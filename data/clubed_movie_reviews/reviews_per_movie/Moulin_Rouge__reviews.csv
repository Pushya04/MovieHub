I'm not surprised that this is divisive,"What an insane movie. For the most part, in a good way. That being said: there were moments in it, and some aspects, that I found incredibly frustrating... yet there was a lot that did work, and I found it growing on me as the movie went along.I tried watching this about 8 or 9 years ago and couldn't stomach the first fifteen minutes, and so shut it off. I think it was right around the time they started singing Nirvana; I just said 'nope,' not for me.Returning to it now, those first fifteen minutes were still a fairly tough sit. The editing and loudness is just ridiculous. I didn't know whether it was supposed to be funny or cool or what- I was overwhelmed and confused, whilst still recognising that technically it was at least interesting.Things got better slowly- an extended comedic sequence filled with innuendo felt like it was from an Austin Powers movie, and tonally the whole thing felt all over the place. Nothing was given room to breathe, and certain stunning shots would only last a second or so before a jarring cut to something else. There were a few brief moments here and there where I literally couldn't comprehend what was going on.I think the movie did slow down a little in its second hour, or maybe I just grew more used to the style... maybe both? I started to enjoy the music, bold colours, fast-paced musical numbers, and the acting more. The latter is quite good, honestly, especially when it comes to Ewan McGregor, who was excellent. I hated John Leguizamo in this movie though- his character was super irritating, even by Baz Luhrmann standards.And while the final act feels a little drawn out, it's got some stunning moments, and probably the best music in the whole film.Overall, it's exhausting and insane, but for me at least it mostly worked. I can understand people loving this movie. I can understand people hating this movie. And honestly, I can understand anyone being anywhere inbetween on this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful Parisian Extravaganza!,"Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a ""sparkling diamond"", and when Toulouse exclaims ""I hope the piano is tuned"". The songs are wonderful, particularly ""Come What May"" and ""The Show Must Go On"", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste. Overall, a beautiful extravagant film with a 9/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunning Bag Of Wind,"I wonder if that line from the Duke ""I don't care about your ridiculous dogma"" was directed to Lars Von Triar. It could be, the film is full of knowing lines ""He could make you a star and you're dallying with the writer!"" or ""They dressed me with the Argentinean's best clothes and passed me for a famous English writer"" There is something of Ken Russell's second period in ""Moulin Rouge"" Everything is emphasized, underlined and repeated at least three times for safety. Excess seem a rather feeble term to describe it and yet, it works. The film, for the most part, is a delight. Nicole Kidman, ravishing and spectacular, spectacular. Ewan McGregor, superb, and so charismatic that no one would blame me if I confess I had a had crush on him as soon as he broke into ""The Hills are alive with the sound of music..."" Kidman and McGregor, this film proves it, are the closest thing we've had in years to the big stars of yesteryear. They could make anything shine and they have. Another detail that shouldn't go amiss, ""Moulin Rouge"" opened the door again for musicals and that's always a good thing even if we're bound to be bombarded by some terrible stuff. I say it doesn't matter as long as it allows glorious film talents of the caliber of Kidman and McGregor to give us the pleasures they have even in a bag of wind such as ""Moulin Rouge""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A stunning, visual feast","At the risk of sounding overly bombastic, ""Moulin Rouge"" is the best film I've seen all year, perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year.  It is operatic in the best sense of the word, being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal.  It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film, and although ""Moulin Rouge"" may not rack up a huge box office, I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo + Juliet.""In the showing of ""Moulin Rouge"" I saw last week, at least 5 people walked out.  At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen.  The source of these strong reactions?  Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him.  The cast fills their roles with relish, even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkill--but oddly enough, it is the focus that sets ""Moulin Rouge"" apart from other films these days.  Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks, everything about ""Moulin Rouge"" is done in earnest.This movie is the anti-""Pearl Harbor,"" because instead of being a hodgepodge of market-tested ideas, ""Moulin Rouge"" presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it.  I, for one, accepted it with delight.  A telling comparison: Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song.  Very daring.  For ""Pearl Harbor"" Michael Bay chose Faith Hill.  Very safe.  Too safe.  Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out ""There You'll Be""?""Moulin Rouge"" glitters with such bold decisions.  It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes, intricate sets (Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point), and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish.  And the music, the MUSIC!  As you probably know by now, Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from, among many bits, ""The Sound of Music,"" Madonna, The Police, and Elton John.  In most cases, no one song gets performed without intersplicing.  Witness Luhrmann's audacity: the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"" with Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""  And here's the spooky part: it works.The entire movie plays this way, and for the most part it works.  Most surpising is that ""Moulin Rouge"" has a solid, deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love, I'd add that it is equally about loss.  The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent, but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler.  Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work, from ""Brazil"" to ""Enchanted April"" to ""Topsy-Turvy.""  In ""Moulin Rouge"" he manages to be both repulsive and endearing.  His spirited rendition of ""Like a Virgin"" is classic.  Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by ""Moulin Rouge"" in the most unexpected, delightful ways.  It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.",,Anonymous,Romance
The most original and groundbreaking movie of recent history,"I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't ""their taste"".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I am in love with ""Moulin Rouge""!","I have not ever felt for a movie the way I do about ""Moulin Rouge.""  It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen. The story, the music, the acting, the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy, maddening, beautiful, and heartbreaking!  The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly.  This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two star-crossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away.  The story is grand, huge, and operatic, as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's.  I truly felt for these two people, and truly felt that they were in love.  My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie, and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking, visionary, masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics, who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original, daring, shocking film like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. But then again, this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has, in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only ""The Wizard of Oz"" ever has before. Yes, the story is sad, but what  a journey it takes you on! A journey I will be sure to repeat over and over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the few movies out there worth watching several times, just because of the sheer visual and musical enchantment. **** (out of four)","MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French:""Moulin Rouge!"" revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant, expensive Broadway production on screen, with enough open courage, engrossing passion, and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films; ""Moulin Rouge!"" may be a cliché-ridden love triangle, but Baz Luhrmann, the film's director, shines a fresh, stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid, exuberant style for his characters-a mixture between a fast-paced music video and lush, exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs, he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy, but it is the perfect approach to the material.From the opening moments, ""Moulin Rouge!"" plays full force, overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom, and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this, we cut to ""The Sound of Music,"" where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure, and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching ""Moulin Rouge!"" is in the visual stimulation; the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time, celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. ""Moulin Rouge"" may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy, intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again, even, to my great reluctance, John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century, as Christian (McGregor) enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him, including the French artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident, Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club, ran by the robust Harold Zinder (Jim Broadbent). It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular, sexy lead performer and courtesan, Satine (Kidman), to work in their production.After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), Satine falls in love with Christian, much to the dismay of many. However, she believes herself to be a simple prostitute, who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue, but only under his circumstances, things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support.Obviously, the best thing in ""Moulin Rouge!"" is the music. Apart from the cast, the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, Fatboy Slim, Beck, and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all, however. ""Moulin Rouge!"" doesn't try to be a historic depiction, but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should, too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing, sexual energy, and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.As I say in very few film critiques, some movies are you watch, others you experience. ""Moulin Rouge"" is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre, unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively action-one of the bravest, most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a musical for people who don't like musicals.,"This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
the Moulin Rouge!,"I think the 'Moulin rouge'is the most romantic film I have ever seen! I sat crying on the couch watching the movie. Nicole Kidman (Satine) acts if it's real. I was shocked when she died. I just couldn't believe it. Yes, I was crying and my boyfriend too.It was so a romantic film, it's just like 'Romeo and Juliet', just as beautiful.I hope there will come another movie just as exiting as this one because it's a beautiful story and then the music!The music, it is just the thing that makes the film and the story one!

Spectacular! Spectacular! A unique masterpiece to be seen again and again!,"I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time.  This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one  viewing.  Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways.  The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and  the man can sing!  Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well.  Together the two of them light up the screen.  In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing.  It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well.  Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right!  Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years.  A bohemian storm is brewing!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This should go under Trivia AND movie connections,"The Hindi song featured in the Indian musical within a musical at the end is Chama Chama from the Bollywood movie China Gate.

Windmills in Red,"Satine is a performer in the Notorious Moulin Rouge of 19th Century Paris. She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I must be missing something here!,"Back in 2001 when 'Moulin Rouge' was released, the reviews did not tempt me to see it and subsequently I forgot about it. I recently bought a copy of the DVD on impulse; assuming that it must be a re-make of John Huston's very fine 1952 film of the same name which was primarily a biography of the artist Toulouse-Lautrec. On playing it I found Baz Luhrmann's modernistic musical, which played like an extended music video rather than a coherent film. It had little appeal to me, and my first reaction was to rate it for IMDb at 1 star. One look at the ratings chart showed that this would be an extreme and unreasonable reaction to my disappointment (which was after all my own fault). Most ratings charts show a good approximation to a Gaussian distribution about whatever peak the film is judged to deserve, but here there is the perfect bi-polar distribution showing separate peaks at 1 star and 10 stars - clearly this is a film viewers either love or hate. Comments from database users who rated it at one star mostly felt, like I had, that it had nothing in common with what they expected from a good feature film and they therefore had nothing good to say about it; but those who rated it at ten were about seven times as numerous, and enthusiastically accepted what Luhrmann provided - however unexpected - as providing stimulating and rewarding viewing. With such an unconventional format, Luhrmann himself is probably more than happy to find seven viewers in tune with his presentation for every one who rejected it, and I had to acknowledge that my reaction perhaps resulted more from my limited tastes than from the film itself. User comments are presumably intended to concentrate on the qualities of the work concerned as assessed by the writer, and should as far as possible filter out idiosyncrasies of taste even when this is not easy to do. Generally when rating a film I like to consider three things - is it well constructed?, has it been created as the producer & director envisaged? and does it leave the viewer with something to think about when leaving the cinema? (The latter of course is not an essential as many films are only designed to give a weary viewer 90 minutes of complete relaxation - but I would never feel that such films should be rated higher than eight ) Re-attempting a fair evaluation on this basis, I still found myself unable to award Moulin Rouge more than a very generous four stars.The Moulin Rouge is now an almost legendary institution. Any film named after it has to show why it has had such an ongoing appeal for so many years. One wit said that visiting it is something every young man wants to do, unfortunately he often can't until he is too old to still enjoy it. It is this aspect of a sensuously seductive but often inaccessible haven for young men that should first be brought out in any film. The smoky atmosphere in which Toulouse-Lautrec spent night after night sketching a variety of entertainers who could just be seen through the haze was never brought out as it should have been (and was in John Huston's 1952 film). Instead we have clear sharp images swirling and blending in mostly brilliant lighting, as in a kaleidoscope. The incredibly rapid sequencing of visually incompatible images was extremely tiring to watch and for me contributed nothing to the story. The modern pop music continually jarred with the scenario of a building that is so closely associated with the elegance of the 1890's. The continual blending of not only different songs but totally different styles of music left me tired and breathless. The story of entertainers who are manipulated, in a way which often destroys their personal lives, by the impresarios and backers who are anxious to wring another few cents out of the production, is a very old and hackneyed one, but it could have still worked if the characters had been much more rounded and the audience had been able to feel more closely involved with them. This was quite impossible here.When writing a paragraph such as that above I normally feel I have reviewed the film in a way that should be helpful to at least some other movie-goers, but in this case I am left wondering whether I have only reviewed myself as a movie fan. Even in a situation where I cannot enjoy a particular film I can normally understand why other viewers with different tastes may do so. Here we have a situation where I can appreciate the elegance with which Moulin Rouge has been created, the story it tells, and the brilliance of individual sequences, but the way in which these sequences have been combined, and the totally inappropriateness of the sound track for the mood of the film, make it incomprehensible to me that the film could be given more than a low to mid-range rating by any viewer. Perhaps I have reached a point where I can no longer communicate effectively with a significant proportion of today's movie fans.My advice to readers is that those who can enjoy watching music videos continuously for an hour or more might love this film, anyone else should consider staying away. But, either way, do not watch this film to experience the magnetic attraction that the Moulin Rouge exerted in the Paris entertainment district for such a long period of time. Instead try to find a copy of the 1952 film of the same name.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Undescribable,"This movie blew my mind. Watch it, then watch it again. 'Moulin Rouge' made me laugh, cry, and dream. It's boldness and confidence to produce something so original and different impressed me. At times the scenery was as surreal as something you would experience in a dream, which only makes this movie more amazing. 'Moulin Rouge' shows love from all angles. It includes the raw passion, infatuation, vehemence, intensity, ecstasy, jealousy, and pain that is found in true love. The acting was staggering. Ewan McGregor is unrealistically perfect, combining sweet innocence with masculinity. Kidman perfectly brings out the seductive side of Satine, yet never loses the vulnerable soul that lies behind it. Roxburgh(The Duke) and Leguizamo(Lautrec) bring out just the right amount of comic relief in this intense drama. There is nothing I would change about this movie. One warning, though: Moulin Rouge is not for the artistically deprived. It is quite a contemporary movie, so you may not like it if you prefer to watch simple movies(ex. 'American Pie', 'Scary Movie').",,Anonymous,Romance
"Moulin Rouge!, A Masterpiece","The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched.The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time, giving enough music, action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edge-of-your-seat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian, a young writer arrives in Paris, against the will of his father, to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke, who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made, Christian and Satine fall in love, but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way, jealousy, betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained.Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine, for her beauty and character match like no other. She did, in fact, break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor, one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood A-List, plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a three-dimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is, what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction, cinematography, editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong, one of the finest, also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack, giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again.Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge!, the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it.

The dialogue almost unbearable after the first five seconds when one realises that song lyrics are to make up the bulk of the 'profundity'.

The whole film feels exactly like how the world looks when you're in love - everything's so dream-like, fabulous, spectacular, emotional.It's just utterly entertaining! It's touching at one time, funny at another....Firstly, the music is GREAT - there are the likes of David Bowie, Rufus Wainwright, Beck, Alka Yagnik... even just listening to the soundtrack CD alone is an ultimate emotional ride enough. Visually, the cinematography, costumes, sets, and choreography are just stunning. They work great as a whole and resulting in a dramatic eye candy. The plot, although simple, WORKS.So sit back, dim your lights, unplug your phones - and get ready for a fantastical, romantic 'dream' that is Moulin Rouge.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
overrated but not bad,"Favourable reaction to this movie is a good example of a common problem - audiences rewarding something because it's different, regardless of whether it's actually good.Luhrman has good intentions, but he sabotages his own movies by overloading the viewer's senses.The idea to make a period musical where the actors sing contemporary pop songs has great potential, but the storyline is incredibly simplistic, and Luhrmann seems completely incapable of dealing in genuine human emotions, which makes for a hollow movie-going experience.Still, there are a few inspired moments (the movie's high point is the 'Roxanne' number near the end, one of the only times the movie has any emotional power).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Am I the only person who simply *HATED* this movie?,"I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for ""MOULIN ROUGE"", for both its usage of creativity and for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store.""MOULIN ROUGE"" has indeed garnered much favoritism from critic's circles, award panels and esteemed film reviewers alike. Unfortunately, the only award I would hand this film would be a Golden Raspberry.The opening sequence of ""MOULIN ROUGE"" was interesting enough. I enjoyed the camera sequence going through the city of old Paris as we are introduced to Ewan McGregor's character... and then the film pretty much falls flat on its face from thereon in.I am not Nicole Kidman's biggest fan. I did enjoy her in ""THE OTHERS"", but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in ""BMX BANDITS"" or ""BUSH CHRISTMAS"". I thought the musical pieces in ""MOULIN ROUGE"" were 'ear-bleedingly' awful, especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as ""I Was Made For Loving You"" and ""Silly Love Songs"". There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's ""Roxanne"".It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of ""The Hills Are Alive"" from ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC"" that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end, I was wondering aloud, ""Please! Make the hurting stop!"" The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous write-up it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I, I was expecting a great deal more from ""MOULIN ROUGE"". I really REALLY wanted to like ""MOULIN ROUGE"", but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very open-minded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a well-planned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this web-site mentioned that they are ""in love"" with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be, ""I hate Moulin Rouge"".My Rating: 1 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A really fun film, with the adorable EWAN MCGREGOR!!!","You can't compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge, because they share, really, nothing besides the fact that people sing and dance. Moulin Rouge stands alone. I really love this movie.Nicole Kidman did sorta over act in parts (the Elephant scene, and when she tells Zidler she wants to leave.), but other than that, the acting is wonderful. I just love Ewan McGregor's character, and I love Ewan McGregor. John Leguizamo's character, Henri Toulouse Lautrec (yes, the famous painter), I found was just such an annoyingly funny character, he was definently one of my favorite characters. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is definently overacted, and frankly, Zidler (John Broadbent), is sooooo horribly annoying, you really would want to throw yourself off the Moulin Rouge windmill.I love this movie. There are some funny parts, but they are mostly just in the beginning, and the best musical number isn't 'Diamonds', but rather, the dramatic 'Roxanne'. Another one of my favourite pieces is 'Nature Boy', the song sung at the very beginning. It's so sad, but very touching.The beginning is sort of depressing, but it doesn't last long, so don't stop the DVD then. The middle sort of drags on, so be warned. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and very colourful, and the dancing is really Spectacular Spectacular (excuse the pun...), but long periods of time with the Bohemians, or at the Moulin Rouge can make you feel like you're stuck in a circus tent. But since Ewan McGregor's in it, I give it 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
Moulin Rouge,"I loved this movie when I saw it on VH1 and bought it right away. After I bought it, I watched it at least 12 times(no exaggeration) and now any time someone says something that came from the movie, I finish the scene out in my mind or under my breathe! It is my all time favorite movie and I think every household(with children over the age of 13) should own a copy! Ewan McGregor became my favorite actor(and crush of all times...bigger than Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp!) and I think he played the part of Christian perfectly. Nicole Kidman nailed the part of Satine and every movie I see now with her in it, all I see is Satine. The sets were amazing and the colors were crazy, making my eyes go nuts trying to find a solid image to focus on. Again, my praise to this film and those who worked on it. Now, if you will excuse me, talking about Moulin Rouge makes me need to go and watch it again!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my Top Ten's,"I had avoided seeing Moulin Rouge simply because I heard that it was a ""musical"". I soon seem to forget that I DO in fact like ""musicals"" (Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory). So, for a year, I avoided the movie altogether. If it weren't for a good friend of mine INSISTING on seeing the movie, I probably would have missed out on this wonder! I am so glad I listened. I never knew how talented Ewan McGregor was (I am now a HUGE fan, he is adorable!), and though I have always loved Miss Nicole, she was stunning throughout the movie. My favorite scene is the duet they have in the elephant (the first of many). I have never been sucked into a movie like this one. You feel what they feel. You ""feel"" their love, and sorrow. Its beautifully done. I was very upset when Nicole Kidman did not win the Academy Award for this film. The acting is believable and ALL of the singing IS done by those starring and NOT dubbed. Everyone who worked on this film put their hearts and souls into it, and it shines through. It opened me up to at least try on a few other musicals (Chicago, which I didn't like), and I am always looking for another film to make me feel like I did when I watch Moulin Rouge for the first time. I am highly looking forward to the release of ""Across the Universe"" this summer. If you had doubts about seeing this film, try it out. You won't be sorry that you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Those French Really Have Fun,"This is a true experience. I was halfway through the movie. I still didn't understand it, but I sat in its lush glow and vivacity. Baz Luhrmann threw together a mass of elements into a soup that will make some people hate it and others love it. For whatever reason, I walked out of the theater exhilarated. First, we have the love story. Satine and her young writer. We know it is doomed from the time she coughs into her handkerchief. Then there is the theatre. It's what we might see something like this in our dreams. Then there are the French painters, mugging and wandering through, stealing scenes. Through in some contemporary music mixed with music created for the film. It's a hodgepodge. I remember a story by Ray Bradbury where a Chinese emperor doesn't want to face reality. I believe it is called ""The Flying Machine."" He stairs at a mechanical toy with artificial birds and flowers. This is like one of those wondrous machines. I don't even know if we can form an emotional attachment for the characters because they are like dolls moving through the amazing numbers and visual delights. I remember trying to tell someone why I liked this, and by the time I finished, I could see that he would not go near this movie. And yet, for some of us, it reels us in and holds us to the very end.

Taken on a sensational fantasy journey.,"I watched this on DVD with my boyfriend, it was rather a case of not being able to agree on any other to rent.

At 40something years of age I was laughing and crying at a musical the worrying thing is so was my boyfriend.I dont know where to start, it was visually sensational, the music was Fab.

HASN'T AGED WELL.... BUT STILL WOULD RECOMMEND,"So you ever see a movie and think... think this is cutting edge bold film making? Yeah, back in the day I thought this was a good movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same today. I do not enjoy this style of film making. Too cheesy with the overly exaggerated comedy segments and too much slow motion is used in scenes. If you can get through the cheesy and dated slow motion scenes of the movie I would still recommend that everyone see this movie at least once in their life. It's technically is bold filming making in regards to a musical and it has pretty good music. I must say I am shocked with the way things are nowadays where movies are being dug up from the grave from years ago to either get a remake, prequel, sequel, or some kind of side story continuation of a beloved story from so many people's childhoods so that it can be forever ruined for future generations and for people that enjoyed the original because originality is dead today that this hasn't been remade or turned into a musical.... yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

They even both have references to drinking absinthe and seeing the green fairy.The characters are flat and everything is pretty darn predictable, but that's OK.

What a mess,"Can you say ""technicolor vomit?""  The idea for this film actually has a lot of potential:  Take a mish-mash of modern pop songs and blend them together in a creative way to create a romantic musical.  But what do we get here? An annoying nightmare of sound and sight that almost drove me from the theater.  This film is more chopped up than the vegetables in a Beni Hanna stir fry.  Luhrmann never focuses on one scene for more than a few seconds and when he does, the computer enhanced colors make the screen incredibly difficult to look at.  The music has moments of creativity, as when ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is blended together with ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", but all of the scenes come across as little more than videos, not pieces creating a coherent whole.  With respect to the choice of songs: Gosh, can you get more random, Boz Luhrmann?  I mean, I actually feel like Luhrman put a couple hundred song titles in a hat and just chose them at random.  Very strange.  And I enjoyed Ewen McGregor's singing for about an hour (I found myself singing ""Your Song"" with him at the beginning of the film), but then it started to get annoying.  And Nicole Kidman...what can one say except, ""Yuck.""  Ever since I saw her in that Battman movie, she just bugs, bugs, bugs.  And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline.  But she probably wouldn't have been interested in such an artless film.  Finally, why o why does every big budget movie that is set in France have people speaking with British accents?  Is this some kind of unconscious Hollywood rule?  Or couldn't Luhrmann find anyone with French accents to play in this film?  Man, the French must have torn this thing up at Cannes.

A non-traditional film about traditional idealism,"Baz Luhrmann has perfected one of the ADD generation's greatest feats: keep the attention of your audience while not sacrificing plot or character development.  The suspension of disbelief that Baz so quickly threw out is not necessary to make us care about his characters, Satine and Christian. He doesn't cop out with a la-dee-da story, where all the characters live happily ever after.  We find this out from the get-go when Christian introduces us to the story.  At the same time, he doesn't make us think we're seeing a happy story only to surprise us at the end with a tragic surprise (this is also accomplished by Christian's introduction).  In short, Baz created a film the only way it can be effectively created: in a way that is both traditional and non-traditional, in that it matches more the Greek tragedy than the Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time boasting a musical score that includes everything from Fatboy Slim to Elton John to Nirvana.  He has a lot of story to cover in a short period of time, and he performs wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is my favourite movie...,"I really think ""Moulin Rouge!"" should have won the Oscar for the Best Movie in 2001, and perhaps Nicole Kidman could have won the Oscar for the Best Actress, but I'm not so sure of that. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is that kind of movie that you only see once in a lifetime. Jim Broadbent himself says that no one he knows has ever done a movie like this one. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a movie, it's true, but it's a SHOW. Completely... Delicious to the eyes, to the ears and to the heart. The music is amazingly touching. As Ewan McGregor says, some of the lines are just to simple to be spoke, they have to be sung, and they turn into something beautiful. The voices of the actors are very good, and adjusted to their personality. All the colour in the costumes and scenaries, turn this movie into a masterpiece. Baz Luhrmann did an amazing job, he achieved something that no other director had ever achieved: Turn a movie into a small little sweet chocolate, that totally praises your heart, and everytime you eat it, you discover something new.Congratulations! =)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not bad,"This is an interesting film, set in the early 20th century but using late 20th century music. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both prove that they can carry a tune. Neither is a great singer but both do well enough. Once the film gets started, it can hold the viewer's interest pretty well. The story has been reviewed several times over by others so I'll not go into it much here, but suffice it to say it's a musical that's mainly a love story. It has elements of comedy and tragedy but doesn't completely fit in either genre. There is an underlying theme, which is ""the show must go on"" as well as the main love story.

Fantastic music video,"Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet uses a pop exterior to bring Shakespeare's rich dialogue to moviegoers who never would have sought it out. Characters are successfully translated, so that the audience can identify with them. The colorful presentation makes it fun to watch. Shakespeare's story makes this film easily rewatchable, especially in the modern context.Luhrman's Moulin Rogue! has flashy presentation AND pop music. But the story feels thin and stretched. It must compete for time with the (amazingly arranged) music, eye candy, and comical scenes. The underlying story is romance vs. pragmatism, and the challenge of whether or not love can conquer all did have me thinking about the ending two days later (a sign of a good story).I was blown away by the rooftop love-song duet. Having rented it the first time, I bought the DVD several months later. And found the film as a whole not very rewatchable. The music is still quite good though; I wish that there were an easier way to just play the songs, other than skipping through the chapters.The leads both did a good job getting us to identify with their characters, with the few serious scenes they had together. For instance, Nicole does a good job on the rooftop scene with eye contact, to show internal conflict, to help us believe she could still fall in love. They were obviously convincing, or the ending wouldn't have moved me so much.Expect a music video movie (as in Graffiti Bridge), and you won't be disappointed. You will also be rewarded with a bit more, in the story and setting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Aggressively, Aggressively Terrible","This movie was so horrible it made me weep.  It wasn't even really a movie; it was an insult aimed directly at everyone who paid $9 to see it.You see, they wanted to do a musical, only they knew people wouldn't go see a musical unless it featured a random assortment of unrelated, canned popular music.  Well, I ask, what's the point?  Why bother?  If you ""put together"" a musical without writing any music, have you really ""put together"" a musical?  The answer is no.This is the kind of idiocy that _Oklahoma!_ displaced, where the songs are unrelated and the ""action"" and ""character"" don't even rise to the level of formality.  Only it's worse, because it specifically targets songs which are attached to your memories and butchers them.  When I saw them quote out of context the song U2 wrote to commemorate the life and death of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in an idiotic scene on the back of a big fake elephant, I almost walked out.  I should have.  It only got worse.The only way this would be even permissable would be in parody, but this is no parody.  It clearly wants to be taken at least marginally seriously, apparently without going to the trouble of having anything at all to say, unless you count the apparent reality that people are very, very stupid, are essentially devoid of any and all merit, and are not worth watching.Do not believe the hype.  Do not see this movie!

A post-modern masterpiece,"`The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love & be loved in return': so begins `Moulin Rouge' as penniless Parisien writer & hopeless romantic Christian (McGregor) types & reads out the story as it at the same time unfolds before us. `My writing was interrupted' (he types & reads, & I paraphrase) `when an unconcious Argentinian fell through the roof' (cue said precipitation) `and a dwarf dressed as a nun ran into the room' (which he did).Thus the scene is set for an audacious, dazzling, deconstructed & reconstructed, exhilarating romp of a film: a romantic tragedy, a musical that is at the same time old & new, as much an homage to times past as it is a herald of the 21st century.It turns out that the 2 intruders (Koman as the narcoleptic Argentinian & Leguizamo as the painter Toulouse-Lautrec) were rehearsing a play called `Spectacular Spectacular' (itself a good description of the film, 1 of several play-within-a-play self-references), which Christian is promptly drafted in to rewrite. The play is to be shown at a can-can cabaret theatre, the `Moulin Rouge', where Christian meets & falls in love with the star turn, lady of dubious virtue & struggling wannabe Satine (Kidman). She's a Material Girl' who apparently will do anything for money & for the furtherance of her career, & who is attempting to seduce a rich Duke (Roxburgh) to that end. Christian attempts to turn her with nothing to offer but his undying love & a beautiful singing voice. Can he save the girl & win her heart from the cold evil Duke & his money? Will love save the day? The outcome isn't hard to guess  not least because it's announced in the opening scene  but then it isn't meant to be; this is not your average run-of-the-mill movie.Visually this is absolutely stunning  the sets & costumes are impossibly colourful, lavish & detailed, the choreography inspired. The cinematography textbook has been thrown out here; the camera seems to have a life of it's own, panning & zooming manically, making a mockery of normal concepts of time & space, & giving us many post-modern sight gags along the way.The cast is superb: McGregor to my mind is one of the finest actors to emerge out of Britain in recent years, & Kidman fully justifies her star billing. Broadbent, Roxburgh, Leguizamo & Koman give excellent support with really strong performances, & there's a great little cameo from Kylie Minogue as an Absinthe Fairy'. There are moments too of great theatrical power, chief of which to my mind (along with the climax) is the moment when Christian accidentally gives the game away to the Duke about his Hamletesque play-within-a-play; a really powerful scene. The film exudes an intoxicating energy from the opening scene to the stunning denouement, & is in turns exciting, uplifting, inspiring, energising, clever, funny, surreal, & profoundly moving.The music itself is superb, & ranges from turn of the century vaudeville to Fat Boy Slim, Christina Aguilera & the queens of hip-hop, stopping along the way for opera, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Bollywood, The Beatles, T Rex, Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana, U2 & Beck  among many many others; the original music also is excellent. This is a music lover's paradise! Surpassing even the variety & quantity of the music is how it is used: often completely disparate types of music are meshed together seamlessly in a way that is clever, witty, highly original & simply exhilarating. For instance: a can-can type number sung by the Moulin Rouge cast alternates with the audience singing back lines from Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit': `here we are now, entertain us' etc.; Christian eventually wins over Satine in a conversation come musical duel comprised almost entirely of lines from pop songs  brilliantly imaginative & witty. The viewer is constantly surprised with the ever-changing musical landscape & at a time when so many films are extremely predictable for this alone `Moulin Rouge' deserves high praise.The quality of the music is also outstanding, not in the least due to the vocal performances of the stars themselves. Kidman holds a tune extremely well & combines beautifully with McGregor - who is simply magnificent. His is a voice of such control, range, power, tone & expression that it is the equal of his considerable acting talent. His rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time. Jim Broadbent, playing the theatre owner, adds his stentorian baritone, while Koman growls his way magnificently through a version of The Police's `Roxanne'  in duet with McGregor & a tango  - that simply has to be heard to be believed.`Moulin Rouge' is a truly modern musical; Luhrman has taken hold of an old & cliched genre, injected it knowingly with 21st Century irony, imbued it with great energy, imagination & talent; & has produced a post-modern masterpiece, one of the most audacious & original films seen in a very long time - & one for which he deserves every success. After all, to quote Christian & Satine (& Paul McCartney), `Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs  and what's wrong with that, I'd like to know?', & surely making love not war' has never been more appropriate than it is now. Love it or loath it - & you're sure to do one or the other  for any lover of film this is compulsory viewing.Me? I've fallen in love.   RATING: 10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Movie Ever moulin rouge,"The Moulin Rouge is the most amazing movie ever. Its my favorite movie. The songs Are fantastic and i have been singing them in my head all day. Christian (Ewan McGregor), a gifted writer with an idealistic outlook on love, sets off for Paris . He moves into a lowly tenement right across from the notorious nightclub that is the Moulin Rouge, where girls do the can-can... and more. It is here where Christian befriends a dwarfish Toulouse (John Leguizamo), who wants to put on a musical production to further the Bohemian movement. He wants Christian to write it and have the most beautiful and famous star of the Moulin Rouge, Satine (Nicole Kidman), to play the lead. The ever-so-romantic Christian falls madly in love with Satine, but things get complicated when the wealthy financial duke of the production wants Satine for himself. Satine is torn between the two, but like a true actress, she knows that the show must go on.From the trailers, one would not think that ""Moulin Rouge"" is a comedy, but in fact, most of the film is.I was very much surprised how well this worked for the film, not only because we knew the lyrics and could sing silently to ourselves, but also these songs fit the situations perfectly. I was totally absorbed by the film's amusing absurdity. There were original numbers written for the film, which were also good, but it will be the ones that are recognized that will be remembered. Nicole Kidman was great as Satine, and I also admired Ewan McGregor's performance. Credit is to be given to anybody who can act as well as Kidman. Despite a bit of a shaky start, ""Moulin Rouge"" regains control and maintains it for the rest of the film. It is an enjoyable surprise that will make you laugh and sing along. Go check out this movie if you can-can.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love","I too often find people trying to take this movie for something it's not, or criticizing something that's not even there. For example, saying that it ripped off songs when that wasn't why they were used at all. I don't understand how people could possibly be so lacking in common sense. Personally this is my favorite movie. I am not claiming to know all about cinema, I am not claiming it is the greatest movie of all time, simply that I enjoy it very much. I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and I instantly had my breath taken away, and though some of the pacing was fast, I very much wanted to try to keep up and was absolutely in love with the film. I saw it five times in the theater, and I've since watched it quite a few times on DVD. Moulin Rouge is the story of Christian and Satine, a penniless writer and a courtesan. They fall in love in nineteenth century Paris. It was pieced together with many great songs from the twentieth century. This movie was in no way trying to make a new and exciting story, simply trying to tell the story in a new, different, and exciting way, for which I think it did triumphantly. I very highly recommend it, though I know several people who have turned it off because they thought it was moving too fast (I also noticed some people leave the theater), and some others who didn't like the love story because apparently they... don't like and want to admit they have emotions? *coughmyexboyfriendcough* I find this film very moving. Some people I know call it a ""chick flick"", then giggle and twirl their hair around their finger. Stupid peers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
absolutely moving,"I can't believe how excellent this movie is, I'm sorry that some people felt it wasn't worth their money because honestly I'd pay to see it again and again. Not only was it so moving but it makes you really think about love, and not in such a wishy washy way but something that can last forever. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were so beautiful in it and their voices too, this is an amazing story and film and I believe that Baz Luhrman is talented....like I said absolutely moving.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Starts off with a bang!  Ends with a whisper.,"Just the first few minutes of ""Moulin Rouge"" totally blew me away! Everything from the set designs to the art direction to the editing to the cinematography to the costume designs are absolutely spectacular!  The movie should win Oscars in ALL those categories.  I can honestly say the first half of this movie is like nothing you've ever seen!  And it is undescribable.  All I have to say is it took a huge, vivid imagination.  Of course, you have to watch ""MR"" with an open mind.  Let your imagination run wild!  Especially when you have modern songs being sung in 1900 France. There's even a scene where everybody in the club starts singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana.  Just like I said about ""A Knight's Tale"" scenes like that are totally innaccurate--historically speaking--but they're great to look at.  Speaking of things that are great to look at, Nicole Kidman couldn't have looked more beautiful!  If you see some of her outfits in this movie--WOW!  It's beyond comprehension.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang great, and it was nice to find out they used their real voices--I at least assumed McGregor might've been lip-synching.  On a musical level, this film works out splendidly, working in many modern hit songs into the soundtrack that will keep you singing along.However, I was disappointed by the second half.  The first half is so upbeat, so in-your-face and gets your mood so pumped up.  Then the film suddenly takes a dramatic turn.  It takes on a dreary tone, and I felt quite uneasy about the transition.  When you have a spectacular opening like this, it's hard getting adjusted to a more quiet, downbeat, depressing tone.  I had a hard time keeping myself awake!  But I have to say, that climax with the gun is very creative and I got a kick out of that.The first half of ""MR"" is so striking and original that I have to give it a recommendation.  It's blend of great music, fast pacing, unrelenting energy, humor, sexual innuendos and beautiful visuals will keep you captivated!  In the second half, you might want to go out for popcorn.  Some may appreciate the sad tone towards the end and will squeak a few tears, but I had a hard time dealing with the transition.  For that, I will let you use discretion.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply Astounding,"When this film first came out, I didn't hear much about it.  Once Oscar season started, it seemed as if I had lived in a hole.  Everyone was talking about this film.  I still hadn't seen it, and the only thing it was to me was competition for my favorite of the year, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""However, about a month later, I finally saw the movie everyone had hailed for nearly a year.  It seemed as if everyone I knew had seen and loved this film.I rented it, and from the first moment it started, I was entranced.  Every moment of this film kept me hanging on, and sending me through a whirlwind of sights, sounds, and delights for every sensory part of my brain.  I truly believe that this may be one of the greatest artistic films of ourtime.I've been accused of being an ""artsy-fartsy"" person, so maybe that's just the artistic side of me talking.  But even if it is, there is not a single time when I have seen this movie that I have not been moved to tears, be it from the story or the beauty of the movie itself.First, let me address Ewan McGregor's performance.  Regrettably, the only thing I had seen him in prior to this was, ahem, ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.""  Imagine my surprise when the little Jedi belted out ""Your Song,"" a favorite of mine, and promptly caused me to melt into a puddle of shapeless goo.  I still swoon every time I hear his voice.  Who knew Obi-Wan could sing, on top of act the part amazingly?  Not I, certainly.Opposite him, I could have chosen no one better than the lovely and talented Nicole Kidman.  Definitive Satine?  YES.  Simple as that.  Her voice and her actions made me truly believe and love the character, even when she wasn't entirely lovable.John Leguizamo was simply superb as Toulouse-Lautrec, especially for someone who traipsed about on their knees throughout the entire film.I agree with many of Hollywood's best and brightest when they say that Jim Broadbent's Oscar this year was not only for ""Iris,"" but for this film as well.  Fatherly, comedic, and boss-like all at the same time, and managing to do it all with a large mustache and potbelly as well.One cannot mention the cast without mentioning the incomparable Richard Roxburgh and his incredibly hilarious yet amazingly imposing (at times) performance as the sinister Duke.Every singer, every dancer, every actor, every actress in this film was perfect.  Not a single hair was out of place.  Which leaves the director and magic maker himself, Baz Luhrmann.  Not many modern directors would set out to do a project like this.  Perhaps thirty years ago, but not now.  This was probably the biggest risk in his (and everyone else that worked on it, too) career.  Maybe the public is split down the middle, between those that love it and those that couldn't sit through twenty minutes of it, but this reviewer and movie viewer knows that this will go down in history as one of the greatest films of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Baz Luhrmann extravaganza,It's 1899 Paris. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an English writer trying to take in Parisian artistic life. He befriends Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He gets involved with Moulin Rouge star Satine (Nicole Kidman). The club owner Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) has promise her to the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if he would invest.It's got Baz Luhrmann's grand vision. It's a modern day musical. McGregor and Kidman are surprisingly good as singers. It's still not my taste but it's got the style right. Its excesses are what sells this movie. Anything less would reduce this to no more than musical theater. The story is melodramatic but it is in keeping with the tone of the movie. Even using modern songs as burlesque music seems somehow fitting if somewhat weird.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunning,"Full disclosure. I am not a fan of musicals. I'm a lover of epic westerns, film noir of the late 40s, classic syfy and dark comedies. But my wife likes musicals so I rented this years ago. I was captivated from the opening scene. Within 20 minutes I longed to be in Paris in 1899. I wanted to be a bohemian artist. I wanted a tiny apartment with perking paint and a view of the Seine. What a story! The naysayers who were bored by this must be very cold and unimaginative souls indeed. The film swept me along and at the end I was so glad I had experienced it. Possibly the only film both my wife and I love unconditionally. We now have tapes, dvds, blue rays, and I'm sure whatever the next generation of electronic entertainment is we'll get that too. Timeless stuff and Hollywood at it's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best performance comes from Roxburgh as The Duke--excellent job.It will appeal to fans of Kidman and McGregor but is certainly not the sort of musical suited to everyone's taste.",,Anonymous,Romance

Shades of Rocky Horror in very clever musical,"You can't watch this film without comparing it to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, and how much you like one is probably how much you'll like the other. It is a stunning musical with bold in your face camera work that is expertly spliced to give the full effect. The story is the basic boy meets girl, which is refreshing in this day of movies in which boy already owns girl. Finally, a throwback to what a film should be. True romance. This movie is for those who are free of spirit so to speak, and possibly not enjoyed as much by the one who is satisfied with the status quo. This film takes chances. It explores, and it takes you on a journey with each separate frame. A lot of the songs are mainstays of pop, refitted and modified. They take some of the lesser pop songs (Roxanne, Like a Virgin), and improve them greatly. These are possibly the best cover songs you will ever hear. I only saw it twice, so I cannot discern the minor characters, but I could tell they were there, and while it will take me more viewings to see how logical they are, it is obvious they are cinematic and work artistically. The main characters are all very entertaining. The hero is a throwback to the old Hollywood era, and is remarkably charismatic. The heroine seems to be a direct spin off of Madonna herself, and the performance is superb. She isn't a natural beauty, but has glitz and glamour galore. The head bad guy is a riot, and it's a toss up as to whether he or the minor characters steal the show. The henchman is more of a force and face, and rarely speaks, but he is very well done. The master of ceremonies has the broadest range written into his lines, and he doesn't disappoint. The music is all spectacular. The scenery is spectacular. The characters have the cult film quality of stereotypes who evolve into characters. This has all the makings of a cult classic if it catches on. Again, the music is very moving and awesome. I gave it an initial 8, but as time goes on and I see it again, and if the cult quality remains, I'll probably raise that rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Bohemian Feast for the Senses,"I honestly didn't expect to like ""Moulin Rouge"".  What?  Take a bunch of songs made popular by Madonna, Elton John, David Bowie, Sting, and Nat King Cole, and tie them up in a music video-style format?  You've got to be kidding?Nope.I grew up during the era when ""classic"" musicals were still the big thing... ""The Sound of Music"", ""The King and I"", ""The Music Man""... you know the type.  Grand.  Beautiful.  Safe.Baz Luhrman has managed to re-define what makes a musical.  Using every trick in the modern cinematic arsenal, he's created something as grand and beautiful, but never ""safe"".I didn't like it.  I loved it.  But then I love theatre.  And this is as theatrical as you can get.  It's big, brash, larger than life in every aspect, and it MOVES!  There's enough energy in this production to power Sydney for a fortnight.I can't begin to talk about the actors... everyone turns in a stellar performance.  I already liked Kidman, McGregor, and Leguizamo from previous works, but Jim Broadbent as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, and Richard Roxburgh as the delightfully dislikable Duke fit right in and made themselves right at home among my favorite performances.  And watching the two of them sing ""Like a Virgin"" in a Busby Berkeley styled comedy number with a dozen waiters flitting around like a bunch of demented fruit-flies was hysterically funny.  When just thinking back on the jokes still makes you laugh, that's good comedy.Basically, the movie was nothing like what I expected... but then, it's not really like anything else, so how could I expect it?  But I still liked it... a lot.I doubt ""Moulin Rouge"" is for everybody, but then again neither is champagne.  Me... I like the bubbles.Simply great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The longest MTV clip ever,"""The title ""Moulin Rouge"" raises the expectation of a film full of nostalgia. That the film is of the musical genre added to this expectation.In reality the film is however quite modern, with fast montage and short takes. It has been described as the longest MTV clip ever.The film is cleverly made but has no emotional effect on me. Lead actress Nicole Kidman, who came out of the shadow of her then husband Tom Cruise about this time (in for example ""The others"" (2001, Alejandro Amenabar) and ""Dogville"" (2003, Lars von Trier)), plays an unapproachable diva.For some reasons ""Moulin rouge"" made me think of ""Wings of desire"" (1987, Wim Wenders), evidently a totally different film. In both films however a love affair blossoms between a woman who performs on the trapeze and a man who used to be a specatator. Because of his love the man quits being a passive spectator and becomes actively involved in the action. In ""Mouling rouge"" the man is a writer, in ""Wings of desire"" he is an angel. Something completely different indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
To critics who didn't like it: Don't quit your day jobs,"I won't repeat what many have said here about the spectacular visuals, dancing and music.  All I will say about that is that this is the best musical I can ever remember seeing!  Whatever the critics may say to pick it apart, the sum of the parts is that this movie just plain works.  Period. Never mind Nichole Kidman's well-deserved applause, just imagine Obie-Wan belting out a version of ""Your Song"" that rivals Elton John's, and you'll get an idea of the unique quality of this film.It starts out a bit goofy and quickly turns chaotic, but then settles down to just good old fashioned music and dancing.  And through all of the visual and auditory spectacle, you begin to see that there really is a touching, if corny, story underneath it all.  The ending is truly tear-jerking.I understand that some people didn't like this movie for the very reasons that make it great: it is bold and different.  If your idea of a good musical is along the lines of cute story that is written primarily to show off some new show tunes, you'll probably hate it.  But if have an open mind and understand that the main purpose of the cinema is to entertain us, then you'll have to agree:  ""Spectacular, Spectacular!""Oh, one more thing:  Given the subject matter, my kudos go to the director for keeping this film in good enough taste to keep it below an ""R"" rating. The film itself was not like the in-your-face rather slutty MTV video of ""Lady Marmalade"" that was used to promote it.  Although it had its moments of implied sensuality, I was able to watch this movie with my teenage daughter with no reservations.Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lacks originality...,"While I enjoyed this movie as an overall pleasurable movie-going experience, I left feeling that it lacked something.  Of course, it was visually spectacular; the scenery and the dance numbers provided something of a sensory overload.  Nicole Kidman was beautiful, though her tragic part was rather cliche, as was the whole story.  Anyone ever hear of La Boheme? or Cabaret? Put them together and you have Moulin Rouge.  Don't get me wrong, both have terrific stories, but did we really need them to be re-hashed, with new songs?  I think not.  I would recommend this movie purely for the visual value and performance numbers, but certainly not if you seek something original with a plot that will leave any impression at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Suffocating the Movie Musical,"I thought Pearl Harbor would be the worst movie of the summer. Then I  saw Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann has indeed reached the core of human  emotion. I never thought I could hate a movie this much. I can't recall the last time I laughed that much at a movie. And this one wasn't even a comedy.This might be the first musical with -- NO -- original songs, but that wasn't the bad part. It's what was done with the songs that was the killer. As if we're supposed to find tunes by Madonna, Queen, the Wallflowers, Sting, and others fitting in 1900 Paris... Anyway, I can get past that.I have to make a list of things I learned from this film1) Baz Luhrmann can only direct one movie. It's name is 'Romeo and Juliet'.2) If you're going to rip off a plotline, take it from a relatively unknown tale, like 'Pearl Harbor' did from the French legend of Martin Guerre. Don't take that of a critically acclaimed, amazingly popular film that won Best Picture three years ago.3) It seemed like an acid trip. It is not creativity, it is insanity.4) The movie musical has not been revived. Lurhmann, in performing CPR  on it, blew way too much air into its lungs, thus making them explode.5) 'Phantom', 'Les Miz', 'Miss Saigon', and other stage muscials are believable. People cry at the end of 'Rent', when Roger confesses his love to Mimi. It is impossible to cry at a movie where the moon winks and smiles at the main characters.6) Did I mention the lack of an original plot?7) Any handgun, when thrown through a broken window in Paris, will travel several miles, out of Montmartre, over the city and off of the top of the shaft of the Eiffel Tower. (This of course, is much to the delight of Earth's only natural satellite.)8) Some movies scream ""I DESERVE AN OSCAR"", as this one does for costume design. It'll grab it, but please, let it take no others. If so, I've lost total faith in the Academy.Thank you for allowing my venting.",,Anonymous,Romance

Dazzling.,"I think that dazzling would be the best word to describe this film. Everything about it is just visually pleasing from the set designs to the beautiful costumes. The idea of adding unique flare to classic songs (i.e. ""Heroes"") really made me adore all of the musical numbers. For the most part, the charisma and eccentric nature of the film was hilarious and a joy to watch. However there were certain points, mostly in the first half, that were a little bit too out there for me to enjoy and ended up distracting me from the film as a whole. A lot of the film was really cheeky and sometimes that worked, but sometimes it turned me off. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both give absolutely phenomenal performances (the best I've seen from both of them), doing an outstanding job of combining emotional range with drama, musical talent and very charismatic charm. I loved watching them throughout. The story has been done many times before, but it felt really fresh for some reason, maybe that had to do with the overwhelming charisma. I can't get over how fun it was to watch McGregor. Overall, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would and it's certainly one of the best of 2001.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent do reasonable jobs with their roles, but I personally thought that John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec was the neatest character in the movie.

But it comes across as a musical that's quite interesting and without as many weird segues. You know what I'm talking about; in most musicals the dialogue is going along just fine and then somebody suddenly breaks into song for no reason. Well, in Moulin Rouge it's well-integrated, and the plot is just surreal enough to be arty and interesting without spoiling the mood or becoming campy.For example, the racy modern music they play at the burlesque gives us a feeling of what it might have been like to hear what was considered racy music at the turn of the century. The romance is compelling and sweet, and there are plenty of deep thoughts about the nature of what it means to be human, and to fall in love. It brought tears to my eyes, and that's very rare for me -- I'm hardly a weepy at the films.Who should see this film:-- Romantic comedy lovers -- a must-see, although expect a lot more romance than comedy-- People who are musical -- a must-see-- Everybody elseI'll give this film a sensational 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style...,"When 'Moulin Rouge!' came out, in 2001, its director, Baz Luhrmann, was already 39 years old, but had made only three other movies, 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet'. So, assuming this is only his third film, and the third of his 'Red Curtain Trilogy', he still has a lot to grow as a director, after all, it generally takes years for a director to hit the jackpot, but of course there are exceptions like John Huston and his exceptional 'The Maltese Falcon' as his first movie.'Moulin Rouge!' tells the story of Christian (Ewan McCregor), a young English writer that travels to 1899 Bohemian Paris. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan of the Moulin Rouge, the main nightclub of the city underworld. The problem is when he falls in love with her, but she is already committed to The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), a very rich man. Throughout the movie, most of the main characters tell the audience that this is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things, love. And it is indeed. All four of them are a very important part of the story, which is very well-told, by the way, starting off a year after the main events, with Christian writing what happened. And it's all told with really good dance numbers.The acting is nice. We have the two leads, Ewan McCregor and Nicole Kidman, playing their parts well, and singing their own songs. We have other stars like John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh. No one really stands out, but you can see the actors did their jobs exactly as they were told to.As I mentioned, Baz Luhrmann still has a lot to grow as a director, but at least the guy has a lot of style. The landscapes of Paris were one of the best scenes I've seen in a musical, great mix-up of 3-D effects and real shots. You can see all his potential in those scenes. This movie is a perfect portrayal of Bohemian Paris, wild, senseless, and weird. The way he mixed up lots of famous songs of the 20th century to tell the story is brilliant. In here, we have songs by Madonna, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana and many others, and it works really good. The art direction is excellent, but too modern for my taste. The main problem I have with this movie is the editing, too claustrophobic. When you start to get into one scene, it jumps to another and you get dazzled.Overral, even though I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style, it's undeniable the effort he and his crew putted into the making of this movie. The problem I have with 'Moulin Rouge!' is simply a matter of taste - too modern for me.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Look, Ma! I'm wearing a feather boa!!","I got this movie on DVD for Christmas from my older brother Paul, who basically doesn't understand me and never will. He more or less told me: 'I saw this with my girlfriend and we both agreed it was kinetic, it was energetic, it was musical and superficial. We immediately thought of you' After seeing this atrocity, I have to seriously reconsider the image I project to my somewhat conservative family. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is the kind of film that makes you really consider with a jaundiced eye the sorry state of contemporary mass culture with desperate questions like 'Have we sunk so low?', 'Can we possibly survive?' and 'Don't we all deserve to die from shame for having had anything to do with the kind of society that can produce such a film and call it art?' I know it was produced by Australians and we should all cut them some slack for their relative lack of sophistication. I know Ms. Kidman gives a truly surprising performance as a dancer-singer (I thought she had no other talent than a certain ability to manipulate the media, which she shared with or possibly learned from her husband Tom Cruise) and I know it is probably supposed not to be taken at face value. But I can't forgive its pompousness, its grandiosity, its masquerading as something important while being such a patchwork of second-hand elements. It is supposed to infuse the viewer with the charm and cultural significance of turn-of-the-century Paris while paying homage to every French romantic creation from 'The Lady of the camelias' and 'Scènes de la vie de bohème' onward. Yet, the only spoken French words in the whole show are 'Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?' from the Patti Labelle 'Lady Marmalade' song, which has nothing whatsoever to do with Paris, Romanticism or French culture. The plot is a distillation of every melodrama ever written down to its bare bones: Poor poet loves girl; girl belongs to rich man; girl spits out her lungs. And this is supposed to be funny? It's anachronistic, turgid, necrophiliac and excessive. It's a movie for people who think synchronized swimming is a life-affirming art. It's what Ren said to Stimpy about cartoons: 'They're only puppets and they'll rot your brains!' It's supposed to make you want to get up and dance. It only made me wish I knew someone intellectually-challenged enough to accept this DVD as a worthwhile gift. The truth about this movie is that it's one big monumental camp that was conceived for people who have no grasp of history, of the world they live in, of their own identity, of their own cultural heritage and who like dressing up in mother's mesh stockings and inventing stories in front of the mirror when there's no one around. It's really meant to bring out the secret drag queen in every viewer. Trouble is I never nurtured my inner drag queen. And I can only see this movie for what it really is: a desperate attempt at meaning from feeble minds and, now that Oscar time is approaching, a desperate grasp for Academy members' attention and the supplementary mazzoola that Oscar's prestige can still confer on this undercooked, overripe tripe.""Moulin Rouge!"" - the exclamation point is meant to express revulsion - is to movie musicals what ""Family Guy"" is to TV sitcoms: a cheap gimmick for retards, a cheat and an easy way out.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Mill On The Dross,"The favorable reviews (by paid critics in the International Press) for this piece of drek (though I have no objection if it cops a Blue Ribbon as Best Of Breed at Crufts and/or the Kennel Club) illustrate to a fare thee well a social phenomena:  Critics Are Getting Younger.  It seems that the average critic today is a failed busboy/girl at Denny's and/or Burger King/MacDonalds who figured that filing copy was better than stacking shelves at Safeway.  The major qualification seems to be 'sure, I'm qualified, I've seen 102 slasher' movies and/or 'I've seen Nightmare On Elm Street 36 times'.  These cats have little or no frame of reference to guide them, if they HAVE actually heard of 'Citizen Kane' they think it's about that son of Adam who killed his brother and went to live in the Land of Nod. Their idea of in-depth movie analysis is Premiere.  If they'd actually seen, say, Renoir's 'French Can Can' or Huston's 'Moulin Rouge' (both covering loosely the same subject) let alone even HEARD of either, they may not have been so hasty at garlanding this bad joke.  What beats me is WHY anyone would want to make a movie set in a Definite period and then, deliberately GRAFT onto it the style/music of a later era.  In 1953 Cole Porter wrote his penultimate Broadway Show, 'Can Can' and to do so he PAINSTAKINGLY fashioned a score that was redolent of French Music Hall at the turn of the 19th Century.  Sure, he employed sophistication and wit but without drawing attention to them.  The number in THIS movie that drew all the notices is 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend', a very sophisticated lyric (by Leo Robin) set to an equally sophisticated melody (by Jule Styne) but VERY MUCH in the style of the late 1940s, when it was written.  In 1899 the music to be heard in Paris was the same as in London or New York. Mostly Viennese waltzes or two-steps, simple - if sometimes haunting - melodies and even simpler lyrics.  The people who crawled out from under a rock to write and direct this travesty, to say nothing of those who cut it with a pair of secataurs, give the impression they have been walking upright only since Tuesday and have absolutely no concept of what cinema is all about.  The same kind of people who think that 'new' automatically means 'better'.  Minus 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Spectacular, Spectacular!","This is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life! The music is so unbelievably awesome! The actors fit their parts as if that was what they were born to do. If you believe in truth, beauty, freedom, and love this is the movie for you. I have seen Moulin Rouge more times than i can possibly count, and i still love it. This is one of those movies that never gets old. The love and romance the two characters have for each other it so unbelievable. It makes everyone want and crave the love they share! The greatest thing about the movie is not just the love they have, but the love they long to posses! In conclusion, WATCH THE MOVIE! I Guarantee a good cry and a warm feeling in your heart.

A Dazzling Cinematic Spectacle,"""Moulin Rouge!"" is an extraordinary film that captivates with its vibrant visuals and unforgettable music, earning a well-deserved 10/10 rating from me. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, this romantic musical immerses viewers in the bohemian world of Paris at the turn of the 20th century. The story follows the passionate love affair between Christian, a young writer, and Satine, a dazzling courtesan, brilliantly portrayed by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.The film's cinematography is a feast for the eyes, with lush colors and imaginative set designs that transport you to a whimsical universe. The musical numbers are electrifying, featuring a unique blend of contemporary songs reimagined in a historical context, which adds a fresh and exciting twist. Each performance is not just entertaining but also serves to deepen the emotional stakes of the story.What truly sets ""Moulin Rouge!"" apart is its exploration of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of dreams. The emotional depth, combined with the film's extravagant style, creates an unforgettable viewing experience. If you're looking for a film that combines artistry with heart, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is an absolute masterpiece that should not be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just to love..,"'Moulin Rouge' is an experience. From the first seconds in the story takes you away to Montmartre, a bohemian place which you might have heard of, or you didn't even knew it existed. Either way the whole atmosphere and environment of this film will make you feel like you are there with the characters, and you are lucky to be the third person to see whats happening over there.I've watched this film many times, and every time it just amazes me, especially the music. The songs were always great. ""Roxanne"" and ""Your song"" were always beautiful to me. But except for those songs there are a lot of great musical pearls in 'Moulin Rouge!'. The passion that McGregor and Kidman deliver in all those songs is just amazing. I'm not too proud to admit it, but every time i hear ""come what may"" I cry. Because sometimes you have given up on love and when these two marvelous actors sing that song, it makes you want to believe again.For me the whole story is a masterpiece, because you are in a a story which tells about a theater play (kind of inception) while the two are connected in every way. Every time I see it I see more references from the story to the play, and discovering new things is always fun.When you've watched a movie once you already know whats going to happen in the end. But when you still want to watch it again and get touched by all the great scenes including the ending, you know that this movies is definitely worth a 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A visual feast and famine plotwise,"MR! is a feast for the eyes. The movie starts with a bang and hardly ever let the fast pace slack, but the ten minute frenzy in the beginning is never reached again (thank god, because it would have been too much of a good thing). You cannot resist being impressed by the set design, decor, costumes, cinematography and all technical stuff. However, a day or two after seeing this movie, all I was left with was an impression of colors swirling before me and dancing and singing. The story!?! Well, it is easy enough to comprehend, but does it stay with you after a week. No, I don't think so. It is not involving enough somehow, even though it should be heart breaking. All in all, great entertainment, but not all is it trumped up to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A musical of a different color,"I must say that I never saw this movie when it was in theaters but it was on demand last night so being bored i decided to order it and watch. It was brilliantly done but I can see where the negative reviews come from. The camera spins and created dizzying shots in which colors and shapes blend with pop songs such as Like a Virgin and Diamonds are a girls best friend. I would still suggest seeing it because I have seen nothing like it.....as some mentioned earlier it would probably be a good spring board for getting someone into musical film and theater. On a side note, I had no idea that Ewan McGregor could sing so well nor Nicole Kidman for that matter, they alone make it worth enduring the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Put On That Red Dress,"Director Baz Luhrmann certainly deserves credit for artistic daring. He takes ""non-singers"" and casts them in a musical that pairs contemporary tunes with the Paris of Toulouse Lautrec.Roger Ebert wrote that watching the film is ""like being trapped on an elevator with a circus"", which is a way to say that the experience is a claustrophobic extravaganza, which seems fair. The screen is a kaleidoscope of color that jumps from cut to cut. Sometimes, the method overshadows, or counters, the message, especially in the early going.Nicole Kidman plays Satine, the courtesan and nightclub star, as somewhat innocent. She meets a romantic composer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), who sings her funny love songs and commits, come what may. It's a relationship that grows to tragic proportions until it consumes all the film's energy---like the leading edge of a tsunami---till you must see where it will end.This film is highly stylized and vibrant. It is so creative, it compels you to watch. In the end, I wish it had some languorous moments to contrast with the freneticism. And I might appreciate its magnificent dancing more if the camera dwelled on the movements of the dancers. But this is a film about the can-can. And fin de siècle enthusiasm. And it works.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still trying to mull it over,"I must admit, I'm a sucker for musicals so my opinion is distinctly biased. If you get p***ed off when characters in a movie break into song, you probably won't like my review.Music:  Of course, the music is anachronistic which becomes a bit of an inside joke.  Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is hailed as a brilliant original modern poet while spouting lines from popular music written two generations after 1900.  Of course we recognize them as top ten hits.  The Bohemians at the end of their summer of love (1899) find them strikingly new and original.Most of the musical production numbers are medleys of songs appropriated from popular culture.  Madonna, Cole Porter, The Beatles, Nirvana and Sting get pulled out of context and used in weird ways.  This is not new.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astare managed to recycle more than 20 Irving Berlin songs in Blue Skies.  In most of the cases the songs get put through the wringer and come out as completely new compositions.  In some places the two songs are mixed into contrasting harmonies and lyrics that actually work well.  In other places you end up with a jumbled mish-mash of songs that don't really fit well together and spoil the effect.  In other cases the transformations demonstrate a twisted sense of black humor.  (Jim Broadbent's and Gary Oldman's dramatic duet of ""Like a Virgin"" complete with chorus line is worth about half the price of admission.)Plot:  Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled but the plot and the scripting seemed to be one of the weaker parts of this movie.  Not only was the music appropriated, but the script in places was appropriated as well.  The script alternates between slapstick and tragedy.  If you've been raised on too much opera, the movie keeps you guessing, is it heading towards Tosca or La Boheme?  The climax comes right out of Charlie Chaplin and then dumps you right into Verdi with a sweet Hallmark tag at the end.I suspect this is a movie that most people either love or hate.  I'm a bit in the middle.  As a musical, this certainly isn't Sound of Music and it isn't even Evita.  The closest musical I can compare it to is Bob Fosse's almost-biography All That Jazz which is another movie that viewers either love or hate.  I suspect that All That Jazz would be a good barometer for determining if you want to see Moulin Rouge.  If you thought All That Jazz was worth watching, then you would probably appreciate Moulin Rouge.  If you find that self-referential and critical musicals are overly self-indulgent, then you probably should skip Moulin Rouge.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
All Around Ineptitude,"This musical is like a melding of a bad opera, an unfunny vaudeville show, and an annoying music video. The concept of constructing a story based on lyrics of popular songs has potential, but is undermined by inept direction and editing. Luhrmann is a clueless hack better suited to making MTV videos than a feature film. This is the perfect film for those suffering from attention deficit disorder. The editing is so frantic that few shots last more than a second. The incessant cutting and zooming is nauseating. The plot is clichéd and melodramatic, capped by a ludicrous finale. On the plus side, McGregor brings energy to his role and Kidman has never looked more beautiful.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The second time I saw it I was touched for the very first time,"When I first saw Moulin Rouge! last spring, I agreed with the nay-sayers. I thought the camera work was a bit too jarring, the story was too melo-dramatic, the choice of songs was inappropriate, etc.  However, I rented the movie last night, and all of my misconceptions were extinguished. This is a spectacular, spectacular film! We are bombarded with uber-realism in today's cinema.  Moulin Rouge! offers an entertaining vacation from the normal filmic experience.  Moulin Rouge!concerns itself more with its artistic vision rather than the tired popularity contest of most studio films.  Luhrman's original style and the sheer talent of the cast (McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, and more) prove that the musical genre is not dead and, more so, that it can be extremely enjoyable to watch.  So if you didn't like Moulin Rouge! the first time, I urge you to see it again with an open mind.",,Anonymous,Romance
9/10,"I am not a fan of musicals. I often avoid to see them at cinema, but sometimes I see them on DVD and regret my choice. There are many musicals that can be considered the best movies ever: The Blues Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show to name a few.This is a beautiful musical, too, that can compete for quality with the above mentioned ones, even if I voted 9 for this (my favorite ones are perfection). First the music is great. It has so many famous songs rewritten to fit in the script. I was delighted especially by the ""Like a virgin"" scene and by ""Show must go on"" (I'm always touched when I hear this magnificent song. It tells a lot of life and death and can be considered the most impressive testament by Freddy Mercury. One of my favorite songs ever). The initial song (I knew a boy..) is also very touching.So, the music is great, the script is funny and well written, the direction is wonderful, the actors are great, Nicole is sexy and as good as usual. But Jim Broadbent (the owner of mouline rouge) is the best actor in the play. He creates a character that you cannot easily forget.Don't miss this movie in DVD. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Favorite movie of all time!,"I normally do not like musicals, but the thing about this movie is that it doesn't only focus on the musical aspect of it, but it has romance, comedy, drama, and everything else you want in these kinds of movies. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgreggor really embody their characters in such a way that you actually fall in love with them and their relationship since the beginning of the movie. There are no words to describe how Moulin Rouge is a true masterpiece and in my opinion, it is not given enough credit as it deserves. Making a musical is hard, but making a good story out of one is even harder and the story of this movie is really creative and there is nothing like it.

Generally - I liked it,"""Spectacular Spectacular - no words in the vernacular can describe this great event, you'll be dumb with wonderment"". That line stuck with me for a few days, after watching this piece of artistry. Colorful, fast-paced, MTV video style motion picture that reminded me of Whose Line Is It Anyway Song titles game. The Like A Virgin sequence was modernly hilarious. True, it won't appeal to everyone, but there's actually a love story surfacing above the glitz and the glamour. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a nice job of portraying the ""doomed lovers"", and they do a good job of singing too. I still think Kidman should have been nominated for ""The Others"", but Moulin Rouge just shows her range more for comedy, music and drama. Very exquisite. So some of the songs were after the Moulin Rouge time period, I sang along with it anyway. The movie is like a nightclub itself, fun and entertaining. Overall, an original concept and an unforgettable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Stunning visuals, Disney story","The raves about this film all include reference to the fact that this film is a feast for the senses.  And, visually, it is mighty impressive.  Lavish set design and art direction (an Oscar must-win in this category) are the primary virtues of this film, and mark out its uniqueness.  Other than that, though, you get a storyline that's not nearly as easy to appreciate, one that's been done time and time aplenty in a Disney movie (well, except for the ending). On the whole you get an above-average movie, worth viewing at least once (several times if you like the striking visuals), but I think one could come up with several other movies meriting consideration for best-film nominations before this one.But as to the visuals, it does raise the question: is this the most visually impressive movie ever?  It's certainly among the most *impressive* ever, though I wouldn't categorize it as one of the most visually *beautiful* films ever.  For that, I would nominate _Barry Lyndon_.  It's a feast for the eyes, but like everything else Kubrick, it doesn't bombard you, as _Moulin Rouge!_ does.  And the first 15 minutes or so of _Moulin Rouge!_ are just plain dizzying; there's no time to really take in anything in particular.  This director hasn't had the best of track records with me; I literally gave up on _Strictly Ballroom_ about 30 minutes into it.Mainstream storyline + extraordinarily lush framing = 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bohemian rhapsody, spectacular spectacular","I fell in love with Baz Luhrmann as a director when he released ""Romeo and Juliet"", and brought a timeless classic to life for a new generation. I was struck by his inventive genius -- I mean, who else would have thought of using the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart as emblems identifying the Montagues and the Capulets? Yet even that did not prepare me for the bedazzling display of manic energy and glorious excess that is ""Moulin Rouge"". I saw it again recently on television, and realized just how busy the film is -- almost too much to absorb, a constant assault on the senses.Yet all is not noise and cacophony. There is harmony, too. Take, for instance, the sequence where ""Lady Marmelade"" and ""Entertainer"" are seamlessly woven together in a way I have not seen since the Big Band sound merged with soft rock in ""Xanadu"".Ewan McGregor (as Christian) is the heart and soul of the film, the troubadour of ""truth, beauty, freedom, and love"". He turns out to have a wonderful singing voice. Who knew? And he is able to deliver the hackneyed clichés with a perfectly straight face, genuine emotion, and touching naivety that makes you want to believe every word.Nicole Kidman (as Satine) pulls off the amazing feat of making you completely forget Marilyn Monroe ever sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"". Kidman makes the number all her own. She is the counterpoint to McGregor's lovesick swain -- a turn-of-the-century Material Girl.But the true genius of ""Moulin Rouge"" lies, not in its visual appeal, not in the acting skill of its principals and supporting cast, but in its bitingly satirical commentary on modern-day popular culture, seen through the lens of turn-of-the-century Paris.Luhrmann uses Christian and Satine as vehicles for an incisive examination of the cynicism and materialism of modern-day society, masked by the false romanticism of popular music and literature. Luhrmann slyly weaves classic song lyrics into the film's dialogue. Once the pleasant shock and surprise of recognition wears off, we realize just how corny they are -- or, more to the point, how jaded we have become.""Moulin Rouge"" is a movie with a message, and that message is best captured in the words of Sir Paul McCartney: Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs. And what's wrong with that?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Campy Piece of Garbage,"Am I the only one who felt that this movie just was campy garbage.  I mean granted, I have to give credit where it is due,  The cinematography was different and grand, the singing of Ewen McGregor and Nicole Kidman was quality, however I felt that the Bastardization by Luhrman of the great Rock and Roll works probably made Freddy Mercury and Kurt Cobain roll over in their graves.  I really felt that the predictable plot and the campy dance routines made me want to laugh in a bad way more than praise the movie.  If this is the type of movie that people believe is brilliant, I believe that a new Paulie Shore movie is coming out for you intellectuals.

My favourite musical,"Generally speaking, I don't like musicals. Mostly because of the songs. The two main exceptions are Singin' in the Rain and Grease, both of which are incredibly fun with very catchy songs. For the most part, though, I can't stand the genre, especially the recent flux of them of which this film is the catalyst. But, after hearing all the raves for this one, I decided to give it a go. It wasn't my type of movie, and I loved it.The interesting thing is, if this film hadn't been a musical, I doubt I would have liked it as much. Sure, the direction is innovative and the acting is impressive, but it's the numerous medleys of contemporary songs that really made this for me. Going in, I was under the impression that this was going to be like every other musical  songs written directly for it. Little did I know that David Bowie, The Police, Queen, and even Nirvana were all represented in various shapes and forms. I absolutely loved the way in which a vast variety of songs were covered, interpreted, and woven together to create instantly memorable tunes. My favourite? Definitely ""El Tango de Roxanne"", but I enjoyed everything else as well.Of course, that's not the only highlight of the film. The incredible visual and directing style is unlike anything I've seen in a film of this sort before. In fact, it's really unmatched in cinema in general. The acting is very good, as the stars manage to create three-dimensional characters while also having great singing voices. The story is a brilliant mishmash of doomed romance, slapstick comedy, and even historical drama. The slapstick routine at the beginning crackles with terrific comic energy, and the whole film is incredibly vivid and alive.I have to say this is one of the biggest surprises for me as a moviegoer. A musical romance, two of my least favourite genres, that produced a hit song which I loathe, and I ended up loving the film. Go figure.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a MASTERPIECE!,"Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 18, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a ""sparkling diamond"", and when Toulouse exclaims ""I hope the piano is tuned"". The songs are wonderful, particularly ""Come What May"" and ""The Show Must Go On"", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewan McGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a seriously good film.,"If you are used to slow, panoramic films, consider a seat-belt-equipped chair.If you expect original music or pure covers, leave your expectations in the kitchen.If you want linearity in exposition, watch out.This film will make you work very hard but it is worth it.Presentational entertainment is often classified - e.g tragedy, comedy, sometimes terms like 'romantic comedy' or 'screwball comedy'.Moulin Rouge borrows from many of the standard classifications - I would call it romantic tragicomedy but that does not do the film justice. The spectacle, pace, eye candy, sheer entertainment make it hard to classify.As important as the plot is, this film upholds the best traditions of 'American Musical' - just enough story to hold together the music and show numbers.But I digress.

The trainer robots arrived on and left the bus, taking different shifts.

One of my favorites,"Artistic, beautiful, entertaining.My mother and I have been watching many movies together as of late, most of them popular ones from her childhood. This means most of the newer films I've seen have been late 1990's-early 2000's. I was hesitant to watch this one, knowing very little about it besides it being a musical and from 2001. My mother kept insisting we watch it and assuring me it was great, so we finally sat down and watched it, and holy crap.I love this movie. The acting, the music, the setting and outfits are perfect. It's genius storytelling.It's characterized by its charming sets and unique take on modern day music. The Roxanne Tango is now one of my favorite songs, and favorite scenes of all time. Ewan McGreggor is fantastic- I had no idea he could sing! The editing is unique and fitting to the style. The story is simple yet complex enough to create real conflict. It's emotional, (yes I bawled at the end), telling a tragic love story between two young people in ancient France.It's also surprisingly funny. The 'like a virgin' scene is absolutely hilarious. It's such a creative, clever film. I love it so much and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Style over substance = a creative mess,"I was about to give up on Moulin Rouge just over the halfway mark when the ""El Tango de Roxanne Medley"" appeared. I will never listen to Sting's ""Roxanne"" the same way again. (A big thanks to actor Jacek Koman as the ""Unconscious Argentinian"" for performing the song.) It was one of the few times I tried to give a movie one more chance to prove itself.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang pleasantly and were certainly up for the challenge director Baz Luhrmann was giving them. Overall, Moulin Rouge is a stylish, ambitious and gleefully over-the-top musical romance that is very heavy on the senses and is, fatally, very light on plot.As mentioned before, portions of the movie are better than the entire film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A superficial depiction of love.,"When will people figure out that you can't compensate for a lack of TALENT with glitz and glamour. Shaking the camera, inserting quick cuts and using over-the-top sets and costumes may distract some people from this atrocity, but some of us are insightful enough to recognize crap when we see it.This is absolutely the worse editing I think I've ever seen. (The fact that it was nominated for an academy award made me rethink every thought I've ever had. I'm afraid to leave the house now, because I think that was a sign of the coming apocolypse.) The cuts are far to quick and it seems to have arbitrary cutaways thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. It was impossible to follow, because there isn't a single shot in this movie that lasts longer than 2.5 seconds. All flashy cuts do is confuse the viewer. They aren't ""hip"" or ""cool"" or ""innovative"", they're just plain ridiculous (believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a professional editor.) The whole idea of editing is to cut the film together into a coherent story so the viewer can enjoy it-and this film failed miserably. All it did was give me a headache.  To be fair, the editor is a very skilled editor who probably was just doing her best with what that no-talent hack of a director gave her. I have to believe the A.D.D. style of cutting was his vision, not hers. Check out Road to Perdition or Elizabeth to see her true skills.What was with the gratuitous slow-motion? Every other shot was in slo-mo for apparantly no reason at all.The singing made me want to sharpen a pencil and shove it directly into my ear. Seeing a fat man singing  ""Like a Virgin"" is going to cost me years of therapy and lots of sleepless nights. Kurt Cobain is turning over in his grave, and if I ever hear ""Your Song"" by Elton John again, I may set myself on fire to distract me from the pain. ...THE MOON SINGS! What the f**K?Not to mention, the story was awful. This was a just a very superficial depiction of love. The story is what holds a film together. No matter how pretty you make it, without a good story, it's just a complete waste of time. I shudder to think of some potentially great movie that didn't get made because this piece of crap did.I was EMBARRASSED to watch this movie, and I was alone when I watched it, so figure that out.

It is like any old hollywood musical in that is completely presentational, but what fun. Better than anything else I've seen in years.   The fact that the movie is so polarizing speaks highly of director. People love it, or hate it.  That's because unlike most directors, Baz Lurhmann did not back down.

Not an Incredible Movie,"Based on some excellent reviews that I had read about this movie and the positive comments of a good friend of mine who saw it twice at the theatre, I thought Moulin Rouge! was going to be an amazing movie. After watching it, I thought it was a very unremarkable movie, maybe my expectations were too high.It just did not appeal to me as a musical or a drama. I actually have to consider the movie a fantasy movie to justify the relatively high rating that I gave it. The best thing about the movie was Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were great, especially when they were singing. But I found the movie really hard to watch overall, I found the fast paced music video style sequences in the movie terrible.The movie cost fifty-three million US$ to make, but it has only made an unremarkable fifty-eight million US$ in North America up until March 2002, this movie has really been over hyped. Moulin Rouge! is not for everyone, but some viewers sure loved it. More than 40% of the IMDb members that voted on this movie gave it a 10 out of 10. My rating is 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cinematic triumph!,"Moulin Rouge is the kind of film that makes you aware of the true possibilities of modern cinema. From beginning to end, this film is an amazing aural and visual feast. It defies cinematic convention, and instead delivers one of the most inspiring pieces of entertainment that I've seen in a very long time. It grabs a hold of your spirit and takes it on one of the wildest rides around. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor literally light up the screen, and they can really sing! The use of contemporary music in a musical period piece is brilliant! The cinematography is amazing, and the visual effects are captivating. At the heart of this artistic masterpiece is simply a tale of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all love. And boy is it fun! Kudos to Baz Luhrmann! For the first time in a long time, I left the movie theater with the feeling that someone had actually made some effort to challenge my senses! Warning: If you've become accustomed to the regurgitated rubbish that hollywood has been putting out lately, you might be put off by Moulin Rouge's ORIGINALITY!

"Nice movie, but not great","I saw Chicago before seeing Moulin Rouge. Maybe this was my fault. I came with very high hopes for this one, as many say it was the reason for Chicago's success. I have to say, it is a very foreseeable movie, the story is a classical Hollywood soap-opera, and music and dancing are really just for ""decoration"": The focus is always on story (the final play says it all). Unfortunately, the story didn't catch, and I wasn't touched by it a single moment.The music is not bad, if you like to recognize famous songs played a bit different. Even so, I couldn't find a single song that stayed with me, and most of them are cut to less than a minute! As I said, the focus is really on the story, which is bad enough to spoil even the rare moments of good music.Anyway, the dancing is really missing, and it could have been so much better! Except for the tango scene (which is not great, but I suppose it's the best scene in the entire movie: you should see Asfalt Tango for a much better one), I always had a feeling of frustration, trying to see the dance and moves, but the cutting and camera moves didn't allow.I think the greatest achievement of this movie is turning the attention of the audience towards musicals, and making possible the success of later movies, like Chicago. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""The greatest thing, you'll ever learn...","...is just to love, and be loved in return"".""Moulin Rouge!"" is my personal favourite musical. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is arguably the best musical ever made, but nothing touches me more than Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a feast for the eyes, heart, ears and soul. It's unapologetically romantic, shamelessly corny, hysterical, sexy, and FUN.The doomed love story of poor writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) and the beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) is told by pop songs from the past 2 decades or so, even though the movie is set in Paris, 1899. From David Bowie and Madonna to Elton John and Nirvana, they're all there. McGregor, Kidman, Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo are all great in their parts, and do their own singing in most of the scenes. Even though ""Moulin Rouge!"" wasn't an extraordinary box-office hit and got mixed reviews when it first came out in mid-2001, it earned 8 Oscar nominations months later (the Academy, trying to apologize for not nominating Luhrmann for best director, earned his wife, Catherine Martin, two deserved awards - for best costumes and art direction), eventually created a major cult and legion of fans, and officially became the movie that brought the musical genre for the 21st Century. ""Chicago"" would bring Bob Fosse's genius to the big screen and get 6 Oscars (including Best Picture) the following year, the delightful ""Hairspray"" and the uninspired ""Dreamgirls"" got over 100 millions at the box-office last year, and now we can officially say: musicals are popular again. Nobody should forget, though, that Baz Luhrmann's partly responsible for this fortunate comeback. 10/10.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Stick with it, and you will be rewarded","This is the type of movie that I am usually predisposed to dislike -- an overhyped production that starts off as a mess, which Moulin Rouge definitely does.  While the first 15 minutes of the film are almost unintelligible, they are visually stunning, and that was enough to keep me going.  After quite a while, the actual plot appears, and while it's hardly original, it provided a good framework upon which to hang all the rest of the weirdness that follows.An ensemble cast performs magnificently and that's the real attraction of Moulin Rouge.  Nicole Kidman redeems herself here as Santine, the courtesan with a heart of gold -- she's truly stunning, both as an actress and a vocalist.  Ewan MacGregor surprises me with his earnestness, vitality, and naivete as Christian, the young writer.  Jim Broadbent deserves his Oscar nomination as Zidler, the complicated proprietor of the Moulin Rouge.  On the other end of the spectrum, the Duke is played as Snidely Whiplash by Richard Roxbourgh with no shadings whatsoever, and John Leguizamo is just ridiculous as Toulouse-Lautrec, affecting both a poor French accent and a ludicrous lisp.However, the use of contemporary music (and mostly old pop songs) bothered me throughout the entire movie.  I don't believe that an original piece of music was presented until almost an hour had gone by.  Instead, we get several riffs on Elton John, the Beatles, the disco era -- ""Voulez-vous couchez avec moi""?  Come on.  It serves to pull this viewer out of the flow of the story.  I didn't really become absorbed until much later on, when the scenery stopped being so intrusive, the quick cuts and speed-up/slow-down effects subsided, and anachronistic songs gave way to some beautiful original work that actually had something to do with the story.  The choreography got pretty silly, too, especially toward the beginning.All in all, a visual feast and a belatedly engaging story combine with mostly brilliant performances to deliver a very entertaining film.  It's not my favorite, but I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story actually begins.","There has been much hype about this film, especially from friends, and I was very excited to see it, especially at the prospect of hearing Ewan McGregor sing! I must say however, that I was disappointed. I was told this is probably the film of the year, and it certainly is not, with the first half lacking direction and substance, merely a collection of big show scenes that seemed to be included for all lovers of musicals and stage shows. Hence why my friends loved it!At this point I must say that I am not a great fan of Baz Luhrmanns' Romeo and Juliet. The only real part I liked was the portrayal of the rival families. To me it seemed like an extended MTV music video. So this probably clouded my judgement somewhat.Saying that, once a semblance of a story begins, it begins to seem like a film, and a wonderfully entertaining one at that. To me, the two actors who shine through are Ewan McGregor, showing that he is truly a versatile actor, and Richard Roxburgh who plays the most fantastic baddie I've seen since Charles Dance.The music sequences are brilliant, and when the characters start speaking lines from songs, that added a nice touch to the film, especially since it's something all my friends do anyway!When the plot does kick in, it kicks in quickly, and although it's a simple story of love, it's well acted, scripted and directed, with the most amazing musical sequences.An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story begins.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mad world,"Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' was a brilliant blend of Shakespeare and a decidedly modern sensibility. 'Moulin Rouge!', that film's successor, is a less-grounded and rather more self-indulgent affair, a voracious monster that gobbles up just about every influence it can lay its hands and spits them out as a spectacle of sound and noise so overwhelming that at times it seems that the screen can barely contain it. Luhrmann's interweaving of fragmented images and songs is dizzying and dazzling and very self-aware, delighting in its deliberate anachronisms. The editing is perhaps the most manic yet seen in cinema, which sometimes supports but at other time smothers some the film's nicest tricks, like the deft choreography (and not just in the dance numbers) that were one of the pleasures of 'Romeo + Juliet'. One could hardly call it monotone, but one can almost for just a little bit of metaphorical black-and-white to offset the extravagant colour.Ewan MacGregor does his usual stuff, Nicole Kidman is excellent in the most demanding role and I also enjoyed the relatively understated performance of Richard Roxburgh as the malevolent Duke. The plot resembles that of 'Shakespeare in Love' (which of course was also based on Romeo and Juliet), and also contains a definite nod to 'Strictly Ballroom', Luhrman's breakthrough feature. There are also no original songs, the joke lies the way that the familiar is recycled into something shiny and new (and if you've seen the film, you'll get the allusion in that last sentence). Yet the fact the soul of the film is so well reflected in pop songs also indicates a certain level of triteness. For all its pomp and magnificence, when the hero and heroine sum up their tale in a simple chorus, you're left with the feeling that there really hasn't been anything deeper than this at any point in the movie.You can file this film along with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut' as a modern attempt at revitalising the big screen musical. 'Moulin Rouge' is certainly amazing; but the fact that you're unlikely to see another film like it is probably something of which you'll be glad.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Visually dazzling,"""Moulin Rouge!"" created so much hype in 2001 I'm still surprised I never got around to seeing it. Although Nicole Kidman was already famous, this was one of her first major successes after her split from hubbie Tom Cruise - the fact that it became such a global phenomenon only sparked more tabloid crap - ""Kidman Bigger Than Cruise"" and the likes. This only fueled the popularity of the movie and it became something of a cultural sensation. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing about it.Four years later and the noise has settled. I finally got around to watching the movie on television and left my expectations at the door. As such, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun the movie actually is - visually it's a feast for the eyes, packed with dazzling extravagance. Director Baz Luhrmann (""Romeo + Juliet"") expands upon his directorial flair and theatrics - this comes across as somewhat of a sequel to his Shakespeare remake. (Indeed, the modern soundtrack compliments it nicely.) The story is kind of nostalgic - a worker at France's ""Moulin Rouge"", played by Nicole Kidman, falls in love with a poet (Ewan McGregor). They are not allowed to be together but they cannot resist their feelings for each other.""Moulin Rouge"" isn't a perfect film but the plot is fairly interesting, the characters are likable, the songs are wonderful and visually it's on the scale of a Gilliam film - magical and huge.I would never say it's a ""great"" movie but I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are indeed very talented at singing, dancing and acting... Baz is an excellent director with a lot of talent, knowing his work pretty well. All the other cast and crew worked really hard to make a musical that will entertain people and they succeeded, in my opinion. I also love the way they combined music, comedy, action and drama.

The film stars Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh.An English writer visits Paris to the biggest night club Moulin Rouge and falls in love with courtesan who also happens to be their star performer.There is no doubt that this film will not be everyone's cup of tea and the reason being that the film is very musical and few of the performances are really over the top but still if you like musical films then this is the film for you.Acting is top class and Nicole Kidman had done a tremendous job in the lead role, she was aware that the film is based on her and she will not disappoint you for a single bit. Ewan McGregor was equally impressive but in my opinion he was little over shadowed by Kidman, Richard Roxburgh in my honest opinion didn't looked impressive and although being the only villain he had to be spot on but looked little off track.Screenplay of the film was full of music and dance and as mentioned earlier the typical music film lovers will like the screenplay of the film. Climax of the film is strong and gives a nice closure. A must watch film if you are musical film lovers or also if you are a fan of Nicole Kidman.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Had mixed feelings...............,"Ya i can understand this being a musical an all,had to be a bit out of my league,but still,this is just utter disgrace to the 'musical movie' genre.Of course,it had a lot of ""commercial"" stuff to make this one worth the wait,but definitely not one to be missed.Well,it does have a flip side to it,as most movies do,all is not disappointing.Well, i have to admit that Nicole kidman as well as Ewan McGregor have put their best foot forward to make this a spectacle,it is (though not too pleasing to the eye),not a completely waste of effort.Richard roxburgh as the duke is quite believable as the ""bad guy"" here.Also,a thumbs up to Jim broadbent as the colorful Harold Zidler.overall,i would give this 6 on 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too bad...,"I'm truly disappointed.  I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite awhile.Moulin Rouge! could have been a truly great movie if someone would have held Baz Luhrmann's hand and restrained him a bit.  Unfortunately, the film suffered from many of the shortcomings of Romeo and Juliet, but this time they were amplified beyond all reason.  Baz Luhrmann's editing, while innovative, is nothing short of self-indulgent.  It takes over the film, interrupts the story, and turns the film into a mediocre overly-long music video.I don't fault any of the performances...not even the singing.  The story was actually pretty good...when it was allowed to unfold.  Had the film-makers exercised some self-control in the editing room, this movie could have easily taken place inside of one hour.  It also could have been a very good movie.  Luhrmann is a visual genius, but he needs to be reined in a bit.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was fantastic!  It made me cry the first time i saw it.,"Moulin Rouge isn't, under ordinary circumstances, my type of movie.  When I first heard about it, I wasn't interested because I thought that it was a stupid idea.  When my mother rented it, I just left the room.  I saw it for the first time in French class and I fell in love with it.  The guy who brought it for us to see in class is a skater boy that seems rather stoical sometimes.  He told me that he cried when he saw it for the first time and that it's his fav movie.  I watched it curiously but still with no real interest.  The story, music, and dancing was so awesome that I still watch it one year later.  I could relate to Satine as far as how she looked at love.  I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unlike anything you've ever seen.,"The opening moments of this movie were a bit disorienting, as I was swept into a world and a film unlike any other I'd ever experienced.  But I kept in mind that Baz Luhrman simply doesn't make normal movies (See other work 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo & Juliet'), but rather audio-visual extravaganzas.The music is what carries the film as the quirky pop adaptations, although odd at first, work very well and mesh seamlessly with the equally high-caliber original music.  In fact this is the rare film that, while nothing quite compares to a theatrical viewing, is as good on DVD.  I attribute this to the music.  Like listening to a favorite CD over and over, 'Moulin Rouge!' is an enjoyable two hours time and time again, and the music will stay with you for even longer.But unlike many movie musicals, the music here advances the story along, rather than simply providing melodious entertainment.  It also enhances the story by displaying a greater depth of emotion than most mere words are capable of expressing.  As for the vocal qualities, I found it quite refreshing to listen to the actual singing voices of the cast.  Kidman, McGregor, and others supplied their own vocals, which was a fantastic change from the typical pre-packaged pop or opera sounds.Tough movie to describe, but in a sentence, it's a flashy, fast-cutting, moving-camera, music-drenched portrayal of a love story set within a modern turn of last century nightclub.Bottom Line:  Every year there are two or three movies that genuinely get me excited about what can be done with and through film.  'Moulin Rouge' was one of those in 2001.  Top Five of the year. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't know what I was expecting,"...but it sure as hell wasn't this! I loved Luhrman's """"Strictly Ballroom"" but after seeing ""Moulin Rouge,"" the word talent doesn't begin to sum up what this man can do. Absolutely fresh, exciting, colorful, fast, brilliant, fiery, sweet, gorgeous, funny, original - I'm still stunned from the visual impact and the use of the anachronistic music in this film.A total knockout in every way. I recently saw John Leguizamo interviewed. He said that he was scheduled to be in more numbers but - and I'm paraphrasing - Nicole Kidman kept knocking him over or vice versa - he was hilarious.Baz Luhrman pulled some opera elements into this, particularly Traviata - one of the scenes was right out of Traviata, in fact. I'd love to see him do a production of it. It would be phenomenal.The cast was wonderful, with Kidman and McGregor magnificently showcased - beautiful to look at, fine acting, good singing - they made a fantastic couple.I have one itty bitty criticism, but it's not enough to give such an original approach less than a 10. I would have loved some of the musical numbers to have been just a tiny bit slower. I realize today the style is more the fast cuts, but some of it was so beautiful, I would have loved to have lingered on some of the scenes a bit more.A sensational accomplishment.

Divided Reactions to Moulin Rouge,"The ratings posted on IMDb for Moulin Rouge are something of a surprise. People I know loved or hated this film in about equal numbers. And I mean REALLY loved or REALLY hated. If the pattern on IMDb were the same as the one I found among friends, there would have been clusters in the 8-10 and 1-3 range and very little in between. For those looking for guidance, you need to understand that everything about Moulin Rouge is exaggerated. You can go with the flow and enjoy the film (as I did) or you can compare it to more conventional movie musicals and despise it. For those who liked the movie, the lead review on this site has it exactly right. But you can also turn the comments around, view them from the other end, and understand why a lot of people disliked everything about the film for pretty much the same set of reasons.

Its's a movie than starts fresh but just ends in a recycled mess.,"When one first starts watching Moulin Rouge it is easy like the characters of the movie to get swept away in its eye popping visual flair.  The Costume, and Art department get a big 2 thumbs up for the work they did on this piece.  And the some of the musical sequences were phenominal (i.e. Loved the Can-Can; and both versions of ""Diamonds are a Girls best friend"", as well as ""Roxanne"" looked amazing).  But other than that i feel that Moulin Rouge had nothing else to offer but a very bad, way over-dramatic storyline.  Its a Movie that starts Fresh but just ends in a recycled mess and for the most part everything just came off very cheesy.  I think what i really didn't like about it is that it seems like an original piece of work but its not.  I hated how most of the songs weren't original but remakes or re-vamped versions of pop hits.  Throwing a whole bunch of songs together to make one love song just seemed cheesy to me and silly.  In fact thats another good adjective for this movie silly, and too erratic.  It kinda felt i was on drugs for most of the film; some wild stimulant for the first 30 minutes  and then on some depressants for the second half.  Though i couldn't feel anything for any of the characters.  I really didn't care if the lovers ended up together at the end, because they had to force this love story down your throat till there was no room for air much less anything else.  By the end I was just exhausted of hearing everyone moan and cry. Performances over-all were good but I think Ewan Mcgregor shines brighter than Nicole Kidman does.  His wide-eyed enthusiam for art and love was addicting at times, but Nicole seemed to jump from stale to over the top too many times (her performances in The Others and The Hours are better examples of her acting abilitites).  Everyone else just seemed (again) silly.  Moulin Rouge is not a terrible movie.  Its almost worth it to own a copy just to look at the dazzling decor of the film.  But having to hear 200 songs about love isn't worth it to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Musical Ever!,"Moulin Rouge is the best musical movie for me so far. Born in 1981, I have not seen many musical movies though. Anyway, I'm glad I could see this one.The pace of the story is perfect. The story runs so smoothly that I have no idea what time was it until the movie ended and I took a look at my watch.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's great voices really brightened up the movie. The songs were so great that I didn't realize it took place back in 1900s.Costumes were so great. I have no doubt it won Oscar for best costume.All sorts of emotions could be expressed via wonderful songs. Compare to another musical movie that did better in Oscar (not for me), Chicago is lack of love songs while Moulin Rouge has it all.",,Anonymous,Romance
Whirly gig on overdrive,"I had to watch this film twice before I could get my baring and decide. Watching Moulin Rouge! For the first time was like getting hit by a Mac truck then taking a roller coaster ride afterwards. This film is unique and like no other I have ever seen before (gilbert and Sullivan come close in the PP). There is so much eye/ear candy in this movie  that I did not have time to absorb or enjoy it all. The last time I saw this much energy in a music/movie was ""Stop Making Sense"" (1984) you stare in disbelief at the wattage expended. The second time I watched   Moulin Rouge! I enjoyed it. I have mixed feelings about most of the dialogue coming from other song lyrics. I watch older films and listen to older music and enjoyed picking out several lines from these films and songs.  Since many young movie goers may not realize this, it will pass over their heads unnoticed. Such reuse is not a new concept and is enjoyable if done well, camp if forced. When the reuse was well-integrated, it was magical but there is a couple of  gear grinding moments (""Like a Virgin"" needs work). Over all, 96% of the music was well integrated and awesome. The cinematography, costumes and choreography make this a visually stunning event. With uncommon movies like Moulin Rouge! that can't be easily categorized, people will either love or hate this movie. I fall into the love faction. The plot is simple and fanciful but who quotes ""War and Peace"" on a roller coaster? In defense the plot does have an ending not typical of the sappy ""happy ending"" one expects.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply fantastic,"Written for English class.Moulin Rouge! (2001) is a movie musical that takes place in the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris - Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer, falls in love with the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Their love is doomed from the start, since Satine is set to marry the wealthy Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), who has promised to invest in the cabaret if he gets Satine in return. In spite of all, the two start a dangerous love affair.To some viewers the characters may seem unrealistic and hard to understand, but after learning more about Luhrmann's style in general, I believe that that is exactly what he was going for. Christian is a hopeless romantic, ready to do anything for love, while Satine is at first extremely skeptic and doesn't believe in true love. In Moulin Rouge! these two main characters aren't the only ones with strong personas - Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the head of the cabaret, is comically melodramatic and jolly, while the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is exactly his opposite - so snappy and angry it may feel overdone at times. All of the actors in this film do a fantastic job portraying such dramatic characters.One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is ""El Tango de Roxanne"". This scene depicts Luhrmann's style quite well - the entire set, (especially the lighting) and the dancing are very dramatic and truly engage the viewer. Furthermore, the editing jumps from one place to another very quickly. Luhrmann's style can also be heard in the songs - the song they are dancing to is the rock song Roxanne by The Police, released in 1978, combined with the tango ""Tanguera"" by Mariano Mores, released in 1953. The events of Moulin Rouge! occur somewhere in the early 1900s, so neither one of these songs would have been released back then.Moulin Rouge! has been one of my all-time favourite movies ever since I first saw it. I absolutely love everything about it, and what especially stuck with me were the music and the actors, who all did a fantastic job. Not to mention the ending, which left me speechless for days. The production design, as it is in all of Luhrmann's films, is breathtaking - every scene feels extremely carefully thought out.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Splendid Extravanganza!,"Moulin Rouge is a movie which i had been planning to watch for many years now,from the day it released.I recently rented the two disc DVD edition of the movie and it was a wonderful musical indulgent. I admire musicals as they are just a joy to watch and moulin rouge delivers the best music of it times. All the songs are well crafted and performed,Nicole has performed close to 5 songs and so has even McGregor along with her for two songs. The Story as it claims is about freedom truth beauty and love(hope i got all four rite!) and yes it tries to capture them all together with Paris' very own Moulin Rouge in the background. The costume and stage set up is really awe inspiring and the make up for characters brings in the grandeur the director had in mind. The movie is a real treat to the eyes and also to the soul with all the love in the air.Catch this movie if u haven't,after all its ""THE REVENGE OF THE MUSICALS"" time now!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow,"I must admit, my primary reasoning for seeing this movie was that of a shallow, teenage girl, I mean, Ewan McGregor is....well, HOT!! But once I had seen this masterpiece I knew it was a stroke of genius. The way Baz (yes, we are on a first name basis) mixed contemporary music with such a moving screen play was amazing. Its tone of humor as well as tragedy is what forces me to watch it over and over. And although I can practically speak right along with the movie, I never tire of it. The true talent of Ewan and Nicole (again, first names here) is realized when you find out that every note and every song is actually them singing!!! I have not been this excited about a musical since Phantom of the Opera, yes, it is that level. So, for those who haven't seen it, do, and for those who have seen it, see it again. And again. And again. And then, see it a few more times, just for good measure!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"well made, if still a spectacle ultimately","Buz Luhrmann's Moulin Rogue is a good example of a film where having songs in it repeatedly and sung by the cast isn't distracting from the rest of the film (unlike the recent Dancer in the Dark). In fact, considering the frenzied pace, razor sharp camera cuts and settings, songs do this film some good.Moulin Rogue, as we learn was a very big and flashy dancing and practically insane place for really entertaining people (notice the sarcasm). Enter in a dreaming writer (Ewan McGregor) as he soon find that his most important philosophy (I believe in love, he states) is put to a test with the lovely and tempting Satine (Nicole Kidman). Then the usually noticeable convention happens in the story, but that's not what gives this film it's high rating.Luhrmann presents a musical that hasn't really been seen or heard before. He uses a Technicolor film approach, mixed with contemporary songs (some might remember last month's Knight's Tale tried this trick) and 50's dance numbers. It is actually quite a stupendous spectacle once you surpass the flaws. Kudos to the cast, of course, but also to Lurhmann, editor Jill Bilcock, cinematographer Donald McAlphine and production designer Catherine Martin for making such a different piece. By the way, in case anyone is wondering, this is the only film where you will see (originaly it was) Roxanne turned into a Broadway type of production number.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just captivating,"This is the first and only movie up to now that i fell hopelessly and forever in love with just from its very beginning! all my friends (except one, who actually told me to see this film because it's already a classic) thought it was too melodramatic and maudlin, too sugary and mawkish, but for me it is more than a masterpiece. i was totally enthralled with it as early as the scene in which satine was hiding christian from the duke which is one of the funniest things i've ever seen in cinema (excluding a lot of memorable moments from ""dumb&dumber"" but this movie falls into a completely different category). i also adored the blazing style of all the dance scenes, all the colours and vibrance in them, the ingenuity of the adaptations of contemporary songs (which in other context, in other movie i would have thought inappropriate in the least) - my favourite is the tango of the argentinian. another of my favourite scenes is the one in which the duke is singing this elton john song - and he sings so heartbreakingly badly and makes such a face that somehow you start pitying him and, of course, you can never think of him as the bad guy in the way you think about bad guys in action movies for example.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's a good movie, but maybe if it weren't musical it would have been better.","This film is a mind-boggling trip to the bohemian world of Paris of other times, when the city of lights was the capital of vice and art, in a Europe more interesting than today. The Moulin Rouge is a cabaret, one of the most famous in the city, and it still exists, but this film shows its golden age, when the choristers were also prostitutes or ""suggar-babies"" of the elite. The script is based on a triangle of love, sensuality and interest formed by the chorus singer Satine, the powerful Duke and the romantic Christian, an English writer who falls in love with her.This film has a beautiful tragic love story to tell, and that was what I liked most here. The best scenes in the film are the most romantic and the final part. Nicole Kidman looks wonderful, knows how to be sexy without being vulgar, and has very good chemistry with Ewan McGregor, who is another great actor in great shape here. The film was good for both their careers and they both earned all the credit they got. In the supporting cast, Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent deserve an applause for their good work.The problem with this film is, basically, everything else. Instead of focusing on history, creating a romantic drama with tragic contours, the dazzle of Paris was stronger and decided on a Broadway-style musical. This can be pleasant, in other films, when it is done properly. ""Les Misérables"" or ""Sweeny Todd"" are good examples of films of this style that worked wonderfully. Here, the Broadway style and the comic touches came totally out of the question and only served to distract us. Of course, in the middle of the error there are good things. For example, the songs were excellent (Your Song is particularly striking) and so was the music. The entire choreography and dance department of the film deserved to be congratulated for the excellent work, at the level of the best that is done on Broadway. I just think that the film, due to the good love story it brings, did not ask for this cheerful style, especially if we take into account the tragic touch it has. I didn't like John Leguizamo either. He looked like a clown all the time.The film was well directed by Baz Luhrmann, but the film may not be as good as other films of his career, like ""Gatsby"", which was one of the best films he directed, in my opinion. Here, I think he was too bold and followed a path that he shouldn't have followed. But despite that, the film has quality and is worth the time we spent watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Technicolor Yawn,"In a way, Moulin Rouge typifies everything that's wrong with American cinema by bastardizing everything that's right with its European counterpart. Visually, the movie is a great reference for any commercial or video director. But unlike a music video that lasts only three minutes, Moulin Rouge begins with a visual volume worthy of Spinal Tap and tries to sustain it for 120 minutes. It doesn't work. The rule of dynamics applies as much to a pretentious musical as it does to an ambitious action film. If the volume is too loud, you simply can't hear anything. Everything gets lost in Moulin Rouge's hurricane of desperate art direction and production design. The film's leads, talented actors though they may be, simply aren't charismatic enough to compete. The movie requires posturing, not acting. And, frankly, there are no less charismatic actors than Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. In fact, their appeal is in their pastiness, not in their screen presence. What's more, the music can't compete either. Great songs are dwarfed by the never-ending onslaught of CGI visuals, which, after a while, become tedious. We get it, already. The moral of this story is that you still need one to make a good movie. Nothing can replace pen and paper. Unglamorous though it may be, a good script is everything. The filmmaker's previous effort with Romeo And Juliet worked precisely because he had a great script to begin with. The production design was icing on the cake. With Moulin Rouge, icing is all there is, and a satisfying meal it does not make.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Most Impressive Love Match Since Romeo And Juliet,"I still remember the day that I went to the cinema for to watch 'Moulin Rouge' -- simply extraordinary, a movie full of thrills. I think that Nicole Kidman is really impressive and I was surprised by her fascinating voice when singing. The rhythm of the movie is frenetic and the scene of the 'can can' is 'spectacular spectacular'. For me it is the story of the most impressive love match since Romeo and Juliet, and the tragic end instantly brings to mind the story of the Lovers of Verona. The real highlight among the well-known songs in the film occurs when a duet is performed By Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. In fact, I much prefer Ewan's version of Elton John's ""Your Song."" I always liked it but now I love it. I went out of the cinema enthralled and I have seen the DVD loads of times. It is the perfect movie to see in good company, and to cry with emotion.",,Anonymous,Romance

Yes, I understand is is arty to use modern songs in a past era, but there is a point and I don't think Kurt Cobain would much approve of using 'Smells like Teen Spirit' as part of (basically) a vaudeville act.  On a good note, the hidden references to modern songs are many and there is much that is amusing about the way they are used, but it does NOT make up for what is overall an attempt to get into the Guiness book of records for the most surrealistic picture ever.

One of the best non-Disney musicals,"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""Moulin Rouge! is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. This movie tells the story of a young poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) who plunges into the insane world of the Moulin Rouge, where he meets and falls in love with the club's most popular and beautiful star, Santine (Nicole Kidman).The only musicals I have ever really enjoyed have come from Disney. I find a musical every now and then that wasn't made by Disney and although I may really enjoy that movie, I have never found one that I have thought was an outstanding movie. That has now changed. Moulin Rouge! surpassed my expectations and I have definitely say that in my opinion, this is an outstanding movie. The songs where all great and memorable, the acting was fantastic and the movie itself looked amazing!My main issue with musicals is that I find that many of the songs begin at awkward times, the songs aren't memorable enough to remember and that many musicals have songs that I simply don't like. All of the songs in Moulin Rouge! are great and are all very memorable! All of the songs fit what is going on at that moment in the movie. One thing I would like to say is, who the hell knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had such great singing voices? They should definitely show off their talent more often!The songs in this film were great and so was the acting. I have only seen a couple of movies starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor before watching this and I definitely want to watch more of their movies! They both put on great performances in this film as Santine and Christian! Their chemistry was great and I would like to see them work together again in the future on another movie! We also can't forget about the performances from the rest of the cast, especially Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh, who I definitely think deserve more credit than what they get! Richard Roxburgh was great as the The Duke and Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler was a crazy performance and was one of the best supporting actor performances I have seen in a while!Moulin Rouge! was a very bizarre, crazy, depressing, happy, exciting, emotional experience. I have not enjoyed a film this much in a while! I know that not everybody will agree with my opinion as there are a lot of people out there that don't like this movie but if you haven't seen it, I personally highly recommend it! It is definitely one of my favorite musicals that isn't made by Disney, one of my all time favorite romance films (a genre I don't enjoy that much so I'm surprised I enjoyed this film so much) and one of my favorite films!

Probably not the musical you are thinking of,"The word ""musical"" usually makes me think of those films from vintage cinema or those Disney animated films.  Moulin Rouge is not like this.The movie's tone is a bit more serious and contains suggestive dialogue (as it should be considering the setting).  The musical numbers are a mix of both modern-style original and adapted songs such as Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" and Madonna's ""Like a Virgin.""  But, make no mistake -- neither the songs nor the score contain heavy rock-n-roll or electrics; think more along the lines of a full orchestra.I thought the music worked well for this movie and offered a different style of storytelling than the norm.  It had a pretty interesting musical-within-a-musical plot.  The movie itself did seem visually hard-hitting and disjointed at times, especially in the beginning, but it does settle down once the love story gets going, and an emotional one it is.Don't dismiss Moulin Rouge because of your predispositions, because chances are they don't apply in this case.  It's not your typical musical.  Also, it's not so much like Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" -- you can like one and not the other.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hyperkinetic,"Chanteuse in late 1890s Paris mistakes a Bohemian songwriter for a wealthy Duke--they fall in love anyway. Strictly as a piece of eye-candy, director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a stunning cinematic achievement; alas, it is also full of inappropriate music and characters so manic, they lose any appeal the actors might have brought to the slim material. Visually inventive though it may be, the film is without passion; it is so mechanically cranked up to grab us by the eyeballs, it fails to come together on an emotional level. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--everyone in the cast, in fact--is game and energetic to a fault, but after 90mns I'd had enough. The film's major conceit (pop and rock songs injected into a period setting) never quite gels, and as for the characters...who cares? *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hard to fault ... but not to everyone's tastes,"Moulin Rouge is the 3rd of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain trilogy and arguably, the installment that takes the Red Curtain concept the furthest.  As such, it is not a film that will appeal to everyone either in concept, story, style or execution.  I, however, find it a film that it is difficult to fault but can understand the criticism of others.As for the plot, it is loosely based on the Opheian myth (Orpheus and the Underworld) and is a love story which uses very similar story telling devices to Romeo and Juliet and is based around Montmatre and Moulin Rouge in turn of the century (1899) France.  The key device that this film will be remembered for is its use of modern songs in a period setting (not an original concept but taken further than previous films have dared).The acting and musicianship of the headlining actors is excellent and each brings something to the film as a whole.  Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an idealistic, naive writer and McGregor brings a degree of honesty and vulnerability to the role, particularly in his early scenes with Nicole Kidman.  Kidman herself plays Satine, the courtisan in chief of the Moulin Rouge and completely owns this role.  It is impossible to imagine anybody else playing the part as well as Kidman and her musicianship, particularly in ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend) is also top-notch.  Jim Broadbent plays Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge and mostly is there to provide comedy.  However, he performs well and creates real shades of light and dark.  Finally, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke, is a good comedic villain, who also managed good variation between light and dark.  In fact, the only characters I did not care for were the other Bohos such as Toulouse (played by John Leguizamo - a Luhrmann favourite).  They suffer from being the story devices to get Christian to the Moulin Rouge and as such, they feel shoehorned in to scenes taking place after the Elephant scene.The direction is typical Luhrmann - brash, colourful, quick and stylish. Admittedly, the first 20-30 minutes of the film are not easy viewing as they invoke the style of old WB cartoons and there is also a lot of jump cutting. This is, I believe, the main thing which puts certain audiences off. However, if you can get past this, the direction settles down post ""Spectacular Spectacular"" number.  It's hard not to like this - it has charm, wit, drama and romance and for the most part, is an original concept. The set and costume design also show an amazing attention to detail.  The dancing exudes energy especially the Can Can in the Moulin Rouge.  But I think the Tango scene is where it is used to best effect. However, if you do know someone who hates musicals, this is not the film to try and convert them.In my opinion, an original, modern classic and the sort of film-making that should only be encouraged.  Superb 10/10 (Plus, if you liked this, try Singing In The Rain if you haven't already seen it.)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Spectacular, spectacular","Mouling Rogue! is, at this moment, best movie that Baz Luhrmann has made. Romeo+Juliet was visually very similar, but it did lack the continuity of Moulin Rgue!.Whole fairy tale like feeling of the story makes this movie more enjoyable to watch.I am not huge fan of musicals, but I must confess that I adore Moulin Rogue. It has much to do with familiar songs that have been rearranged to fit in the musical pieces of the story. Many who have seen this movie pick out the wonderful tango version of The Police son Roxanne, but my personal favorites are wonderful adaptation of Madonna's Like A virgin and Queen's Show Must go On. But there are many others as well, whole movie is a fireworks of visual and musical candy.Whole movie is filled with fantastic actors. Ewan Mcgregor does mans work as Christian, a romantic, who fells in love radiant Moulin Rogue courtesan Satine, played Nicole Kidman, who has never looked more stunning. Richard Roxburgh as the Duke is wonderfully sleazy and disgusting villain, bringing great contrast against naive Christian.I could go on and on. It is hard to find bad performance from this movie.Enough is enough. You either love it or hate it. Go see it and decide. I love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
BEAUTIFUL and Dazzling,"I put off watching any musical made after WestSide Story so I did not see Moulin Rouge until this week.  I am so sorry I missed it on a big-screen.  I was awe-struck.

Great Aussie actors!!!,"Moulin Rouge is a great film and should be watched by all!Visually spectacular with great songs, great costumes and script. Nicole Kidman and MacGregor work excellently together as the Aussies. The set, itself, which is entirely inside a huge warehouse is great . This includes the big elephant and the dance hall.Although I must admit that you need 2 or 3 viewings to actually get what is happening and all the flashbacks that do occur! - As in the beginning it is sometimes hard to recognise that MacGregor is the man typing on the typewriter!10/10 - A must see by everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I thought it was pretty good, but I'm a Kidman fan, even more since she's singleanyone want to introduce me?  One more thingthe theme of this movie was summed up in one line: `It's a story about love..at the Moulin Rouge.'

"Delightful, vibrant comedy drama musical.","Filled with music, dance, amazing visuals, love, drama, humor, action, suspense and naturally a bit of weirdness (being a Luhrmann film), this is a film I can watch again and again, and again. I must admit, though, it might be an acquired taste at first, like sipping on on good bottle of wine or nibbling on swiss cheese. The more you taste it, the more acquired you become and the more you want! The effortless blend of so many fantastic songs into one incredible medley is simply fascinating, to say the least. The visuals alone make the film worth watching. The casting is perfect, notably Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
mixed feelings,"What I liked: visually the movie is gorgeous. The sets are great, so are the costumes. The colors are beautiful. I also liked much of the music. I appreciated the joke of using late 20th century popular tunes in a movie set in 1900. The two principal actors (Nicole and Ewan) sing amazingly well.What I did not like: First of all the story. Was this the one-millionth love story? Will he get her, will she get him? Who cares? This type of story has been told so often in books and movies. Then the over-acting: the Duke and the Moulin Rouge's director over-acted heavily, making their scenes unrealistic. The other actors over-acted a bit too. Maybe the over-acting was intentional - it fits the type of acting that was practiced around 1900. Still I don't like it.Overall a 6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular! Spectacular!,"I know it's a terribly stereotypical thing to say, but many guys prefer cyborgs smashing into each other and car chases through Tokyo over a musical about the 'merits of love.' I am definitely the former. In fact, most of the titles in my DVD collection ends with the phrase '...of the Living Dead.' However - and it's a BIG 'however' - I will make a massive exception for 'Moulin Rouge.'I'm certainly not a fan of musicals in general (and I'm sure 'South Park: The Movie' doesn't count as one, despite having plenty of songs contained within), so I'm not sure why I love 'Moulin Rouge' so much. It's set a hundred years or so ago in Paris when a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) in the - kind of infamous - nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Naturally, true love never runs smooth and the pair have plenty of highs and lows along the way.I suppose it helps that I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor (who can sing probably better than you imagine!) and, possibly what aided this musicals place in my heart was the fact that all the songs they sing are actually 'modern day' songs which work surprisingly well for what is - effectively - a 'period piece.' Nicole Kidman also deserves a nod for her singing voice, although I'm not a massive fan, but she did everything she had to well enough. Although, the two definitely do have chemistry, even leading to rumours of being 'more than just friends' off-screen, too!Although however much you like or dislike the film's leads, what often gets talked about more than who's in the production is the way it's directed. It truly is a film student's dream to watch. Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic (and most of all creative!) job at bringing this old tale to life and injecting more energy than Renton every experienced from 'jabbing a vein' in 'Trainspotting.' The songs/dances are the true definition of 'high energy' and the whole film is awash with vibrant colours and glamour.The supporting cast are also good: John Leguizamo does well for a 'normal-size' man playing a dwarf and therefore acting (and dancing!) on his knees. Jim Broadbent always stood out for me and definitely deserves a nod. The film's primary antagonist is Richard Roxburgh, who, in my opinion, is delightfully campy as the villain. However, I did hear that he took a lot of criticism for his performance and some saw him as the film's 'weakest point.' I guess he does chew up the scenery in some places, but in a film so over-the-top as this, I couldn't really tell the difference.Overall, there's nothing really new here in terms of storytelling. After all... the 'boy meets girl' story is a tale as old as time. However, it's not the story that stands out, but HOW it's told. You definitely don't have to be a fan of musicals to appreciate the volume of energy and love that's gone into making this. It really is a spectacle to observe.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Circus of Weirdos,"'Moulin Rouge!' is, without doubt, one of the ten worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  It's loud, annoying and senseless with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Though it's billed as a 'musical', most of the music is drowned out by sheer noise.  And the musical directors cast historical accuracy to the wind as we hear contemporary songs including 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' performing in Paris of the 1890s(?)!  What schlock!As much as I usually love Nicole Kidman, even she could not salvage this awful movie for me.  A Golden Globe ... !?!  C'mon.  Nicole should have won a Globe and an Oscar for her performance in 'Dead Calm', but certainly not for this unadulterated mess.  The acting ... by everyone on-screen ... is so irritatingly hammy that it cries out for brown sugar sauce. Yuk!What were they thinking!?!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and to be loved in return...""","And so I went, journeying into the unforgettable trip that was ""Moulin Rouge!"" - now and forever one of my all-time favourite MOVIES (not just movie musicals) ever! I simply cannot say enough to express how very deeply this film affected me when I first viewed it...it's impossible. From the very first jaw-dropping image of the 20th-Century Fox logo bordered by a beautiful red velvet curtain and a bouncy conductor - I knew then that I was about to experience something I had never seen before. Grand, inspiring, original, flawless...everything that so many others have said in their descriptions of ""Moulin Rouge!"" could not be put any better. This is the reason I am now a bona-fide fan of director Baz Luhrmann. I had actually seen some of his previous work - the hyperkinetic modern version of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo & Juliet"" - and from then on was absolutely hooked onto his visual flair. Likewise with ""R+J"", ""Moulin Rouge!"" oozes with theatrical energy, gorgeous costumes/set designs, terrific music, and of course, first-rate acting from its wonderful two leads, as well as the supporting cast.Watching the first few minutes, I could unfortunately see why this movie was ignored and laughed at by many critics, filmgoers, etc.; apparently it developed a bit of a ""cult"" following of sorts after that. I agree that it's not for everybody - but come on, after I finished it, I remember thinking: ""What's wrong with everybody? This movie is a classic! What were the haters thinking?"" Granted, if you don't like musicals, I can understand, but for others, I guess its overwhelming originality and unconventional wisdoms were too much for some people. Oh, well...you clearly can't please everybody.At any rate, this film deserved all the praise and award nominations it received and/or won. It's certainly one of the more interesting and groundbreaking films released early in the new millennium, and it truly reminds some of us just why we love movies in the first place (or musicals, or MOVIE musicals, for that matter). It lifts our spirits with often-campy fun. It's lovely, it's larger-than-life, and it's just plain phenomenal. A joy to watch and listen to.I'll stop gushing for now...I think I've made my point clear. Thank you.* * * TRUTH * BEAUTY * FREEDOM * LOVE * * *",,Anonymous,Romance
Bravo Baz!,"Anyone who loves artistic, emotional and different films has to see this masterpiece by Baz Luhrman. As the third installment of the red curtain trilogy by Luhrman it clearly indicates how the director has developed as an artist.To begin with it has to be said: Moulin Rouge is not for everyone. Due to the fact that it has a unique and at times absurd take on the musical genre. However, I think its pure genius. The way in which cliché after cliché is uttered by the protagonists and modern songs are given a new treatment to suit the orphean myth in this musical, which set during the belle epoque, is just awe inspiring.This movie touched me on so many emotional levels due to the clever usage of known songs and overly romantic dialogue.The fact that Moulin Rouge can make an audience laugh and cry, and all the while be utterly entertained is very extraordinary in a time when Hollywood produces so many movies that you feel like you've already seen ten times before and that make you wonder why on earth you even bothered to pay for the ticket.The casting is superb.I wasn't a big fan of Nicole Kidman before this movie but this movie truly proves she has star power and great screen presence. Ewan Macgregor  is equally astonishing in his role.The chemistry between the two is sparkling and its amazing how they can make their love for each other so believable in such an unbelievable story.The art direction deservedly won an oscar, creating a suiting atmosphere for the movie: heightened reality at its best.This movie is  an art piece. It made me feel and experience something truly unique and memorable. The music, art, casting, directing, photography, editing and mood, make Moulin rouge a roller- coaster ride of emotions you do not want to miss!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect 10 out of 10,"I loved this movie since the first time I saw it opening weekend, and it still makes me laugh, cry, sing, and dance.  The perfect use of song is what keeps this movie going.  Just when you think you have seen the best song sequence, another pops up and pleasantly surprises you.  My favorite part would have to be when Satine sings ""I'll Fly Away"" followed by many different songs with Christian.  The Roxanne scene near the end is also awesome.

"Fall in love, with the stylish musical, Moulin Rouge!","When I had the chance to see Moulin Rouge, I went into the cinema with no expectations, yet all I had heard was praise for this Australian film. To my delight, I was swept up in what I think will be one of the films of the year. In fact, this was the sort of film I have been hanging out for, for six months.A poet, against his father's wishes, moves to France, the 19th century equivalent of Andy Warhol's Factory. He falls into the world of Toulouse-Lautrec and his entourage, and is drafted to write a nightclub spectacular. In this seedy world of sex, drugs and electricity, he begins a passionate love affair with the club's highest paid star and courtesan.Firstly, I want to give special praise for the script of Moulin Rouge. It was so spectacular spectacular', and there are so many reasons for this. Well the main reason would have to be the great soundtrack. The old classics, then a mixture of 20th century hits that had a great remix to suit the mood of the film. Then you have the dancing part of the script, which again helped set the music up to have a big impact on the audience. Then the last reason would have to be the very subtle change from the four main themes of Moulin Rouge: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and LOVE. The script also has a two sections to it. One half made me happy, the other made me sad and want to stand and applaud.The cast of Moulin Rouge, while it might not be world wide known, it will put the Australian talent we have on show to the world. I want to praise the two main characters. Nicole Kidman, has had a rough trot this year, but this has not affected her acting talents. She was fantastic as  the beautiful Satine.  I never realised that Nicole could sing, but what a voice she has. This film will undoubtedly make her a big star in the following months, home and abroad. I look forward to seeing Kidman in future movie roles, because it will take a big role for her not to be known as the Moulin Rouge babe'. Then we have the role of Christian, played by  Ewan McGregor, the new Star Wars' man. While he was good in the Phantom Menace, McGregor showed off his real talents in this one. Again the dancing and singing of this Scottish born actor just amazed me. I felt that McGregor and Kidman had a great on-screen chemistry together. The wrong pairing for that part of Moulin Rouge would have spoilt the film completely.The other people in the cast of Moulin Rouge, might not be too familiar to people overseas, yet being from Australia, I picked up on them immediately. Richard Boxborough, played the role of the duke and did it very well, plus there was John Leguizamo, Garry MacDonald, Christine Anu, David Wenham and a very special appearance by Australia's favourite girl  Kylie Minogue.So, with a great cast and wonderful script, Moulin Rouge is a brilliant film for mine. It is very original, a little bit different to your ordinary film, and gives you another view of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The director of Moulin Rogue, Baz Luhrmann, deserves so much praise for this film, because this will put Aussie movies on the map.Finally, I want to leave you with a quote from Moulin Rogue that I will never forget, a reference to the movies main theme  LOVE:`The greatest thing is just to love, and  be loved in return'.Love is a very confusing and difficult emotion to handle, but this quote says it all. Give love and you should receive love. Oh how I wish I knew more of Shakespeare's work, because I am starting appreciate it even more. Count on one thing, I will be adding the DVD and soundtrack of Moulin Rouge to my collections when I have the chance to.Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10 (Loud Applause!!!)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
See this movie in the theater so you can get the full effect.,"The first half hour or so of this movie is completely amazing!!  My date and I both had huge idiotic grins on our faces- my cheeks actually started to hurt from smiling so much.  The fast pace of the movie, the jumpy camera work, and the vibrant colors were stunning.  I really enjoyed the fast dialogue, the clever musical numbers, and the way crazy characters would pop up from random places.  That being said, when the movie calmed down towards the end it lost most of its charm.  It went from being overpowering and engaging to sappy and predictable.  The finale was a letdown: not because of the tragic ending to the love story but because it lacked the intensity that the beginning of the movie led you to expect.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

masterpiece,"I totally agree with Rob, from NY. My girlfriend is from Spain. She thinks with these simple universal love stories they distill love to the bone and create an a new original version of an age old idea. The film is a work of art because it really does take you on a journey and if you fail to be taken in by this story then you are a cold hearted cynic and shame on you. This is what love should be and hardly ever is. Life is never like this but at least for a couple of hours we can believe it and love it. If you love your partner take her/him to see this film. If they don't come out loving you intensely, then dump them. It's true. Believe me. My favourite bit is Like a virgin with the aristocratic lothario and the Moulin Rouge impresario. My girlfriend's favourite bit is the dialogue/song battle using all the songs you've ever heard of in a seamless medley of intense pleasure: love versus convenience and who's paying the rent. Ultimately it's a fable but hey, it's fun and let's us all forget the drudgery of normal life for a moment. And if they actually had the final production/theatre piece on stage anywhere in the world in real life it would be sold out forever, forget Les Mis or other such rubbish, this was exciting and vivid - and I HATE musicals. Except Grease of course. What can I say, forget the US cynic critics and follow your heart. At least for once. Some people say you love this film or hate it. Maybe it's whether you get it or not. I hope you get it. Maybe it's because I have loved and been loved in return I love this movie but hope others can follow this path. Remember kids, there IS nothing else to life apart from Love.

"See this show, before it shuts down!!","'Moulin Rouge' is probably one of the best films I've seen all year. It's the cinematic equivalent to being tied to a four-poster bed, having your eyes pinned open, ala 'clockwork orange' and having a mixture of honey, sugar and vaseline smeared over your eyeballs whilst Nirvana and Elton John let off fireworks just behind your ears. Lovely!! The screen chemistry between Obi Wan and Kidman is hot, hot, hot. They can both sing (Ewan struggles sometimes but I think that just adds to the movies charm) If I've got any criticism it's that, the film is predictable and, like Jim Broadbents paunch, it does start to sag a bit towards the end. In all though, I thoroughly recommend it, for pure escapist entertainment. Finally, I've got to applaud Mcgregor and Kidman for tackling these parts, it's this kind of diversity that sets them apart as two of the best actors around at the moment. Hats of to Baz Lurman's outrageously over the top direction. Every scene could be framed and placed lovingly above your fireplace. It really is *cliche alert* a rollercoaster ride of a film.

And not a sappy sickly sweet love story but one that can really touch you... if you let it.

The Acting is great but the movie drags on forever!,"Moulin Rouge is quite and intriguing new style of film making that caught my eye from the start of the movie.  Nearly a thousand different frames fly by your eyes in the beginning of the movie moving from one picture to the next. If you are not alert while watching this movie, you will be visually dazed. The story line is nothing out of the ordinary.  Two lovers battle over the same girl and you can pretty much predict the ending except with a little twist.Many people walked out of the theater crying but the movie didn't seem to hit me that much.  The visual effects are interesting but the movie seems to bounce around way to much.  I found myself rubbing my eyes trying to focus on what was going on but it was hard.  The first half of Moulin Rouge is the best part of the movie in my opinion.  It is gracefully funny and entertaining.  The second half moves along extremely slow for over an hour going back and forth about how much each person loves the girl.  It made me sick and wanting to run out of the theater.  I thought the ending was never going to come.The acting was superb!  Nicole Kidman as Satine does a fantastic acting job throughout the film.  I wouldn't be shocked to see her nominated and winning a best actress award when the oscars come around.  Ewan McGregor also does a great job acting.  Though a singing voice is patched in over his because after this movie is a musical.Overall, I was entertained for the first half of the movie but then the love story took over and I started to slide down my chair.  The movie moves really fast and at times is quite tedious.  If you like love stories and like movies where you cry (girls), you will like this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Obi Wan stop shouting....,"Nicole could sing... Ewan shouted. Nevertheless, with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann delivered another visually stunning film, similar in style to Romeo and Juliet. I like this pop culture take on the musical. Hollywood just doesn't make musicals anymore, and its interesting that this one was shot entirely in Australia.Moulin Rouge is unusual. The leads give their best, the supporting cast is great and I quite liked the music. However, in saturating the film in song, Luhrmann doesn't really let the characters develop. Moulin Rouge looks pretty and is certainly different.I did just buy the 2 disc DVD and the extras are great.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The use of modern music diced into the late 19th century era is done with sheer perfection and brillance.

It seemed to be inventive and fast moving and had lots of nice songs but I guess I was wanting a little more story and less extravaganza.  Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo were very good.  I must admit another bias, I cannot stand Nicole Kidman.  I think her acting is egocentric hamming.  I think she was miscast and the movie suffered because of her.  Other problems were too quick MTVish shots and the penchant of the cast to yell their lines.  It was a bold movie clearly taking a chance with an odd way of telling the story and was, my biases aside, successful.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Never have I had a movie make me physically sick, but this one has managed to achieve that distinction and not just because of the editing.I can't say what the story is actually about because I couldn't discern that amidst the cluster of technicolor overload, ridiculously hyperbolic characters, and MTV music videos cinematography. Luhrmann tries too hard to be out of the box and winds up with a total mess here.I gave it 1 star for the effort and another star for the production. The costumes and staging are wonderful.

New Opera for the New Century,"Moulin Rouge! starts with a tell-tale scene of a conductor working himself in a sweat conducting an imaginary orchestra before large curtains.Expecting a pseudo-historical romantic view of turn-of-the-century Paris, I got thrown into a turbulent vaudeville. Instead of a voyeuristic approach the director had the guts to actually throw me smack in the middle of the actual stage without so much as a warning.At first I plucked my eyebrows but it was simply irresistible. Moulin Rouge! is loud, outrageous... and deeply moving.The heart of the movie is a classic opera-style tale filled with romance, deceit, treachery and death. The form however is far removed from anything I have ever seen. The musical accompaniment is a skillful medley right across twentieth century music. What to think of a room filled with men in cylinder hats dancing to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana?. If Verdi lived in our time, would this have been his approach? Who knows, and who cares. I could never get enough of this exuberant, rich and yet somehow sober performance.The acting is excellent, with outstanding roles by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent. The director is both ubiquitous and subtly withdrawn. Ubiquitous in the loving care that went into every detail. Withdrawn in the strict adherence to the self-set rules of the story and the way it is told. Not once do you tell yourself: ""Hey wait a minute, this is a movie! I am sitting in a theatre, and this isn't real!""The story is told in one long trait. At the intermission I actually felt like having had desert, and still had half the movie to go.To finish off the compliments, the movie, besides being a real tearjerker, is simply great fun. You can't miss the scenes where the rotund theatre director sings ""Like a Virgin"". And it works!Don't miss Moulin Rouge!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You really can fall in love with a movie,"Yes. I, too, really fell in love with this movie. It's propably the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, audiovisually and by the cliché storyline. Everything is beautiful and melancholy. The music ain't very good in itself, but the main actors make it sound beautiful. You have to dig your fingernails into your palms to stop yourself from sobbing, when Christian sings ""why does my heart cry""...*sigh*... Moulin Rouge! is a beautiful faerytale, which makes you feel unreal. I'd hope it'd stay in the movie theatres for ever and ever, and see it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular Spectacular creates a stir,"This is a visually stunning film! It is an incredible treat for the senses. This one must be seen on a BIG screen with BIG sound to be properly appreciated. The soundtrack and performances are wonderful, but this movie gets highest marks for production design and direction. The unique, fantastical world created here is reminiscent of the magic done by Jeunet and Caro but with some Peter Pan dust thrown in. The story is essentially very short and seems stretched out, but the extra space is filled with lots of moving fun. This is a period piece that doesn't stay in any one period. The special effects seem groundbreaking, and the refreshing thing is that the big budget F/X aren't used for car chases, fighting scenes or aerial acrobatics. It's high action romance. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely stunning movie but....,"I totally agree with all those other contributors who've heaped such lavish praise on this movie.  As a spectacle it was stunning, an assault on the senses, but I don't think I've ever come across a movie where the views of the critics are so polarised.  It's either one of the best films of all time or else it's total garbage.  When I saw it at least 6 people walked out.  I guess some people don't like weird movies, and let's face it this is a weird movie, it doesn't obey any of the rules, and some people are obviously uncomfortable with that.But I do have one big criticism, and that is Nicole Kidman's performance. I did not believe for one minute that Satine loved Christian. She was too cool, she was too distant, she could have been wondering how the hell she got involved in such a movie, but she was not in love.  I've asked myself several times whether that mattered in such a surreal film where style triumphs over everything, but I think it does.  Love is the message, this is a film about love and Baz Luhrman could have found an actress who looked as if she was mad about the boy.  Instead we got Kidman trying to be Marlene Dietrich.It was still wonderful, but it could have been almost perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not bad, to be a musical","Not being fond of either romantic films or musicals, I must say Moulin Rouge lived up to my expectations. Early in the movie I was a bit bored by too much light and dancing and the rest of elements of a musical but, fortunately, things improved before long. It was the first time I really paid attention to a Nicole Kidman's performance (Yes, it's true), and the same can be said for Ewan MacGregor, who I hardly knew something about, aside from his appearance in Star Wars.Though I have liked Moulin Rouge, my opinion on musicals hasn't changed.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh La La Land...,"When I was a student, our marketing teacher told us an anecdote about one of our predecessors who, after finishing school, started quite an unusual business; he bought grants for operating licenses, allowing him to improve a brand and its value before selling it with a capital gain. One of his first clients was the owner of a cabaret whose fading reputation made him lose money and customers and needed a real rejuvenation treatment. It was the Moulin Rouge.Legend has it that, once he owned the rights, the secretary of a young Australian director called him, asking for the permission to use the name for the title and the setting of a movie. Needless to say that it boosted the 'Moulin Rouge' image for a whole new century and our young businessman made enough money not to need another job. I don't know how much has been amplified by the passing of years, but I love to think of fate as a crazy Can-Can dancer with a perfect timing; a pivotal business at a pivotal moment of the history of musicals, in fact of movie-making.Wikipedia states that ""Moulin Rouge!"" was the first musical to be nominated for Best Picture after ten years, the last being ""Beauty and the Beast"". While Disney's classic is a great musical, the novelty of its nomination had more to do with its status as an animated movie, so while not disregarding it, I would say that Baz Lurhmann's ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a mini-milestone as the first live-action musical in twenty-two years since Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"". When it came out, the ""love-letter-to-Hollywood"" wasn't 'all that jazz' yet, the film took everyone off guard, shook up the conventions of the genre with such gusto that it might have undermined the chances to win the Best Picture Oscar. The more conventional ""Chicago"" would, over such heavy contenders as two epics and a holocaust movie.There wouldn't be one streak of ten years without a musical, but ""Les Miserables"" didn't win the coveted prize and recently front-runner ""La La Land"", was knocked out at the last minute by ""Moonlight"", so maybe the love for musicals have faded a little, and viewers are more attached to conventional forms of storytelling, as long as the stories are unconventional. Maybe that's the problem of musicals: they use unconventional narratives stories that can't wow our cynical eyes. And maybe the reason why I was so ecstatic after ""Chicago"" was because the story was still enjoyable without the music. ""Moulin Rouge!"" uses a clever exclamation mark to distance itself from John Huston's eponymous film and emphasizing its treatment of the iconic place, but beyond all the glitz and extravaganza the film is wrapped in, the story is rather conventional and its notability film is mostly dependent on all the choreographic achievements and frenetic editing.Indeed, ""Moulin Rouge!""' plot can be summed up in one paragraph: a struggling writer named Chrsitian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Moulin Rouge's sensation, the courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) but their romance is undermined by the sneaky mustached Duke of Monroth (Richard Boxborgh). So, they use the process of writing a spectacular spectacle (deliberate pleonasm) as a decoy to their forbidden love but the Duke's jealousy and Satine's illness (she's suffering, actually dying, from tuberculosis) escalates to the obligatory emotional climax. The story is well-acted but its plot is like a clothesline where to hang musical numbers, but that's not to diminish the appeal of the film because it is in a class of its own, on that level and one's got to hand it to Lurhmann to have opened the streak of musicals with possibly the least conventional one.Lurhmann was the son of a dance choreographer and theater owner and like Bob Fosse who was a dancer; you can tell that it injected a real musical instinct in the young director. The film is a dazzling and vertiginous series of musical vignettes directed by a majestic ringmaster played by Jim Broadbent in an unprecedented role since Joel Grey in ""Cabaret"". There's not a single shot lasting more than ten seconds. It is a spectacle that paradoxically endorses the codes of musicals as tragic romances but that invent something that appeal to the MTV and clip generation. The result is odd and avant-garde and might disorient the fans of the more traditional form of storytelling. But don't get it wrong, this is not the kind of musical that would have looked better in Broadway, if anything, it highlights the status of movies as a unique way of storytelling.Indeed, you can't have such dramatic changes of costumes, such heavy jump cuts in a play, but here, they're indispensable for the film's hyperbolic vitality. The editing of is one of the most rhythmically fact you'll ever witness but it's a double-edge sword. The paradox is that the film might not hold up in theaters, many users said they left the audience because they've had an overdose so maybe this is a film that benefit from a viewing, one where you have a remote control. Still, if you're patient enough to get to the end, you will see that the film is not without a strong emotional resonance. Maybe that wouldn't have been possible had it featured traditional can-cans and a gloomier Toulouse-Lautrec (unlike Leguizamo's) but it couldn't be just a retread of the Paris we know.Believe me, as someone who lived in Paris and not far from the Pigalle quarter where the cabaret is set, I knew there was an eternal gap between the Paris you imagine and the real one, Paris is never as dazzling as in the realm of our imagination and what can be more imaginative than a medley of songs that go from ""Queen"" to Kurt Cobain in Paris' 1900. It's crazy, sick irreverent and grotesque but hey, for the sake of entertainment no holds are to be barred.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not as good, or as bad as everyone says...","Moulin Rouge! The only movie I can ever remember seeing with an exclamation point in the title! But that's about the only originality you'll find in this film.Does Moulin Rouge have great musical numbers? Of course! But are they original? Moulin Rouge samples, ""The Sound of Music"", ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""Lady Marmelade"", ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Like a Virgin"". The list goes on and on. It's more like a Puff Daddy Remix Album than an original motion picture soundtrack.How about the plot? A struggling writer competes with a wealthy man for the love of a beautiful girl. Nothing too original there.So surely it must be the dialog. Yet thinking back, the only phrase that's still ringing in my ears is ""The show must go on!"" A great phrase, but nothing Moulin Rouge can claim to have coined.Is Moulin Rouge a bad movie? Not at all. The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor is excellent, especially when they're singing duets. And while a little neurotic at times, the movie never lags or leaves the viewer bored. Despite all my complaints, the movie was over before I knew it.

Praise,"Apart from the media coverage regarding it's Oscar nominations and successes, I had never seen Moulin Rouge until I bought the DVD. The surrealism of the opening titles and sequence was, for me, totally entrancing. I, at first, doubted the movie during the wild set piece which introduced all the main characters and, ultimately, the character of Satine. After that, I was entranced and fully enjoyed the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Call me old fashioned, but I watch movies as an entertainment and do not look for any hidden messages, mistakes or wish to comment on the director's 'vision'. As entertainment, Moulin Rouge is a visual and very emotional treat.",,Anonymous,Romance
Breathtaking,"A few days before seeing the movie, I watched Baz Luhrmann selling the film in Cannes and all over the States thanks to a BBC documentary. I was sold on the film just from seeing an army of suited guys giving an operatic rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit - and that's not even one per cent of this film's brilliance.In perhaps the bleakest year for big screen offerings, MR is one of the most welcome movies of 2001. A treat to look at, fast, funny, daring, sexy, rousing, exciting - everything a good movie should be. But if the set design and music weren't there, then it would still have worked purely because of the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. They look like they're having fun which is worth the price of admission alone.An instant masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly a beautiful film,"It was brilliant. When it first started, my first reaction was, this wasn't going to work, and then it opened up and just lit up the screen. The two leads were pitch perfect (who knew Nicole could sing). The imaginative director Baz Lurhmann is just fabulous. Creative, smart, and beautifully shot, not many films surprise or please me like this one did.Very few movies succeed as musicals. (CHICAGO was a masterpiece) The love story was sincere, and the chemistry between the actors was genuine. Baz directed an earlier film that I had enjoyed STRICTLY BALLROOM, which was a wonderful film and my first introduction to his works) but this one far surpassed any of his works. And so far, he hasn't topped this film. But he's diverse - and I look forward to more films directed by him. 'Romeo and Julie' was well done, but 'Great Gatsby,' though beautifully shot and directed, just was missing a 'heart' and 'Australia' though again, another well made film just feel kind of flat.

where's the love?,"I went into the theater prepared to love Moulin Rounge, as I had been terribly impressed with Luhrman's last roller coaster, Romeo + Juliet. However, there the visual pyrotechnics had been at the disposal of the greatest love story ever told; the plot here is, well, NOT the greatest love story ever told.  The whole things starts off too silly to take seriously, Satine falls for Christian merely because the script requires it (who wouldn't fall in love with Nicole Kidman?), and the fact the story is being told in flashback destroys all tension as to what will happen.  McGregor and Kidman are fine both as actors and singers, but the words spewing out of their mouths are such a bewildering purree of pop culture references the mind can't process everything.I recommend the film for Luhrman's dazzling visuals and the fine work by the actors (particularly Jim Broadbent, who should get an Oscar nomination), but the writing keeps it from being as good as it could have been.  My rating is a 6 (actually, it's close to a 7 but since it is averaging over 8 I feel I need to knock it down a notch).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A Dazzling Film That Can Irritate Or Amaze, Entertain or Repel","By reading all the varied opinions of the effect this film has on viewers, one can easily deduce it's power to attract or repel, depending on the viewer's cultural background--do you want a film that pushes the envelope or a more traditional take, well-made but linear? Moulin Rouge is in no way traditional, and therein lies it's strength for many viewers, perhaps especially for those raised on television commercials and the toys of instant communication, where a frequent change of focus is stimulating rather than irritating.As with Director Luhrmann's recent Gatsby film, the style here is the primary substance, a delirious mix of color, sound and attitude in brilliant color that never lets a moment go by without a camera zoom or background flourish; the first time I watched this strange amalgam of red and gold curtained style, I was ready for a Tylenol, mainly because I wanted some sort of coherent plot, some feeling to hang on to--every time Luhrmann hooks the viewer into an emotional moment, he whips it into something else entirely, like throwing 237 vivid MTV shorts into a blender and churning it on crumble: the second time I watched it merely for the sensual thrills (as the plot is high-school simple) and enjoyed the ride.There is little doubt that Luhrmann is able to make a dazzling film, but whether he delivers any kind of depth in human relationships or feeling is another matter entirely.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

an audatious statement...,"here it is... you ready for it?This will be the best movie of the year.I'm making that statement now and unless something truly amazing comes out, this is the winner.  It is an innovative movie and deserves a place in history.  Never before, not in the days of Ken Russell or even Stanley Kubrik has a movie been so geared to evoke emotions from an audience.  Every frame, every jump-cut, every look, note, word, and movement has intention purpose and it all succeeds gorgeously.Luhrman makes wonderful use of cultural standard songs from the ye old ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend"" and ""Sound of Music""  to classics like ""all you need is love"" and ""Lady Marmalade"" to the new songs like ""Smells like Teen Spirit"".  The plot is borrowed (La Traviata), as are the ideals (La Boheme, or Rent if you must), the drum beats synthesized, the whole movie is built on the talent of past creative minds.  This movie should seem false, all glitz and glamour but no substance, but that is not so.  The material is arranged so beautifully and carried out with a marvelous abandon by all the creative minds.  The words are so corny, the acting so over the top, the music so familiar and ""traditional"", but at no time does it ever pretend.  It never makes you forget that you are in a theatre watching a movie, yet it sweeps you off your feet like no other movie in the history of movies.  Not Braveheart, nor Lawrence of Arabia, nor Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, (certainly not Titanic or Shakespeare in Love) have the romantic sweep of this movie.  It overwhelms you with it's reckless romanticism that one can't help but be swept up and away, riding Luhrman's wave until the final frame.I don't care if this movie wins Oscars, frankly no movie that deserves the oscars gets them (Quills, State and Main, High Fidelity, Magnolia) and even if they do, they don't get enough (American Beauty deserved at least 8, so did Crouching Tiger)  but at this juncture, I hope that it at least is nominated for Best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor (for Broadbent mostly, but Leguizamo, Roxburgh, and Jacek Koman all deserve recognition), director, editing, cinematography, art direction, costumes, original song, and perhaps (if there was enough original material) score.

Then, you get to see the bright colors of the Moulin Rouge and the images (if not the songs) you won't be able to shake for weeks.

Anyways, for those of you who have not seen it because you heard from someone that it was bad, be bold and go out and rented. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a few dollars at Blockbuster.

Ladies and gentlemen: the future,"In the category of how about that' : the most technically advanced film in some time is set in 1899. Baz Luhrmann's purpose is to capture the energy and spirit of that time period, portraying the Moulin Rouge as the Ultimate Party of that or any day. The belief is that back then people were less inhibited, less guarded than now. A slight disappointment is that there is only one scene showing the club in all its wanton glory. Shortly after, it's converted into a theater for the ""Spectacular Spectacular."" The first club scene is milked for all it's worth, though. This is electric, eye-popping cinema that really pulls you into the story. It would have been tough to top.The story isn't the most imaginative ever, but sticks to the format of the musical romance out of necessity. The film works so well because the story is so simple. Anything more complex would be lost in the kinetic pace of the visuals. ""Moulin Rouge"" is really like a roller coaster: one second you're moving slow and easy, the next you're blasted forward a hundred miles an hour.Even if another director could have thought up some of the visual ideas Luhrmann comes up with, they'd likely dismiss them as impossible to pull off. The film is like nothing you've ever seen before and yet, oddly familiar at the same time.  Luhrmann seems determined to give you something cool to look at every second. You're literally afraid to blink for fear of missing the slightest thing. The super zoom' is a marvel to watch, the shot that starts miles away from its target, then pulls you forward at light speed until you're right on top of it. But this isn't all just computer wizardry. It's how the director, for instance, will use two different color filters in one shot, or adds energy to a scene by editing together shots filmed at different speeds. Astonishing.I'm an Oscar junkie so I'm always looking out for films that will tempt the almighty Academy. Certainly the best film of the year so far, I could see ""Moulin Rouge"" nearly running the table: Sound, visual effects, cinematography, editing, directing, original song for ""Come What May,"" acting for Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo (who somehow plays a dwarf). An original score nomination would be a toughie, as Luhrmann pieces this one together from thirty or so classic songs from several genres, re-imagining them in the context of this story. I'll probably be proven wrong as the inevitable crop of quality movies enter the fold beginning in August. One thing is sure, though: ""Moulin Rouge"" will not be forgotten.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Highly overrated, but still good.","After such supermovies this year, like 'Shrek' and 'le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' (Amelie from Montmatre), claiming that this nice but decent movie is the years best one sounds simply absurd in my ears. I have to admit that this movie not even succeeded to be my favorite of the week !No question, the singing is okay, dialogue is good, and there are quite some nice jokes in it. But the movie does basically nothing but bathing the watcher in cliche, telling him or her such well hidden secrets such as 'there is nothing more important than love'. I really often felt quite bored by that.And the environment embarrassed me. The Moulin Rouge is actually nothing but a brothel in Paris ! A place where rich old men buy poor young girls. A prison. A shame for mankind. Whatever. But in the movie, it is treated with a glory as if it would be a kings palace !Too, many story parts couldn't raise my interest at all. The whole part with the jealously could, if at all, make me laugh. Whats the point there ? The man should have known that he is fallen into a whore ! What did he expect ? That she immediately transforms into an angel now ?In the end, 'Moulin Rouge' is nothing but a female counterpart to 'Fast and Furious'. Instead of action you get song and dance, and instead of coolness and freedom you get romance. But I liked the far more realistic characters from 'Fast and Furious' more than these boring stereotypes from 'Moulin Rouge'.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beauty. Truth. Freedom. Love. It's all there.,"It could have so easily gone wrong, this film. Musicals aren't made anymore for a reason. That reason is many people, like me, feel they're kind of silly. People don't dance to settle arguments, they don't break into singing just because they're happy and even when they do they're usually so drunk you can't understand a word they're 'singing'. And before you disagree, just think of that ill-conceived Titanic musical (for krissake). But that's not the only reason this could have gone very, very wrong. Having actors sing is about as good an idea as having singers act, especially considering Ewan McGregor's casting (anyone remember A Life Less Ordinary's sing-and-dance routine?). And then there's a completely unhinged madman director like Baz Luhrman. It could indeed have been awful. What it is however, is the most innovative, spectacular, gripping and beautiful film this year.Luhrmann continues what he had already done in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, which is combining the commercial (using modern music and a surprisingly heavy dose of comedy) with the artistic (the heavily theatrical stylings and loaded emotional content). Moulin Rouge! (it really deserves the exclamation mark) is most definitely a pop-opera. Technically, this is the crossbreed between unhinged and brilliant. With CG-rollercoaster shots through Paris, amazing production design and about as much edits you can fit into a two-hour film without driving your audience fully insane this is a visual feast every second of its running time. Even topnotch stylists like Ridley Scott don't come close.Sound however is not forgotten (it is a real musical, you know). Luhrmann uses many different types of music and has everything from Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend to Material Girl to Smells Like Teen Spirit to FatBoy Slim's loose interpretation of the cancan thrown into the first 15 minutes or so. Of course, they're all reworkings of the original songs, but they're both so recognisable and different I doubt any fans of the originals have a right to be insulted. With such a wide variety of music, the movie's bound to have both high- and lowlights, my personal favourite being a tango-like version of Roxanne. I don't really dislike a single song, although I could have done without one of the film's many love ballads by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Not that's it's their fault, really. McGregor shows himself a talented singer and Kidman is truly spectacular. The same goes for their acting. Jim Broadbent is fine but I did think John Leguizamo could have been better. Special kudos go to Richard Roxburgh, who is absolutely hilarious as the movie's villainous Duke.So, with so much madly OTT style it really can't be expected to have any substance, right? Wrong. Moulin Rouge! may be more of  triumph of moviemaking than it is of screenwriting, it's definitely not as empty as certain critics would have you believe. It's basic premise is simple enough (it simply combines most great old plays about beauty, truth, freedom and above all love) but it's filled with emotions that seem cliches but are brought with such compelling honestly you can't help (or at least I couldn't, which, for someone who usually prefers cynicism above optimism and intelligence above emotion, is quite surprising) but be swept away be it. No, it won't exactly keep you talking about the relationship between art and real-life as portrayed so vividly on screen. In fact, I doubt it will keep you talking at all, but Moulin Rouge! is a film to experience, not to dissect.In short, Moulin Rouge! is a one of those once-a-year type films, which re-establishes your faith in the belief that Hollywood money can be used to create something utterly unique and astoundingly beautiful. The kind of film you hope won't be insulted by the Academy (but you know probably will).Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visually spectacular,"Well, this one really was an assault on the senses. Your eyes and ears will be overwhelmed, especially at the start of this well crafted tale.I enjoyed one of this director's previous works (Strictly Ballroom) and was underwhelmed by Romeo+Juliet, so went into this with a fairly open mind.Quite frankly the story was ho-hum, but the outstanding performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor more than made up for it. Some will find the very 20th century soundtrack in this 1900-set film irritating, but I found it most amusing (especially the Elephant Love Medley and the fantastic rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"")And a cameo by Kylie Minogue!

Beautiful....but if only...,"When i first saw this film on its initial release i was stunned at its energy and sheer visual accomplishment..now having watched it many many times..i still wish it would slow down at times as the rapid and spasmodic editing gets a little wearing at times..the tango scene..whilst powerful..is so quickly edited that you find it hard to see the dancing..and to feel the acting from both nicole and ewan..but only a few minor moans against an otherwise beautiful and unique film.Whilst Chicago has its merits by being rather ""old school"" musical in its presentation..Moulin Rouge is a musical on absinthe!..Fabulous performances all round..particularly Nicole Kidman..and Jim Broadbent.. it maybe an acquired taste as a film..but like absinthe..once tried never forgotten..one minor extra quip..note to baz luhrmann..as satine's signature song in the film is ""one day i'll fly away""..why at the end of the film,didnt christian release satine's bird from its cage hanging outside his blacony!?..maybe im too soft..but the sight of that little bird..with nicoles's song gently playing beneath being released into the paris skyline at sunset would have made this already romantic old heart bawl my eyes!..just an idea..other than that..fab film!",,Anonymous,Romance
Simply the MOST Beautiful Film I have ever SEEN!!!,"Honestly. I literally had to be dragged into this film kicking and screaming. I knew it had to be the worst movie ever made and I would not in a million years pay to see such tripe. My wife insisted and alas I gave in. Maybe only to keep her quiet.2 Hours 20 minutes Later......Moulin Rouge is an exquisite, tearjerking, mayhem filled Extravaganza. Quite Possibly the best film I have ever seen. I was so glad my wife forced me into that theater, and I pity anyone who doesn't see it in a split minute.Albeit the love story within the love story has been DONE to death but who cares. This is certainly the most original film I have had the pleasure of viewing in a long while. The Performances were top notch besides Nicole Kidman who seemed to be in a daze for most of the film, But Ewan McGregor knocks your socks right off!!!

You really need disk 2,"The movie is very good. No doubt about that. But the editing is too fast for me. Take for example the wonderful tango sequence. In my opinion that wonderful sequence is so much over-edited that it looses most of its impact. On disk too (DVD version) you can see the sequence as it should have looked. This goes for some other sequences too. The cutting is so fast, that one can hardly see what happens and many shots get lost in that way. That really is a pity. That is my criticism. The story, the music and the acting are first class. Nicole Kidman, who has impressed me since ""Bangkok Hilton"", is better than ever. The costumes and sets are fantastic. (Everything was filmed in Australia; the crew did not even see Paris!). One can hardly believe this.I have to see this movie again and maybe yet another time until I think I have really seen everything. But I don't mind. It is a feast for the eye.I would never have given an Oscar for the editing, however, but I have started with that criticism already. With a bit more restrained editing I would have given 10/10, now it is ""just"" 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Erm, not bad, not keen on Nicole though","This has got to be a film you either love or hate.  I went in there thinking it would be great and fantastic (my boyfriend went in thinking he would hate it).  I came out cold and he came out jumping for joy.  I knew I was hating it as soon as I started looking at my watch.  If I love a film I don't care about the time, but I was clock watching.  I didn't enjoy the start of it. Everyone was OTT.  It was everywhere.  I understand that it was supposed to be a crazy time.  It did my head in.  One could argue, it is a musical and it is a theatrical piece.  Bobbins!  It still was trying too hard at the start.  Got to say that Nicole made a good entrance, but for some one with Consumption, she had a good set of lungs on her and looked well.  As if! Do you know, but when I was little I always thought that Consumption was something that people who ate too much food got.  Anyway, that aside.  I like how they did new songs in the old setting, but I hated how they kept enveloping different songs into each other.  And (perhaps it's because I'm a female and it is the law that females end up hating female leads if they are very beautiful), but I felt no sympathy for Nicole's Satine.  I just couldn't wait for her to die.  She was a completely cold character that was not sold on me at all.  I thought that John Leguzi-whats-his-face was fab at Toulouse Lautrec and the Narcoleptic was a great part also.  I preferred Romeo+Juliette and Strictly Ballroom.  They wiped the floor with this film. Perhaps it's just me not ""getting"" it, but it was not the best film I saw this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One colossal little love story.,"The vivid, vibrant, highly graphic strokes and style of French impressionist Toulouse-Lautrec was inspired by the colorful night life of the Montmartre district of Paris -- the circuses, the brothels(!), but notably the Moulin Rouge cabaret which he frequented often and became a routine host to an elite, partygoing bunch of artistic intellects and deviants.  Were he alive today, he could very well have been reinspired by this ambitious recreation of the Moulin Rouge 100 years later.  A mammoth, toyingly libidinous piece of escapism to be certain, the painter would simply revel in the outre, over-the-top, visually assaultive mind of its creator writer/director Baz Luhrmann.I, too, was quite bowled over by this ""everything but the kitchen sink"" extravaganza, although not always as ecstatically as I would have wanted to be, but certainly enough to appreciate the intentions of this masterful deluge of gaudy Gallic grandeur circa 1899.Refreshingly original (the previews had me fooled), what did NOT race through my categorical mind while experiencing this film!  In its initial stage, the love story seemed to borrow its concept directly from Christopher Isherwood's ""Berlin Stories,"" specifically the Sally Bowles ""Cabaret""-inspired chapter in which a naive, struggling writer recalls (via his typewriter) his doomed love affair with a capricious entertainer who got caught up in the phony glitz and decadent glamour around her.  But from then on, it was anybody's guess.  A potpourri of other musical shows and films flashed through my mind --from the typical (Jose Ferrer's ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Can-Can,"" ""Les Girls,"" ""An American in Paris"") to the more imaginative and surreal (""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Fellini Satyricon,"" Fosse's ""All That Jazz,"" the phantasmagorical ""Yellow Submarine"", anything Gilbert & Sullivan-ish, and Disney's ""Aladdin"").  Don't even ask me why on some of these.Nicole Kidman's Satine could have easily been based on the life of the indelible French star Renee Adoree, a one-time circus performer who became a Folies Bergere dancer.  She subsequently was ushered to Hollywood and illuminated one classic love story, ""The Big Parade"" with John Gilbert, that remains a silent screen treasure.  A frail beauty, Renee died in her mid-30s of tuberculosis/consumption.Once the incessant battering by the camera's eye took a breather and I was allowed to actually focus on something tangible -- like the love story -- I found the enticing, highly photogenic Kidman, coupled with Ewan McGregor's honest-guy Christian, to be quite affecting as a pair, even moving.  And that wasn't easy.  The visual bombardment and gimmicky use of modern songs constantly threaten to isolate the viewer from the film's emotional core. Fortunately, it did not succeed.Speaking of, the use of contemporary pop and classic rock songs worked better at the beginning when it was a novelty but, of course, the pattern eventually wore out its welcome as I started spending my time ingenously thinking about what next classic hit should be used for the present scene -- much like the so-so musical ""Mamma Mia!"" wherein a series of Abba songs are thrown together (very weakly) to create a ridiculous storyline.  I thought the ""Material Girl"" number (despite the engaging presence of Jim Broadbent's bombastic impresario, Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh's oily villain, the Duke of Worchester) was stretching a potential good idea too far.  However, Kidman's breathy song stylings and, especially, McGregor's sturdy pop tenor handled the love songs quite effectively.As for the handling of simple little love stories, however, I sincerely hope Luhrmann doesn't get any ideas by setting his sights on a remake of ""The Fantasticks.""  I don't think the fragile little story could take it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Dazzling!!!,"Moulin Rouge is a Diamond among gems. This movie stands out as a brilliant piece of film. It has it all...spectacular imagery, a wonderful story, sensational performances and an amazing musical score. I was extremely impressed by this film, considering I wasn't even going to see it. The movie is beautiful. It has brilliant colour, amazing costumes and is just a wonderful movie to watch. The sets are very well done and I applaud the performances of all involved. John Leguizmo as Talouse Latrec is incredible, taking nothing away from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor who are magnificent in their roles. I really found the addition of modern music, set in the early 1900's quite an innovation and loved the work that went into these numbers to weave them seamlessly into the film. This film has a vison and it simply fulfills it to a brilliant conclusion. I have not seen a film this good in a long time and whole heartedly recommend it to all. It is also has humour that adds to its charm. I hope to see this film recognized at the next Oscar Ceremonies. It truly is a wonderfully well done piece of movie making and I cannot say enough good things about it! A solid 10 on my list...Moulin Rouge is a must see movie for all!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Eye Candy, Fair Movie","Moulin Rouge is a frustrating movie for me.  There is so much there that is very good to excellent, but it is dragged down by a script that fails in all the wrong places.This movie is a treat for the eyes.  The sets are vibrant and original, bursting with light and energy.  The camera flies over them like an acrobat on his/her eighth espresso; jumping, spinning, and dancing to capture the frantic action.  The use of lighting, not just to illuminate, but to define structures and action is wonderful.  This movie is indeed set in a fairyland, albeit a corrupt one.The costumes are totally over the top.  Whoever designed and made them must have had a wonderful time.  They are a near perfect expression of the sophisticated and decadent world portrayed here, the 19th century equivalent of disco.Led by Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge, and John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec, the cast turn in performances that are at the very least good.  Broadbent holds this movie together as the satyr-like Zidler, a man for whom no pleasure is to be denied.  Leguizamo takes his Lautrec to the edge of zaniness while keeping him border line believable. Nicole Kidman shines as Satine.  She goes from hardened prostitute to lover, capturing at least my heart along the way.  Ewan McGregor delivers a wonderful tragic performance as the man who's love transforms Satine.Unfortunately, all of this is fatally compromised by a script that is indecisive at all the wrong times.  It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, a love story, or a tragedy.  The result are scenes that inject laughs at all the wrong times, drop tear jerking moments into the action without motivation, and generally ruin what could have been a transcendent movie experience.  The use of existing songs is handled poorly, all to often taking lines from several songs to create a muddled and confusing whole. While there are exceptions to this (especially the Police's ""Roxanne""), this is the general rule.  I was also surprised to discover that cast members did their own singing, the lip synching was terrible.All of this is really too bad, because Moulin Rouge had the potential to be one of the great movie musicals of all time.  But it just doesn't make the grade.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

From the first ten minutes it was downhill and it kept going downhill. Everything but the kitchen sink - from Nature Boy to Camille. Nothing original anywhere.

"Stunning visual, great music and acting","This movie takes a huge risk, with over-the-top melodrama, dancing and extravagant sets, but it works because the acting is strong and the music is great. There is a scene where they incorporate the song ""Roxanne"" as a tango with a huge ballroom full of dancers, while cutting back to a private scene where a courtesan is deciding whether to sell herself, and it's visually stunning with the song used to great effect. This was unlike any movie I've ever seen, in some senses a classic musical but unlike others because it mixes so many styles of music. The actors and the director should all be commended for putting themselves out there and making this work, at least for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Ultimate Post Modern Experience,"If someone asked me to sum up the essence of ""Moulin Rouge"" in one sentence, I would have to say, ""an ultimate cliche with extraordinary originality.""  I realize this is a contradiction, but what wasn't about this film? Outside of ""My Fair Lady"" I have never been able to stomach a musical, so when I went to see ""Moulin Rouge"" I was expecting to go to laugh at it. Strangely enough, I consistently found myself laughing with the film rather than at it (as well as crying). Every time a new scene emerged I thought, ""here's my chance to scoff,"" but the film was able to pull me into the other direction EVERY TIME. If anyone wants to know what Post Modern is: this is it.  This film took pop culture and made it art...how is that possible? I'm still trying to figure it out.The film, first of all, cannibalizes itself. It's a story about a man writing a play based on the story as it unfolds, and he is writing out the story after the fact. So it's a story within a story within a story. But it is never confusing, surprisingly enough.  Secondly, there is a romance. How does one make a movie about a romance of this nature--very cliche--and pull it off? Ask the director and writer of the film and you'll find out.  I still can't believe I liked the romantic aspect, but I did. Thirdly, the film is a mixture of genres I haven't seen since ""Blade Runner"" (although I wouldn't compare the two)--a musical, comedy, tragedy, fairy tale, with some hints of film noir. Fourthly, the film, I don't think, has any original score; rather, it uses a mixture of music from the last thirty years--some so unlikely to be put together that one has to check themselves to make sure they are really hearing the song(s) they are hearing. What I find interesting about the score is that Kidman can sing ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" while the men below sing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" both in their original tunes, and they work together as if it was all the same song. And fifthly, the movie is obviously a parody of musicals (and parodies are almost impossible to pull of these days without being banal), which is why the mixture of music, the love story, etc. can be well received without indignant guffaws.Well, there were a couple of people who did guffaw and snicker...but they were sixteen year-old teenage girls with their boyfriends who went to go see the movie because of the Madame Marmalade video on MTV--they wouldn't know parody if Christina Aguilara told them personally. And many have been asking if McGregor and Kidman were lip syncing. Actually, no. Everyone in the film sang their own music and did it live (of course, I'm sure there was some ""fiddling"" around with the sound quality).Anyone with intelligence could see ""Moulin Rouge"" for what it is: a great film. Over the top? Yes. Silly? Yes. Contradictory? Yes. But strangely enough, it all works because it knows it is all of those things and plays off of them. I walked out of that movie thoroughly surprised at my respect for it. It was worth every dollar I spent and I'll spend it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Music! Dance! Costumes! Melodrama!,"A young Scottish author (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris right before the turn of the century to join the Bohemian movement. He's there to write about love, the only problem being that he's never been in love. Luckily, a group of actors recruit him as their new writer and he gets to meet Satine (Nicole Kidman), the Sparkling Diamond of the infamous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Unfortunately, the budding attraction between these two is bad for business as a very wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is also interested in Satine's, ahem, satins.What Moulin Rouge! does better than pretty much any other film I've ever seen is spectacle. Everything this movie does is gargantuan. Everyone is acting, emoting, always moving, but always in-character. These people are writers, can-can dancers, courtesans, low-life actors. It makes sense that their whole life is one humongous act where it makes perfect, logic sense for someone to burst into a song right out of nowhere. I especially love the scene where the Duke is about to discover the plot, but everyone, without even knowing one another, is able to pull the wool over his eyes with a quickly spun yarn conveyed through glances and fast-talking. That's how in tune with one another these people are.McGregor and Kidman are also very good in their roles and have some genuine chemistry. Sure it's drowned in cheese, it takes them about five minutes to fall in love and the romance is mainly there to be the romance. I don't really think they really get to know one another. But sometimes that can be forgiven if the movie can pull of the mood and the style correctly. And Moulin Rouge! definitely does.The production values are also amazing. The costumes, the music, the whole grandeur. It's also shot with a very distinctive style from the actual curtain opening start to the faded browns of Christian's sorrow to the lusciously vibrant colours of the cabaret. A film many people see solely for the visuals. They're that good.And yeah, it has its flaws. Its many, many, many flaws. The editing is way too fast, making you unable to focus on anything, especially in the beginning until you get used to it. Though, to the film's credit, it slows down a bit after a while. The story is kind of clichéd and the ending twist is rather uncomfortable from the characters' point of view if you think about it too much. Roxburgh's Duke is also completely over the top, so much so that he would stand out in a children's morning cartoon. It's very much intentional and kind of fits in the whole mood of the film, but he's still something of an oddity among the character cast.But, Moulin Rouge! is one of those guilty pleasure movies where you really don't want to change any of the flaws (with the exception of editing speed in my case) because to change them would be to take something away from the experience. It's definitely not for anyone, but personally I appreciate it for what it is and will definitely pop it in everyone now and then for the rest of my life. Just because it is such a unique piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie musical,"Moulin Rouge! has one of the most simple stories I know but it comes in the most beautiful package I can imagine. Almost nothing is new in the movie, but all that old stuff together is one of the most original things I have seen.We have a forbidden love packed in a movie musical. All the songs used sound familiar but totally new at the same time. We hear a beautiful version of Your Song from Elton John and a refreshing version of Roxanne from The Police. We hear so much more songs we recognize but don't know. The only original song, Come What May, is a beautiful one as well. The actors all do their own singing. It is terrific.Sometimes the screen seems hectic, but it is all in favor of the atmosphere of the movie. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and great in her part as Satine, the courtisane who falls in love with the poor writer. Ewan McGregor is that writer and he as well does a tremendous job. I loved the supporting roles: John Leguizamo as Toulouse, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke who wants Satine because he pays for the new play they will do in the Moulin Rouge, and especially Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, the boss of the Moulin Rouge.The story doesn't matter very much, it is the way the whole movie is brought to us. In living colors, with bright actors, terrific settings and costumes, perfect voices for beautiful songs, a sharp cinematography, all put together by a very good director, Baz Luhrmann. The movie musical is back and if you need some evidence, watch Moulin Rouge! 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best movie ever made.,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time. Although I'm a bigtime horror freak as you can tell from feed. Baz Luhrmann's ultimate cinematic masterpiece is unlike anything that's ever been or will be released.

Unfortunately she's been promised to the Duke whose going to turn the club into a theater and Satine into a famous actress. Against all odds they pursue their romance with the villainous Duke moving in. The movie is wonderfully romantic, magical and infinitely creative. There is no other cinematic experience like this. As soon as it begins you are transported to a timeless, inspired world of endless potential and magic. Everything about this film is perfect, it's not for everyone but if you go in with an open mind and heart you may find yourself having one of the best experiences of your life. <3Budget: $52M

You could say, the Monkees on acid would be a fair description.The slapstick comedy was boring, the acting abysmal, the plot made no sense, the sets looked like a second rate Disney animated film.  Let's see, take a compilation album commercial for pop love songs, add a Laurel & Hardy Film, a high school production of Camille, the Blair Witch cameraman, ""It's a small world"" Disney Theme Park Ride, throw it in a blender, crank up the speed and add some acid.

Moulin Rouge,"""Christian"" (Ewan McGregor) is a struggling writer living a stone's throw from the legendary Moulin Rouge in Paris. He cuts quite a solitary figure until he is befriended by ""Toulouse-Lautrec"" (the scene stealing John Leguizamo) and introduced to the hedonism of the club run by ""Zidler"" (Jim Broadbent) that features it's superstar turn ""Satine"" (Nicole Kidman). He is besotted, he must meet her in her blue elephant apartment and love must follow, surely? Well, maybe, but ""Zidler"" has other plans on behalf of the seedy ""Duke"" (Richard Roxburgh) who has determined to make her his. ""Christian"" now finds himself inspired, and sets about writing his ""Spectacular Spectacular"" piece of musical theatre that thinly disguises the burgeoning romance between the pair whilst hopefully throwing the ""Duke"" off the scent. These things are expensive, though, so the venal ""Zidler"" ends up having to do a deal with the devil to pay the bill - and that leaves everyone exposed to the lasciviousness of the amorous aristocrat. We also learn that, not unusual for the late 19th century, ""Satine"" isn't so well and so time might not be much of an ally for them, either. Can they thwart the lecherous ""Duke"" and save their love? Though I didn't really love McGregor's rather flat singing so much, the rest of this is an highly entertaining romp through a tawdry Parisian society riddled with sexiness, vibrancy and just a little hint of evil. Broadbent is in his element as the master of ceremonies who'd have looked just as impressive hosting a circus - and indeed it's a circus that his boozed up and horny guests want every night as the original sex-club comes alive with colour, dancing and champagne. The soundtrack works really well using just about everyone from Rufus Wainwright to Elton John via Broadway and T-Rex - even Kylie manages a tinker-bell of a cameo. The film looks great, with huge attention to the detail of the look; the costumes and the set - with the perilously poised pachyderm overhead. There's heaps of chemistry between McGregor and a very natural looking Kidman and two hours just flies by. It's one of those films that positively wallows on the big screen and each time I see it, I seem to get just a little bit more from the humour and the pathos in the writing. Original, quirky, zany and good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It does a nice job of representing the world as a stage, but it looks too much like an MTV music video.  Please note that this does NOT hurt the film - it simply makes it difficult to watch - like watching the epilepsy enducing visuals of Pokemon.  Just be warned.The songs are fun - that's what I really enjoyed about this film.  What better way to update the movie musical than by using POPULAR songs?  And the way the film incorporates the songs really works.  It's humorous and uplifting to hear them in the context of the story.  (The Beatles' ""All You Need is Love."" is a subtle, yet strong example.)Ah, but now I reach the story . . .GAG!  PUKE!  WTF!!!!!*cough* *cough* Excuse me . . . Okay, I'm better now. :)Disney seriously comes up with more original and complex storylines than this (Bambi, The Lion King, etc).  But lest I forget the dialogue! Whoo-boy!  CLICHE is the word of the day!Anyhoo, like Batman, this film is all about the visuals (and the music) so it's best to watch it looking and listening for those things.  Just cover your ears when they're not singing, folks.  :)  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and turn off the television, leave the movie theatre, and take your next vacation to Paris to feast your eyes on the one and only Moulin Rouge!P.S. For a better modern musical, check out Dancer in the Dark.  It's definately MORE experimental and MORE creative in its experimentation than Moulin Rouge.  And guess what?  The dialogue's intelligent.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor Pathetic Critics,"If you found Moulin Rouge unlikeable you are either: a) an idiot b) have no appreciation for a fantastic work of art c) an idiot or d) obviously missed the bigger picture of what the film was about.All of you who are sitting there criticizing the film because it has 'songs mixed together' or find the 'plot laughable' truly have not looked beneath the surface of the film. The meaning and messages that Luhrman presents are so significant and important in the world today that it would be stupid to dismiss them.The film is not just about Love and Lost (which I'm sure many of you found corny anyway) but it is also about how giving one's heart and soul to a single purpose will eventually mean overcoming everything. this is not just with Love but with all quests. Although there is loss along the way, eventually the truth really will set you free.The fact that Lurhman teamed the fantastic plot with such a great set up including the music, the cast, the set - hell the whole concept is just fantastic - makes it even more Spectacular.I truly think all of you so called 'critics' out there need to sit down and watch the movie again and not have such a closed mind about it. Be open to the underlying meanings and who knows - you might even learn something about what it takes to make a fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film should down in history as the complete example of form over substance.,"This film should down in history as the complete example of form over substance.   Although interesting to watch why someone wasted 4 years of his or her life on this film is a mystery.  Baz keeps on about the story when of cause there isn't one - I suppose if he says it often enough he'll convince himself that there was one.  One of his collaborators (or should that be partners in crime) said that the 'story' was decided by the songs that they could licence.Nicole Kidman looked just like Cyble Shepard from some musical she made in the 70's and the 'baddie' Richard Roxburgh was doing a Tim Brooke-Taylor impersonation (from the 'Goodies' and Willie Wonker) Jim Broadbent looked like the Gilbert character from Topsy-Turvy and the great McGregor just looked like he hadn't a clue why he had agreed to do the film.Upon saying that - the sets and costumes were great - but the cinematography... who can tell - as far as I could see there wasn't a shot longer than 20 seconds in a 2-hour film.  That is even worse than that Bruce Willis thing about the asteroid.  As for the F/x you can be the judge.  I've seen better on a pop video - in fact that's what is, a 2-hour pop video.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a yawn...,"A yawn, I've seen this movie twice. The first time, I didn't like it. The second time I went to see if I could actually like it. Turns out I disliked it more the second time.People ask me if it's because it's not my kind of movie. I do prefer certain types of movies (american beauty, america psycho, fight club... that kind.)but I can watch any kind. I just tend to like drama/thriller.Moulin Rouge is a drama?! How? The only dramatic sequence I can remember is when the narcoleptic is singing Roxanne which is also the same scene when Satine is at dinner with the Duke. That's the only drama. That was one of my favorite scenes... Along when they're singing/explaining to the Duke what the play, Spectacular Spectacular is about... Cute, fun, bouncy scene.The plot was WEAK. Boy meets girl, the two fall in love... This is a problem, though, because the girl just happens to be unwillingly attached to someone else. How many times has this been done? With a slight different twist? It's BORING.There were NO likable characters besides Christian. Odd for me, because I tend to like the 'bad guys' and the 'villains'. Christian was the complete opposite. He was innocent. He was sweet. And McGregor can SING. I've never seen any of his movies besides this. He put on a great performance in this ho-hum movie. I will definitely be checking out some of his other work.All in all, this movie was below mediocre. 2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tired,"I'm tired...I really am. It's late. The star are shining on the sky, and despite the terrible disaster that took place today, life goes on...does the show go on? That's a question for which the current answer is, and will probably continue to be for some time: yes, it does.I read somewhere that Moulin Rouge was the kind of movie which one either loved or hated. I can't agree with this fact, as I would fall in between. It's hard for me to say it was an excellent movie and I certainly can not say it was a terrible one. I guess it usually depends on what you want to see.An everlasting subject: love. Everlasting, but rarely changing any more. Some stereotypes have been set and they are repeated. You can not expect of this movie to stun you with innovative ideas about love, as you can not expect Paul Anderson to do a good movie out of Resident Evil. Sorry there...got carried away.   Back to this film. I'd have to say a little confusing...totally lacking originality...sounding good, but not excellent. I know what happens when something sounds good, but not excellent: at first you enjoy it. Might happen the same thing the second and the third time. But then, the inevitable appears...it becomes boring. In the worst case, annoying. That's my opinion about the songs in this movie, and about the movie as a whole. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad...it can simply drive you mad!There's Nicole Kidman...yes, Nicole. I have just seen the movie, so I had little knowledge of her performance(in this movie) at the time of the Academy Awards. I was living under the impression that she would win, but it wasn't so. Sincerely speaking, I agree. I want to point out that I haven't seen the actual winning actress either, but I have my standards and Nicole wasn't good enough. She didn't make me feel the action...and she should've.On the other hand, Ewan was acceptable...but he wasn't anything special either.    Actually, that's where the movie suffered. It didn't really get me connected, despite having a quite simple plot. I personally enjoyed the beginning most, until the story became routine. About love and how love will forever rule...I guess I just couldn't feel this movie. Strange thing to say, but I couldn't. It is worth to see though, because I'm sure others will feel it, and because there are some interesting things in it. The few original ones. I vote for a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Camp musical fun from director Baz Luhrmann,"This musical opens in 1900 with Christian, a writer, working on a script based on his own experiences in Paris in the past year. We then move back a year and see his story. He is a young British writer who has moved to Paris to experience the Bohemian lifestyle; particularly that at the titular Moulin Rouge theatre. He starts writing for a group who are preparing a play. When he goes to the Moulin Rouge he is quickly attracted to courtesan Satine. She has been promised to a wealthy duke but following a misunderstanding mistakes Christian for the duke... by the time the truth is revealed she has fallen for Christian. When they are caught together they explain that they were merely rehearsing the play... a story of love that mirrors their situation. The group works to create the play described, all the time trying to keep the duke in the dark. There is another concern Christian is unaware of; Satine is unwell.If you want a feel of late nineteenth century Paris and the music performed there you are likely to be disappointed; the songs are reworkings of modern songs so expect to hear versions of songs from the likes of Queen, Madonna and Bowie. The musical numbers are impressive with huge numbers of extras as well as our central performers. The story may be cliché but it is effective and provides a good reason for the various musical numbers. The cast does a fine job; most obviously Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as Satine and Christian but also the likes of Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh as theatre owner Howard Zidler and The Duke, amongst others. This certainly won't be for everybody but if you like over-the-top camp it is a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surreal and Chaotic,"""The singing is okay, the spectacle is amazing,"" said ""Broadway"" magazine, and a bizarre and often boring spectacle it is. The spoof of ""The Sound of Music"" is apparent, but one does wonder why it is being done-half serious, half mockery, and overlaid with absurdity. Prepare to have your senses assaulted and your musical assumptions challenged. You've got to know your musical history to appreciate the allusions in this satire. Incorporating a number of anachronistic songs and motifs, this odd spectacle ostensibly set in Paris in 1900 attempts to look at the mystique of the city and the Moulin Rouge nightclub from a new and surreal angle. The special effects are wonderful, but ultimately this film is more bizarre than engaging. If the credits had said ""Directed by Salvadore Dali"" I would have believed them. If you have seen every film musical made before this one, the echoes will resonate. otherwise you might just gaze at the screen in confusion.

Film-making at the expense of the narrative.,"I know I'm going against the flow, but ...Having seen Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo and Juliette', I approached `Moulin Rouge!' with some trepidation. I found R & J interesting yet flawed (I felt that the modern setting was unnecessary and sensationalist, and what made the film special was its sheer energy and verve). I was ready to dislike the use of modern songs in MR for similar reasons, but in the end I found that aspect of the film perfectly acceptable and even fitting!However, taken as a whole, I found the film self-indulgent, over-directed, over-edited, and pretentious.There is no doubt that Mr Luhrmann is a very talented film-maker, with highly original and daring ideas. However, I can't help but feel that style should be used to enhance and embellish the narrative, while here the story is saturated with style to such an extent it is virtually suffocated. I think there is quite a moving tragic tale going on underneath the very glossy exterior, but I found it very difficult to get particularly involved as my attention was constantly drawn to yet another directorial device rather than the storyline. The most interesting and entertaining passages were the slower, more gentle ones, which did not involve sudden and disorientating cuts to and fro.I will undoubtedly be accused of being old-fashioned, but I appreciate a film whose story is considered paramount, and where directorial style and skill are used to enhance that story. When the audience is more aware of how a film is put together, I'm afraid the director may be accused of having failed in his task.",,Anonymous,Romance
A musical made right.,"Moulin rouge does a perfect job of mixing a story with music.Ewan has an amazing musical talent and gives his all with very little (noticeable) computer interefearment. Nicole Kidman does an excellent job with Satine with her deception and vulnerability.The contemporary music mixed with the original pieces show an ability to be relatable and traditional while also showing a familiarity that the audience can grasp and cling to.Baz Luhrmann shows an excellent talent with crafting an extremely energetic and wild film.

Great vision!,"This film was yet more proof of Baz Luhrmann's great vision in music and movie-making. His music is so deep, you can't help but be drawn into it. I believe this movie has set a new precedent for musical films. I don't know about the rest of you, but I hope with all of my heart that Baz Luhrmann keeps making films and beautiful (to put it mildly) music. I also hope with all of my heart that someone out there keeps Ewan MacGregor singing. Why did it take so long to get that gorgeous voice and man out there in this kind of role?!?!

Creative Misfire,"What a weird movie.  It's like `The Wizard of OZ' on drugs.  Baz Luhrmann, co-writer and director, and Craig Pearce, co-writer, have created an utterly, decadent fantasy that pushes the envelope of the imagination.  This movie is a testament that there are no boundaries when making a movie these days.  The computer-generated images of the Moulin Rouge and Paris in 1900 are fascinating.  The camera shots that seem to have no seams, zoom through the city, and come to a close-up of an actor are great.However, I can't say I enjoyed `Moulin Rouge' that much.  It just seemed way too busy, and it could have been better without all of the silliness.  The love story that is central in the plot, was, in fact, interesting and touching, but unfortunately there are too many campy distractions.While watching `Moulin Rouge', it reminded me of a couple of movies.  The first that I thought of was 1996's `Romeo + Juliet'.  I later found out found that he co-wrote and directed it as well.  The second I thought of was the Beatles' `Help' because of the playfulness and zaniness of some of the scenes.  So if you liked the style of `Romeo + Juliet', you may enjoy `Moulin Rouge'.The music and songs were good and bad at times.  Luhrmann and Pearce take famous songs and blend them to create some interesting medleys.  Many artists are sampled, from Nirvana to Dolly Parton.  Madonna, the Beatles, and Elton John also have large chunks of songs thrown in.  The combinations are not always great but are original.  My favorite scene in the movie is when Christian (Ewan McGregor) is trying to convince Satine (Nicole Kidman) that they should be lovers.  Christian and Satine sing lyrics from famous love songs, while they are in on top of her elephant-shaped apartment (yes, she lives in an elephant).  They end up singing David Bowie's ""Heroes"" (great song).McGregor is outstanding, as the aptly named, Christian; the poet who falls in love with the most sought after prostitute at the Moulin Rouge.  His singing voice is good, and he handled his dramatic scenes very well.Kidman is Satine; the hooker that falls for the poet and suddenly develops morals (the hooker with the heart of gold).  I have never liked Kidman, and I have a hard time believing that Satine was the most popular prostitute.  I don't see it.  She does sing well, however.  If you are a fan, you should like this new dimension of her.The best performance in the film was by Jim Broadbent, as Harold Zidler, the owner and pimp' of the Moulin Rouge.  He was great.  He reminded me of the wizard in the ""Wizard of OZ"".  He was funny and he sang well.The bottom line is that I am glad I saw this movie, however the craziness and silliness was taken too far for my tastes.  I wish Luhrmann had made a more serious movie that was consistent with the love story.  I can, however, appreciate the creativity and work that went into this movie; it is quite an accomplishment.  I think if you are a fan of Broadway musicals, you should like it.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return""","What a movie!! I have to say i've never liked musicals, but the day i saw this movie it kept me thrilled during the 2 hours it lasts. I thought that it was impossible first to make love songs in the ambient of the Moulin Rouge for the fact that it is a cabaret and ""courtesans"" can't fall in love, but Bazz Luhrman did a great Job directing the movie and placing the songs in the right time to elevate this movie to a DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE.Won't say anything about the plot, because there are others who have already done that, and very well, but i have to talk about the songs, it is a subject apart, it begins with a song of David Bowie performed by John Leguizamo and it gives you the clue it is a romantic movie with a sad ending, and that song is the one that establishes the climate you'll feel later in the movie. Then we have Lady Marmalade performed by.......well we all know who perform that song. the next great moment of songs is when Zidler appears and the whole Moulin Rouge sings and dances by the rhythm of ""the can can"", a really aggressive song with a really modern sound. Then we have the introduction of ""Satine"" (Nicole Kidman) singing ""Sparkling diamonds"" and it shows us a Character that only loves material stuff, she doesn't care about love, thing is going to change when she meets Christian (Ewan McGregor) and he teaches her the meaning and importance of love. Then we begin with the great love songs of this superb movie ""Your song"" , ""One day i'll fly away"" ""The elephant love medley"" and ""Come what may"", what can i say about these songs, they are just too great to say something about them and those songs make you wanna see this movie again and again and again.If we should analyze the outfits and ambient of the movie, it couldn't be better, it is all colorful and filled with energy everywhere (you really see this is Bazz creation). It is everything red and there's a lot of fireworks everywhere, like celebrating love and life.Resuming, this a an experience that no one should miss, though not everybody shares my optimism, i guess they just can't understand it well, because this movie is really a MASTERPIECE, no doubt of that......",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's a pure razzle-dazzle, whiz-bang, spectacular spectacular with so much going on in each frame that your eyes scarcely know where to look. I began to think I was watching what would turn out to be my favorite movie of 2001.But razzle-dazzle can only hide the lack of a plot for so long. 45 minutes into the movie I began to look at my watch. And for the last hour I was reduced to simply hoping the movie would hurry up and end already.Oh, sure. It does have a plot. I guess. Unfortunately the plot is only a sappy love story that we already know the ending to. How do we know the ending? Because we are told it in the opening minute of the movie. Why are we told the ending at the beginning? That's a very good question.Still, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a spectacular looking, well acted bit of razzle-dazzle that almost swept me away. Oh, for a real plot! Oh, for a real villain, instead of the non-threatening Duke who we are supposed to hate and fear! Oh, for an ending that could have kept me guessing!

At Least it was Pretty,"I really did enjoy watching this film, but i would be hesitant to reccomend it to an unsuspecting audience.  The plot was incredibely banal, a golden hearted hooker meets lovelorn poet story.  Which will triumph in the end ""True Love"" or ""Love of Money""?  The suspense might actually get to you, if weren't for the exceedingly effected acting style of the two main characters.  Not to say that all the acting is awful, John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent were fantastic in their supporting roles, as were most of the other minor characters. Once i stopped paying attention to the plot and the lovers, however, i really enjoyed the film.  In addition to Baz Luhrman's eclectic genius, Something must be said for the absolute neon brilliance of Catherine Martin, the production designer (who also did such a fantastic job with Baz's other films, Romeo+Juliet and Strictly Ballroom)as well as the cinematographer Donald McAlpine.  The world they created was absolutely beautiful to watch. Everything visually was stunning to the utmost degree. However, while the gaudy decadence of the set and frantic editing pace appealed to me, it may overwhelm some audience members.  As a rule of thumb, if you don't like fast paced jumpy editing sequences (think MTV or Baz's other big hit Romeo+Juliet), you proboly won't enjoy the visual effects of this film. As a musical i couldn't decide if this made the cut.  Certainely the opening brothel number was fast-paced and exciting, but the majority of the rest of the songs were all sappy love song clips which i thought fell a bit flat. I just didn't feel the excitment of that opening song was ever recaptured throughout the rest of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Visually stunning, otherwise vacant","I really have mixed feelings about this one. It truly is a film like no other I have ever seen. The cinematography is absolutely incredible, no doubt about it; whatever artistic Oscars the film procured were well-deserved. The world that the film creates is stunning and the amazingly free movement of the camera solidifies spatial relations and brings the different locations together into a coherent whole. It really is fantastic work. That said, I didn't like--borderline hated--the film. The vast majority of ""dialogue"" is actually song lyrics (often rehashed) from familiar songs of the past 30 or so years. In this, it can be said that the film is often ""catchy"" and certainly caused the occasional smile, but really has nothing worthwhile to say. The plot would make Walt Disney jealous of its simplicity and really has nothing to add to the traditional ""boy and girl want to be together but something's blocking the way"". Perhaps it could be seen to be making a societal comment in its over-intentional hodge-podge of pre-existent ideas. At any rate, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this formula still brings about success... But it was really irritating hearing the same trite, already-familiar lyrics repeated again and again. It was a musical melodrama pumped with so much false energy that I felt embarrassed for the actors at times and just wished it would stop. The acting of the two main characters was certainly average at best. The fact that Nicole Kidman was lauded for this performance truly makes me ill. But the incidental characters in the film were mostly much more solid and interesting, especially the ""manager"" of Moulin Rouge. I must wrap up: visually it's absolutely stunning and certainly worth watching, but it is emotionally vacant and meaningless.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aesthetics and emotion fused into one,"I'll admit, it's hard for me to be objective about ""Moulin Rouge."" I've loved it since I saw it in the cinema, it was the first DVD I owned, and I still return to it. Every time, Baz Luhrmann's colorful, heartfelt, and sometimes overpowering film-making draws me into the movie's world of beautiful design and high emotion.Yes, the plot is a total cliché--a love triangle between penniless poet Christian, doomed courtesan Satine, and a sneeringly villainous Duke. ""Moulin Rouge"" is intelligent enough to winkingly acknowledge the melodrama at times (it also winks at some iconic bits of pop culture), but irony is not the film's prevailing mood. The actors play many scenes completely straight, speaking the sometimes-trite dialogue so earnestly that you come to believe it after all.And what marvelous performances! It's rare to find a male actor giving a performance as open and pure and vulnerable (and handsomely sung) as Ewan MacGregor's. Nicole Kidman gamely, and skillfully, does everything from low comedy to high tragedy to old-fashioned movie-star glamour. Jim Broadbent, playing the Moulin Rouge's owner Harold Zidler, finds unexpected depth and tenderness in his vulgar and blustering character.In many musicals, the songs are moments of heightened emotion, but are also designed to show off the actors' singing and dancing talent. ""Moulin Rouge,"" on the other hand, emphasizes emotion above all else. Yes, the corps of can-can dancers is excellent, and McGregor and Kidman sing very nicely, but the film-making, and the mood it evokes, is the true star. My favorite sequence, the ""Roxanne"" tango, encapsulates Luhrmann's technique. It's a wickedly clever use of a familiar song, turning it from a catchy, groovy little tune into something boiling over with tension and danger. The film rapidly cuts between the passionate tango dancers, Christian's heartfelt counter-melody, and a fight between Satine and the Duke in the tower, building to a climax where image, sound, and emotion fuse into one.The credo of the Bohemian characters, and of ""Moulin Rouge""'s creators, is ""Truth, beauty, freedom, and love."" I would argue that a fifth item should be added to that list: Art. The whole movie is about how life imitates art and art imitates life; how art can redeem and resurrect us; and most importantly, how art is central to the Bohemian credo. Art is ""fake,"" but it conveys a higher truth; art highlights life's beauty; artistic expression is a kind of freedom; art inspires love.""Moulin Rouge,"" a piece of film-as-art, does all those things.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"AN WILD EXPERIENCE! ORIGINAL and EYE-CATCHING, but not for everyone.","Anyone expecting anything even remotely like the 1952 ""Moulin Rouge"" with Jose Ferrer (see reviews) will be blown away by this. I was. This was closer to something like the Ferrer version meets ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", less the sexual identity confusion so popular with some.First of all, the cinematography and general camera work were daring and effective. Kudos to the director. The art direction was utterly fabulous and almost certain to get an Oscar nomination; the sets, costumes, and general 'look' of the film were original, beautiful, and brilliant.The music was jolting in that much of it was from popular and rock music of the past generation - that in Paris in 1900! Offenbach's ""Can-Can"" was set to words and sung, but not on the floor of the Moulin Rouge club; for that we had ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" done by Nicole Kidman as Satine the club's sensuous star.After the initial surprise at the anachronistic music we learn to adjust to it and ""go with the flow"". The same with the wild, often frenetic direction with over-the-top lighting.The story and characterizations are none too deep: young writer falls in love with the gorgeous star but she is coveted by the rich duke who owns the lease on the club. True love triumphs over obstacles, but eventually tragedy results. (Anyone see ""La Traviata""?). But the plot isn't the point. You want deep character studies rent the 1952 version with Jose Ferrer as Henri Toulose-Lautrec, here played by John Leguizamo, but without even an allusion to his painting prowess.The plot might have ben more interesting had Satine and Henri (called ""Toulose"" in the film, just as in the 1952 version!) the undersized artist had some relationship. The rest of the acting was quite good with Jim Broadbent (see ""Topsy Turvy"") particularly unctious as the club's manager.Definitely RECOMMENDED. Although I know well it is NOT for everyone and there are those who may hate it for the frenzied pace, the music, and an almost surreal feel at time - a singing moon, for instance! But I liked it; I thought it cool!One warning/complaint. I saw this in a Cineplex Odeon theater in NYC. And the second and last reels (total of thirty minutes) were noticeable BLURRY. Bad job, Cineplex Odeon. If anyone else has a complaint just go to their web site and forward it along.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One Of The Greatest Musical Film I've Ever Watch,"Set in 1899 and 1900, Baz Luhrmann's takes on a very strange but interesting decision to fill the musical not only without any original song but a modern song instead with an early 1900s style, from The Beatles, Elton John, Madonna, Queen, and even Nirvana and etc, the movie is also fills with a rich and glorious set, dance, color, and it is feels like a magical places, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give they're best performances both in terms of acting and singing, so do the rest of the cast, this is not only an ordinary musical, it's an epic musical and it's definitely among the greatest Musical i've ever watch, Moulin Rouge! Is fantastic!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I love this beautiful movie....,"Moulin Rouge is an incredible movie, truly ""Spectacular, Spectacular""! The scenery, lighting and costumes are unbelievably beautiful. Then there's the music.......amazing use of contemporary music in 1900 Paris! Nicole & Ewan's voices are wonnnnderful together. Did not know either of them could sing, but both of them have great voices and together they ARE breath-taking. The dance number is haunting - after watching the movie, I find myself singing ""why does my heart cry...."" for days! Also, ""Come What May"" runs through my mind often, too.Nicole is ""drop-dead"" beautiful as Satine. I have always admired her acting. I do believe she is one of the finest actresses there is - she IS ""Sarah Bernhart"" and then some. Not hard to imagine that Christian, the Duke and every other man for miles around would fall in love with her. I enjoyed her (their) humorous touches, too!Ewan, on the other hand, I hadn't much noticed before (I DO now!) He was lovable and adorable as Christian. Many of his facial expressions warmed my heart and/or broke it. He is a marvelous actor as well. He and Nicole are fantastic together - the perfect couple!In view of the ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" production, direction, acting, and music; I am puzzled that the movie was not even more successful in the USA. We are a real ""bohemian"" society and Love is a prevalent, dominant theme in movies, advertising, etc. I guess, in general, we have no taste for the finer things.... Suffice it to say, I absolutely loved it and will continue to watch it over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawed beauty,"I was REALLY looking forward to this. The opening credits only heightened the anticipation and for the first twenty minutes or so it was a magnificent spectacle, but then the film got bogged down in repetitive padding. The musical numbers seemed ten times as long as they needed to be and I started to get both bored and irritated, a mood which carried on to the end credits - a shame, as performances were great and the whole film looked absolutely stunning. But I would rather have had more of a script which did justice to the film rather than the same bloody Elton John song seemingly over and over again. I shall rent it out at a later date, just to enjoy the beauty all over again, but I'll be fast forwarding over a lot of the musical bits......",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Let's do the can-can! for this film!,"Definitely the one of the best romance films of the century. The movie was done so well that it gives off something for teens to realize. Don't let your romance fall flat on it's feet. This movie almost is a guide into your romance. Don't let anyone push you away, and certainly don't let anyone tell you can't have what you want. The movie itself is fantastic. The actors were amazing. Nicole Kidman plays a can-can dancer named Satine and brought up to believe she was only worth what someone would pay for her. So you can understand her line of business.Ewan Mcgregor plays a sad romantic who has never been in love and actually realizes this when he's typing it on his keyboard. So then his friends, well, i'm not sure friends is what he thinks of them, but then pass him off as an English writer and they all went to the Moulin Rouge.Funny enough, Satine mistakes McGreoger for the Duke who is a powerful man who was willing to invest in the Moulin Rouge if he has Satine. Then the movie plays out into where the Duke invests in the show they tried to cover up when he accused Christian of foul play, and turns the Moulin Rouge into a theater. The movie shows fantastic work by Baz Thuriman and Nicole Kidman sparkles. Moulin Rouge shows us everything truth, beauty, freedom, betrayal, suspicion, jealously, and outstanding love.Moulin Rouge is a breathtaking experience and will leave your heart pounding. I highly recommend this to all, especially hopeless romantics.A",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nice music, shame about the plot","I like the songs, the juxtaposition of modern music to the 19th century was often amusing, and overall the musical set pieces are great: it's just a shame they felt they needed to add a plot. Maybe I've just read too many 'how to write a hollywood blockbuster' books, but to call it predictable would be a compliment... nor did I think that Nicole Kidman did particularly well in her role as the love interest.Not a horribly bad movie, not a great one, but it's a shame that the plot didn't live up to the music video interludes... I really liked the first 10-20 minutes, but was looking at my watch by an hour in. I can understand why some of my friends love the move, but it doesn't work as well for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Massive Sensory Overload,"This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen. For one thing, it seems like a weird role for Nicole Kidman to take, not her kind of thing at all. The movie was like a bad acid trip: too many sounds, too many blinding bright colors, and too much camera movement, all assaulting the senses simultaneously. The musical style was from the wrong era for the historical time of the film: too modern for it, so it clashed. It reminded me of the country music I frequently hear at the Chinese buffets in my city. Combine that with a lack of plot, and you have a hideous caricature that attempts to imitate a movie and fails. Very bizarre.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A remarkable experience,"Moulin Rouge is the most visually unique thing I've seen since I don't know when. I watch an awful lot of movies, and I pay attention to things like color and camera work. A lot of people don't. In Moulin Rouge, you can't help it. These aspects grab you by the collar and shake you around for 2 hours. From the bright, vibrant, almost neon nighttime colors when the Bohemian ideals (love, truth, beauty) of Montmarte are celebrated, to the brownish, daytime hues when harsher realities set in, this movie sustains our attention. The images run the range from beautiful (Satine, bathed in blue light) to garish (the owner's appearance, and his tendency to shout loudly and closely in people's faces) to bleak (the entire setting when the plot grows more grim).I am not even a fan of musicals per se. There have been occasional musicals that I have enjoyed, but I am not one to sit down and relish the choreographed movements of the Sharks and Jets. Yet if any non-musical lover has a chance of crossing over, this is it. Moulin Rouge is a musical on speed, a post-modern musical for the new millennium. If anyone can remain unaffected by the Roxanne ""number"" near the end, I would confess astonishment. Its sheer power and fast-paced rhythm carries us along. It's one of the most incredible examples of virtuoso editing I can think of.The movie is thoroughly saturated with song. When no music is being sung, it becomes part of the dialog. Someone should count how many different songs are sung or partially quoted. From Elton John to Rogers and Hammerstein, the movie is a like a collage of music.It ends as quietly as its middle was loud. When the credits began to roll, the movie theater was silent. No one talked or made much noise; it was a response approaching reverence or at least respect.Perhaps Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times said it best. His comment takes into account that Moulin Rouge may have its detractors. But it underscores the film's uniqueness, its coherence as something entirely different:""You can go with it or resist it, be exhilarated or worn out. But forgetting the experience is not one of your options.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a mess,"This is a highly over-rated, strangely beautiful, ultimately chilly mess of a film on whom the talents of several fine actors was wasted.  Mr. Luhrmann has too much money and not enough patience.

The Roxanne Tango is amazing.  See it at your own risk.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wauw!!!!,"I thought I'd seen it all, but that was before Moulin Rouge. Normally I'm not a real musical lover, although I loved Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair, Tommy and a few others, but like JCS, which was a weird musical too, this one also rocked my world. Songs from Madonna to Marilyn Monroe and everything in between, the good actors (I didn't know Nicole Kidman could also sing, is there anything she can't do? and of cause nobody could top Ewan), the beautiful clothes, jewelery, dancing, great songs, all beautiful made by Baz, who I thought already was a genius after Romeo and Juliet, but now, how does he plan to top this one. The only weird thing was that a musical like Chigaco, that was really bad if you don't count Richard Gere (he looks good in every movie), won all kinds of Oscars, but not Moulin Rouge???? Shame on the people at the academy. They give Nicole enough credit, but always for the wrong movies. I don't like the Botox-Kidman, but I love her in almost every movie, especially this one.

"A circus blend of Shakespearean comedy, Cabaret, and Romeo & Juliet","This film has plenty of pizzazz, dash and spectacle with fabulous costumes, eccentric characters, dizzying camera movement, and a curiously surreal, circus-like Paris.  It's also a funny, fresh look at the tragic love story -- and only with Baz Luhrmann at the helm could that not be a contradiction.This is a musical, first of all, and that will alienate some potential movie-goers.  The characters burst into extravagant musical numbers (my favorites were the Roxanne tango--WOW--and the comic ""Like a Virgin"" number) at the drop of a hat, and any smidgen of realism is non-existent.  That said, however, the love story between Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) carries a surprising ring of truth.  McGregor's natty smile (reminds me a little of Hugh Grant, but I reckon McGregor brings it off in a less corny way) and Kidman's melting response just work a treat.Story-wise, this one is very Shakespearean with all sorts of mix-ups and confusions and plenty of bizarre side-characters with wonderful cameo roles. You feel like the cast had a lot of fun making this film, and you're let in on some of the jokes, which is very neat.That all said, I still wasn't as pulled into this film as I have been with others.  It was fun and I wasn't bored, but I wasn't much moved  either, and at the end I have to give this film a firm thumb up, but not two thumbs.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Spectacle with some under achievements,"I would really expect the most after ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"". I would really expect the rebirth of the musical movie. But one thing doesn't let me score this movie higher than 7. I would also expect a better vision of Montmartre and Paris altogether. This movie lacks universe, because the action and the characters are too restricted. What I mean is that this musical lacks that epic vein it could have, because everything turns around that group of 5 or 6 people, that group of 4 or 5 buildings (the rest of the audience and the people are man with top hats and girls with dresses, let's face it) and the result is a grand musical film, but which is presented with the scenery range of a play (just count the scenes that don't take place on studio). And this is the thing that left me craving the most, since I think Luhrmann's nuts were really too big when he grabbed music from the 80's and put them in 1900. There are too many musical highlights, but if I could choose one that really touched me more than the others, it's gotta be the powerful ""Tango de Roxanne"", which is as achieved as any masterpiece song we ever heard, and works also as a summit to all the movie. This is my conclusion: the movie is great, could have been even better. Love those opening credits, though. And oh yeah, how on Earth did they managed to turn John Leguizamo into a midget? He looks real, there seems to be no digital manipulation or so!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed cheese platter anyone?,"I'd rather enjoyed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, I'd been overwhelmed by the gaudiness of Strictly Ballroom but somehow also managed to find some mindless entertainment in that... but I am sorry to say I won't be anywhere near as generous with Moulin Rouge. Some adoring reviewers here have claimed this film has revealed the endless possibilities of cinema to them. I must then think that they haven't seen very many films in their lives, seeing as Moulin Rouge does nothing but pick 'n mix then regurgitate with an extra helping of gorgonzola from films and genres that have been seen, digested and assimilated many, many times before. Except the now-obligatory post-modern irony isn't even in this mish-mash, as the two leads - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in particular - are so totally devoid of any ability to do irony, you'll end up with tooth decay at the end of this schmaltzy ride.Kidman and her button nose, which prevents her from looking anything but pretty but never beautiful (as this film would have us believe), is probably one of the most actory actresses working in Hollywood today. Her performances go through all the motions - see her Oscar-winning performance in The Hours, for instance, where she showed us what a mentally disturbed, brooding artist does, at least externally - without ever reaching anything resembling the SOUL of her character. In this sense, when comparing Julianne Moore's unforgettable performance to Kidman's in the same film, you understand in what ways she could also be viewed as unconvincing as the doomed courtesan Satine in Moulin Rouge. As for McGregor, who was supposed to be playing a young Londoner (with an awfully good Scottish accent for someone from so far South in the UK!), his Christian had a little more integrity, but way too much sap. Watching such a man declare his undying love to me would probably make me feel like the most unromantic, irreverent and callous woman in matters of love!The film itself, essentially an old-fashioned musical with no original songs and a few clever gimmicks to give it a superficial modern veneer, will probably date very quickly. Whoever will be watching it in, say, the year 2020 won't help noticing how turn-of-the-century it is. A film which uses popular culture references for a greater, more timeless purpose rather than being used BY them, will probably stand the test of time. Not so a film which does nothing but wink and nudge the spectator all the way through just to show how up-to-date with all the latest, late 90s, trendy pop references such as MTV-style cinematography, Bollywood movie aesthetics, Kylie Minogue and the ""naughty"" and Bohemian use of absinthe (which had a revival in the late 90s)... Even the big, turn-of-the-century New Year's bash... a direct reference to the MTV generation's own 1999.**SPOILERS AHEAD** One scene I found particularly ridiculous was the one in which the ruddy-cheeked, mustachioed Cockney (in Paris!) impresario Jim Broadbent (only superficially reprising his much more interesting role from Topsy Turvy), tells Nicole's Satine she's dying of consumption (tuberculosis for you and I). He does this as a last resort to convince her once and for all that she must give up her true love, the impoverished writer Christian and sleep with the evil Duke so that he'll sponsor the Moulin Rouge and her acting career. When Satine hears this shocking bit of news about her health, she reluctantly agrees to going along with her impresario's wish. I'll explain why I think this scene is ridiculous: if anyone has ever known someone who's had to go through the unspeakable pain of discovering they have a terminal illness, they will know that Satine's reaction - agreeing to give up her love for Christian - is psychologically the least credible thing she could have done. Exactly because she knew she had so little to live, what really matters most in life would suddenly have come into sharp focus for her. She'd have wanted to spend her last period alive doing exactly what she had always wished for and what was really worthwhile - not pretending to love someone she despised in order to further someone else's business interests! As for her own business interests, what would they matter if she knew she was dying? **END OF SPOILERS**Speaking of the Duke and the way the evil, upper-class patron was portrayed in Moulin Rouge - he made the whole film so similar to Titanic in my eyes. Not unlike that other gargantuan cheese-platter, Moulin Rouge's poor were the generous, creative, lively, warm, vibrant salt-of-the-earth types to its cold, heartless, snobbish, evil rich. Moulin Rouge and Titanic portray class differences in a manner so simplistic, I wonder why more people didn't feel insulted by such an affront to their intelligence.Other majorly irritating elements about Moulin Rouge besides the... er... choice of music were some of the supporting characters, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec in the front row. A lisping, simpering fool played by an actor of average stature unconvincingly walking on his knees.... It makes one balk just to think he was meant to portray one of France's legendary Belle Epoque artists, one whose artistic heritage embodies that time in the French capital like few others. Yet here he was, reduced to no more than a cutesy, Disney animal side-kick so he could be fed to the MTV generation without turning them off from the historic/cultural baggage that would come with such a figure normally! My final words on Moulin Rouge are that if I'm going to watch a gaudy, noisy song-and-dance with funny characters talking in silly voices, give me the original Muppet Show series any day.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece,"I rented Moulin Rouge because I thought my wife would enjoy it. I was planning on just surviving the ordeal. As it turned out, I absolutely loved it. It is an artistic masterpiece. The plot was secondary to me and not to be judged at face value like plots in 30,000 other films. This was eye and ear candy, entertainment per se. I am amazed at how many reviewers absolutely hated this film. If ROUGE were judged by the plot, it is an awful and simplistic movie. But it isn't about the plot and it is a fine and sophisticated movie. The music is delicious and creative and played with a sense of humor, the songs of the 70's and 80's sung in anachronistic sarcasm and beauty.  The leading actors were good-looking without being too old or too young and smug.The craft of directing and producing is generally overrated. Any nit-wit actor with a lot of clout and money can become one. For once we see a film that is so complex in its art form and brilliantly conceived and executed that the run of the mill actor turned director could not have pulled it off in his or her wildest dreams. I hated to return MOULIN ROUGE to the store and may actually buy it on dvd. However I don't want to watch all the behind the scenes features. I want to always enjoy it in its pure form.

"Come what may, I'll love this movie until my dying day!","In a world of complicated concepts and unfamiliar ways of life one familiar concept is handed to us on a silver platter. Love. To the English writer called Christian love is like oxygen. Love is a many splendered thing. Love lifts us up where we belong. All you need is love! One problem. He's never been in love. And so the journey at the Moulin Rouge begins. And in a wave of familiar lyrical songs and laugh-out-loud jokes, you watch as a young, sensitive, handsome, penniless writer falls for a clever, sexy, Cortesan called Satine. It seems as though the only thing the two have in common is there singing talents and there desire for something greater. But things start to get a little more complicated than Christian thought when Satine is sold to the Duke in exchange for investments on their new play, and when Satine becomes deathly ill. What was a sweet and lighthearted romance turns into a desperate race for Satine's love, and overwhelming jealousy and a sense of ownership create a power on screen that becomes heart wrenching. Baz delivers a few powerful renditions of modern songs and delivered lines that make the audience gasp. Such as the scene where the Duke asks why the Cortesan shouldn't fall in love with the Maharajah. In an angry and frustrated rage Christian screams out ""BECAUSE SHE DOESN""T LOVE YOU!"" Sending further suspicion that Christian and Satine are in love. The daring casting of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give it an extra leap of faith that proves to be ""Spectacular!"" And the unexpected romantic aspects have ever female viewer in tears. But an extreme in opinion shows a serious viewing issue. Many who are spontaneous, passionate, and artistic will love this. The combination of the passionate love story, the wonderful music and art direction and the character's want of something greater is gripping. But the viewer has to be very opened minded. This film is a breakthrough in musicals. But is slightly odd. The plot has the kind of feel of Pretty Woman, but much more artistic. All in all, this is a great romantic passionate, art driven movie. Baz made moves in this film that no one has ever seen done. Yet it's captivating and emotionally driven and sends you to a place you can only go to in the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"WOW, WONDERFUL, FUN, EXCITING, GREAT MOVIE","I love this movie. It's got all you want in a romance, musical, and even a little drama. It's fabulous to know that there are that many actors out there that can sing. Ewan McGregor is a dream boat and boy can he sing. I voice from heaven and a body made by the devil. (ha, ha) The choreography was spectacularly done. I loved how they used songs from the past, it was creative. The director, producer, and writer Baz Luhrmann is a movie genius. The way he setup movie and with the camera angles, shows this imaginary world where all thing do happen. Where the nightly pleasures and undying love meet you find meaning hidden.I really loved the bright colors used on the set and with the costumes.

"A better Titanic, but that doesn't mean much","I hate jukebox musicals. Not my thing. I also hate James Cameron's Titanic, a film with beautiful detail, but contains the most shallow love story ever. Good god it was boring. I came into Moulin Rouge with mixed expectations, and got the viewpoints of someone who loved it, and someone who hated it. I liked the film overall but there are some issues that I have with it that I won't spoil. The film is over the top, which for some can be jarring, especially with the editing and musical numbers. It does give the film a certain energy, but it gets old really quick. The plot is also put forth to us fairly quick, especially for a film that is 2 hours. The singing is eh, but my favorite sequence in the film uses ""Roxanne"" as a tango, and it is shot, choreographed, and sung well. I also enjoyed the set design and costumes, but the editing sometimes prevents me from looking at it. As a whole, I'd give Moulun Rouge a rental. I liked it, but I wish I could love it. However, I can say that is is infinitely better than Titanic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing!,"This is my favourite film by far and I think it is amazing! I think it is very clever how the writers have adapted contemporary songs and incorporated them into the script. I also love the variety of styles such as comedy, romance and tragedy. My favourite part is the 'Like a virgin' sequence, which is hilarious! But you'll have to watch the film to see it! All the actors and actresses in the film are very talented and mostly sing the songs themselves, which I think is fantastic and makes the film even better, if that is possible! I think this film could be enjoyed by most people, although there is a lot of singing and music, so if you don't like that kind of thing it may not be the film for you!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as good as the first time I saw it,"I remember watching this film when it came out in cinemas in 2001 and my 23 year old at the time self absolutely loved it. It was so different to anything else at that time - camp, funny, sad, colourful, bohemian - whatever I felt at that was at that time.I've probably not watched this film for about 10 years at least and today saw it was on a streaming service I subscribe to. And I have to say it isn't as good as I remember.Sure, virtually it is still pretty stunning, with the brightness that is a Baz Lurmann signature, but the fast cutting, particularly in the opening 15 minutes is actually horribly jarring and almost headache inducing. It's still very clever and creative, but rather than a movie, it feels like you're watching a music video.Other things that now annoy me are how disjointed the film is, with tragically sad or serious scenes interspersed with very sudden out and out ridiculous comedy.This review makes it sound like I hate Moulin Rouge! But I don't. I still really like it. The casting is perfect, especially the two leads. Ewan McGregor puts in a consistently great performance as the penniless writer who falls for courtisan Satine played by Nicole Kidman who manages to bring out sizzling sensuality, hilarity and tragedy in her. Everyone cast in this film looks and feels right for the parts they're playing. The story is simple and some of the musical sections are incredibly inspired. It's great entertainment.One final jarring thing for me. I know the Paris scenes and anything outside of the main Moulin Rouge set are all CGI and because we are being told a story they have a sort of ""storybook"" look about them, and 23 years ago the effects were probably cutting edge, but on a 4K/UHD screen the fakery looks too fake - outlines around actors and that look of the actors being inserted into the scene post-production.. Oh and there are a few bits where Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's eye colour, clearly brightened in post-production has been missed. Eye colour changes between different parts of the same scene.. Especially when they're in the elephant and he's singing Your Song to her. Picky I know, but now I won't be able to unsee it!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Devastating!,"This is the second time I have seen Moulin Rouge.  I can easily say that it is an amazing film!  If you have not seen it... rent it or buy the DVD. After seeing Nicole Kidman's work on this film, I believe she will walk away with the Oscar this year for The Hours (as the Academy sometimes does). Her role was incredible  and she did a fantastic job in it. Her singing along with Ewan Macgregor's is amazing.  They had so much chemistry going on.  I can't believe he was overlooked by the Academy last year!  This is a film that explodes with color... and energy.. romance.. despair.. and of course love. I can't say enough about this movie.  Yes.. it is an MTV style film, but the editing, the cinematography and originality (even thought they use old songs) are all top rate!  I am very glad that I own this film in my DVD collection.  9 stars out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You don't have to like musical's to bear this film,"As watching this film was part of my university film course, it became compulsive viewing even though I would normally steer MILES clear of ANY film even mentioned within a breath of the musicals genre. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic and went in with the lowest of lowest expectations, I think this film did pretty well considering that factor.The visuals are pretty stunning. The amount of colour and energy you are drowned in is quite spectacular although this is partly down to Baz Luhrmann's way of doing films, namely with the fast edits he uses. The settings and clothes used were pretty good and even more so when viewing it on 'the big screen' as I saw it in a proper viewing theatre - a feeling I'm told isn't as much present when viewed on the small screen. Although the music itself feels very out of place with characters breaking into chorus' of 'Your Song' and 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' on the verge of the 20th century, it doesn't distract TOO much from the rest of the film, in fact if anything it makes it a tiny bit stronger.One thing that is quite perplexing about the film is the fact that the main character or, in actual fact actor, can sing and sing very well. The songs (all be them modern when compared to the set era) are sung with such grace and passion, it makes you just sit and stare and the activity on screen and in a REALLY odd way, you actually become more aware of the lyrics and how beautiful the song can actually be.In terms of narrative, there's nothing too spectacular. It's the classic love triangle and very reminiscent to that of the situation faced in another musical: 'The Phantom of the Opera (2004)'. The story gets rather stuck. It tries to go up a gear now and again with the Heroine's 'black out' problems and 'the Duke' character getting involved with the Moulin Rouge set up in a certain way but everything seems too planned and too forced for it to flow in a seamless way and for it to be of a level of entertainment that I'd usually enjoy.Still, with plenty of colour and energy and strong acting performances, both in the singing and general acting department this is a pretty enjoyable film that you'll like if you're into your romantic, period dramas with a musical flavour. Even if you're not, you'll enjoy it for its energy",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
not very complementary,"I don,t understand why they had to change camera shots so often, but I have seen strobe lights that are slower. Hopefully they didn't spend too much on costumes, as the camera changed so fast the eye could not focus on anything. After 25 minutes of this I started to time the camera changes ( just shows how it held my attention) At this time they changed on average of 2.3 seconds. The opening number was much faster, probably 100 different shots in 38 seconds. If they are nominated for anything it should be for the poor sap that had to splice all those tiny bits of film together.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Regardles It made and impression so I had to watch it again. I did and it was mind- boggling but in the amazing unbelievable way. This has seriously been the best and most original musical I have set my eyes on. The outrageous characters accompany an equally outrageous set. It seemed like every single song, scene, and sentence conveyed the director's (movie's) message. It truly engaged my mind in seeking an answer to the age old question... what is the meaning of life? Why are we here?... The best part about the movie was when it was over my mind had satisfactory answers.

"""I want to vanish inside your kiss""","Well, it's weird, i don't like musicals, at all!This one caught me off guard as my girlfriend ask me to make the effort to see it and i went to the theatre with very few expectations.I knew nothing about the movie nor the actors and director, but as soon as the movies started it reminded me of Romeo and Juliet with Leo and Danes, and guess what... The story couldn't be more simple, but it's told (in the first half) in a frentic way that intercalates raw emotional moments of singing with the ecstasy of the boemiam life, some scenes are a bit cringy, but that's ok, it's Baz's style.All the actors go well in the movie, but Kidman and McGregor stand out for me! They can sing!! A lot!!! Great performances paired with some great musical moments.The thing is, when the Elephant Medley scene ends (""You're gonna be bad for business, i can tell""), i'm completely surrendered to the movie and it's blowing away my expectations.The second half of the movie is less energetic, as the movies slows down a bit to reach the fatal conclusion, which is the first information given to us at the beginning, but as the movie progresses we tend to forget that (a reminder here and there) in the middle of that beautiful chaos.It's definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen, i saw it countless times now and it still holds up till today as the best musical ever in my opinion and the best way to tell a love story, simply magical!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Audacious fun,"To accuse Baz Luhrman of style-over-substance is missing the point, since the style is the substance of this giddy, splashy musical.  It is appropriate that Luhrman incorporates Queen's ""The Show Must Go On"" into this film, as this is the cinematic equivalent of a Queen song -- intelligent, over-the-top and winking in a knowing way that let's the audience know it's not just in on the joke, but part of it.The plot is just an excuse to throw together musical numbers and set pieces. To that extent, the second half of the movie drags and could have used some editing -- although the climactic scenes are very effective.  I'd ditch the ""Roxanne"" number, simply on the grounds that it was musically uninteresting, for starters.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both show the breadth of their talent, including their fine singing voices.  Jim Broadbent uncharacteristically chews the scenery, delightfully, while John Leguizamo characteristically chews the scenery, also delightfully.The use of music is almost always spot on, and any movie that not only touches upon Queen, but Elton John (big time), Sweet, Kiss and T-Rex shows an auteur who knows both zeit and geist in equal amounts. Oh, and the look of the film is just awesome, stitching together the best bits of cinema from the silents to Welles to today's cutting edge technology.And best of all -- it's the best Kylie Minogue/Placido Domingo film ever...7.5 of 10, only because of the draggy bits -- but still worth seeing.Mike Bennett",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Who needs a plot when you can have Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love?","This film has been slated by numerous people for a lack of originality and a feather-weight plot. Both of these criticisms I find hard to fathom. For one thing, I can guarantee that you have never seen a movie like this before, and are unlikely to see anything quite like it again. For another, the entire genre of love stories isn't exactly groaning with stunning and complex plot lines, so why should this one suddenly have to be judged by some monumental standard, particularly when it has so much else to offer?What makes 'Moulin Rouge' so special is not only the much discussed pace of the opening twenty minutes, or the way in which the perfectly chosen songs are fused and reworked into each other and the story, but the performances of the entire cast, from the evident enjoyment they display in the early ensemble scenes through to the love scenes between Ewan McGregor (who has a smile to die for) and Nicole Kidman, both of whom look stunningly beautiful and have real chemistry (they CAN sing too).The film also manages to avoid the law of diminishing returns, with each musical number or emotional twist being bigger/better/funnier/sadder than the last, no mean achievement when you consider the scale of the opening.I don't want to give away any details, so I'll leave it there and just urge everyone to see this film for themselves because it really is worth it - funny, sad, entertaining, overwhelming and very touching. Who needs a hefty plot when faced with all of that?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sensational,"What you need to know about this film is that it is all about love. It is a story of lust, greed, jealousy and music, music expresses what words cannot and that is shown throughout this film.From beginning to end, I was completely captivated and this was because it was so quirky and beautifully scripted that I felt I was a part of the Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann directed and helped write this musical and I have always been a big fan of his work..The protagonists Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) are the unlucky and unlikely lovers as Satine mistakenly assumes that Christian is the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Christian is in fact a young writer who travelled from London to Paris in search of inspiration and maybe love and Satine is the 'Sparkling Diamond' of the club who catches the eye of both Chrstian and the Duke. Satine wants to seduce the Duke so he can give her wealth but also help her to achieve her dream of being an actress. Early on we can tell that the two men will be fighting over Satine but it seems a greater threat is at large.The film takes its inspiration from 20th century music specifically love songs and even creates a medley of many popular love songs of the century. One thing I do love about this film is the soundtrack, the music intertwines perfectly with the plot and it really does help into showing us the characters true intentions.Obviously not every film is perfect and this film has its flaws but I think that is what makes it so honest and their love so captivating.The cinematography and the editing is beautifully composed, very quirky and quite dark for a film of this genre.Overall this film is a must see if you are a fan of romance, drama, comedy and above all else music. Also if you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann then I would definitely put this film on my 'To See' list.RJ x",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
My all time favourite film!,"To start with, its directed by Baz Lurhman so you know its going to be good...
But I never expected to be obsessed with this film 11 years after I first watched it for a school project!Considering the bohemian/absinthe induced-vibe that makes it all so unrealistic and fantastical, from a signing moon, to the green fairy played by Minogue; the talented actors, Kidman, McGregor and Broadbent are stunning and make it all very believable. You find yourself routing for the protagonists and detesting the antagonist - just as any movie should make it's audience feel.It is so full off mixed emotions, all the way through. It is somber to start, with a beautiful opening sequence featuring establishing shots and the wonderful character Toulouse, played magnificently by Leguizamo!

A waste of an evening,"I was so incredibly disappointed.  This was truly a waste of both my time and money, and an insult to the glorious movie musicals of the past.  Not one original song--instead a long strain of every recycled old pop song you never want to hear again.  And the vocalists certainly did not help the matter.  Ewan McGregor, usually an excellent actor, suddenly loses all acting skills as soon as he opens his mouth to sing.  (As to his vocal abilities, he certainly leaves much to be desired.)  Kidman, though making a slightly better showing, was uninteresting and lacking in true vocal training, proving that it takes more than ""star power"" to have a vocal prowess that can carry a musical.  Definitely not Kidman's best work.  The story itself has potential, and the cinematography is unique and artistic...but the movie goes downhill from there.  This is a devastating mess of a movie.  If you're going to make a musical, for goodness sakes, PLEASE actually write an original musical score, and cast REAL SINGERS, not just ""big names."" Such a shame--done right, this movie could have been fantastic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a fantastic film!!,"Baz Lurhman is truly a creative genius and his work on this film is astounding.  The colors, the textures, the music, the chaos, the characters all weave together to create one of the most stimulating and thrilling experiences ever.  Nicole Kidman can sing and Ewan McGregor can really sing! Granted, this film is not for everyone.  Some may find it dizzying - a sensory overload - but for those of us brought up in the MTV generation it fits together beautifully.  It is a musical (or perhaps more correctly a mini opera), a drama, a comedy, a love story and a special effects extravaganza all rolled into one beautiful work of art.  Bits and pieces of some of the most esteemed movies and songs of our time aid in the telling of this tale, reworked to fit into the heightened world of the Moulin Rouge. Definitely worth the time and money as long as you can handle all the visual festivity.  The 2-disc DVD is loaded with extras as well as hidden ""easter eggs"".",,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie,"Moulin Rouge was the best movie in class. The movie had actual plot, meaning, and it had depth. I really enjoyed all the different chaotic shots, the moving colors, and so much was going on. When there were contrasting shots, it was really pretty, and you get really engaged into the movie because then you don't want to miss anything. The characters in the movie were irritating but that just means that there are good actors. Not only were the shots, plot, and actors good, the music was also top-tier. I listened to the soundtrack for three months minimum after. Three of the songs were always in my top 10 songs monthly.The entire movie had deep emotional meaning & it was worth the watch, even past the sort of bad quality due to the year it was made in.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Positively extravagant,I'm a pretty musical fella and oh my god can ewan mcgregor sing. Definitely not what I was expecting from obi wan kenobi but his voice actually blew me away. Nicole kidman stole every single scene she was in with her incredible preformance. The music overall was pretty fire I must say.Only really one major thing that bugged me about this movie and that was the camera work. Some of the cinematic shots were beautiful and really well done however In general I really dislike the frequent fast paced shots that were constantly being used in the first scene. They kind of died down in its second half which I'm glad about but I feel they can be annoying if they're overused. Other than that the movie was brilliant. Really sad too.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Romantic musical Tragicomedy that is a visual and auditory spectacle,"Moulin rouge directed by Baz Luhurman. The film was released to the public in 2001, it is an operatic show set in París accompanied by songs of the decades of 70's and 80's, the musical deals with themes such as ambition, longing and revenge but focusing on love and what you are willing to do for it.The story takes place at the Moulin rouge nightclub and is about a growing, poor writer named Christian (Ewan Mackgregor) who goes to the Moulin rouge for the first time where he meets and falls in love with Satin (Nicole KIdman) the bar's most famous courtesan and headliner. Although her love is reciprocated, sadly, from the start, the viewer learns that their love is impossible since Satin has tuberculosis and is engaged to the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) who bought her from Harold, owner of the Moulin rouge (Jim Broadbent) in exchange for fame, prestige and respect as much as for them as for the bar.Although it may be the simplest cliche of the classic myth of Orpheus, and the oft-repeated romantic triangle between a beautiful lady and a poor man against a more wealthy man cliche, even though the plot is more romantic, the film is much deeper than it seems, the performances of the protagonists as well as those of the rest of the cast are quite good, especially those stunning and well-loved shows that the Moulin Rouge offers. However, being full of these, the film can seem very saturated to the viewer's eye, in addition to the fact that you need to pay a lot of attention to the film from the beginning because it happens very quickly, it's a very moving and dynamic movie but for this very reason i belive it isn't for everyone.Personally, it is one of the best musicals I have ever seen also one of my favorite movies, however the script leaves a lot to be desired, it is not bad but it could have been better, nevertheless, i consider that the director did a great job and of course it's visual beauty full of red, porpurine and a very good soundtrack will make you not regret seeing it. One of the most extravagant musicals and with a quite heartbreaking plot twist if you believed in love driven by revenge. For these reasons if you are a fan of this type of romance and musicals you should not miss it and I'm sure that you will wish to see in person one the magnificent performances of the Moulin Rouge.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This film has ADD,"The easiest way to describe this film is that this movie has Attention Deficit Disorder and only very rarely does it take its ritolin. And when it does slow down, the movie still isn't good.Most of the film is comprised of meaningless cuts at an extremely rapid pace so that things are not on the screen for more than half a second.  And this just hurt my eyes.  Especially because the colors are vibrant and really leap out.  Its like watching a music video which is already too fast on fast forward.When the film is not going off at this crazy pace, it is then comprised of extreme close-ups.  The camera is so close on peoples faces that most of the time they do not even fit on the screen.  And for some of the people, like the owner of Moulin Rouge, it is way too close and down right scary.A problem that I have heard most people had with the movie, if they had a problem with it, was the music.  And that was one of the few tolerable things with it.  Unlike the absolutely ridiculous music of A Knight's Tale, this music is incorporated into the movie well.  At least here they make it like the music is original, even though it isn't.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't enjoy the music, but its at least tolerable.There is not much good about this film.  The story is 100% unoriginal and the film hurts your eyes.  The tagline says that Club Moulin Rouge is an experience you will never forget.

"In my ""All Time Top 10""","If one would look at the BankofMarquis ""All Time Top 10"" film list, you will see such stalwarts as THE GODFATHER, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and CITIZEN KANE. It also would contain a ""more modern"" film that doesn't, necessarily, find itself on these types of lists - Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE from 2001.Yes...it's that good.Set at the turn of the century (the 19th to the 20th century) during the Bohemian Revolution in Paris, MOULIN ROUGE tells the tale of the...you guessed it...the Moulin Rouge theater/club where a young writer (Ewan McGregor) gets pulled into the lives of the artists and others trying to make a living, falling in love with a young courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) all under the watchful eye of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).But it is not the story, but the telling of the story that sets this film apart. It is chaotic, wild, colorful, sexy, grimy, loving, alcoholic and spectacular - all things that not only describe this film, but the Moulin Rouge itself. Directer Baz Luhrman really shines in his vision of this picture that juxtaposes colorful sets and costumes, unique characters and songs and dance and music that tells the tale in a a unique way.Oh...did I mention that most of this music is MODERN music? From Elton John's YOUR SONG to Roger's and Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF MUSIC to LADY MARMALADE to the ingenious use of Sting's ROXANNE (in a tango scene no less), this film is an amalgam of song that fits each scene perfectly. At what first seems incongruous, upon further viewings, the songs are slyly picked to accent the emotions and dramatic purpose of each scene.As for the acting, McGregor and Kidman are beautifully cast (pun intended) as the young lovers. Their good looks radiate across the screen and I thought they had great chemistry. John Leguzamo and the other ""Bohemians"" pop in and out and are uniquely outrageous without being annoying. Richard Roxburgh's antagonist, ""the Duke"", came across in this viewing as not nearly as annoying as I have found him to be previously. Maybe there is more to this character/performance than meets the eye.But it is Jim Broadbent's portrayal of the Master Shoman, Harold Zidler, that steals this film for me. He is a cunning and ingenious showman who (more than once) proves that he will stop at nothing for the ""show to go on"", but there are many notes to Zidler, at once in control and at the same time trying to KEEP control of events spiraling out of his control that actually shows a desperate man doing whatever he can to survive.Add all these ingredients up and you have a film that gets deeper and richer with each subsequent viewing. I have yet to get tired of this film - and I am looking forward to the next time I immerse myself into this world.Letter Grade: A +10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marvelous musical with magical mise-en-scene,"Masterpiece. Every factor that makes up the movie, story, acting, costume, set design, lighting, camera walk, and music, is just the state of the art. The greatest show one can realize on the screen.First, cinematography is the beginning and the end of this movie. The reddish and pinkish fairy lights intensifies love and the romance between Satine and Christian. Without this color scheme in the background, their love is not sketched as beautiful as it is on the screen. Lighting is appropriately used to create certain atmosphere. For example, the lighting of the can-can performance in Moulin Rouge is too bright, rather flashy, but 'El Tango de Roxanne' and Satine & the Duke in the tower scene is so dark that it emanates gloomy and dreary atmosphere. Additionally, the camera walk in the beginning is turbulent to add the feeling of disorganization and boheme of that place and of that time. To be honest, every scene from any angle is not only picturesque but also purposeful.Second, costumes and set design creates fairy tale ambiance. The play about Indian courtesan is an excellent choice because colors in Indian clothes are various and pop, so the stage in Moulin Rouge at the ending can be splendid and colorful as it can be. What I love the most about the set design is elephant room, the room only possible in fairy tale. This alluring, bohemian, and glamorous room shows how much effort the art director puts in the movie. All the props are set to the detail to show who 'Satine' is. Satine's costumes changes from red in the beginning to white in the end. She is a passionate, brave, and independent performer who aspires to be an actress, and red surely represents her character well enough. It also symbolizes romance, infatuation, and physical love Satine may feel toward Christian at first. Her clothes change to white at the ending. White signifies more of pure love and devotion, and this change shows how deep her love is toward Christian. Oh, and her costume including what looks like wedding dress, sparkly jewelry, and her make-up turns her into 'human diamond' as Harold has stated. She just shines. She is wonderfully beautiful, and every audience falls in love with her.All these components can dazzle because the story is solid. The director has a simple but dramatic story line and makes it way more compelling by aforementioned devices. 'Mouline Rouge!' is a great love story. ""I had come to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and that which I believed in above all things: love.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fabulous sights and sounds at the Moulin Rouge,"Christian and Satine fall in love and what a great love story it could be. Except this love, as the film tells us right at the very beginning, is doomed. So there could be a touch of melancholy to this whole film. But director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with the sights, the sounds, the frantic energy of the Moulin Rouge. How can you be feeling glum when you're having so much fun? This film draws you in and never lets you go. Yes, the singing and dancing are quite good fun. But there is that captivating love story too. We know there will be no happily ever afters. But we love Christian and Satine just as they love one another. You can't help but be charmed by this couple. And while giving you such a lovely couple to root for the film also gives you a dastardly villain to root against. The Duke, rich and powerful, wants Satine. But her heart belongs to Christian. The Duke does not like this. Not one little bit. Complications ensue.Initially Satine's heart does not belong to anyone. She does not feel she is free to love anyone. She's the star attraction at the famed Paris cabaret Moulin Rouge. She's a singer, a dancer...and a courtesan, which is a fancy word for prostitute. When the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler, needs someone to finance the club's new show Satine knows what she must do. She will make the Duke believe she loves him so he will finance the show. And this arrangement is not without benefit to Satine, this new show will perhaps give her a chance to be a real actress. But there's a little mix-up. She comes to believe that Christian, a penniless writer, is actually the Duke. By the time she realizes her mistake Christian is already totally smitten with her. And then the real Duke shows up and things could get really messy. But a song and dance number saves the day. In this movie, when in doubt, a song and dance number is always the answer.So the Duke ends up agreeing to pay for the show, which Christian will be writing. Of course Christian is much more interested in Satine than he is in the show. Eventually, through song of course, he will win her heart. Then it's a matter of keeping their love hidden away from the oblivious Duke. Satine starts spending all her time with Christian. For the good of the show you see. A girl's gotta rehearse, right? Wink, wink. This makes for a rather unhappy Duke and a very nervous Zidler who needs to keep the man with the money on board. Meanwhile, lurking in the background there is that knowledge that there will be no happy ending. The whole film is in essence told in flashback, Christian in 1900 telling us of the events which happened a year earlier. The Christian of 1900 is a completely heartbroken man, the movie tells us how he got to such a state. What had become of his beloved Satine?Right from the start director Luhrmann lets us know this film is going to be a little bit different. The film's events may unfold in 1899 but the songs Luhrmann uses are not of that period, it's a contemporary soundtrack. When Christian breaks out into some Sound of Music you think that's interesting. When you then hear a little Smells Like Teen Spirit it becomes clear that absolutely anything goes in this film. And all these songs which would seem to be so out of place work so perfectly. Some, such as Satine's renditions of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl, are so fitting they may as well have been written for this film. Other songs are a bit more of a stretch but Luhrmann makes it all work. And as much as Luhrmann it is the cast who make it work, most notably Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman playing Christian and Satine. Their acting is wonderful and their singing is strong and convincing. And needless to say they look the part as well. McGregor has an air of innocence and immense likability. And it is certainly easy to buy into the breathtaking Kidman as the woman who makes Paris's collective heart race. Jim Broadbent is also notably excellent as Zidler and he gets the film's funniest musical number as well.This is a film with constant energy to it, full of life. It's a bit of a sensory overload. The costumes and color make for a visual feast. The songs are performed wonderfully, the dances are beautifully choreographed. The movie hardly ever stops to take a breath, it's constant motion. There are some moments where you wonder if the tone is quite right. The aforementioned Broadbent number is indeed funny but coming as the film takes a darker turn it seems a touch out of place. And then there are moments where maybe it gets a little too dark, where the Duke goes off the deep end and becomes too evil to take seriously. Yes, he needed to be the bad guy but not that bad. But these are small quibbles. All in all the film is a lot of fun. The story is engaging, the performances are terrific and the music kicks things up to a whole other level. You have your touching love songs and you have your wild, loud dance explosions. Every song, every snippet, serves a purpose. The film is somewhat over the top but gleefully so. It makes for great entertainment. Very fitting that the title of the show Christian is writing is Spectacular Spectacular. Moulin Rouge! is spectacular indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Again the story of Traviata,"Those who think that the era of the great musicals is over will see their opinion denied by this movie which combines the old musical tradition with a lot of digital special effects more adequate to the animation movies but which match with the general purpose of this movie anyway. The editing mainly in the first part shows an overwhelming speed of successive plans almost psychedelic playing successfully with images and sounds and showing spectacular choreographic scenes. In the second part that image rhythm slows down a bit more accordingly with the dramatic plot that develops itself around a Traviata love story of the tb ridden courtisan and the young poor but talented writer. Near the end there is a fabulous musical dance with an Argentinian theme which makes counterpoint with the dramatic scene where the courtisan is going to sacrifice herself to the lust of the rich Duke who is financially supporting the show. The weakest part of the movie is the soundtrack mostly made of more modern melodies like ""The Sound of Music"" which have nothing to do with the movie supposed era. Their inclusion results in an anachronism which we cannot understand. This movie could be better but is good enough anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"All Form, No Content: A disaster","This film is all form and no content.  Moulin is an MTV style music video at heart featuring good music, fast editing, color, costume, cartoon-like characters, and weak and dreamy love story.  Moulin should have stayed true to its MTV genre and limited itself to 15 minutes in length.Beyond being a well produced music video the film failed miserably in every measure of a full-length feature. The story line was weak.  There was no chemistry between Kidman and the male lead.  This lifeless story is set amidst a backdrop of inane cartoon-like characters, and a twirling colorful headache of dancing and music. Extending the video format to more than 2 hours is a dismal failure.  If I were distributing this film I would do the decent thing and include the following warning label on the marquee: ""This film is dull and tormenting, proceed at own risk"".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

`Cabaret 2001'  Almost thirty years later,"The first thing that struck me about the movie (I wanted to see it at the theaters but just never got around to it, so on a whim, picked up the video recently and it has now turned into one of the movies I'm obsessed with), was how much it reminded me of `Cabaret'.  Not because of the plot, or anything that could refer back to the 1972 movie (except maybe that both are period pieces: `Cabaret' during the decadent times right before the rise of the Nazi movement; and `Moulin Rouge' during the fin-de-siècle decadent bohemian times), but just the fact that it presented itself as a musical that totally throws itself in your face.  Why TC ever split with Ms. Kidman is beyond me  she is truly magnificent (her voice in some of the songs she performs sounds rather like Madonna during the early years  not bad). Funny, I've always had an aversion to the idea of visiting Paris (ever!), but after seeing this movie, I kinda, sorta want to go now.  Perhaps I, too, can eventually say, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.'  This is not for the faint of heart when it comes to drama, but it could just be me  I cry at the drop of a hat.  It's actually an amusing *dramedy* that anyone who watches it, and who is prone to suspension of disbelief, would pray for death-by-consumption if only to die in the arms of a Ewan McGregor.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful,Brilliant masterpiece!! one of my favorite Musicals!!","Moulin Rouge is brilliant, the excitement of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. It is a beautiful love story that is not a typical situation which makes it even better. The music is amazing and most of the songs people are familiar with which makes it even better. The costumes and makeup really set the tone and allow you to imagine what it would be like if you were attending a show at the Moulin Rouge. This film is very different from most musicals and i think that's what sets it apart. The biggest take away from this film is that it is very entertaining and you can watch it over and over again. Would deffinantly comment this movie to anyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"20 years after release, the film is still trashy chic.","Undeniably shallow, loud and a little campy, this wonderful postmodern jukebox musical still manages to carry off its bizarre magical act. This bricolage of tropes, songs out of context, a dash of history and self-awareness is if nothing else is memorable. It is all so vivid, Bohemian and with its own beauty, freedom, truth and yes even a little bit of love.We live in the trash pile of culture, here when the world is so very old, and this film manages to acknowledge that brute happenstance. And yet the experience is fresh and alive. I can understand why someone would dislike this film. The first hour or so is very frantic. It takes awhile to get use to rhythm of proceedings. The technical aspects straddle the line between being ironically tawdry and being unintentionally tacky. The art direction is garish but with an odd beauty to it; there is twinge of grace to it. It is just delicate enough to be a fantasiaWhile the performances are uniformly good, Broadbent as Zidler is the character that stays with me. Broadbent manages to be larger than life, crass but not cruel, fatherly not domineering. The Duke is the heavy in this film but in a more realist version of the story Zidler would be an antagonist as well. It is a testament to Broadbent that the character remains lovable throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The whole is better than its parts,"For me the film itself overpowered the actors to the extent that they appeared to be struggling to get out from under.Even so I found that I was moved by the story,which is the universal one and would quite likely be moving however it is presented. As an Australian it was good to see so many Australian actors.Did I imagine it or did I get a glimpse of Graham Kennedy? I certainly do not wish to put people off seeing the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silly good fun!,"Moulin Rouge is a great musical. It pushes the boundary of musicals in the way that many good recent movies have done: by mixing and mashing existing forms. Compared to say, The Matrix, Moulin Rouge has much more crazy mixing, but less finessing (not to say that the Matrix couldn't use more finessing). I particularly indulged in the thought that Moulin Rouge merges Disney with pornography. I doubt this sat well with the ""Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever"" crowd.I believe that musicals are best enjoyed as musicals. As a rule, the construct will bare its seams because of the fact that people simply don't break out simultaneous into song. For most traditional film-lovers, this will be a huge hurdle as the expectations of seamless film-making originates with the likes of Kubrick and Coppola and pop culture simply doesn't have the class to out do it.And while we're talking about class, the dirty down inside theory is that musicals, as per Bollywood, as per the main role of music in almost any country, is to serve as an aphrodisiac for the masses. Conversely, a high-brow is someone who proclaims to have found something more interesting than sex. The two sides are not likely to ever agree very much and for a class targeted piece like Moulin Rouge, disagreements on its quality are as eternal as the class differences that draw the lines.Even the most clever of musicals- ""Cabaret"" (1972) has its kinks. And the glorious musicals of old like ""Footlight Parade"" (1933) consistently have flimsy story lines that serve as loose filler between the fantastic musical vignettes.I got my kicks from the movie through the numerous times it cleverly breaks the fourth wall. Also I couldn't help but muse at the supposition where I could write/sing like the lead character. Having many musicians as friends and once being a fledgling musician myself, I know it's an effective vehicle of seduction.Ah, but how very low-brow of me!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A well filmed movie which is a little too frenetic for its own good.,"I recently saw Moulin Rouge in a college dorm, surrounded by easy-going fun-loving college students, and although they enjoyed the movie so much they could even sing along to the catchy tunes, there were certain things in the film that I was personally bothered by. The contemporary songs in the Bohemian Revival setting work very well for certain scenes, but some scenes, particularly the love scenes between Satine and Christian, would be much deeper and more emotional with conventional background music... The filming/shooting in this movie was refreshing, with camera angles everywhere and zooms all over the place. The effect is slightly overused in my opinion, but is in keeping with the overall ""style"" of the movie. Finally, the acting itself was not bad at all, with great acting and chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and some fantastic secondary roles. Overall a good movie, but perhaps a little bit overdone, as I guess all musicals are.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

His movie was a pistache of bits put together leaving me wondering why I'm bothering to watch this story that seems to be going in so many directions. The movie was very jerky-lunging from scene to scene with little thought as to establishing any connectionsI love Australian movies and the vision they present of the world but Luhrmann's vision was too disjointed for my taste.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies of all time!,"Christian (Ewan McGregor) a talent young writer defies his wealthy father by moving to Montmartre Paris to live the life of a Bohemian.  On the night of his arrival, he's taken to the Moulin Rouge, a wild nightclub that caters to the rich and powerful.  There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) the Sparkling Diamond and star of the Moulin Rouge.  Then in a twist of events, Christian lands a job at the Moulin Rouge, as the writer of Spectacular Spectacular. From the first night they meet, sparks fly between Christian and Satine, and by the time rehearsals really start you can tell this isn't just a small fling, it's deep meanful love. Now, I saw this movie the first weekend it came out in theatres, and that was two years ago (2001).  Since then I have seen it probably about 20 times (don't ask why I'm only writing a comment now).  Everything about this movie is brilliant, the costumes, the sets, the music and the story.  But the best thing is the acting.  The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is phenomenal, they really sell the fact that they are in love through their singing and emotional performances. Another amazing thing is the way the two actors take their characters and help them grown up through out the coarse of the movie. We first see Ewan as the innocent and naive Christian who arrives in Paris with his idealistic youthful ideas of love, but towards the end of the film he changes Christian into a more mature man who has been scarred by losing something he loved very dearly, he makes you really feel the pain he's in. Nicole makes Satine an ambitious and do-anything-it-takes star who has men melting at her feet at the beginning of the movie, but then turns her into this vulnerable and desperate (and dying) woman who just wants to be loved. Another thing that I love about this film is how the whole cast (not just Ewan and Nicole) transmit on to the screen how much fun they all had making this movie. Which makes it even more enjoyable to watch. I know that this kind of movie doesn't appeal to everyone, but I guarantee that if you were to give it a try and sit through some of the more weirder parts, by the end of the it you'll be saying: ""Now that was a good movie.""",,Anonymous,Romance

I can't make it to the end. The noisy, garish, tasteless assault defeats me every time. The only successful performance in the film is by Nicole Kidman's porcelain epidermis. Dancers of the calibre of Caroline O'Connor must have been furious at the way their performances were hatcheted.There was a movie in there somewhere Baz, but you couldn't find it, so you drowned it in treacle.

The ultimate guilty pleasure movie,"Right out of the gate the first thing I have to mention with this movie is the editing for this movie. The editing in this movie is very faced paced and due to that, it's hard for people to fully grasp what is happening. So many scenes in this movie could've included fewer shots as to make it easier for the viewer to get a handle of where everybody is in the scene and what's going on. Whenever the editing for this movie did slow down such as in the, ""El Tango De Roxanne"" scene and towards the end of the movie was easy to grasp. I will admit that there are some scenes in this movie where the rapid editing works such as in the opening scene in the Moulin Rouge. But once you get passed the editing problem this movie isn't that bad at all. The best parts of this movie hands down are the cinematography, set and costume design. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous and brings you into this world. I especially like how when the movie is in the Moulin Rouge the lighting is bright and colourful compared to outside where it's bleak and colourless. The acting in this movie will also help captivate the audience. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are the real standouts of this movie due to really just diving into the weirdness of this movie. I do wish this movie had more original songs in it but the songs they did pick for this musical work pretty well. In the end, Moulin Rouge might be far from a perfect movie musical but it's still an enjoyable movie to watch at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Freedom, Beauty, Truth, Love","The first time I saw Moulin Rouge was in that week of collective numbness following 9/11. We had made our way first to the Grosvenor Square US embassy to make a gesture of solidarity and its impromptu garden or remembrance and from thence to Odeon marble arch. The film itself astonished us - from its manic opening 10 minutes when we seemed witness to a star-studded, epic and monumental folly of film-making, to being, like Satine, swept from our firmly-planted critical feet and propelled along by its spectacular (spectacular) visual and intellectual ravishments. At that moment, leaving the theatre it seemed a joyous manifesto of what, decadent, dissolute, secular and unrooted as we are, we stand for in this world, which has true value, and what stands against us - cold, unforgiving and immune to the ideals of the 'Bohemian Revolution'. I have watched it many times since, its fascination unfading like that of the Wizard of Oz, as it is almost a version of that film for adults, but instead of a monochrome ending we are plunged into the deepest black - which in all truth we know awaits us all in any case. Wizard of Oz is equally applicable to its director, as it is a directorial feat that transforms it, alchemically, from lead to gold. Without the boldest and most extreme editing, and a tongue continually planted in its cheek most of the dialogue sections between the setpieces would have ruined the film, even accounting for some stellar performances from the principles. Instead they are played melodramatically yet sincerely, and it works, allowing the story to flow between the sensual, comedic and tragic delights expressed for the most part in song and dance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Giddy Tapestry of Farce & Romanticism,"Moulin Rouge is a tapestry of things borrowed and thrown together to produce some great fun. The film is a little bit Magic Flute, a little bit MTV, a little bit Cabaret and a little bit Monty Python.Moulin Rouge is giddy fun, right from the first scene, where ridiculously dressed dwarfs come crashing through the roof.If you are the least bit nihilistic in life, this movie will annoy you within ten minutes and have you thoroughly bitter after an hour. Sometimes I think this film was made to annoy the kind of people that hate musicals. If you hate musicals, frivolity and gaiety at all, this film is literally your worst nightmare.Mouline Rouge robs references anywhere it can find them and never apologizes for the plagiarism. Indeed it holds it up to you and demands you to laugh at it all. When a late 19th century love ballad, features copped lyrics from the group KISS, you know you've hit something wonderfully silly.Is this film great art? Most assuredly, just as chocolate ice cream is great food. This is a movie that will delight those with light hearts and discourage those with heavy souls, to the point where they'll become contemptuous of the film's success.Personally, I hope it wins Best Film of 2001.

Worst movie ever made,"The single worst movie ever made, and for good reason: none of the plot was original, at all. You want a dying courtesan caught in a love triangle?

The cabaret singer who falls for the poor writer? Watch the movie/musical Cabaret. The entrepreneur who toys with the affections of his starlet? The black-and-white classic Twentieth Century with John Barrymore will suffice. And not only is it the most derivative movie ever made, the acting was ridiculously bad. Ewan McGregor's crying when Nicole Kidman died actually made me laugh out loud. Sounded more like he was struggling with a hairball. And Kidman can't touch Liza Minelli as the singer in Cabaret.

Love is a many-splendored thing... this movie too,"Christian is a young poet who arrives to Paris in 1899, the summer of love to be part of the bohemian revolution that's happening. With some luck and the help from a group of bohemians that includes Toulouse-Lautrec he ends up being the main writer of the most ambitious show that's about to be presented in the Moulin Rouge (the most famous night club of its time). What he doesn't know is that he would find true love personified in Satine, the star courtesan and aspiring actress.However, things won't be easy once Christian and Satine are together: a jealous Duke who wants Satine only for him (who also happens to be the main investor in the show), Harold Zidler's refusal to the relationship (mostly because of the fear of losing the Duke's sponsorship) and a fatal disease condemn their destiny as lovers.The plot described above easily sounds taken from any conventional romance novel and could have been an average period piece. In Baz Luhrmann's particular vision it becomes a completely bizarre and indescribable experience. Why? Luhrmann takes the risk of using a forgotten movie genre: the musical and with some of the most emblematic pop songs of the 90's creates what he calls a ""real artificiality"" in which anything is possible. Or where else is possible to witness a very unusual rendition of Like a virgin sung by Jim Broadbent? or Ewan Mcgregor singing' Elton John's Your Song? Another risk Lhurmann takes is hiring actors that aren't exactly known for being gifted singers. Nonetheless the risk works and Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent and the rest of the cast prove to have stunning voices. In addition to that, they also deliver powerful performances that reach a very wide field of emotions, from the most absolute absurd to the most heartbreaking tragedy being completely believable.A very important element for Luhrmann's vision to be complete is the recreation of the 1899 Paris. Luhrmann and his team decide not to do a carbon copy of the Moulin Rouge and its elements and instead they create a whole new Moulin Rouge based on how new audiences would imagine it if it had been existed in this time. Also the costume design has an important role here, every gown and dress has own life and differentiates this movie from others.Also the choreography of the musical numbers are completely breathtaking and remind us every moment we're not watching a typical musical movie. And that's Luhrmann's main intention: to create a completely different movie that becomes an experience for the audiences. Many people won't agree with this point of view, but those who agree are grateful for a many-splendored thing like Moulin Rouge!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A film is an abysmal source of studies on cinematographic language and the arts in general that offers us an intense lesson in cinema, literature and history","Moulin Rouge is an unforgettable spectacle. By the way, the word ""spectacle"" is not used in vain, since the beginning of the film is (literally) preceded by an opening of curtains, which close again after the end of the story. Moreover, ""spectacular"" is also the least of the adjectives that should be used in relation to the aesthetic value of the production. The undeniable fact is that Moulin Rouge is a great feast for the eyes, ears and mind.Masterfully directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, the film revolves around the intense love affair between Christian, a poor writer, and Satine, the most beautiful courtesan of the Moulin Rouge, the famous French cabaret that made its mark thanks to the eclecticism of its clientele, which included members of the most diverse social and cultural classes. After meeting thanks to the intervention of the extravagant painter Toulouse-Lautrec, the couple gives themselves over to a forbidden passion - Satine is ""betrothed"" to a Duke who will invest in the greatest cabaret show (which will finally transform her into an actress, not just a dancer), and Christian is precisely responsible for the script for the production (he gets the job after 'composing' the theme song for ""The Sound of Music""). As the rehearsals progress, fantasy and reality mix and the complications in the involvement between the young lovers end up being transposed into the show's script (a device also used in Shakespeare in Love).Between lies and the creation of a pleasant environment for the Duke, Christian and his gang lead the production of an epic show at the nightclub, a way to stay close to Satine. However, the presentation and the place itself hang by a thread when the lovers' relationship becomes too intense. What Luhrmann places in his story is receptivity to the act of loving. While the poet needs the feeling to be able to write properly, the courtesan needs to allow herself to know it. However, as in every work based on romanticism, a moralistic fatality puts everything in check.In Moulin Rouge, Baz Lurhmann offers us an unusual cocktail: tango, waltz, contemporary dance, among other styles, mix the soundtrack that mixes classical music with the polyphony of pop style, literary, cinematographic and visual arts references, which not even after, let's see, 60 or more sessions of the film, has it been possible to catalog them. The production is a festival of eccentricities, with well-crafted musical numbers, well-designed characters and a fluid and efficient narrative, thanks to the talent of the director, on the front line of production, associated with the talents that make up his team: editing, directing art and the protagonist couple, items that give the touch of charm necessary for Moulin Rouge to be considered one of the favorite films of many moviegoers.Despite the fragility and obviousness of the plot, Luhrmann manages to give the film another level thanks to the almost histrionic energy with which he tells his story. In addition to imaginative camera movements, the filmmaker rarely lets a scene go by without numerous cuts (the editing process must have been extremely strenuous for editor Jill Bilcock, who, however, managed admirably well: despite the speed of the cuts, Moulin Rouge never becomes confusing or tiring.) As if that were not enough, the production design by Catherine Martin and the costumes created by her and Angus Strathie are wonderful and create a fascinating, mythical universe.Luhrmann did not earn the title of visionary - even too pompous - for nothing. Its brand is in the concept, in the exceptional performances, in the dynamic edition, in the costumes and in the art direction signed by Catherine Martin and, also, in the fabulous idea of using a collage of contemporary songs, but set in this plot of the turn of the century. There are, in new versions, songs by Madonna, Elton John, The Police, David Bowie, Queen and even Diamonds Are Girls Best Friend, originally performed by Marilyn Monroe, cradling one of the most memorable scenes of Nicole Kidman's career.The screenwriter and director structures his screenplay based on the book The Lady of the Camellias, by Alexandre Dumas junior, which also dealt with a young bourgeois in love with a coveted Parisian courtesan. It may seem like a tireless juxtaposition of content that was originally created and just stitched together, but the Australian director reformulates them in order to integrate them in the way that suits him. And that's exactly what makes Moulin Rouge this instant classic of the musical genre: Luhrmann's vision that assembles the components and configures them according to its plot, while maintaining total respect for the source material.Between the cancan dances and the collage of references, there is room for even more memorable original songs, such as the theme Come What May, in a beautiful interpretation by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Much of the production's laurels are reserved for the protagonists, as they express great chemistry on screen. The impact of Satine's unhappy fate, elevated to melodrama by Luhrmann, takes on delicate nuances in Kidman's interpretation. Her construction of a distrustful, strong and independent Satine who, little by little, demonstrates an immense fragility hitherto hidden, justifies the various nominations for awards.Christian is played masterfully by Ewan McGregor. The subtlety in building the character, combined with the actor's vocal talent is one of the passionate requirements of the film. Baz Luhrmann carefully orchestrates the dance and music scenes between the couple, in addition to balancing drama and comedy in the scenes of Toulouse-Lautrec, the character of the great and versatile John Leguizamo, and also has an extensive supporting cast. Zilder (Jim Broadent) and the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) form a strong duo, whether together or apart, built on a purposeful caricature structure that tends to give the film the theatrical and exaggerated tone.Moulin Rouge is cinema, but it looks like a series of paintings mixed with theatrical aspects, with traces of the language of the music video, in a kind of artistic manifesto that points to cinema as the seventh art, but dismantles the structure in some parts, letting us understand where there is theater, literature, visual arts, dance and music, in a unitary way, to later put it all together again. By closing the Red Curtains Trilogy, Baz Luhrmann delivers a show rich in artistic references, a film that, to be partially unraveled, requires many years of study and analysis. In the field of cinema, references include The Sound of Music, Cabaret, Madonna: Truth or Dare, Dracula; in literature, The Lady of the Camellias, the Greek myth of Orpheus, a man cursed to spend his whole life ""singing"" to his beloved, as well as the basis of jealousy that we know through Othello, by William Shakespeare, well represented in the scene of Roxanne's Tango; on the soundtrack, David Bowie, Alessandro Safina, Christina Aguilera, Bono, Pink, among others.In short, a work for anyone who wants to love and be loved in return. A production that honors cinema and represents it as what we already know. A film for dilettantism, as well as an abysmal source of studies on cinematographic language and the arts in general, with mixed historical traits that offers us an intense lesson in cinema, literature and history. A complete and complex film.Despite all its qualities, Moulin Rouge is not a film capable of awakening unanimity. In fact, it is very likely that a good part of the public will feel bored due to the fantasy tone of the narrative or the illogical behavior of some characters - mainly those who enter the cinema expecting something more 'traditional'. The important thing here is to let yourself go, to be open to going through an innovative experience. And production also has its value and legacy. Thanks to his success, the studios decided to pay attention to musicals again, even if the examples that came later were not so brilliant (""Hairspray"", ""Into the Forest"", ""Mamma Mia""...). The fact is that it will be difficult to emulate the originality of this 2001 film, even more so in a genre that, from time to time, is stuck in conventions and is unable to cross the Broadway-Hollywood barrier (""Nine"", ""Rent"").",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visually luscious and irresistibly charming...,"Moulin Rouge is one of those movies that depend on style over substance. It is very simply a love story that has been told many times over, and throws no fresh light on said love story and provides no original insight. It has not much to do with the actual club Moulin Rouge, which serves simply as a setting for the love story the movie centers on, with a few characters drawn from history (such as the ""dwarf"" Toulouse-Lautrec) and thrown in for comical effect.That being said, the sets and costumes and saturated colors in the movie are very appealing to the eye and, combined with the rather touching romance between Satine and Christian (interesting choice of names, by the way...) and quirkiness of the characters and dance numbers, are enough to hold your attention, especially once the movie gains momentum (it comes off rather strange and random at first and takes some settling into). Nicole Kidman is, of course, dazzling in the role of the sultry Satine, and her voice is quite good. Ewan McGregor's, while not as melodic as Kidman's, is good enough to serve the movie's purposes, and I'm sure a great many women have swooned/will swoon over his character. It is impossible not to be warmed at least a little by the two's secret love, although I was not quite sure why they fell in love in the first place...The dance numbers that are drawn from an amalgamated variety of modern songs are rather tacky but manage to work (some of them are barely pulled off, in my mind, and some are quite good). ""Roxanne"" is definitely my favorite in the movie (as many people will agree), probably because it's in the more conventional and serious style of musical numbers.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, Solid but at the same time stiff","In 1899 France, a young writer named Christian (McGregor) defies his bourgeois father, leaves his family home and moves to the seedy, bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. He is taken in by Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his entourage, and is drafted to write a nightclub spectacular. Through his relationship with Toulouse, Christian meets Satine (Kidman), the most beautiful courtesan in Paris and star of the Moulin Rouge nightclub.

"Went in KNOWING I would hate it, ended up liking it!","I have seen thousands of movies, and Moulin Rouge met many of my must-NOT-see parameters, as follows:1.  I intensely dislike over-the-top lavishness. 2.  I abhor anachronistic films (like Luhrman's Romeo+Juliet). 3.  I am repelled by characters bursting into song. 4.  I am anything but a Francophile. 5.  I am not the least bit Bohemian.So Moulin Rouge should have instantly assumed a prominent place on my own personal Bottom 100 list.However, as a birthday gift to my significant other, I promised to attend the movie with an open mind and not harrumph, groan, snicker, or deride.  I steeled myself for the impending effort at self-control, and armed myself with a super-sized popcorn and soda planning on using the munching and slurping to stifle the involuntary sounds of repulsion I feared were inevitable.Much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  If nothing else, Luhrman is a man with an intense and unique vision, and impressive skills at translating that vision to the screen.  I cannot help but enjoy such unquestionable skill and artistry being displayed, whatever my predispositions.If you have reservations similar to mine, I encourage you to open your mind and give Moulin Rouge a chance...you may be surprised, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ugh!,"Well, I guess I didn't ""get it,"" since that's how everyone who loves this stinking movie explains away those of us who don't. Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" a REAL musical, made fun of ""I Will Always Love You."" ""Moulin Rouge"" pays homage to it). This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video.

Breathtaking,"Moulin Rouge! is absolutely breathtaking and takes you on such a wonderful journey that it's one you have to watch a few times.I've seen this about 20 times as I have it on DVD and every time Ewan McGregor sings Your Song, it pulls at my heartstrings. He's definitely a wonderful actor and you can really tell he put all his heart and soul into the role of Christian and Nicole as Satine was just as wonderful.Nicole has finally stepped out of the shadows and has shown the world what us Aussies have known since the 1980s.Everything about this film is pure magic, the first 20 minutes is such a rollercoaster ride and once you get past that is when the heart and soul of the film emerges.Jim Broadbent is a fine actor and is finally getting recognition - his past few roles in Moulin Rouge!, Bridget Jones' Diary and his Oscar winning performance this year for Iris not only shows us his versatility but also he puts everything into his role.The soundtracks are amazing as well with the recent release of volume 2 a winner as well and the soundtracks and movie are a definite must for adding to your collection.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Flashy and rousing, everything a musical should be","One great friend of mine used to speak of Moulin Rouge as some unforgettable musical experience, that combined with the numerous other great things I heard about this finally got me convinced to give a shot, and yes, Moulin Rouge absolutely was that experience, I've been a musical theater kid since I first watched The Wiz at 4 years old, and I think with a couple more rewatches this one will make its way onto my top 10 list.With a stacked cast featuring grade A names such as John Leguizamo (violent night + ice age) and Ewan McGregor (star wars), from the very first minute this movie captured my attention, Baz Luhrmann is very notorious for a flashy in your face style, very well seen in Elvis and Romeo and Juliet. Neither of which I was a fan of. But the style absolutely shone here, to be quite honest, I never really had an idea what was going on at all, and the lovely performances combined with the flashy style made this a brilliant experience.Combined with some of the greatest songs of all time (your song, lady marmalade) moulin rouge is an absolute must watch for any theater fan.It gets an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A strange, stylish, comedy-turned-romantic-tragedy. It's hard to put it into one genre, but as funny as it is sad, it's simply a must see.","When I first started Moulin Rouge! I felt like I was on a trip, in fact, I found it so incredibly off I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. Too strange. But then a friend of mine convinced me to give it another try, which I did, and I don't regret it. Moulin Rouge! is a hard movie to place, it's hysterically off kilter, it's depressingly sad and emotional, it's musically sensational, and it's definitely different. It tells the story of Christian (Ewan McGregor) a young poet and writer who has come to Paris in search of a job, against his fathers wishes, who warns him that he'll end up wasting his time with a Cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and that there is no such thing as 'freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things, Love.' Which is something that Christian believes in more than anything else. So then,an unconscious Argentinian falls through his roof, along with an artist named Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) (A real person, so I've heard) and herd of other rather eccentric people, trying to find a good song for their next production (Christian comes up with 'The Hills are Alive') and is then whisked away to the Moulin Rouge, an enormous night club owned by eccentric Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the main attraction being his 'Diamond Dogs'. One of his star women, Satine(Nicole Kidman), wows the stage, and is to have a private meeting with a Duke shortly after her act. Well, Christian and Toulouse have already ran into the Duke, and when Zidler points out the duke to Satine, she does not see the Duke, but rather Christian, who instead shows up at the private meeting. Sound weird enough to you? It's even weirder to see. All the music in the movie is great, but if it seems familiar, that's because all but one song (The gorgeous 'Come What May')are remixes of classic rock and stage play songs. It still sounds unique and it all matches the on screen looniness. All though it's established that Moulin Rouge! is a weird movie, it's also a very sad movie. Each character has their own unique charm, and the silliness doesn't totally leave the movie, it stays consistent, but it of course, had to be toned down to make way for the more emotional, and serious main act, which will leave you in tears. I admit, the scenes leading up to the saddest part of the movie do seem unfitting as the end is a hard blow out of a rather exciting scene, but it's clear that the comedic part has made it's end, and it's time for the main act to deal out it's sad story. The movie does what a lot can't: It provides two different stories, that remain consistent with one another. The comedy act almost always hits, with you snickering or even laughing out loud at the overall craziness of the characters, but then the romance act sneaks in, and it's genuine and true, and in some points, even does a collaborative dance with the comedy act, but the romance ends in Tragedy, which severs it's ties with the comedy, though it never loses step. It's a wonderful movie, it's funny, it's sad, it's weird, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dear to be touched,"There are few films that have affected me in the same way as Moulin Rouge does.  You rent, or go to the movies, and most of the time it is to be entertained for couple of hours, while forgetting your own struggles in life.  Here we have a film that takes you beyond that, as you will completely forget everything and you become part of a wonderful love story in a movie which is unlike anything I've ever seen.  When I first heard about Moulin Rouge, I didn't expect much.  Nicole Kidman has always disappointed me, with the only two films I've liked her in being Far and Away & Eyes Wide Shut.  Ewan McGregor has, even for his talent, not always delivered, and is Star Wars the saddest example.  To top this, I just couldn't imagine a Musical to be worth seeing.  I mean beside old films like Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, West Side Story and Grease, are there any real musicals out there?  All my doubts were swept away seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time.  It grabs you, and doesn't let go until many days later. The combination of music that we all partly know performed in a new way, the visual settings and camera work, the strange combination of comedy, drama, reality and fantasy.  All fantastically well put together, brings us a film unlike any others.  I dear to say that if you hate it, you didn't allow it to capture you, deciding rather to stay out of range, untouched and unharmed.

Both stories are set in Paris at about the same era. Both Satine and Marguerite are women who use their bodies to get what they want. This later backfires when they actually fall in love with the wrong men. Both men come from poorer backgrounds but are armed with high ideals.

brought me to tears - it's so bad!,"I haven't paid to see such a bad film in many a year.Let me start with what I liked:  Ewan McGregor is very attractive & a good actor, and I generally like John Leguizamo (although I did not like the way they portrayed Toulese-Latrec as just some gay stereotype).  The only other plus - the costumes & mise-en-scene were very well-done (although I'm sure totally inaccurate).Otherwise it was so horrible, I almost wish I had paid to see ""the Animal"" instead.  I don't like musicals, but I can usually put up with the genre. Now I could be wrong, but wasn't Ewan McGregor lip-syncing?   What pained me the most was the anachronistic use of '80's songs/song lyrics (Nirvana, Madonna & the Police to name a few) -- was just too much for me.It was the utter rejection of any realism that annoyed me.  The lovers float up among Disney-like stars & sprinkles (even their clothes change).  A gun comes out of window & flies across (a computer simulated) Paris to strike the Eiffel Tower.  I'm willing to grant a lot of poetic license (for example, a realistic victim of consumption hacking up lots of blood & completely emaciated would not have been good) - and certainly in a musical, we expect people to just randomly burst into song & dance -- but some semblance of normality would've been nice.The writing was mediocre at best.  Probably because the were dealing with a terribly trite plot.I'll spare you further and more specific complaints, because I can't bear to even contemplate this film anymore.

Wonderful One-Third of a Film,"When I was first subjected to repeated viewings of the ""Moulin Rouge"" trailer (which preceded repeated viewings of ""Memento""), I swore that I would only watch it if someone paid me, say, ten dollars to (above and beyond admission, transportation, and popcorn). It looked to be the worst of Romance and Musical distilled into one dire waste of celluloid.But then I started hearing good things.

Transcendently beautiful. A contribution to cinema.,"*Moulin Rouge* is unlike any movie you've ever seen, even though it's just like every movie you've ever seen. It is the classic tale of boy loves girl, girl loves boy, one-dimensional villain gets in the way, the lovers spout cliches, and then either they live happily ever after, one of them dies, or they both die. Somehow, though, it transcends all these cliches and becomes something magnificent.A beautiful and often hilarious movie, it will probably be criticized as being ""style over substance."" Hogwash. *Moulin Rouge* is a ride. Not a Tunnel of Love, but more like a Wind Tunnel of Love. A radio DJ said of the movie, ""It's like you stuck No-Doze in every orifice of your body and drank a Mt. Dew."" For much of the first half, this is largely true. It almost feels like you're watching a music video, with frenetic action accelerated by dozens of frenzied cuts. Luhrmann recalls the slapstick comedy of yore, complete with exaggerated pratfalls and goofy sound effects. He immerses you in this world. I turned to my friend and said, ""This is the craziest ****ing movie I've seen in a long time."" The camera...oh, the camera. It zooms in and out, and flies around the elaborate set. The film is a directorial field day for Luhrmann. He creates a fairytale world, complete with a drug-induced Green Fairy voiced by Ozzy Osbourne.Like *A Knight's Tale*, it uses anachronistic music. Although I haven't seen *A Knight's Tale*, I believe it is far more effective here. In the Moulin Rouge, music and songs from the 20th century become integrated into the world of 1900 Paris. The amazing thing is, it fits. The patrons of the cabaret chant, ""Here we are now, entertain us, we feel stupid and contagious."" Luhrmann uses the music as if it were actually in existence at that time, and by doing so, he shows the universality of it. Music is one of those universal languages, and the most universal form of all is the love song. Whether it is 1900 Paris, 1987 Chicago, or 1473 Spain, love is love. The words Madonna, Sting, Elton John, and countless others used to portray love would have been just as appropriate back then, but they never had a chance to hear them. In one brilliant sequence, Christian (Ewan MacGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) sing a dialogue about love, fluidly jumping from love song to love song, lyric to lyric. They don't sing these songs as songs; they sing them like they *mean* them. It is like a very trippy musical.The fact that Luhrmann pulls together a great deal of love songs is the key to appreciating the movie, because the love between Christian and Satine is idealized. It simply comes into existence and is there in its purest form between them, without logic, without sense. Over and over again, we are reminded that above all, this story is about love. And it really is *about* love. It is love in cinematic form. It is a visual and aural representation of what love is, what it means, and how important it is to human beings.The movie would not be able to get this across if Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman (looking more beautiful than ever) did not give incredible performances. You can see it in their eyes. You feel their pain. You feel their happiness. The supporting cast supports, as well it should. Jim Broadbent (Gilbert in *Topsy Turvy*) plays the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler. John Leguizamo is real-life midget artist Toulouse-Lautrec, a character I believe is akin to Shakespeare's Fool. And all of the cast can sing unexpectedly well, from a hilariously lyricized can-can to a hilarious ""Like a Virgin,"" from beautiful love songs to a disturbingly appropriate ""Roxanne.""The music is wonderful, from the orchestral score to the electronica. I advise you to stay and watch the closing credits, not only because you get to hear more music but also because it's not your typical black screen/white letters crawl, and it gives some predictable but appreciated closure at the end.All in all, *Moulin Rouge* grabs you and hits you with the sheer power of itself. When the movie ended, the audience was completely silent. I couldn't really speak. I felt like I felt at the end of *Requiem for a Dream*, except less like I was about to die and more like I had just been handed a transcendent feeling to simply experience, enjoy, and learn from. It is the best new movie I've seen since *Memento*, and as this looks like a slow year for great movies, look for it come Oscar time. Go see it. Now.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great if a little bit shorter...,"I was dragged to this movie by a girlfriend so, needless to say, I wasn't expecting much of anything.  While I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" I wasn't part of the masses of people that thought it was a towering achievement.  Before I saw MR, I heard they were using current pop songs (""Like a virgin,""""Roxanne"") in the soundtrack and was very skeptical. Well I must say is was much better than I expected, and just about all the pop songs fit very well, with the possible exception of ""Like a virgin,"" which was totally unnecessary.  I actually liked this film a lot, and was very happy that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang their own parts.  The visual style displayed is key, but not the only drawing point, and therefore works well within the context of the famous French nightclub.  My only complaint really was that it was about 20 minutes too long.

A screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story,"I did not like Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it and I realized why when I visited the exhibit in the Washington, DC National Gallery ""Toulouse - Lautrec and Monmartre"" last April and saw close to 200 paintings, posters, etchings, prints, and other works of one of the most original, ironic, and insightful painters ever.No one was able to capture Monmartre the way Toulouse-Lautrec did - its raucous spirit, unbridled energy, tawdry behavior, garish colors, and provocative celebrities. Lautrec's works are filled with the unique atmosphere of daring, racy Monmartre of the late 1890s. To make a film about Moulin Rouge which is inseparable from Monmarte and to present a stupid caricature, the ridiculous and pathetic marionette that (for some unknown to me reasons) was called Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec and to take away the mood, the atmosphere and substitute them with loud, senseless mess - was unforgivable. I bought a CD in the Museum shop with the original Moulin Rouge songs and music that were written during the ""Belle Époque"". Even though some of them sound a little funny and naive today, they are natural, they are not the fakes that were used in the movie and were supposed to represent the sound of Monmartre of the years long gone.Well, the DVD was on the shelf in the library where I volunteer every Saturday and I decided to give the movie the second chance. I should not have done it. I watched about 20 minutes, and that was all I could take. I remember from the first time that ""Roxanne"" was filmed well and I found and watched the scene again. I like the song and the dancing but I hated how they had to squeeze Kidman in there. The big part of me not accepting the movie is that I don't see Kidman's talent in this particular movie, I don't like her acting, and she irritated me most of the time. There are more things about ""Moulin Rouge"" that I don't like. I hate the story; I hate the stupid dialogs about ""summer of love"". Cancan is a very sexy dance and well performed it would take your breath away. Whatever they called cancan in the movie was not unlike the group of cows performed on the scene.What a screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story/whatever. This was my second time, and that's it.Time Magazine said, ""You've never seen anything like it!"" - Indeed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"My daring ENCOUNTER with ""MOULIN ROUGE""","It must be said that  a standing ovation, and world-wide recognition must be given to someone who had a great influence on the outcome of this film....And the award goes too...... (drumroll please).....The amazing, the fantastic, the incredible.....PLASTIC SURGEON who worked on Nicole's b@@bies! YAY! CHEERS! WHOO-HOO!! AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!! A masterful job if there ever was oneThose two inspired me to continue to watch from beginning to end - through all the sappy-yet-sometimes-really-cool love songs, the ridiculous casting of Ewan McBoringCantSingSoTheyDubbedOverWithTheVoiceofA20YearOldSopranoWhoSoundsNothingLikeMeGregor, and the greased-lightning fast camera cuts through the opening 20 minutes. Yes, through it all, there they stood, proud, magnificent, defiant, and against the wind like a bulwark to a raging storm.Unfortunately, the film got better. And better. And better. Soon I found myself in a quandry.....torn between staring at the close-ups of Nicole, or ACTUALLY paying attention to the increasingly interesting film. Understanding there was no way I could preform both at the same time, alas, I eventually gave in and watched the movie, knowing full well that I would never overreach yonder mountains in this lifetime anyway. Undaunted, I proudly went back to the guys at the office, held my head up high and said..YES! I sat through an entire MUSICAL....and I LIKED it!Suffice it to say that all in all, they,...um... I mean.. it, was indeed, a Spectacular Spectacular!! >:-)",,Anonymous,Romance
Ten times better than Chicago!!!,"I can't believe the fuss this year about Chicago when Moulin  Rouge was so much more inventive and exciting. There was really only one good song in Chicago, All that Jazz, and I was disappointed that they didn't repeat it at the end!  What a waste. The other songs were so-so.  But Moulin Rouge just exploded.  The cast was magnificent.  I think I have seen this about five times on cable and I still enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The parallels between Moulin Rouge and Children of Paradise,"Two movies that sit near the top of my all-time list are ""Moulin Rouge"" and the French movie, ""Children of Paradise"". The parallels between the two movies are beyond coincidence.""Children of Paradise"" was released in 1946 after WWII as two movies made out of one, primarily because of its extreme length. It was made during the Nazi occupation in France in 1945, and was set on the Boulevard of Crime in Paris, in 1820. Many of the actors were Nazi collaborators, because the Germans were oversaw the production of the movie. The French who made the movie were mostly unfriendly to the Germans so many of the actors were also members of the resistance.The two main characters, like the two main characters in ""Moulin Rouge"", include a timid, shy artist, Baptiste, and a prostitute, Garance. She becomes an actress by the direct influence of the shy artist. As the movie develops the courtesan ends up as a courtesan to a Duke, even though she is in love with the shy artist.Finally Garance rejects the Duke, in this case many years later, and goes back to the artist. They finally consummate their love, but then are tragically torn apart, once more.As with Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"", at least two other men are in love with the courtesan, Garance, and have their lives dramatically changed because of their attraction and commitment to her.Arletty, the actress who played Garance, was banned from French cinema for 10 years after the war because she was judged a Nazi collaborator. She had a relationship with a Nazi Colonel during the war.While the plots of the two movies a not exactly the same, the flavor of the movies are particularly similar. Both are set in front of and behind the stage. The action within the scenes in both movies is complex and diverse, as in a non-stop carnival. Dancers and acrobats, aristocrats and beggars fill the stages of both movies in wild celebration.Beneath the surface, within the story lines, deceit and jealousy are played with a richness seldom seen in film.Truth, beauty, freedom and love are questioned and examined, and finally, perhaps, found to be fleeting, at best.The children of Paradise lived 79 years before the children of the Revolution, yet they lived in the same place, lived the life of the theater and suffered the same agony of love.""Children of Paradise"" is considered by many as the best film ever made in France. In 1947 it was nominated for ""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"" by the Acedamy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best film in years,"Not since The English Patient circa 1996 have I experienced a story that resonated with all of the classical romantic emotions - perfectly arranged.What a brilliant work of art.  The sets, the music, the script, the acting, and, most of all, the direction was flawless.A friend of mine who saw it could not get past the use of contemporary music in the film.  Too bad.  Besides buttressing an argument that love is timeless (affecting our view of the past and the future), the contemporary songs added much to the film.It has been over a month since I saw Moulin Rouge for the first time, and I still find myself humming its musical arrangements.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Emperor has no clothes,"Never mind about polarising the reviewers (or at least the professional ones) - this movie polarised me. The production is spectacular and lavish, the set design is outstanding but stylistically I was left cold.It's not entirely Baz's fault. He's more of an addict than a pusher, even though I know it was him sliding the needle under my skin. I felt dirty and used, even as (or because) I enjoyed the spectacular. Was I being cynically exploited (as other reviewers have suggested) by someone that was simply out to sell a product, or was I being offered something that the purveyor believed was a valuable insight into the inner workings of society?I can cope - cringeworthy as it was at the time - with 'The hills are alive with the sound of music'. I have more trouble with the love scenes. It appears that both Christian and Satine are incapable of expressing their emotions except through the regurgitation of lyrics from popular music. I find it hard to empathise with characters who pledge their undying love for on another by using phrases equivalent to 'In the words of Dolly Parton, ""I will always love you""'. To be sure, musicals are based around scenes where emotions are expressed in songs, but they also have love scenes where the characters talk to each other rather than quote each other song lines.I am not immune to having had a song stuck in my head, or to associating songs with emotions and relationships. However, I do not confuse the song for the feelings. If being a romantic is shorthand for ringing up radio stations to get them to play 'our song', I'd have to say that I'm not a romantic. To me, being romantic involves a lot more - and at the very least it means refusing to express emotions at second-hand, which I see as a form of dishonesty.Baz's characters are emotional vampires, with no emotion but what they can suck from the carcass of popular culture. Maybe that was done deliberately. Maybe Baz meant this film as a satire on our obsession with living life vicariously. Certainly the overall effect was of a caricature, something larger than life - a fairy tale romance - which our post-modern sensibilities will judge as no more than pleasing fiction. The problem is that everyone has to be in on the joke for this to work properly.I feel that the film faultlessly panders to the lowest common denominator, where love becomes its own caricature and is debased in the process. Technically the film is a work of art, but it ends up feeling like a rock video clip - all style and no substance. I liked this film but hated doing so. Maybe the style was a cynical attempt to manipulate the audience. Maybe Baz believes that there is nothing new to be said artistically and that all new art can be no more that pastiches of existing works. In any case, I was left in awe of the technical achievements but untouched emotionally.I'm giving this a score of 6/10. That said, I think that it's a great film - possibly a classic, and it makes me wonder why I've given better scores to worse films. See it and marvel. Just don't leave your brains at the theatre door.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Must See!,"This is an excellent movie, but not for all. You have to be very open-minded as Moulin Rouge was directed by Baz Luhrmann. He is a directing genius, but puts a twist to his filming that some movie goers might find ""too weird"". If you like unique films, this is the one to watch! Also, the score is wonderful. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are amazing! My favorite movie ever-- I'm obsessed with Moulin Rouge!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm not sure,"What to think of it ? Moulin Rouge mixes times and cultures with no respect of anything, and it's fun. Seeing the mythic Zidler, Moulin Rouge's owner, singing Madonna's ""like a virgin"" song to fool a jealous duke, yes, it's fun. Some visual effects are brilliant, really, and Kylie Minogue, in her twenty seconds cameo as a ""absynth spirit"" is great too. The whole decoration is great too. Now the bad thing : the storyline is simple, but at no moment I wanted to believe in it, I never felt concerned with the love story, Nicole Kidman plays like a fish : wet big eyes but a few expressivity (maybe not her fault : the role is not very well written). The camera does too much slow motions, it makes go sea sick. Sometimes, the camera can't stay showing a still thing more than one second and that is not very enjoyable too. I'm sure this mvie could have been much much better with a real director : Luhrmann has strong visions, good ideas (too much ideas maybe), but he is not a great director for me, I felt exactly the same with Romeo+Juliette. This movie can go in the same box as ""le pacte des loups"" (brotherhood of the wolves) : funny, better than a waste but far from the masterpiece some calls it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A joy for the eyes, a joy for the ears","If you are looking for a tricky plot that makes you think about it over and over again all night long, please rent a David Lynch movie and forget about Moulin Rouge. But if you are willing to give your eyes and your ears a brand new experience that will make everything else look and sound a bit dusty, this is the right movie. The simple plot which we can find in every classical opera involving an impossible love and some kind of nasty disease, has been enhanced up to the limit with incredibly luxurious settings, gorgeous costumes, a powerful soundtrack and an eye-striking editing. Moulin Rouge actually does not have any original content to offer - as said, the plot is so classical that it gets dangerously close to being naive, and in the soundtrack you will find only one original song, the others being elaborated covers to hits from the 70s, the 80s and the 90s - but this ""nothing original"" is presented to the audience in such a beautiful, witty, colorful, even redundant way that you cannot do anything but watch and be pulled into this fantastic world where nothing is important but Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love. The Bohemian Revolution is here, and nothing will be the same again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Two trains full of confetti, colliding head on","What a mess!  Director Baz Luhrmann takes every known cinematic gimmick, tosses them all into a food processor, and splatters the mixture all over the screen like a would-be Jackson Pollock.  It's loud, brash, colorful, relentless, and doesn't make a lick of sense.  The result is a musical that seems to take place at no particular time, and in no (despite the name) particular place.  There's nothing here that even remotely evokes either Paris or credibility, and character development is nonexistent.  Ewan McGregor meets Nicole Kidman, mutters a few Bernie Taupin lyrics to her, and she immediately declares that she's ""in love.""  Uh, right.  The next 100 minutes consists of various characters engaging in routine and stereotypical melodrama, singing bits and pieces of twentieth century pop songs to one another with songs rarely being sung in their entirety.The ""Like a Virgin"" sequence rivals the ""Officer Krupke"" sequence from ""West Side Story"" as perhaps the worst three minutes ever presented in a musical film.The conclusion of the story is totally unmoving, since you don't know the main characters well enough to care about them.  When it's over, you just sit there wondering why you paid good money to be visually and aurally assaulted for 126 minutes.On the plus side, Luhrmann's use of color is impressive.  Kidman looks absolutely radiant, and she and McGregor both sing surprisingly well.  The opening credits are quite clever.I'd have been tempted to give this film a rating of zero, but the film is so emotionally uninvolving that I just didn't care about it or any of its characters enough to hate it that much.  2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
I want to be Nicole Kidman,"I loved this movie.  It's original, innovative, stunning to look at and spectacularly entertaining.  It also allows Nicole Kidman to showcase a wonderful array of talents.  Funny, sexy and heartbreakingly tragic she sings, dances, falls in love and all in the most amazing costumes. McGregor provides solid back up as the romantic poet and writer, whilst Jim Broadbent is his excellent self as Harold Zidler, the Moulin Rouge's owner.  His version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' is a comic highlight.  Only John Leguizamo (as Toulouse Lautrec) didn't quite work for me.  But this all pales into insignificance when Kidman is on the screen.  She dominates the movie like a Hollywood diva of yesteryear.  I know this isn't the sort of movie that usually wins Oscars but what more does a girl have to do.",,Anonymous,Romance
Of course the story is easy!,"I was reading some comments and I just couldn't believe there are still people out there saying: ""Lots of show, no substance... The story is worthless... Why does Satine fall in love with Christian after just one song... Unrealistic..."" Aaargh! I'm gonna direct this comment to those people: What are you, stupid?! When you heard the story of Romeo and Juliette for the first time, did you think ""How unrealistic, they only know each other for two seconds and already they're in love.""? It's supposed to be unrealistic, it's one of those dramatic love stories!Of course the story is simple,  of course it's a corny, over the top musical with silly love songs in it and a predictable ending. That was the whole point! It's supposed to play on the human emotion in the easiest way there is; with music, dance and simple but beautiful lines. You have to enjoy the singing and the dancing, you have to smile when they get each other, you have to cry when she dies, you have to get goosebumps during the final of the tango/Roxanne, you have to be dazzled by the colours and costumes. It's a show, a wonderful, cheerful, uplifting, easy for the eye and ear show!

"Wonderfully over the top, camp fun...","Moulin Rouge was surely a better film than Ron Howard's TV movie of the week weepie that eventually garnered a Best Picture Oscar in 2001 (A Beautiful Mind, in case you've blocked memories of THAT abomination out of your mind) and the fact that Baz Luhrmann failed to even secure a Best Director nomination in the face of such a low-grade 'true story' speaks volumes about the Academy.Lurhmann's film is a colourful swirl of song and dance, with Nicole Kidman giving a dazzling (and surprisingly good) performance as the doomed Satine, while Ewan McGregor acquits himself well as usual, even if neither of the lead actors can sing particularly well. That, however, is half the fun of Moulin Rouge -- where the characters break into song, the singing talents (or lack thereof) of the actors gives the re-modelled song numbers (Diamond Dogs, Children of the Revolution, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Roxanne, Lady Marmalade, etc) a fun, almost spontaneous feel.It's a wonderfully inventive pastiche of the musical genre that deserves the recognition and success it received upon release.

Absolutely Amazing,"I absolutely love this movie! I have to admit that for the first twenty minutes or so, I was thinking to myself ""what in the heck is going on here?"" But I stayed to watch the whole thing and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did. Not only is the acting amazing, but the singing was out of this world! Who knew Nicole Kidman could sing like that (I sure couldn't, especially if I was hanging from a trapeze at the same time...) and I repeatedly listen to Ewan's songs (his voice just makes me fall in love with him). The story just rips your heart out (in the best possible way) and I think I've watched it so many times that I can pretty much talk along with the movie (I'm just a little bit of a movie geek...).

The beauty of the script was undeniable, the huge theme of love throughout the play almost had me in tears at it's beauty.

Excellent. Honest and sweet in a way few movies dare.,"I liked some of the songs from the soundtrack and borrowed the DVD from a friend to see what the movie was like. Some would maintain that it's not a true musical in the sense of classics like Singin' In the Rain and West Side Story, and they're probably right, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining if you give it a chance. For all its pop-culture borrowing and frantic presentation it stays true to its message, simple though it is, and avoids descending into the tedious self-mockery and cynicism so common to many modern movies. It's really surprisingly sweet, honest, and moving. It may seem strange to say that a movie like this takes itself seriously, but it's true, and it shows. On top of that, the movie is beautifully made and everyone in the cast does an excellent job. I really enjoyed it, and I'll be buying my own DVD to watch it again.",,Anonymous,Romance

The mixture of modern songs, big production musical numbers, gorgeous stars like Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman doing their own singing (good enough: they aren't as good as Meryl Streep in ""Postcards from the Edge""), and editing tricks thanks to computer animation just had me sitting wide-eyed in appreciation. I would give this part of the movie an 8 or a 9 on the IMDb scale of 10.However, then comes the second half of the movie. Early on, two or more songs are sung simultaneously (I remember particularly ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"") in such a way that works beautifully. But later, in a scene where 3 or 4 songs are sung in this way, the trick loses its magic and it sounds as if everyone is just screaming the lyrics. The story's superficiality also begins to take its toll on the film in the second half. The last 30 minutes are especially difficult to watch due to an excessively complicated plot and a drawn out finale.But at least Ewan McGregor emerges from the movie unscathed.

The production design is spectacular as is the costume design. The visual effects are brilliant. It's colourful and dazzling. It feels original.

Well yes, if by reinvention you mean 'no melodies' and 'snatches of pop song lyrics thrown around like confetti'.Some would argue the film is refreshing, and in some ways it is because the cast and director are plainly doing whatever they think is fun, but I found it to be like a four year old with a toy: it's fun for him but bloody annoying for you because he's so loud.This is a bloody mess of a movie, and I'm usually very open-minded.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

There isn't one scene that lasted long enough for my eyes to focus on it. The mix of songs, some stolen from other musicals, were staged in a blend of people and animation, and are awful. Though I was surprised to find that Nicole can really sing, while her costar cannot.The story is taken from the real life of an actual French dancer, but what is in reality a tragedy of life cut short is here made into a comic travesty.It's a different style film than others before it, but different doesn't mean better.

Brilliant.  Spectacularly Brilliant.,"Never have I seen such a movie that was so spectacular.  To me, Moulin Rouge! is the epitome of the modern musical.  I think that Baz Luhrmann is an incredible genius to have revitalized the musical in films today, succeeding where many others have failed (i.e., Woody Allen). It begins as a story about a penniless English writer named Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, goes to Paris to be inspired, circa 1900.  He is befriend by Toulouse Lautrec, played by John Leguizamo, and introduces him to the decadence that is the Moulin Rouge nightclub. There he falls in love with a courtesan named Satine, played by Nicole Kidman.  It is a beautiful musical, and the movie takes you on a whirlwind of colors and songs, sometimes letting you forget that Satine and Christian are doomed lovers to begin with.I'm surprised that this movie didn't pick up an Oscar for Nicole, especially for Best Picture, instead losing out to the particularly bland 'A Beautiful Mind'.  I'm also surprised that the Academy didn't even nominate Baz Luhrmann with an Oscar for Best Director, and the biggest crime that they committed was not even mentioning Ewan's brilliant performance.Even Nicole has talent in her ways, and this was probably her first most noticeable role as a leading lady, it is Ewan who truly carries the film.  You can see throughout the film there are times where she's unsure of herself, being in a musical, especially when she's singing, but it is for Ewan that you most sympathize with.  He is the one who is able to handle best the flexibility of the many emotions of Moulin Rouge!, and is the most talented vocally.Many people were astonished to hear that these actors could sing.  I wasn't that surprised when it came to Ewan McGregor, because I had heard him sing briefly in 1996's Emma.  Even Sir Elton John was so amazed by Ewan's performance of his song, 'Your Song' that he predicted that he could have a very successful career as a recording artist.And of course, there will be endless comparisons with Moulin Rouge! and Chicago, especially after this year with Chicago picking up several Oscar awards.  People have critiqued Moulin Rouge! as extreme, and unoriginal.  I guess it's because that historical references being dated into more modern movies is something that Baz Luhrmann has done before.  I honestly feel that Moulin Rouge! in its own way, more original than Chicago.  The only thing that is unoriginal, are the songs, in my opinion.  Chicago the musical, itself has been around for decades, and some consider the film a revival, not a new idea.Also Baz has explained in the past, fearing that his 'musical' would not be accepted, saying that one of the reasons he used modern pop songs in his movie was to carry it mainstream.  He felt that he had to use modern songs, for a musical to be accepted in modern society.And of course there were times that I felt when they broke into song, i.e., 'Like a Virgin', it felt a bit silly.  And I remember watching in the movie theater, when they started with 'Roxanne', people were giggling in the audience; when it was supposed to be a serious moment in the film, referring to the disastrous effects when you ""fall in love with a woman who sells herself.""  Of course there were beautiful moments and songs in the movie, like with its only original song, 'Come what may'.  There will be times that it might upset the audience, but according to Baz, he has his reasons for it.I can only hope that Baz can continue making musical movies like this, because Moulin Rouge! is one of my favorite movies of all time, regardless of how many times I've seen it.  No one else can make decadence look this glamorous; and rarely",,Anonymous,Romance
"""The greatest thing you will ever learn is to Love, and be Loved in return""--Christian","First Baz, the director did ""Strictly Ballroom"", then ""William Shakespeare's--Romeo+Juliet"" for a sequel and for a trilogy. Can he make a musical movie without screwing up?...YES HE CAN CAN CAN! YES HE CAN CAN CAN! Moulin Rouge is the best musical movie I have ever seen in my 17years of existance here on Earth. This should be the number one musical ever instead of that West Side Story one. Nicole and Ewan did a wonderful job in this movie. Actually Ewan is my favourite actor and knowing that he's in this movie made me even more desperate to see this. Nicole Kidman is so sexy, no matter what her costume is, she is so hot! I really like the songs they put in this movie especially the *Elephant Medley* and *Come What May* The song with an Indian singer & Nicole for the last half is so cool. Every time I hear that song I feel like dancing! 'Cause this movie so good, I bought it on DVD. Buy or rent this movie people, this is the movie that will make you watch it over and over again.

"At first a fast paced journey into Paris, then it slows down into a timeless tale about forbidden love.","This movie was so brilliant, I was shocked to see how America's response to this film was minor. This is a new age movie set in old times, yet it squeezes your heart and makes you want to get up and sing. It takes you on an adventure that no other film could possibly match up to. Moulin Rouge is a wonderful mix of comedy and love, but it is mostly about the deep love that kepps the two main characters, Satine and Christian, bound together despite the odds. Nicole Kidman is getting every ounce of recognition she deserves for her leading role, but I feel that Ewan McGregor is getting cheated for his spectacular performance. If anything he should have received the award for Best Actor In a Musical Or Comedy at the Golden Globes. Moulin Rouge should have gotten more attention than A Beautiful Mind, and all Moulin Rouge fans know it. THis film is a feast for the eyes and an opener of the soul.

Just the way it was made, all the colours, dancing and music were brilliant itself. But also all the acting was amazing too.

"Silly, campy fun that could have been a lot better","Well, I definitely didn't hate Moulin Rouge like I feared but there were times I felt like hiding my head with a blanket. In all honesty, if you get through the first 15 or so minutes and see what they are doing, you find yourself getting into this rather silly but still fun flick.I had a few complaints though - the frenetic camera movement (particularly in the beginning scenes), the really absurd added touches such as a fake moon smiling and others, and the inability to slow down to see the characters create the story rather than have to narrate what is going on.This is absolutely not a film for everyone.  I can see where the novelty of the film is a real positive and the special effects were amazing. Sure, the story has been done a billion times but it's a good story if a little saccharine.  I don't mind mush as long as it's honest mush - this film struck me as being honest mush.I liked the acting overall but this is the sort of film that didn't really call for heavy acting from the leads which was a little disappointing.  Jim Broadbent has been one of my favorites for a while and I thought he did a great job.  I've always found myself impartial to Ewan McGregor and I just enjoy watching him on screen period.  I thought both he and Nicole Kidman had ""okay"" voices but I think if you took away some of the echoing and effects, they would have sounded a bit flat.   It almost looked like Kidman was lip-synching in a few scenes which I'm sure she was.I give it an ""A"" for effort and I loved the originality - parts of the film were quite memorable and good.  But it just wasn't enough to sustain an entire film and it sort of missed it with the frenetic editing, the over simplified story, and too silly, cringeable touches.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wishing I'd seen Freddy Got Fingered instead,"It is very suspicious situation when a director's last two movies are virtually stolen from the creative genius of others as Baz Luhrmann's Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and now Moulin Rouge can attest to.  That said, Moulin Rouge was the type of theater experience in which your literally dying to go home and read the 6000 page War and Peace, read the entire 20,000 page IRS tax book, or rent the bottom 100 of all time film Freddy Got Fingered.Nicole Kidman was visibly embarrassed when her selected scene as Satine was shown at the Academy Awards.  And rightly so because the scene displayed exactly what she did throughout the entire Moulin Rouge debacle which was pant uncontrollably, fake orgasms, and lip synch songs that were better left behind to the forgettable 1980's.  I'm not sure I've ever seen an actress nominated in a lead role for using so little dialogue.  What an embarrasment to see Nicole Kidman contending with the likes of Halle Berry (she lifted Monster's Ball single-handedly to greatness) and Sissy Spacek (A difficult role for a gifted actress in In the Bedroom).  And a word of advice to Ewan McGregor-you were miscast here and you'd be wise to stick to better roles like the one you had in Trainspotting.The most notorious thing I noticed in Moulin Rouge was how much I cringed in embarrassment for the gifted Jim Broadbent as a pimp daddy of sorts. This grandfather and Academy Award winner has always picked good roles (excellent British comedy shows, Bridget Jone's Diary, Iris) and why he relented to Baz Luhrmann I'll never know.  I can only surmise that he is desperately trying to pay the mortgage on his 15- million dollar brownstone and was forced to stoop to this level.  If only the relentless camera hadn't been so motivated to capture his oddly made-up face quite so closely.Whoever signed off on virtually making a mockery of Kurt Cobain's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" better be prepared to hear it from Kurt in heaven.  I thought Madonna was smart enough to sell her songs to the highest bidder with some class, but she must have thought that Moulin Rouge reminded her of the good ole' days when she wore those pathetic cone bras and thought the world bowed only to her.Moulin Rouge has an awfully high rating of 8.7 on the IMBD and I can only surmise that a bunch of little Brittany Spears-wannabe 10 year old's voted about a 100 times each.  Never has a film stolen so much from previous songs, previous movies, previous musicals, and called itself inventive and inspired.  The only thing inventive is the gold-digging scheme undertaken by Baz Luhrmann to produce and direct trash and market it as real art.If you want to watch a film that reinvented the musical with a classic work (Romeo and Juliet) but original songs, go rent the amazing West Side Story (1961) starring the deceased but incredible Natalie Wood.  Not only is it a piece on race but it's a new idea.  And yes, it thankfully lacks a slowly turning red wind mill.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

This certainly wasn't what I expected it would be,"I probably don't have to tell you what the Moulin Rouge really is and where it can be found. It's one of the most famous cabarets in the world and even today it still breaths an atmosphere of decadence, eroticism and freedom. This of course had to be the subject of a movie sooner or later and in 2001 it finally happened. ""Moulin Rouge!"" saw its first (stage) light and caused a little shock wave in the world of cinema.At the turn of the 19th and 20th century a young English poet named Christian, comes to Paris to pursue an unpaid, but free career as a Bohemian writer. Soon he meets a group that asks him to write a musical for them, which they will perform in the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. When he goes for the very first time to that famous night club, he immediately falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Satine. Satine thinks he's 'The Duke', the man she has to please, because her boss expects a lot of money for him so he can build a new and proper theater. The Duke seems to be willing to give him that money, but he has one request: he wants exclusive access to the favors of Satine, who doesn't have any problem with that, because she finally wants to become a proper actress in a proper theater. And normally that request shouldn't pose any problem, but in the meantime Satine has done something no courtesan should ever do: she has fallen in love with Christian. This is the beginning of a dramatic love story that sooner or later will end in a tragedy...I loved the fact that this movie wanted to give an idea of how the Moulin Rouge looked like in the early nineteen hundreds. I'm very interested in that time period and I was really looking forward to it. And exactly that was MY biggest mistake, because this movie hasn't got much to do with the history of the Moulin Rouge or the people who worked there. This movie isn't much more but an extremely fast paced, almost video clip like, vehicle for popular pop songs from the last fifty years that have been slightly renewed. Sure it all has a modern and slick feeling, but it also gave me the impression of a hollow shell. It almost felt like this was made for all those Americans who don't know anything about Europe, but who love flashy shows and fast consumption and who find everything great and lovely, as long as they don't have to think too much ...This movie never really gives you a moment to catch a breath, to come back to your senses. It's a constant whirlpool of emotions, music and spectacular events. I know many people love that (if you check the percentage of people that gave this movie a 10, you'll get an idea), but for me personally it didn't really work. I might even say that it sometimes started to work on my nerves. Still, not everything about the movie was bad. The chemistry between Satine and Christian felt real thanks to the nice performances of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I never thought those two would ever from a couple in a movie, but I must say that it really worked. So definitely no complaints about that.As a conclusion I want to add that it is a good thing that the genre of the musical isn't dead yet. It has always had a spot in the history of cinematography and it should have one in the future as well. But I have my doubts about the fact if this is the best way to go. Every day we are flooded by millions of video clips on TV stations like MTV, do we really need that in a movie as well??? Personally I don't think so and that's why I give this movie a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Revels in its ridiculousness, and that's not a bad thing","Baz Luhrmann knows he's going to look foolish. So does Nicole Kidman. So does Ewan MacGregor. By the end of the first half hour of this film the entire cast and crew has tried very hard to bring themselves to meet your very definition of the most utter foolishness you can imagine. Then they go past it. So, the question is, are you going to take this film for what it is -- an absurdist satire on cynicism, if you can believe that -- or just think it nothing more than ridiculous? I decided to go with it and had two-thirds of a great time. You know exactly where the plot's going, you know how it's going to end, you know with all the silly archetypes you've been introduced to that it's going to have nothing but either flamboyant or sincere melodrama at the outcast. I laughed hysterically at this film, but I think it knew I was laughing at it. In fact the movie almost dares you to ridicule it, then tops your ridicule with a cherry and does the next most ridiculous thing you can imagine. I admire its audacity. It was laughing back at me. I can handle that. Really the only big drag about the film was the length of the ending and how it probably took itself a little more seriously than it had to at that part, but hell, you knew going in that it was melodramatic, didn't you? Frankly, I admire its nerve. That counts a lot for me. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Spectacular (but also very sad) show !,"Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I must definitely say that Moulin Rouge! is a very unconventional movie, when it comes to this specific genre, and with that it immediately caught my attention. Even though it tells a truly saddening story, it's mostly presented in a very joyful manner, with spectacular performances and great dance-and-sing acts.Christopher, a young English writer, arrives in Paris in order to follow the Bohemian Revolution that started in the city's underground world. However, after he is introduced to the prostitute and drug infested community things start to spiral out of control. He meets a beautiful courtesan Satine and deep affection soon follows. The romance takes a hold of this young couple, but nothing can be complete without a few problems on the road. Mainly, the Duke, the sponsor of the whole play, has a thing for Satine too. And in order for the great performance to come to fruition she has to stop running around with Christopher and give in to Duke's filthy desiresIt's amazing that through this simple story Baz Luhrmann is able to depict the harsh truth about our lives. Even if we love someone dearly and with all our hearts, there can always be someone to stand in our way. Someone richer and more powerful and who is actually able to buy his dreams instead of working to achieve them. And even being able to withhold this obstacle may be not enough, as the movie sadly shows.Funny thing is that the first 15 or 20 minutes make an impression that the movie is going to be weirdly psychedelic. The use of light, colors, fast camera movements and, most of all, eerie characters, provide for an unforgettable experience. Still, a few moments later there is a sudden change of pace and the movie takes on a new turn to make it more dramatic. And this is a recurring motive in this picture.The music in Moulin Rouge is very enjoyable and fun to listen, due to many very clever mash- ups of famous songs by world-renown artists, including Madonna, Queen, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe and even Nirvana. The versions written for Moulin Rouge! give those songs a brand new twist, and are actually very entertaining.The movie also makes a great use of various camera techniques, especially of regular close close-ups and numerous swirls and spins, to give the picture an avant-garde feeling.Great acting by young Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is the true quality, which shapes the overall appearance of this film. There are some fantastic (and erotic) sequences that may deliver many laughs. However, the scene, which represents the brilliance of these two actors, is contained in the big finale - the great and fabulous theatrical show, which ends in a huge tragedy. There aren't many pictures, where you'll find such a passionate scene of unbearable and tragic loss, accompanied by such loud cries of helplessness. A true tearjerker.Overall, I would like to say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and as a proof of it look at the trend that may be observed throughout the first decade of the 21st century: after Moulin Rouge!'s success many musical features started appearing all around the world. And they still are. That's the power of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Muppets would have made it better!,"This movie was tacky, garish, and derivative.  I say to those who ""love it"", have you people seen a real musical with original music?  Like maybe ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Grease"", ""The Sound of Music""?  Pick any Disney musical from the past fifty years and it would be better than this nonsensical mess.  The only way I can think to make it better would be to turn it into a Muppet movie.  Miss Piggy would be a much better Satine (as she would say, ""at least Moi can speak in a French accent"").  Kermit would be Christian and Fozzy (Waka, Waka, Waka!) would make a great Zidler. Mix in some ""humans"" like Dabney Coleman or Elliot Gould as the Duke.  Gonzo would make a terrific Toulouse-Lautrec and Rowlf (a dog) would be the perfect Narcoleptic Argentinean. I'm telling you Dr. Teeth and Rizzo Rat would fit this movie like a glove.

There's no need to edit like this, it's worse than Michael's Bay cutting. Just because you can edit so quick doesn't mean you should. I know that the director wanted the film to be hyper but please!

Beneath the Sensory Extravaganza there is More than Meets the Eye,"Moulin Rouge, for me, is one of those unique films that cannot fully be appreciated until it is viewed for at least a second, and maybe a third time.  After my first encounter with Moulin Rouge I found myself making the usual comments:  Colorful, lively soundtrack, fine performances, but at times visually distracting and unnerving, but an overall good movie that I enjoyed.  But after a second viewing, I discovered so much, much more.Beneath the soundtrack, slick editing, elaborate costuming and eclectic sets is, at heart, a simplistic, emotional love story.  That the plot is simplistic and not terribly original cannot be denied.  However, like most great stories, it is this simplicity that allows the performers to carry the show, to utterly convince us that this story is important and worth telling. Plot complexity would merely distract from the emotional, sincere portrayals given by the cast.  It is the performances and director Baz Luhrman's willingness to capitalize on them rather than subjugate them to visual frenzy that transform Moulin Rouge from a fun song and dance number into poetic filmmaking.Ewan McGregor is perfect as the idealistic, hopeful romantic who woos the world (and Satine) with his song.  He is unafraid to expose himself as an actor emotionally and whimsically.  Jim Broadbent as Zidler is clever and witty with just enough bombast to make us like a character who at his core should not be very likable.  And Richard Roxburgh does a fine job in the end of turning what could have been a prototypical ""foppish bad guy"" into a more complicated villain with real pain of his own.  All the actors sing effectively (particularly Kidman and McGregor) and they use the songs not as an interruption to entertain us, but to further the story in an effective, emotional way.Ultimately, in this writer's humble opinion, it is Nicole Kidman who pushes the movie to the highest level.  Unfortunately, before this film, I was one of the many who perceived Kidman as a decent talent, but successful largely due to her husband's coattails.  I stand corrected.  In Moulin Rouge Kidman conveys more emotion with simply her eyes than most actresses can do with a hundred words.  What makes her performance extra special is the ability to tell the story without saying a word.  Kidman's character goes through changes, some subtle and not-so-subtle, that pushes the actress to great work.  In the Elephant Love Medley, if one can stop from rollicking along with the music (which admittedly is difficult to do)and observe Kidman's acting, it is a marvelous thing to behold.  She evolves through defiance, amusement, wonder, fear, doubt, hope and finally embraces Christian's love, and she does all this definitively and effectively in three and a half minutes.Kidman takes us through Satine's complicated journey throughout the movie. She is a woman yearning for what she has never known (true love), but certain that yearning will lead to destitution and heartbreak.  She dives in with Christian, only to realize, despite her anguish, that this love cannot succeed, it is just not meant to be.  Of course she comes to realize Christian is a man who loves her more than he loves what she can provide and do for him.  She is astounded by this and commits to him no matter what, until she realizes she is dying and cannot offer him anything.  It is painful to watch her fight with the idea and resolution of telling Christian she doesn't love him and must send him away.Beneath the flash and bang of Moulin Rouge exists the picture I just described, and if we let it, it will take us on an emotional ride with which we can relate, share and feel.  We really do feel for the characters and understand their love, sorrow, love and pain.  This is the Moulin Rouge I saw the second time around, and it has made all the difference.  I challenge others out there to give this movie the same chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

My Favorite Movie!,"Wow!  What a ""spectacular"" experience!  Ever since I first rented the movie two weeks ago, I have watched it seven times.  I was simply amazed at the heightened reality of the film.  While some think it is goofy, I thought it was great how the director, Baz Luhrman, could walk the viewer skillfully through such a wide variety of emotions- laughter, sadness, love, energy. The dance scenes, especially the tango scene, were truly a joy.  I love the way the play and the dance scenes mirror what is happening to Christian and Satine.  Also, casting was wonderful, and Nicole and Ewan's voices are perfect compliments.  Also, John Leguizamo played an excellent Toulouse-Latrec, and Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh were a wonderful support team.  The lighting was always perfect for each scene, and the use of color and movement, especially in the cancan dance, was simply magnificent.  I think the fact that we see all these exaggerated actions and emotions in the movie simply adds to the truth, not takes away from the reality (which is what many close minded people would say).  Furthermore, the use of previously composed songs did not bother me- in fact, it helped me relate to the movie more easily.  I have never been touched so much by a movie.

Dazzlingly Mad.,"Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is one of the most divisive films of recent memory, thought visionary by some and stupid by others - and both by me.One thing is for sure though, Moulin Rouge is one of the maddest movies I have ever seen. The music, production design, and costumes make it ravishing if not ironically uneasy on the eyes. The direction could do with a bit of polishing, I would have liked much longer and more fluid takes for example, to take in the wonder that the film was visually for example.The film was pacey enough for me not to worry about the time while I was watching it and entertaining enough for me to smile and chuckle along.But overall, Moulin Rouge is definitely only one for those aficionados in everything Luhrmann.Lavish. Raunchy. Ridiculous. Oddball. Melodramatic.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
great music,"I love musicals, and I have to say that this is some of the best music that I've heard in a movie in a long time. My favorite was ""Come What May"", a duet between Kidman and McGregor, which was absolutely beautiful. They both have unique voices, not the best, but rich and powerful, and that's all that's needed in these songs. The only song I was disappointed with was ""Like a Virgin"", which absolutely sickened me and made me hate the song. I thought the tragic love story between Christian and Satine was beautiful, but a little overdramatic and overdone. Their love is best portrayed through the songs. The acting is excellent, especially on Kidman's part. I know the Moulin Rouge are like an abstract acting business, and while those aren't my favorite types of people, their costumes and makeup are very well done. The cuts are also a little too quick moving. The costumes are gorgeous, I love the flashiness of all of it. While I admit it was a little hard to follow, esepcially with all the quick cuts, the movie was great. 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"'We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The show must go on.'","MOULIN ROUGE! is visually spectacular, and the movie floats away on a childishly whimsical tune with Paris as a backdrop, and is truly an adventurous ride. Director Baz Luhrmann uses the MTV-technique of his Romeo+Juliet with even more extravagance and fun, and like fireworks the scenes are glazing with pop-music references (the 'Like a Prayer' turn is especially amusing), fairy-tale love and temptations.And 2 hours with THIS kind of dancing, singing and emotions is almost a gay-ish blast, with its great choreography and cinematography - and in the beautiful Paris you'll be drawn down to Moulin Rouge's atmosphere were sparks fly with decadence and lust. Ewan McGregor is the angel-innocence in a world of sin (according to his father), and he's a hero wherever he sets his foot, but slips into sorrow and depression over his love's (Nicole Kidman) death. A death birthed by Moulin Rouge's tireless demands, a life where she's worth whatever a customer would pay for her.The first act is a blast of humorous editing, colorful cinematography and surely a crazy Jim Broadbent, but the slow-paced scenes of Christian (McGregor) and Satine (Kidman), in the second and third act, clearly states a pure love, and the carefully directed scenes of Kidman alone gives a feeling that the tragedy is within reach. It's a surprisingly emotionally powerful movie, and the earlier, sprouting tunes turns into something darker, as Sting's 'Roxanne' becomes McGregor's earnest, jealous and cry-out for Satine to leave her Moulin-Rouge-life behind, and the roller-coaster introduction simply en-powers its drama as Jim Broadbent tells her Satine; ""We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The Show Must Go On."", and suddenly this tragic fairy-tale has got a meaning and message.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nice Visuals, Terrible & Insulting Script","Being a fan of the 1952 film, I was pumped to see this, especially after reading a few reviews which raved about it. Wow, what a letdown.Yes, part of the reason I was so disappointed with this was that it bore little resemblance to biography of artist Toulouse-Lautrec which was the centerpiece of the classic film.Later, when I was informed that this movie was not intended to be a re-make but a totally new movie with its own story, I felt a little better and watched the movie again. Sorry, but it still sucked!Oh, the visuals were great, especially in the beginning of the movie. I loved all the color and wild visuals in that first 20 minutes, but that was it. After that, it settled into a frustrating love story and the bogged down drastically the rest of the way.As for the music, there are too many slow numbers sung by mediocre singers like Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke, the two romantic interests in the film. They weren't bad singers, but so-so wasn't good enough for a major motion picture production like this.And, being a big fan of Toulouse-Lautrec's artwork and fascinating history, I didn't appreciate him being shown as a clownish transvestite-type character. That was disgusting, and really tells you about this film.As they say, ""too bad; this could have been so much better."" All they needed was an entirely new script.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breathtaking!,"This is a complex movie made out of a simple, unfortunately sad, story. I think that transforming a basic boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-and-one-of-them-dies plot into a masterpiece is the work of a genius, but you can't expect less from Baz Luhrmann, now can you? Ok Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor aren't exactly Julie Andrews and Frank Sinatra but the bottom line is that they gave wonderful performances, despite the singing, and they had a real chemistry between them, which is something you don't get everyday. This is the kind of movie that goes to the extremes. Either you love it or you hate it. But most important, this is a movie about love. Since nobody really understands love, don't try to understand Moulin Rouge, just feel it!",,Anonymous,Romance
a very personal view,"My boyfriend thought it was a bit over the top - we watched the DVD on Valentine's day and he obviously would have preferred something more peaceful. I've read similar criticisms of it. I tend to zoom in on the intimate scenes so the more flamboyant bits melt into the background. I thought musically it was excellent - my favourite scene is where the Argentinian sings Roxanne and Ewan MacGregor comes in with his own song - the counterpart is stunning. Also I had never noticed Ewan before in Brassed Off or Emma so the director really brought out his talent as a singer and got some very good visual shots too - they must both have worked very hard. I realy enjoyed the finale after the credits come up - all very romantic and stirring.  I wanted to know more about the history of the Moulin Rouge after this, having seen a black and white movie on TV when I was a child.  The film defintely inspired me to want more background information, about Paris in the 1890s and Toulouse Lautrec, and perhaps more about Argentina.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A feast for the eye,"This is a very special movie, it's a very original movie i think, movies like these aren't often seen in the modern world, but it's great how well this movie works, Luhrmann have really done a good job.The music works perfect with the scenes, and it creates the spark that makes you feel with the characters, especially loved the scene with song ""One day i'll fly away"", i couldn't help putting on a little smile there realizing how fantastic Kidman is in this movie, how can you not fall in love with her?Kidman and McGregor had an absolutely stunning chemistry which worked great with an awkvard way of editing, which i liked though, the movie itself is a very artistic piece and Luhrmann have a very special way of doing his movies, it works fantasticly here though, way better than Romeo And Juliet, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning as well..

Best Picture of 2001,"I'm a war movie-loving male, and I thought I would hate ""Moulin Rouge."" However, the wife had been wanting to see it, so I borrowed it on DVD for her to watch.  I sat in the room with her reading while she watched it, and my suspicions seemed to be confirmed.  Way too much weird stuff going on! Confused, random, and pointless it seemed.  Then that ""Roxanne"" tango sung by a very annoying voice.  Yep, I hated it.However...I sure liked that scene where they sang Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You.""  While strange, the opera-singing moon was an interesting touch. You know, that hindu scene was kind of cool too.  And the end really seemed to pack a wallop.  Maybe I should sit down and watch it again, this time paying attention?Was I ever blown away!  What a wonderful, beautiful movie.  I wound up watching the entire movie three times this weekend, NOT counting the time I read while my wife watched.  I replayed many of the scenes several times as well, in particular the Green Fairy scene (Kylie Monogue is rather tasty), the love song medley, the hindu scene, and the forgiveness scene at the end.Sure there are some plot holes and mistakes, but with the vision and beauty (as well as freedom, truth, and love - heh), I can overlook a few mistakes.Loved it, loved it, loved it.  9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Too much a Titanic,"I have seen this film, and I rush to comment on it here. Well, I just come up with an idea: this is a new Titanic story. Why? See here: 1. Satine(Rose) and Christian(Jack) come from different societies. 2. Satine(Rose) meets Christian(Jack) 3. They fall in love. 4. But there is a third-party here intruding into this affair: the Duke(Carl) 5. They try to hide it, but it is discovered at last. 6. The Duke(Carl) forces Satine(Rose) to leave Christian(Jack). Zidler(Rose's mother) advises Satine(Rose) to obey. 7. Satine(Rose) unwillingly says something to Christian(Jack) to break his heart. 8. On the stage, Satine and Christian(Jack and Rose) finally find that they really love each other. 9. The Duke(Carl) goes mad: he first hires a man to kill Christian(Jack), and then he picks up the gun himself. Failed. 10. The Duke(Carl) surrenders and leaves. 11. Oops. Satine(this time, she is Jack) is dying, telling Christian(Rose): hey, you should go on(you will never let go. Promise me now, Rose...) 12. Satine(Jack) is dead.Don't you think the film is simply a modified version of Titanic?I can't say the film is very bad, but at least it is far from great. The opening kills me. It's too exaggerating and the music is terrible. The film-makers apparently did this deliberately but I don't think it's good at all.The middle part is better: when Satine and Christian fall in love, and then part again. However, this doesn't continue. The ending is bad. When the door on the stage is opened, the good part ends. In fact, the way the show continues is stupid. It's over-emotional and the gun thing is not interesting at all. That 'high-flyer' just comes as a shock and spoils the original good scene. And as I have said, the very last scenes are poor and I don't want to comment on them any further.The love story is quite cheesy. I don't mean that it's not impressive or heart-rending, but hey, can there be anything fresher? We go to movie to see something new but not some old plots already marked as antique in a museum! In a nutshell, Moulin Rouge is not a surprise in every sense.Average: B to B-",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A spellbinding experience of Shakespearean proportions,"Spectacular, spectacular... the title of a dance hall show in the film, and the most apt description of the film itself.  It is a show of enormous vision and brilliance - truly an Experience.Following up his entrancingly surreal version of ""Romeo and Juliet"", director Baz Luhrmann has created his own spectacle of Shakespearean proportions.  Like all of the master playwright's greatest works, the story is superficially simple - the plot could be summarised in one paragraph - and yet the message is deceptively complex.  The themes of truth, beauty, freedom and love wash over you in a spellbinding display of style, and you are transported into the Bohemian world without even realising it.The story is set in and around a dance hall in Paris, and so, fittingly, much of the story is told through song and dance.  The music is a glorious montage of styles, featuring songs by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Sting, Fatboy Slim, Nirvana, Elton John and old Marilyn Monroe numbers all flowing seamlessly together.  With vocal cameos by Placido Domingo and Ozzy Osbourne - need I say more?There simply are no weak points.  The performances from all the actors are impeccable, and the cinematography and visual effects will blow you away even if you are immune to the power of the music.  After watching it six times in the cinema, I was still captivated by it.I'll have to stop now - I'm in danger of running out of superlatives, and anyway, the movie speaks for itself far better than a review ever could. Simply put it is a magical and beautiful production, the likes of which you have never seen before.See it.  Fall in love with it.  Be forever changed.

Follow your dreams,"Moulin Rouge. One of the hardest pieces of cake to bite when writing about. It's the musical aura, and the thing of talking about matters so obvious that they used to just slip away usually. A story of love and a force which when gets a hold of somebody, always wins. Death that is. All in a sound stage, all colourful, one moment an usual Hollywood, LA production, another moment European, or Eastern Seaboard heritage. A man falls in love with a courtesan. And when love is for the highest bidder there is no trust. Without trust there can be no love. There can be a broken heart though. When the final clash comes she... well you'd better see for yourself. The soundtrack's great. Ewan and Nicole doing their best to good effect. The supporting staff keeps up the pace. My fellow countryman is great too, singing 'Roxanne', and dancing a fantastic tango and mimicking narcoleptic attacks (with minor credibility). For me it's the unique case of a movie which everyone must watch and find oneself in there. The outstanding music score (U2's Bono and Sir Elton John also involved) and actors' performance make no snag.",,Anonymous,Romance

A Modern Movie Musical,"I love movie musicals.  The first one I ever saw was ""Singing in the Rain"" when I was in the first grade.  I loved it, and every other musical made during the fifties; the age of movie musicals. Movie Musicals of the fifties took the favorite music of the time, put a cute plot behind it, got some people who could sing and dance, and shot the film.  The audiences loved it.  Unfortunatly, that genre of movies faded away, and the movie musical died. . . until director Baz Lurhman brought it back. Moulin Rouge, starring Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman, is a fantastic movie musical, with all the qualities of one.  I feel that many people are looking at it from the wrong angle.  It is a great musical, WONDERFUL singing (McGregor and Kidman both have fantastic voices), and the color and costumes are great. Lurhman combined his first two movies (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet) and created a fabulous display of color, music, and emotion. Lurhman's sence of color is fantastic, with the two themes of Red and White sprinkled through out the movie.  There are lots of little details if one looks close enough. My one complaint is that in the Elephant Love Medley, they really didn't need the ""I Will Always Love You"" in there.  Blech!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thrilling.,"People I've watched the film with have said that it rips off some great songs, but as far as I am concerned the songs are used well, especially Roxanne, which no offence to the 'Police' was a better version in Moulin Rouge. Its the cinematography but not only that the acting, ecstatic. I feel sorry for Baz that he wasn't nominated in the directing category for the oscars. However, I do wish Nicole Kidman the best of luck considering she totally deserves best actress with an absolutely stunning performance in Moulin Rouge, even better than The Others, she has really sprung into action in the last year and deserves one hell of a congratulations for it, what better with an oscar. This film makes love out to be fantastic and Hollywood and the audiences have been waiting for a romantic tragedy (Romeo and Juliet not quite right) for years and finally is delivered, screw Lord of the Rings, I may be British but Moulin Rouge has got more of a watchable storyline, shame that it is up against Lord of the Rings, which will probably run away with it this year at the oscars, any other year Moulin Rouge would be the best.

Wonderful! Original! May yet be a classic despite a few flaws.,"Anyone who follows my reviews knows that I reserve wonderful for truly rare cinema. Moulin Rouge is wonderful.I think I hear Fredrico Fellini saying ""Here! Here!"" out there in paradise. It seems almost fitting that the world lost such a genius as Fellini on Halloween, since his works were always events of the bazaar and often masking greater things. The writers of Moulin Rouge saw a few Fellini films, bet the farm on it.Anyway, except for one, the cast was splendid too. John Leguizino is a show stopper as his version of Toulouse Latrec. Evan McGregor as the love smitten Christian is very good too. Jim Broadbent is dazzling as Zidler. Ok to the ""el stinko"";..yep it is Ms.Kidman. Ok so she is pretty. Sunsets are pretty, even beautiful, but they are hardly sexual experts as courtesans are supposed to be. Nicole Kidman as ""Satine"" the courtesan, is rather like casting Ernie Borgnine as Lancelot, it wouldn't be a fit. She is not a fit. She is pretty and perhaps she can even act, who can say, but a courtesan she isn't.Hollywood is full of sexy young courtesans, pick any one of hundreds and put them in this role and you have a masterpiece.

Awful.,"I lasted about 50 minutes in this movie until Jim Broadbent's leering ginger mug repulsed me so much I had to leave. There is no denying the beauty of the art direction here, but it really is the proverbial purse made from a sow's ear. The script is appalling, the plot paper thin. In the grand tradition of all those terrible puppet shows your parents made you sit through when you were a child, there are characters who exist for no reason other than to add a sort of aural punctuation to the main characters songs and sentences. John Leguizamo's entire dialogue seems to consist of beeps and squeaks at appropriate moments. Then there are the songs...ah yes...the songs. If you want to shake things up a bit and ""re-invent"" genres, which Luhrman is no doubt trying to do, is dull radio fodder like Elton John really the way to go? The choice of such songs smacked of product placement. Beyond this, add the fact that Ewan Mcgregor cannot sing, Kidman's voice was flat, and both of them gave up trying to act before the movie had even begun, and you have an undeniably excruciating experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ladies and Gentlemen of the film going public of 2001. If you remember one thing I tell you today, remember this: see Moulin Rouge","Ladies and Gentlemen of the film going public of 2001. If you remember one thing I tell you today, remember this: see Moulin Rouge.If Mercutio can do ecstasy with Romeo and sing disco songs in drag, then why can't a love story set in Paris of 1899 be a splashy rock opera with 80's and 90's pop songs? Director Baz Luhrmann showed his flair for anachronism with his 1996 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, and uses it as the heart and soul of his latest film, Moulin Rouge.Satine  (Nicole Kidman) is a beautiful courtesan and star dancer of the decadent Paris nightclub. She is conned by artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, kneeling inside prosthetic legs to make him look shorter) into seducing a ruthless and powerful Duke, convincing him to back a musical written by a fledgling writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor). The Duke agrees, but at a price, Satine is to be his and only his. Faster than you can say Stephen Sondheim, Satine falls in love with the Christian, after being wooed by his genius poetry (actually, lyrics from songs by David Bowie, U2, Paul McCartney and Wings, among others).Luhrmann keeps the story moving at break-neck speed, switching back and forth from Busby Berkeley-styled musical numbers, romantic melodrama, and the high camp of French comedy. The effects can be emotionally distancing (as most musicals are), since there is twice as much singing as there is dialogue. But what Moulin Rouge lacks in character development, it more than makes up for with earnest performances and sumptuous visuals.  Kidman's timeless beauty and McGregor's energy bring charm to their stock characters. As visual stylist, Luhrmann has few peers (the Coen Brothers and Lars von Trier among them). His use of visual effects, camera moves and editing, steam roll through what would be static, expository moments in a film by a lesser director. The costumes, sets and elaborately choreographed and photographed dance numbers, make Moulin Rouge like nothing you're likely to see this summer, or this year. A strange hybrid of Cabaret and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where lascivious nightclub patrons sing Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and grown men wrap themselves in makeshift veils to sing Madonna's ""Like A Virgin.""Some of what I've said in this review may not make sense to you.

The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn...,"Is just to see this movie! This is perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen. It starts out with scenes that make you feel like you're on drugs but soon turns into a wonderful story. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are superb as Satine and Christian, who become the Romeo and Juliet of France. Satine's a high class prostitute that mistakes Christian, a poor poet, for a Duke and makes him fall in love with her. Meanwhile, the real Duke obtains the deeds to the Moulin Rouge, an exciting night club, and demands that he own Satine while he is there. Zidler, Satine's pimp, orders her to end any feelings she has for Christian, in fear he will lose ownership of the Moulin Rouge. But the lovers will not be torn apart and all hell breaks loose until the final, tragic ending. This is a must-see movie filled with laughs, gasps, beautiful songs, and some intense dance numbers. (Watch for the ""Roxanne"" dance number, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.)I particularly like Christian's quotes: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""

One of the greatest parts of the movie however is only on the video as the extented dance scene. This scene truly shows that it will be a cult movie and a Broadway hopeful!

Makes Battlefield Earth look like Academy Award material.,"Like Titanic, this was one of those movies that female friends had suggested was good, but that I intended to go to my grave having not seen.  However, someone put it on at a little get-together, so rather than be completely neurotic and leave, I stayed to watch.God how I regret it.That's two hours of my life I want back.  The only good points I could pick out were that the sets (when you could see them) and the costumes.  Both seemed quite well done.  Actually, if you removed the script and the cinematography, I suppose it wouldn't be such a bad movie.  But those two ruined it for me.  The camera angles were so jerky and uncoordinated I felt sick, and the plot was incredibly bizarre and didn't make sense until at least half way through.  And the final nail in the coffin that would make me recommend this movie only to people I hate is that they used SOUND EFFECTS for the characters' movements.  Seriously, cartoon sound effects.Want a historical semi-funny romance? Get Shakespeare in Love.  Want to be sickened by bad camera angles, nauseated by the neurotic acting, and just plain irritated by the general reek?

This movie is colorful in every way, from the lovesick and love obsessed Christian and the courtisan/singer Satine to the amazing costumes.  The cinematography in the movie was exquisite, my favorite use of the camera being near the beginning when you first enter the Moulin Rouge, it is used to make you feel disoriented, like Christian probably felt when he first entered the late 19th century version of Studio 54. In a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you feel all of it. The Truth - This movie is sensual, uplifting, a definite ""Spectacular Spectacular."" The Beauty - Every thing about the movie is beautiful, from the setting and time ( late 19th century, paris france during the bohemian revolution) to the people, costumes, music...need I say more. The Freedom - You will feel free as your entranced by this story about the lovesick Christian in his attempts to free his first love, Satine, from the grips of the evil duke. The Love - You will love to watch this movie over and over again.  You will love to sing along with the characters in each of the amazing songs (Your Song, Elephant Medley, Come What May)  You will love being able to share the movie and its story with your kids, grandkids and so forth. You will just flat out LOVE this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well, I thought it was fantastic!","*Moulin Rouge*Moulin Rouge has become the ultimate love-it of hate-it movie.  Most men hate it, and a lot of females hate it too.  But me? Being the heterosexual women I am, loved it.  The love story didn't bore me like most people complain it did.  The music was sensational!  Unlike most people, I liked the mix of popular music from back in the day.  My favorite music moment had to be ""Roxanne.""The one thing that doesn't make me completely love Moulin Rouge is the first 20 minutes.  It was awful.  I was ready to turn it off or leave the room.  I don't remember the exact moment I started to like it, but after a while it just grew on me.  The charactors were well thought up and the setting had me in a trance.

More than just music.,"Excellent movie. I really thought this was more a musical than a movie, boy, i got it wrong. I liked all their songs and i liked this movie, although a secret is already revealed in the beginning that you're thinking of the entire movie. The actors and the decors are amazing, just like the camerawork, who acts like a crazy through the crowd at Moulin Rouge. The dressing by the actors was also nice done.

I'll kill that sound guy.,"I gave this movie an 8 because I'm convinced that I'd like it, at least, that much if I had been allowed to see it as it was supposed to have been seen. Unfortunately I ended up seeing it a very tired Sunday at 9 p.m. in a theater where the sound technician were either deaf, on dope or both.This movie is ... intense. Its imagery is intense as well as its sound. Therefore it became almost impossible to experience for me. On the other hand, I've never been much for musicals and Moulin Rouge is a musical on steroids. It's somewhat difficult to take the plot seriously when everybody's running around, singing everything. The scenes of the show at Moulin Rouge are almost tiring in their excessiveness.It's got humor, romance, music, sorrow and action but it misses at some point, trying to compress too much movie into too little space. Or maybe it's just that some songs are way too cheesy. Or maybe I'm just tired and grumpy. The point I'm trying to make is that, being such an intense film, you really need to have the perfect setting for it, or you will just not like it (like me).Oh, and one very big positive thing: They all actually sing their own songs. Without that the whole movie would just be laughable, at best.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A trifling, insignificant little film","You're not going to believe this, but the film I was most strongly reminded of when I watched ""Moulin Rouge"" was ""Mission: Impossible 2"".  Both Baz Luhrmann and John Woo have developed a very recognizeable visual style, and both of them are perfectly willing to tear a script to shreds in order to maximize the visual effect of their films.  Each film is an empty, dessicated husk of a motion picture, lacking any real content or substnace at all.  Both are pleasant to look at and, if one's standards are sufficiently low, passably entertaining.  The fact that one is an action movie and one a musical seems a very minor difference to me.The plot of ""Moulin Rouge"" is both hackneyed and bad, which is a disasterous combination.  But then, this is a musical, intended for a musical audience. A musical audience is one for whom singing and dancing are more important than plot and story.  Similarly, M:I2 is an action movie, intended for an action movie audience, for whom chases, fights, and explosions are more important than plot and story.And what's all this bellyaching about the film being overlooked for Best Director and Best Editing awards by the Academy?  The editing was a significant drawback to the film.  The pace was so frenetic that it was impossible to develop any sort of emotional attachment to any of the characters.  The direction was extremely clumsy.  Check out my review of ""Apocalypse Now,"" the bit at the end where I talk about Brando's performance.  Coppola pointed a camera at Brando and filmed a great actor at work.  Now, there's no Brando in this movie, but the cast is very talented. It is not necessary to provide a few seconds of menacing slow motion when Zidler orders Satine to stop seeing Christian, because Broadbent is a talented actor (who has finally been recognized, hooray!) who is perfectly capable of delivering the line with all the menace you need.  Coppola is a genius and Luhrmann is hack precisely because Coppola knows what his job is, and Luhrmann doesn't.Luhrmann constantly uses the camera, the editing, or some distracting special-effects shot to unnecessarily underscore points that the actors are perfectly capable of making themselves.  Compare to Oliver Stone, whose own ingenious editing style has been harshly attacked by many critics and filmgoers.  In ""Any Given Sunday"", Stone uses editing to allow characters to clearly convey multiple emotions simultaneously.  Pacino delivers a line laced with nostalgia and regret, while an image of Pacino screaming in rage appears silently on the screen.  Stone uses his camera to give the audience information in addition to what the actor is giving.  Luhrmann uses it to give the audience the same information, only without subtlety or grace.Basically, take ""Shakespeare in Love"", get rid of the wit, dumb-it-down a bit, throw in spectacular sets and costumes (credit where due), sing some anachronistic songs (which was sacrilege in ""A Knight's Tale"" but somehow genius here... go figure), and there you are.  ""Moulin Rouge"".Many say you either love this film or hate it.  I obviously don't love it, but I don't hate it either.  There's nothing there to hate.  There's nothing there at all.",,Anonymous,Romance

After a closer observation (and repeated viewings)...,"...I finally found the method to this film's frentic madness. Before, I used to get overwhelmed and think that there was no true depth to this film and thought it was just an attempt for Baz Luhrmann to establish himself as a unique film-making style. Turns out, it's not in his pace of film-making, but in the style of his shots that seem to encompass a world in and of itself that sets him apart from flash in the pan directors like Michael Bay and McG.The film tells a heartbreaking tale of true love and how it transcends the boundaries of materialism and set standards. We have idealist Christian (Ewan McGreggor) who comes to Paris in 1899 to find his voice as a writer. As he meets a gala of colorful roommates who take him to the Moulin Rouge to pitch his play, he sees Satine, the crown jewel of the cabaret, and is instantly captivated by her. But unlike the other men who are put under her spell, Christian can see what Satine has hidden from everyone else and he falls in love with her. After Christian shows Satine that life (and love) can and does exist outside of the Moulin Rouge, they begin their love affair. But Satine is constantly dragged back into her world by The Duke who simply wants to buy her with material possessions.What the film has to say about love is that it can transcend any drudgery and elevate those whose hearts are filled with it. Even in the darkest of places where ""love is available to the highest bidder"" as one song suggests, if you truly love someone for who they are, then love can exist anywhere.Bax Luhrman creates a 17th-18th centuary like we've never seen, where the colors are vivid, the lighting has as many spotlights as it does shadows and the pace is more frentic than today's hustle and bustle. Though at times the songs and pace can seem out of place, it only helps to create one man's vision of the times. Luhrman's style may not be liked by many, but one cannot deny that it is his own.At first, I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, but then the pace grew so fast for me that I became exhausted with it and couldn't find the depth that I once saw in it. Then watching it again on DVD on my TV has shown me that this is the best way to watch this movie so as not to be overwhelmed by the the big screen, but seen in widescreen so the TV won't cut out every facet of this festival for the eyes and ears.Despite the ending, one can't help but feel grateful that love had existed, helped someone achieve their dream and give them the sense of freedom. And in doing that, Luhrman and company have truly embodied and modernized the Bohemian mantra of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Musical of 2001 sets us up for the Best Musical on Broadway,"Moulin Rouge is probably the most glamorous and majestic film to date. Many films have tried to be like Moulin Rouge but none can compare. Highlighted by beautiful cinematography and vivid acting, (Nicole Kidman was utterly breath-taking,) Moulin Rouge gave the audience a trip into a colorful world unexplored by any filmakers. The one tick I have is why the Academy was so stupid to leave Baz Luhrmann out of the race for best director. ALL of the film is a genuine product of his beautiful mind, (wink, wink!) It has been the talk of Hollywood lately that 'Rouge' is being considered for Broadway adaptation. I say go for it! It can't be a bigger flub than the skewing of Lurhmann for the Oscar. I am now a bona fide fan of his, and i would love to see him bring ""Rent"" to the silver screen.(if you havent heard about this, click on his name.) **** (4 out of 4) -Give my regards to Broadway, remember me to Harold Square!-",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tragic Love Story Indeed,"This movie was a colossal disappointment for me. I enjoyed Romeo + Juliet tremendously and I really like Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, so this seemed like a can't miss.Unfortunately you could dive feet first into a puddle of this movie and not even get your socks wet. All the dialogue was contrived to find meaningful poetic snippets of great songs and compile them into one fluid love story. The idea has merit, but the execution was all wrong. The lines didn't tie together well and totally lacked the emotion of the songs themselves. This left little to no character development and almost no emotional attachments which should be important to a ""tragic love story."" Another problem I have is that a lot of the mystery is taken away in the opening monologue, not that that would be enough to wreck a movie, but in this case, there is no reason for it. So with the ending already decided you look to the actors to hold your interest and find yourself being even further let down. You hope the dialogue can at least carry some interest but that dies quickly too. I can't believe the hype for this movie, but then, I can't believe Britney Spears has sold millions of albums either. You can't trust the general public.The filming, set-design and costumes are the only reason this film received any stars at all in my book. Brilliant colors, multiple crazy angles/cuts and wild sets however weren't enough to hold any interest.I describe this movie as being liked by people that THINK they're artistic and creative but truly have no depth.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Brilliance of Moulin Rouge,"Moulin Rouge has to be one of the greatest films of all time, if not the year.  Dazzling you with incredible editing and brilliant effects shots, it captures your attention and won't let go until the end.  It takes you on a journey of true love and leaves you wanting more.Moulin Rouge begins with the once naive Christian (Ewan McGregor) sitting down at his typewriter to tell his story.  He begins with how he came to Paris to write and live a penniless existence.  And is then greeted by an unconscious Argentinian falling through his roof.  ""And is quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun.""  Talous La Trec.   Talous introduces him to the Bohemian lifestyle and gets him his first job in Paris...writing ""Spectacular, Spectacular"".  Satine ( Nicole Kidman)  the ""Sparkling Diamond"" mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him.  But she is a courtesan and isn't suppose to fall in love with anyone, except the duke, who is financing the conversion of the Moulin Rouge ""into a theater"". Satine is supposed to be his.  Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the duke. But like any forbidden love, they are found out.  The duke forbids her to see Christian or he will be killed.  So Satine makes Christian believe she doesn't love him to protect him from the duke.   Okay that's as far as I'm going to go.  I don't want to give away the ending.  If you want to know, go see it.I have to tell that I was swept up in this film.  I saw it six times in the theater in a time when I couldn't afford to see one movie let alone it six times.  I had to choose between eating and seeing this movie and I chose this movie.  That's how powerful it was.  It is beyond anything else I've seen all year and I've seen alot.  The musical score is fabulous.  Ewan McGregor, although always one of my favorites, went beyond what I thought possible for him. (And should have been nominated for an oscar, but was passed over) And Nicole Kidman, never one of my favorites, showed me that she too can act just as well as anyone and is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  Their voices compliment each other perfectly.The visuals were outstanding.  Never seen effects shots so perfect. Usually I can find something wrong with films, but I couldn't find one single, solitary thing.

Moulin Rouge is a shockingly creative and fascinating film about an original love story.,"A film like this could VERY easily have been great, or at least much greater than it was. Consider what would have happened had they put in the time to come up with an original score that fit with the astronomical level of creativity and imagination that saturates every other element of the film - it may very well have been something as memorable as The Wizard of Oz or some of the truly great scores from film history, such as the Indiana Jones music or the Star Wars theme or any number of other great film soundtracks. But unfortunately, they decided instead to punctuate this incredible and beautiful film with covers of modern popular songs which have no business being in the movie in the first place.First of all, before I begin to complain, I should mention that it is a testament to the quality of the film when something like this is unfortunately thrown in, yet the film as a whole manages to remain a wonderful cinematic experience, it's just too bad that there was so little effort put into such a pivotal thing as the score (especially in a musical romance like this), which could have put the movie over the threshold into the realm of the truly great films. Again, I would like to point out that the performances of the songs were beautiful and wonderfully entertaining, as well as brilliantly choreographed, but even this amazing presentation does not make up for the almost complete lack of any original musical content. There are a few original songs in the movie, but it's the modern ones that are not only unoriginal, but completely disruptive to the rest of the movie.The story deals with an out of work writer in the year 1900 who goes to Paris to write his masterpiece and find true love. Once there, he finds himself stalled by writer's block, but soon finds himself whirled through a dizzying sequence of events that inadvertently send him on the way to accomplish the very goal that he set out for, although not in exactly the way that he had anticipated. This is where the originality comes in, as we are presented with a fascinating although initially superficial romantic plot which is enormously exaggerated but not beyond belief even for a moment. The Parisian night life that we are presented with is huge and glittery and rich and loud, and we are so enraptured by it that we don't doubt for a minute that this is exactly what the night life was like at the Moulin Rouge in 1900.However, this brilliant story is also exactly where the movie begins to falter. True, this is almost surely a vastly exaggerated account of what nights were really like at the Moulin Rouge during this time, but it's so well presented that it is remarkably easy to believe. Unfortunately, we are periodically confused by performances of popular modern songs. Now, I can't say that I was altogether disappointed with all of these performances. Indeed, many of them were genuinely entertaining and well done (although I almost had to leave the room when The Police's `Roxanne' was belligerently performed), but they feel like speed bumps in the film. This is such an enjoyable and convincing film that it's horribly disappointing that they decided to throw songs like `Smells Like Teen Spirit' and that Whitney Houston song into the mix, almost mocking the audience for trying to enjoy the turn-of-the-century world that's presented.Moulin Rouge is something of a strange phenomenon, then, because it is a truly great film that was brought down by the childish addition of modern music. There is no fathomable reason that a film that takes place in 1900 should contain these songs, even though they were quite often well done. It was interesting to learn that both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wonderful singing voices, but the presentation of modern music does nothing but remove the audience from the world that we have been drawn into and remind us that we are watching a movie, and a movie that's trying to make a bad joke, at that.There is no mystery as to why Moulin Rouge was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2001, but there is also no mystery as to why it didn't win that Oscar (and there is even LESS mystery on that subject when you've seen the other nominees, particularly A Beautiful Mind, the earth-quakingly good winner).  Moulin Rouge in inarguably one of the best films released in 2001, but it was sadly held down by its soundtrack.It should be noted, however, that the music in the film was beautifully done and that the performances were for the most part nearly as good as the rest of the film, but they are so incongruous with the content of the film that they can only count against it. A musical romance is so centered on the music in the film that if the music doesn't work for it, the film as a whole suffers, and it's too bad because Moulin Rouge could easily have fit in as one of cinematic history's truly groundbreaking and memorable films.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
When was the last time a movie made you cry?,"No movie _ever_ has made me feel as strongly as this one. An enormous catharsis, that's what this movie is. The strongest of feelings: love, sorrow, jealousy, etc. Absolutely everything in this movie just fits in, from the ultra modern camera action to the themes that are as old as man himself.The basic story is actually a very shakespearenian tragedy - reminding of Shakespeare In Love and the most recent version of Romeo And Juliet (which was, by the way, directed by the same man than this one). From the opening scene it's obvious that there will be no happy ending on this one, and the whole plot could very well be crafted by Shakespeare himself.Also this is a musical, in a way it follows the footsteps of many former musical classics, like Singing In The Rain for example. But most of all this is A MOVIE, an audiovisual experience at it's best! Very rarely, if ever has there been such a collaboration between the direction, cinematography, acting, music, and script as in Moulin Rouge! Watching this movie was like taking a giant load off my back, it somehow freed me of any bad thoughts I had, a catharsis as I mentioned.Besides, this movie made me cry, a thing no movie has accomplished in at least ten years, and that really is a compliment from a movie freak like me!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

No one cares about your dogma!,"A movie musical starring an unsexy sex symbol with an actor pretending to be a writer making up songs off the top of his head that are actually hacked from other musicals or pop songs, most of which were achingly bad in their original form.  My wife wanted me to see this with her, and I just kept staring at her.  Eventually, she was embarrassed by the bad call she made in picking this movie and wanted to leave, but I insisted that we stay to the end, and delighted in sharing the remaining 45 minutes of cinematic punishment.This movie is a textbook example of two phenomena.  The first phenomenon occurs when the developers of a movie and its consumers convince themselves that a corporate-approved, non-threatening movie with talented actors and a big budget and flashy movement and costumes and the trappings of decadence must be a great movie since all the easily recognizable components of a great movie are covered in the ""checklist of elements of great movies.""This phenomenon actually works to some extent because the self-deception creates and moves the product.  In the U.S., demand for Titanic was so high that copies went on sale in stores that had never sold a videotape before. At one point, everyone was telling me to see Titanic.  Then everyone was telling me to buy Titanic.  Then everyone told me not to bother.  Now they sell on Ebay for US$1.00.  By the time that most of you read this review, this process will have already occured to Moulin Rouge.The other phenomenon is when the creators of a film convince themselves that movies about superficial themes, like a Paris dance hall/whorehouse musical, can or should be superficial films, because there's the available defense of ""of course it's a superficial film!  This movie is ABOUT surface!  Truth! Beauty! Freedom! Love!""What truth?  The romantic element of the plot rung false.  What beauty? Nicole Kidman is recurringly described in the American Press as ""alluring,"" which is code for ""really pretty, but not in a way that provokes an erotic response.""  What freedom?  Everyone in this movie is a whore, and none of them seem to earn any grace or learn any worthwhile lessons.  What love? I'm not sure what any of these characters really love or believe in.Maybe this film is escapist in a way that speaks to other people.  Maybe my fellow US citizens are as superficial as this movie seems to assume they are.  I doubt it.

"Merits a place in a cinematic hall of shame, its that bad!","So much has been achieved by mankind over the ages. Man has walked on the moon, Concorde was able to break the speed of sound and the car has brought greater degrees of mobility to billions. How then can mankind have conspired to produce this film. It is so unforgivably tedious that those responsible for it should be charged with crimes against humanity. It's that bad! The endless song and dance routines sap the very life out of you. So over-the-top is the acting that one feels urges to unleash shotgun justice on all the participants immediately. All of the major characters are outrageously annoying, all of the minor characters invite your derision. The songs are appalling, but in the worst possible way. They stay in your mind and poison your sleep. You hum the tunes for days afterwards vainly hoping to forget their sheer banality! I cannot emphasise enough how bad this film is. Jim Broadbent is a fine actor, but he should hang his head in shame for starring in this sorry rubbish. To anybody with even an ounce of common sense regarding their film tastes, do not watch this movie! It will haunt you for days! This film has probably driven fathers to drink, their marriages have collapsed, their kids have turned to crime, people have been murdered and all because of this horrific offering. Moulin Rouge is probably the worst film ever made in terms of how much it will bore you to tears. Avoid it like the plague.",,Anonymous,Romance
A passionate romance between a courtizan and pennyless writer.,"In this feast of colors and quick cuts, a beautiful young star of the Moulin Rouge and a love obsessed writer share a passionate affair. Set in the early 1900's, Christian (McGregor) comes to be a part in the bohemian revolution and falls in love with the most beautiful Moulin Rouge dancer Satine (Kidman. However, Satine already has a wealthy suitor, the duke. This frenzy of art, love, and drama intertwine to create a fantastic masterpiece of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
phenomenal movie; 10 out of 10,"When I first watched Moulin Rouge on DVD, I wanted to kick myself. No, not because I spent money on a bad movie. In fact, the opposite of that. I wished I had believed the reviews and gone to see it in the theater. Hopefully one day they will rerelease it, for this is the kind of movie that would most likely be phenomenal on the big screen. Anyway, Moulin Rouge is breathtaking and ground breaking at the same time. It's not your traditional musical; often you can't even tell when the singing stops and the talking begins. There are many references to songs from the 20th century, which I enjoyed, in a comical way, hearing in this sense. The music and dance direction is wonderful. Each number is better than the last. And the movie doesn't stop there. In fact, after viewing the whole movie, this is not the major part I remember. The story, the script, the lyrics... they're all so beautiful. ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return"". ""This movie is about freedom, truth, beauty, and above all things, love."" While these might seem cliche and corny, the way these ideas are presented are so that the viewer actually believes them. Last but not least, the characters of the film are great. I especially enjoyed Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge who defines the word thrifty. At some points it may seem like he is the antagonist, or one of them, but at most times he is on the side of good, of love. There's so much more about Moulin Rouge that's wonderful, but it would take the length of the script to write it all, if not more. Every line is wonderful, and to compound on that the acting, singing, dancing, editing, costumes... EVERYTHING is wonderful. So please, if you have not seen this movie, see it.And remember:The greatest thing You'll ever learn Is just to love And be loved In return",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What an experience!!,"So I didn't see this film at the cinema. I must say that the trailer didn't do it justice and I had no idea what to expect. It was on a flight to South Africa I watched and was totally in awe of the style and power of the film. Right from the opening scenes in the night club I was completely hooked. This film really is an experience. I found myself wrapped up in the fabulous performances, the incredible music, the romance and the bohemian idealism, escaping all to realise their dreams.This film really is outstanding. Imagine my horror when the landing at Johanesburg interupted the film with 20 minutes to go. I was desperate to see the end and had to wait five days for the return flight to find what happens.Extraordinary!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love is All You Need,"After due consideration, I have decided that the ever coveted last spot on my top 5 films of all time list has been filled by a captivating piece of cinematic brilliance called ""Moulin Rouge!"". To call ""Moulin Rouge!"" a film is an act of uninhibited slander, for it is nothing short of transcendental cinematic excellence. Baz Luhrman weaves such rich tapestry of well placed fades, camera movement and clever inserts of Christian's narrative typewriter that truly make this an example of modern day storytelling, full of the revolutionary bohemian ideals around which the film revolves, and not merely part of the money making hollywood bourgeoisie. The script is brilliant, with the writers finding clever ways of steering the character's converstations into classic songs, with tweaked lyrics to further the story. An example of this is how Ziedler artfully stalls the Duke from noticing Satine's apparent disappearance by saying, ""you make her feel like a virgin!"" which of course leads into a slightly comical rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" performed by two men, one slightly overweight, one slightly under. The cast is stellar. Ewan McGregor proves he has what it takes to be one of Hollywood's top leading men, with a great range of skills that is not limited to a withdrawal sickened Heroin addict or a Saber wielding Jedi. John Leguizamo as the diminutive Toulouse, gives his best performance since ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"". And no words can be said to describe the Beautiful Nicole Kidman except ""stunning enchantress"". All these elements combine to create one of the best films of 2001, but of all the aspects of this multifaceted masterpiece one rises above the rest. The Score. The songs, unlike in most musicals, aren't an uncomfortable break in  the flow of the film. In fact, not merely musical interludes, the song and dance numbers all help to further the story by driving home emotions that are intensified for the audience, by the powerful music with which they are delivered. An example is the full orchestral Tango scene in which the Argentinean explains to the crestfallen Christain, why one should never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, via a latin flavored version of Roxanne. I am not one who usually enjoys musicals, in fact most drive me insane, so it came to me as quite a shock that I loved this movie as much as I do. When i first saw it I regarded it as good and not much more, but after re-watching it a few times, I've been captivated by the sheer joy of imagining a world full of fun and fancy, magic and mystery, and of course true love. Not only was it artfully directed and beautifully written but it was also an example of a genuine love story. And when it comes down to it, that's all Moulin Rouge really is. A story about Love, a never ending, undying, perpetual, and all encompassing love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Audiovisual appeal,"Moulin Rouge is a very pleasant movie to watch. It's style over content the good way. A glamorous cast and a great music add to the overall feel. It evolves as a fairy tale where even the evil is presented in a non-disturbing manner to the audience. There might be nothing more than an excuse of a plot, but chances are you won't notice it since Nicole and Ewan do their best to outshine it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Emperor's not-so-new clothes.,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's too bad that the IMDB rating scale only has `1' as the lowest possible rating. `Moulin Rouge' is a textbook case for much of what is wrong with some contemporary popular films. It substitutes technical tricks for style, and frenetic cutting in place of meaningful development. The story is the epitome of triteness, creating a soap opera melange out of Camille, Orpheus, and the old Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney movies where they decide `let's put on a show.' As a deconstructive musical, it depends on send-ups of popular songs to fill out most of its excruciating two-plus hours (there is some undistinguished new material), and this is interspersed with bits and pieces imitating scenes from a wide variety of films of the past, most notably the works of The Three Stooges. The dialogue is extremely lame, often painfully mistaking popular song lyrics for great poetry, and it certainly lives down to the level of the story. The overall attitude of this film,  is that if you take the kitchen sink approach and throw in as much stuff at as fast a pace as possible, many people will be tricked into thinking that there's substance here, rather than just the frantic hyperactivity of a desperate mind with a vague notion and a lot of money to spend on bringing it to the screen. This becomes quickly apparent after the same gimmicks are used over and over even in the very beginning of the film. By the end of the film you've seen the same devices so many times that a nauseating numbing effect results. While, like a cinematic junkyard, it is truly crammed with great numbers of things (cuts, costumes, camera moves, set pieces, computer effects, etc.), there is no overriding sense of purpose or vision, just the effects of juxtapositions of elements, and this quickly creates a tedious and irritating result. Nevertheless, many will be fooled into mistaking quantity for quality, and will believe that they saw something of merit. It might also be appreciated by younger people who have been weaned on music videos. `Moulin Rogue' may be the first commercial film created expressly for the ADD crowd.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
pretty colors doesn't equal good filmmaking,"This was so distractingly cartoonish. It seemed to be flashy for the sake of being flashy.This has some of the absolute worst editing I have ever seen in a film. I nearly turned it off in the first 20 minutes because of how chaotic and choppy it was. It legitimately gave me nausea and I felt like I was having a seizure.The script was terrible. The dialogue has horrible and the story was formulaic. I know I say that a lot, but it is especially true for this if none else. For most of the run time, I was just sitting through it so I could watch cinemasins afterwards. I didn't even have to pay attention to it to know what was happening, that's how predictable it was.The songs did absolutely nothing for the story other than say what the audience already knew. They just felt like cheap time filler that went on forever. If the film is going to have such anachronistic music in it, why does it even bother telling us the year it takes place in? to have pretty costumes and sets? it seemed like it.Something so pretty really shouldn't feel so dull and empty.",,Anonymous,Romance

One of the Best,"Even though I'm a sucker for musicals, I wasn't planning on seeing it when it came out.  My cousin took me to see it and I fell in love.  It's now my favorite, or at least one of them.  I seriously went to see it in the theaters 7 times (it was a slow summer).  It's a classic tale of boy falls in love with a girl he can't have and the consequences of that.  Yes, it's over the top.  But that's what makes it wonderful.  In the first ten minutes, you find out how it's going to end, but that's the beauty of Baz. All of the actors are brilliant as well.  Check it out even if you don't like musicals.

"Unbelievable story, dancing, music, acting","Being a big fan of Baz Luhrmann, I was expecting a lot from Moulin Rouge. And it delivered!  Everything about it was amazing.  A review I read said it takes cliches and pulls real emotion out of them.  And I agree. Everything felt new, even though it's been done a million times before.  The acting was superb - Ewan Macgregor was so heart-wrenching.  My friend and I were falling in love with him as he sang to Kidman's Satine.  He was perfect.And Nicole Kidman has the only person who could play this part.  Her expressive eyes and perfect turn-of-the-century looks matched the background superbly.  She evoked memories of Jean Harlow's silliness, Marilyn Monroe's sexiness, and created in Satine a gloriously contradiction - the naive prostitute.  More than a hooker with a heart of gold, Kidman's Satine is childlike, even in her seduction of Christian.  Her painful coming of age, brought about by the duke, was wrenching and amazing.Baz's direction and vision are extraordinary.  I fell in love with his vision the moment I saw Strictly Ballroom, and Moulin Rouge keeps it going.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow!  How bad can you get?,"Usually I'm pretty opened minded when it comes to movies, so I decided to go see this movie with my girlfriend (who by the way loves musicals).  Wow, I was shocked at how utterly awful this title was.  Good thing that I work at a theater and get movies for free, or I would've completely wasted my eight bucks on this one.  The scene where the drugs enter the characters' systems near the beginning started the long, lost, winding road of a movie.  Just one more side note, Ewan McGregor needs to sit out of the movie business for a few years and rethink his character choices, because after this and those jokes of a movie they call Star Wars, he's flushing his career down the toilet.1 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
crack-fueled claptrap,"O.K., this one hurt - my ears, my eyes, my intelligence . . . Five minutes into it, you've pretty much seen it.  My husband and I did, however, stick it out to the end because his sister had told us we would love it.  As a matter of fact, she said it would break her heart if we didn't.  Oh boy.  We just put off mentioning we had seen it as long as we could.  Apparently, this film causes a visceral love/hate reaction in viewers, and obviously, we didn't fall into the ""love"" category.  I admire the idea and the effort but was numbed by the product--a triumph of editing and sound, I guess, but all to an incredibly annoying result.  Mostly I just wanted it to STOP. What astounds me is that the score has won two major awards already!!! I realize there are some original things in it, but surely that is not what sticks in one's memory.  I like Ewan McGregor and can tolerate Nicole Kidman (though the ""wronged woman making an valiant comeback"" schtick is getting old). Even though I hated it, some other people think it's really swell, so I'm loathe to say don't see it.  Just don't say you weren't warned!",,Anonymous,Romance
It's allegorical,"In the first 15 minutes, my senses were assaulted.  I was also taken aback by the use of popular song lyrics as dialogue.  Then I finally got the point of the movie. It's not even remotely grounded in reality.  It's ""hyper-real"" (Lurhman's own words).  It's allegorical. The characters are deliberately archetypal.Relax, and give in to this feast for the senses, and you won't be disappointed.McGregor's ability to sing surprised me more than Kidman's.  Personally, I think he did a better job singing, but both were quite good!Roxburgh's portrayal of the Duke is superbly comical.  When he recites a couple of lines from ""Like a Virgin"", I was rolling on the floor.  Compare this with his character in MI2.  They are a wonderful contrast.My favorite part is when the song, ""Roxanne,"" is given an awesome interpretation in some passionate Argentine Tango.The key is that the songs and lyrics-as-dialogue are wonderfully integrated into the movie, unlike a standard musical that stops for a song.  This integration contributes to the film's good pacing.  It's so refreshing to see popular songs used in original ways.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Energy and Charisma not usually seen in main-stream film ...,"The weekend prior to the Academy Awards, I decided I could avoid it no longer, and I rented ""Moulin Rouge!""  As a devotee of classic musicals, I thought I would be offended and disappointed by a film that destroyed their legacy rather than honoring or bettering it.  Boy, was I ever wrong! From the opening seconds of the film, I was shocked, dazzled and inspired. As I have since learned, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (with a large chunk of appreciation due to ""Camille"") served as the source material for this unbelievable piece of showmanship.  Each shot (and they are seemingly endless) was carefully planned, is part of both story and atmosphere and is unlike practically anything else produced today.  Each member of the cast is wonderful, maintaining the perfect balance between melodrama and true passion/emotion, all with this fantastic self-awareness.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" performs for the viewer, asking at each turn whether he/she is satisfied. Lines, songs, costumes: they all change the ultimate outcome of the story, but if you are unsatisfied, wait just a few minutes, and they will change it again, aware of their power and yet free of pretension.  No comments on this movie would be complete without a word about the magnificent singing voices of those involved.  When Ewan McGregor pops up with ""The hills are alive ... "" and later ""My gift is my song ... "" my mouth dropped open.  And Nicole Kidman, descending on that trapeze murmuring ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" - I almost applauded.  This IS what musicals are all about: Spectacular, Spectacular!And so somehow, this film works.  It works and it laughs at the cynic who thought it would fail.After the first hour, I was ready to change my Oscar predictions. How could something of this magnitude be ignored?  Yes, it is gaudy and garish. Yes, the actors do spontaneously burst into song and dance about.  Yes, Baz was more than a little obnoxious in interviews in the weeks before.  But isn't that the point?  Unfortunately, Oscar voters would like to distance themselves from their craft.  On ""the big night,"" they seem to desire that which is safe, that which is normal, that which is mundane.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" is none of these; and although my first predictions of its success were wrong, I feel positive that this film will survive and entertain as long as people are interested in intelligent, stimulating art.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A string of superlatives that ringed the globe could not come near to describing it.Being a dancer, I loved the dance scenes (some of my friends were in them), they were unbelievably good. Very passionate and over-the-top, wonderful to watch.I loved the way Baz mixed current and past culture in so many ways - it made what could have been a period film into a relatable entity for so many people.The costumes in this film were remarkable as were the sets and effects, I could go on and on and start to write (probably really bad) poetry, that's how moving the visuals in Moulin Rouge were.HOWEVER I have one complaint: I did not cry. I was not moved by this film. It is an easy thing to do - I'm an emotional person, I walk into the cinema looking for opportunities to be swept away and moved inside by the production. Not in this movie though. The fundamental problem, for me, was the love affair. The love was not deep enough, they had not shared enough, their love had not really been tested enough for me to believe in it. Oh sure there was the Count, but he was a cartoon character - to ridiculous to be believably evil. I could not see him as a serious threat to the love of Satine and Christian.So there's my complaint. I couldn't cry at the demise of a love that was really too insubstantial to begin with.",,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely enthusiastic,"The first time I saw Moulin Rouge I really didn't know what to expect. A modern musical, using established songs for the sound track and Ewan and Nicole singing! I was blown away. I love Baz Luhrmans work anyway but I think he has excelled himself with this film. It is colourful, fun, vibrant and sad all at the same time. For me it has everything that a truely classic film should have and it is one which I can see over and over again without feeling that it has lost anything or grown tired with repeat watching.Baz Luhrmans over the top style of direction and the sheer opulance of his set productions would make this film worth viewing on its own, but add to that the wonderful chemistry between the two leads and the brilliance that is Jim Broadbent, (Like a Virgin will never be the same again!), and you have a truely enjoyable experience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a fantastic job with the kitsch music and they can truely sing. They are sexy, romantic and tragic by turn and carry off their roles perfectly.Any fans of Baz Luhrmans Strictly Ballroom or Romeo and Juliet will probably enjoy this film, especially if they like a good sing along followed by a good cry! I know that there are people out there who didn't enjoy this film, and I can understand that it isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I for one would rate this as my favourite film of the last few years and would urge anyone to watch it and make up their minds for themselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I can understand why some people don't like it...after all, it wasn't anything like what I was really expecting (I hadn't looked into the summaries very much).  If you try to take it seriously, then you may become irritated with the use of late-20th century music in a film set in 1900. Or maybe you are offended by the parody of the Sound of Music (which happens to be my all time favorite movie) or the operatic rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" or the medley of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" with Fatboy Slim's ""Because We Can"" or John Lennon's ""All You Need is Love"" with Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You.""  However, I challenge you to look beyond the dates and titles and just let the movie take you along for the incredible journey.

I was amazed by the overwhelming amount of emotion, intrigue, and dazzlement that I experienced while watching this film.  It captivated me more than any other recent movie.  It truly is a film that captures the essence of the Bohemian ideologies of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love.  Watch this movie, and be reminded that ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beyond Bad....Horrible,"This is the first film I ever walked out on.  I am at home right now while my wife and our friends watch the rest of this boring overhyped pice of junk. The diaglogue consists of the most inane drivel you have ever heard, making no sense.  It is like an overacted melodrama, but there is no story or vilain or anything of any kind to hold your interest.  In my life I have never walked out on any film (even though I've wanted to), but this film was so boring and horrible, I was about to climb up the wall.  I was so upset at how miserable this film was, I left to come home and do the world a service by writing this review.  There are several other IMDB reviews about Moulin Rouge similar to this one.

moulin rouge review,"Luhrmann succeeds again!Luhrmann's fourth film will leave you utterly exhausted.  The fast paced in your face dance routines and song performances are truly 'spectacular'. Moulin Rouge set in Paris 1900 mixes the high-class gentleman with second rate artists, bohemians and courtesans.The film sees Christian (Ewan McGregor - Little voice, Down With Love) a young talented poet move to Paris in search of fame as a writer.  He becomes entangled in a group of bohemians where he experiences the diverse magical world of the Moulin Rouge.  Employed by the bohemian's, Christian begins writing his first play, which they intend to perform at the club, Moulin Rouge. Toulouse (John Leguizamo - Romeo and Juliet) the leader of the group pretends to set up a meeting with Satine (Nicole Kidman - The Hours), the main courtesan of the club and Christian.  His intentions are to sell the play.  Meanwhile Zidler (Jim Broadbent - Bridget Jones's Diary) the owner of the club has set up a real meeting for the Duke (Richard Roxenburgh - Mission: Impossible II), a promising investor of the club, and Satine. When Satine mistakes Christian for the duke, he becomes besotted with her and madly in love.  She explains that she can't fall in love because she is a courtesan, but eventually her feelings prevail.The everyday plot of 'will love out do evil?' is a common convention of the musical genre, but some how you seem to forget this while watching. Luhrman's direction has exceeded again, leaving you gob smacked by its constant mirage of colour and fantasy-like scenes.  The use of 20th century music re-mixes such as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Roxanne' are successfully integrated within the plot, expressing the characters' feelings well.  The contrast between its time period and imaginative song selection, give an original flavour to the film.Another ingredient to the films impressive overview, is its phenomenal set and costume.  Although the main characters are lower class the piece somehow proclaims class and glamour throughout.The casting, which is somewhat unexpected, is exceptionally fulfilling.  I was surprised to see Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor in a musical genre but their talent as performers and singers were outstanding. The chemistry between the pair leaves you emotionally attached, which unless you have no feelings at all will be expressed at the end of the film.  I think any hatred for the character Duke will advance to sympathy. You begin to feel quite sorry for him because you get to see how lonely his character becomes.Baz Luhrmann is known for his curious fantasy like films and compared to his others, this one is no exception.  Enticed by its prominent story telling structure, Luhrmann takes you into his world for roughly 127 minutes to experience an intoxicating love story, which will have you singing along to all your favourite songs!",,Anonymous,Romance
This movie kicks a**!,"I luv Moulin Rouge. Its one of the best movies ive ever seen. It rulz! I cried the first two times i saw it. Everyone should c this film! The actors sacrificed a ton for this movie (for example nichole breaking bones in rehersal, which cost her the lead in the box office hit ""panic room""), and i think that its so cool that Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman both sang all of their songs.

Best Film In A Long Time,"This is the first, and to date, ONLY film that I have seen that has ever provoked me to comment on. One of the few masterpieces of this new era of films (1995 onward), Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! has captivated my soul. It is the only film that has evoked every possible emotion out of me. For those who haven't seen the film, please note that there may be some things spoiled in the next few sentences.I laughed with the bohemians, was smitten and totally in love with Christians and Satine, felt the burning rage and jealousy of Christian as his love was toyed with, was as genuinely torn apart as Satine as she balanced true love with her career, and admittedly cried when Satine died, leaving Christian to bear it all.I strongly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. In it's lavishness is the pure and unadulterated love story that will surely leave you spellbound and breathless when leaving the theatre.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Moulin Rouge captures the essence of love,"'Moulin Rouge' illustrates that one of the most important things in life is to love and be loved.  The movie is about a young man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who travels to Paris to write about love.  Soon there after, he meets the beautiful courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman).  In a very Romeo and Juliet-like moment, they fall in love, but are pulled apart by outside forces.  Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the 'Moulin Rouge', tells Satine to make the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) believe she loves him so he'll invest in the 'Moulin Rouge'.  She tries to play both sides, but of course it catches up to her and she's forced to make a choice.  'Moulin Rouge' is directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann ('Romeo + Juliet') and he does anything but hold back on his creative style of filmmaking.In any movie, color plays a role in how a movie is detailed.  In 'Moulin Rouge' certain colors stand out and seem to play their own part in the movie.  The color red traditionally symbolizes love and death.  The use of the color in this film is emphasizing the search of love for both Christian and Satine.  It also foreshadows the inevitable death of Satine.  Red is the first color the audience sees, when the curtain rises, and also the last color the audience sees, when the curtain closes.  Throughout the movie, red is used elaborately in costumes and setting.  The décor in both the elephant dressing room and the Moulin Rouge is mostly red and the majority of the costumes are red or red tone.  Even the title, when translated, means red windmill.Probably the strongest thematic element would be the music.  'Moulin Rouge' is a musical, telling the story through music and dialogue.  The use of music is unique in that only one song (`Come What May') is an original song specifically for 'Moulin Rouge'.  Songs such as `Your Song', the various songs from `The Elephant Medley', `Come What May', and `Roxanne' all reflect the theme of love.There are many movies that try to capture the essence of love.  Some succeed, some fail.  'Moulin Rouge' has definitely succeeded.  Throughout the movie, the bohemian's belief in truth, freedom, beauty, and love is echoed constantly from the beginning with Christian to the bohemians reciting the line in a song at the end.  As they say in the movie, the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie EVER made!,"Moulin Rouge is the best film ever made, period. Why? Well, the cast are just perfect. The two leads, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are great together. They have a very unique chemistry together. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler is wonderful, and he can even sing!The songs chosen are just right. They fit in perfectly with the story and aren't just there to take up time in the film. I would also like to praise Baz Luhrmann for his outstanding direction of this masterpiece.Faults? Absolutely none. Even the professor of pickiness at Oxford University wouldn't be able to find anything wrong with this movie. And if you haven't seen it yet, DO, you won't be dissapointed, I promise you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like being served a disgusting burger in a three-star restaurant,"God, how I detest this film (though in all fairness I liked the opening credits). I hate most of the songs(so I'm a devotee of the Great American Songbook - sue me), the dances (which aren't THAT great, see the DVD) are obscured by MTV-on-speed cutting, the story, though 'mythical' is so thin and predictable that I cannot understand how anyone could be moved by this (or why it took Lurmann and his co-writer so long to get the story 'right' - it's a direct steal from La Bohème/ La dame au Camélias). And though Ewan and Nicole's performances are decent, I am not a fan of either performer and really couldn't care less about them. So at the tragic finale I just laugh scornfully at the deliberate tearjerking instead of being (even slightly) moved. On top of this, the vulgarity and over-the-top camp act as total turnoffs for me. If someone wants to 'reinvent' the musical, why not DO IT LIKE THEY USED TO, going for real charm and delighting in the sensuousness of performance instead of having the director ego-trip the whole time through (why can't any director understand that in musicals THE PERFORMERS DANCE WHILE THE CAMERA STAYS STILL???!!!) Definitely one of the most irritating film experiences of the year. But what can one expect from a film which, while claiming to use the 'best ever songs of the twentieth century', opens with the abysmally wretched 'Nature Boy'??? I am so glad I only saw this on a review copy DVD - any money I had to pay for it would have been daylight robbery.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Huh? I must have been sitting in the wrong theatre.,"I WANTED to like Moulin Rouge. I liked Romeo & Juliet. I liked Strictly Ballroom. I like oddball films, I appreciate offbeat juxtapositions. I should have like this.But I didn't. Oh, there were things to appreciate. Some very interesting performances, a great soundtrack, inventive (if overdone) sets, and an attempt to somehow parody itself.... but it came off.....forced. Unnatural.Rocky Horror and even films like O Brother Where Art Thou get away with high camp because you KNOW it's camp. With Moulin Rouge you got the feeling that the actors, and far too much of the audience, were taking it seriously.",,Anonymous,Romance
what dreams are truly made of,"i have dreamt of this film every night since i've seen it.  before seeing it, i was a little skeptical at how the whole musical deal would work out, but it was mind-blowing, exciting, full of emotion, and so much fun. incredible cinematography, colors everywhere.  it starts off with very fast cutting, and shots that go all over the place, slightly disorienting (on purpose) and it sucks you into the story and once you're in, you don't come out.  even after the credits are over it seems like you're living in that life of ""bohème"" of 1900 paris.  even the credits are fantastic, they literally scroll down in the end on a very long piece of paper with what seems to be candlelight in the background.  the singing is incredible, the visuals are incredible (the green absinthe fairy still flies around in my head), the plot is pretty good, overall this film is fantastic and EVERYONE should see, (preferably in theaters to really get the full effects).  this movie is about love and i LOVED it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Moulin Rouge is absolutely, overwhelmingly the most fantastical film that I have ever seen.  I cannot believe that I missed this movie in theaters and never bothered renting it.  I was so blown away by this film - which is funny, because it wasn't until I watched this movie that I remembered that as a child, I adored John Houston's Moulin Rouge.  That was a very different movie, where if memory serves me right, I felt very drawn and empathetic towards Toulouse Lautrec and the Can Can girls.  But it's ironic to see a movie about the same place and same period of time that is so true to the spirit of the Moulin Rouge and yet absolutely different and original from any of the movies that came before it.The cinematography is breathtaking.  I know some people criticized it as being too much but I could not get enough of it.  And Nicole Kidman was born to be Satine.  Ewan McGregor made me feel like I was a little girl getting a childhood crush all over again for the first time.  I cannot stress how much I enjoyed seeing these two opposite one another.  They're not a pair I ever would've thought of, but they work so beautifully opposite each other. The music is Wonderful.  So totally cool to hear Nirvana and Elton John and Marilyn's calling card and Material Girl all blended into a kind of crazy insanely cool operatic opus of modern culture.  Baz Luhrman is in a league of his own and his vision is nothing short of extraordinary.  I enjoyed his Romeo and Juliet due to the visuals and his unique vision of an often told story, but with Moulin Rouge he has graduated straight from grade school to a Master's Degree.Entirely it's own world - absolutely wonderful.  But most of all, exquisite. He has totally resurrected and redefined the genre of the musical and it is an astounding pleasure.  And Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor earned my undying support for taking a chance and committing themselves one hundred percent to the story.  I'm so thrilled that it paid off for all of them and their hard work.A high recommend.  And a gushing 10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The film that should have swept the board at the Oscars is ...,"Moulin Rouge!From what I can gather reading other user responses on this site, this film very much divides audiences into black and white categories. You either love it or you loathe it. May I be so bold as to suggest that this is solid proof of a work of art? It leaves no one indifferent.I reside in the former category, that of love! (bordering on obsession if I'm honest) I saw this film five times at the cinema and would rate it as one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever had the privilege to partake of.Why did I love Moulin Rouge so much? Have you got a spare couple of days?:1 - Stunning, breathtaking visuals. So colourful and enchanting to look at.2 - Baz Luhrmann is a genius. There was not one moment in this film that he had not agonised over. I would like to have seen him presented with a 'Best Director' Oscar this year, as this man is gifted and deserves huge kudos. What a surprise that the academy once again opted for a conventional choice, and the outrage that Luhrmann was not even nominated! There is no way in this world that any of the nominees put as much heart and soul into their work as this man breathed into his. He is a phenomenon.3 - The music. Beautiful. There was not a piece of music or re working of a song in the entire film that I didn't like and I can only hope that Baz Luhrmann's film will help start a new era in getting musicals back onto our cinema screens. I'm sick of teen filcks I want to see more intelligent films like this one!4 - The perfect balance of humour, surreal visuals and comedy with the tragic love story. Any film that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure has to be applauded.5 - The Performances. First of all let me say how stunning Nicole Kidman is. She is captivating and reminds me of a screen Goddess from the golden age of cinema. Her voice is, granted, not west end musical standard but it is very, very capable and human sounding. Ewan McGregor is a star with a lovely boyish look about him and a Robbie Williams style singing voice. Both are fantastic, play their roles to perfection and have excellent chemistry together on screen. A delight to watch. The supporting cast are also excellent. I especially loved (the amazing) Jim Broadbent and Caroline O'Connor.I could go on and on, but I would like to put a theory forward as to why some are disliking this film. I honestly think that it is above the heads of the average member of the cinema going public, most of whom are accustomed to hi concept trash and popcorn films. Luhrmann's film is postmodern and unconventional - two factors which make it unnapealing to a popcorn movie crowd. Despite that, I do accept that even to individuals who 'get it', its dizzying pace and hypnotic look may still be too much. Overall, 'Moulin Rouge' is an acquired taste. For what my view is worth, I would rate it as one of the finest films ever made and the nearest I have ever been to a theatrical experience in a cinema building. Thank you Baz Lurhmann: you deserve every success. Thank you for daring to be bold, and daring to break new ground. Thank you for the passion that goes into every frame of your work. Thank you for your energy, your vitality and your dedication! Just a huge thank you really! The Academy need their heads examining for overlooking this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wow.,"I had so many preconceived notions about this movie, as is understandable, even for someone who doesn't watch television, when you're talking about a film that was hyped as much as this one and which has such a following.  I didn't watch it until tonight because I was afraid I wouldn't like it.  For the first twenty minutes or so I thought I was right, because *other* preconceived notions I had were being laid waste left and right, and that took some mental adjustment.  Once I settled in, however, and got used to the stylized presentation I found myself more and more enjoying *Moulin Rouge* for what it was -- an amazing, well-put-together combination of lightheartedness (even silliness) and deep emotion.  The music is wonderful (even, perhaps especially, the odd but fitting usage of modern songs).  The singing is breathtaking.  There are moments that made me laugh out loud and yet the end had me nearly in tears -- what a staggering range of emotion this movie encompasses.  Every character was acted to perfection; I could go on for pages and not do justice, not only to Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, but also to the entire supporting cast.  As I mentioned previously, the stylized production took some getting used to, but by mid-film I found it adding rather than detracting from my enjoyment, for the most part. Perhaps there were some devices (the jerky movements) which were irritating even until the end.  The writing and direction overall are superb -- the whole-cast scenes as well as the more personal moments.  This is a movie well worth watching; I'm glad I stuck it out past the first twenty minutes or so and let myself really get into it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely brilliant,"Moulin Rouge is a movie unlike any other. It tells the simplest of stories in a most unsimple way. This movie is so original and so amazing, that is must be seen more than once to truly take in all of its greatness. It's a shame that the Academy went with the ""been there, done that"" A Beautiful Mind, and ignored the originality that is Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman is fantastic, and deserved the Oscar for this performance, which shows all of her range, from comedy, to singing, to heartbreaking drama. Ewan McGreggor is also very good, as is Jim Broadbent, who really won his Oscar for this performance, despite what movie he was nominated for. Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that dared to be bold and original, and offer up something new and fresh to movie goers. It succeeded in giving us a movie that will be around for a long time. It's just a shame that as usual, when someone tries something different, the old guard stands up and shouts that they like things the way they are, and take every chance they get to bad mouth the new thing, and attempt to keep things the same. To you all I say too bad, because while there are lots of you out there, the majority has seen the light, and this movie is being embraced like none I've ever seen before. Its 8 Oscar nominations are a good indicator of that. To anyone who has not seen this movie, give it a chance, it may surprise you, as it did I, in the most spectacular spectacular of ways.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thank You,"Darn it.I used to be a movie lover. I loved most good films whether they were drama, romantic comedy, war, western...even musicals. I saw Moulin Rouge two weeks ago, on DVD. Last week, I rented Legally Blonde, a film I expected to enjoy. I didn't. I thought it was most unoriginal, unfunny, and a bore. The following day, I bought Moulin Rouge on DVD, and I've been watching it since...(without/with commentaries, behind the scenes stuff, choreography etc...there's a lot to get through!)I have a sinking feeling that I'm trapped in a world where the only movie I want to see is Moulin Rouge. Every film I've seen seems to pale in terms of the enjoyment factor. Honestly, it's like a drug!

Style over substance - what's wrong with that?,"I saw Moulin Rouge three days ago for the first time, on DVD, and apart from the film, the DVD is very much worth seeing - buying even!You may guess from that comment, that I loved it. 3 days later, I'm still left with a warm glow. The film is unashamedly about love, and I can understand many people hating it, because it's not a substantive film, like perhaps ""A Beautiful Mind"". To me, its the opposite of that film, where you are perhaps led to believe that you a fly on the wall of the life of Nash. Moulin Rouge is about being aware that this is fiction, that these characters aren't real, and showing an idyllic form of love that perhaps everyone should strive for, even if we can never reach it. The Moulin Rouge was a nightclub, and even today when we go to a nightclub, in a sense, its about leaving the real world behind, having a few drinks, dancing like maniacs, and maybe even finding love. Nightclubs are not about substance; they're about leaving substance behind.The film is pure entertainment, a feast for the eyes, ears and heart, not for the brain. The frenetic pace, the colour, the familiar and sentimental love songs, the fantasy characters and the comedy which is absolute farce, make this film a unique experience. The audience is asked to sit back and enjoy, without really trying to preach or teach you anything. It demonstrates that film can be pure art, like a painting or music or dance, with no other agenda but to lift you out of the mundane ordinariness of life.Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for getting this film made, in an era where superficiality can be frowned upon, and films must fall into a category dictated by marketing people. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who were intelligent enough to see what he was trying to achieve, and going out on a limb with him to achieve it. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for his originality, bravery and vision in avoiding formulaic or so called ""worthy"" film-making. He has proved himself a visionary before, and he proves it again with Moulin Rouge. It is a shame that the Academy have not acknowledged him this year, because surely this was a directing triumph. I suspect that Moulin Rouge will go home empty handed from the Oscars, but that is an indictment of Hollywood, not of this great film. It is not only the best film of 2002, but probably the best film of the past ten years.Nicole Kidman was incredible in her perfectly judged over the top performance, as was Ewan McGregor for his wide-eyed innocence and purity. And the singing? Brilliant. They looked like two people utterly in love, and gave those old love songs a depth of meaning that they never had before.Maybe I'm shallow, but I'll take Baz Luhrmann's style over Ron Howard's substance any day of the week.Ten out of Ten!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love it or hate it.,"The definitive film to divide both critics and cinema-goers, Moulin Rouge is a film like no other. From the moment the curtain glides up, the audience are swept along on an outrageously extravagant anecdote of truth, beauty, freedom and above all, love. Luhrmann's undeniably ambitious film is a two hour immersion in colour, sound and emotion that leaves your body saturated with a euphoric exhilaration that precious few other films can provide. I will not pretend that this film is the best that you will ever see, for as much as I enjoyed it, I am inclined to agree with some of the more cynical reviewers on this board that certain inclusions are questionable.However, to examine it short comings would detract from what is a spectacular cinematic experience. If one can watch this film with nothing more than mild curiosity, then I am sure that you will enjoy it immensely.

Hopelessly disappointing ----,"I feel keenly that ""Hollywood"" seems no longer able to produce ANYTHING on screen that can reach the discerning public.  This film -- was it a film?? or a video-taped hopeful for broadway?? -- the ""singing"" was just so -- just so flat, loud, and emotionless, reminding one of a b-grade and copycat off-broadway score ... and one should not even mention that it was totally out of era (don't tell the kids - they'll believe anything we show them at this point) ... I thought this film (movie seems a better word) gross and disgusting in every sense. I worry some that we had to allow Nicole Kidman a flaunt of her assets on screen just before and during her much hyped divorce from whats-his-name. Along with the recent throw up of a re-made Pearl Harbor, (see Tora, Tora, Tora for a much better propagandic rendition), I feel most strongly about avoiding anything that is made in the hills of hollywood at this point.  If they are worried about revenue, they won't be seeing my money for years to come -- dreadful stuff.  Look to cable and the independents, and don't forget about the Brits and Europe for what is really counting on film.

Never Fall in Love,"I liked Baz Luhrmann's previous works such as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" but ""Moulin Rouge"", in my opinion, was perfect, I'd give it ten stars if I could.

The film was a bit too dramatic at times and the cinematography was incredible...""Moulin Rouge"" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Baz Luhrmann should have had an Oscar nomination.Some people criticized the cinematography for being too vibrant and colorful but that was the best feature of the movie. Normally, I do not care for musicals but this is more than 'just a musical'...it has elements of drama and comedy as well. Nicole Kidman was absolutely beautiful and she did a FANTASTIC job as Satine. ""Moulin Rouge"" was a large [array] of colors, music and the craziest, most gaudy sounds of music ever! The costumes fit the movie very well.The music was great too. It was cool to hear Nirvana, ""Lady Marmalade"", ""Material Girl"" and Marilyn Monroe's calling card all at once.

The best musical of all time!,"Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman surprised most of the Moulin Rouge audience with their singing abilities in this film. Add to that a wonderful musical production, a great story, and great acting from top to bottom, and Moulin Rouge is my favorite film from 2001. (Believe me, that surprises me more than you.)That is especially significant considering that I have never liked musicals, and I have rarely liked such a love story. I suppose most teenage males wouldn't. But I saw, I liked, and eventually nothing could top it. The best reason for this, I think, is the soundtrack. I was absolutely taken aback by the music from this film. I bought the soundtrack, bought the second volume, bought the promotional score, and even ripped audio from the DVD that couldn't be found on any musical release.Of course, this film isn't for everyone, and the awards shows earlier this year have proven that. Still, Moulin Rouge was (in my humble opinion) the best movie of 2001, and one of the best of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tried for a second time,"I thought maybe the first time I watched it many years ago I was in the wrong mood or frame of mind. I decided to give it another chance. Unfortunately it was about the same reaction I had before. Garish and grotesque and in your face. Nicole Kidman has a career of miscast roles. She is good with certain kinds of roles but is often cast in the wrong part due to being a big name that can help promote a project. The direction is all over the place and convoluted. Ewen McGregor does well as the naive, idealistic and hopeful young writer. The sets and production designs should be a plus but are also too much and very distracting.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Musical You Will Actually Enjoy!,"You know, it's strange how most people either love it or hate it. No middle ground. Anyway . . .When Moulin Rouge was being advertised, I shuddered at the thought of having to sit through a musical. I HATE musicals! So, I skipped it. About a year later, there was nothing new at Blockbuster, so I picked it up.WOW! Moulin Rouge turned out to be such a wonderful movie (probably the only musical I'll ever like, though). Everything about it was fantastic and impressing.It's interesting because instead of the actors telling you what they feel, they sing it (and you can actually like the songs)! Music and singing can express feelings that words cannot. The simplest phrase when sung can add a lot more meaning and emotion.The songs were entertaining, the costumes and scenery were amazing, and the story line really keeps your interest. This film is very different and unique, which makes it so worth the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Hate Musicals....I loved This!,"I had no idea what to expect from Moulin Rouge except for i knew it was a musical which fills me with dread as i hate musicals.What i saw was a brilliant piece of film making that is unlike anything i have seen before. For starters the music was not what i was expecting , it encorporates modern pop songs instead of fluffy , new , songs which made it all the more enjoyable. The photography is fantastic especially the panning from one building to another and the rushing from street to street and the set is brilliant. The story is hardly rocket science and is easy to follow especially because the cast is headed by two brilliant young performers in Nocole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.The rest of the cast are superb too.

A spectacular visual journey with a modern musical flair...,"(8/10)I rented Moulin Rouge! with low expectations. Ive never particularly liked musicals, and was cautious of this new ""modern"" type. My expectations, visual limits, everything ,dashed. Moulin Rouge! is in cocept a simple movie, and like most musicals doesn't have much depth or extensive plot or character development. The most important thing in watching this movie is that you except it for what it is, a musical, not an emotional drama.The most stunning aspect of Moulin Rouge is certainly the visual imagery that dazzles you at every corner, and the cinematography that brings the never ending bustle of extroardinary activity in the Moulin Rouge! nightclub in 1900 Paris to the viewers in a stylish manner. The acting, despite its Oscar nods, was not all that impressive to me...but it sufficed for this particular type of movie.Overall, it definitely deserves its Oscar nomination and a watch from every movie-lover out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

In fact, I saw it as part of a friend's film class, and he said he was going to show the first three reels after his night class, and I went back to see the first part again.  The first hour of that movie was one of the most spectacular things I have seen on film.  I would urge anyone to see this movie.  I will agree that it is not for everyone, but one may be surprised by it like I was.  Since it is a musical, you have to give it a chance to be what it is.  People don't break into song like that, but it works here, like all good musicals.  It also goes from campy to serious to funny to sad, all in the space of a few minutes.  Most films don't seems to do this effectively.  This one does.  Again, I would urge you to see it if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ewan McGregor's teeth look like he's been chewing on dirt, his hair looked like a wig, and he looks like he smells like he's a heavy smoker.

A massive storm of music,"If you don't like movie musicals, don't make the mistake of dismissing ""Moulin Rouge"". For it is no ordinary musical. It's more of a massive storm of music, visuals and emotions, resplendent with all the decadence of turn-of-the-century cultural life in Paris, loaded with musical anachronisms ranging from Nirvana to ""Sound of Music"", all with a rapid music video style. Compelling, spellbinding and very, very funny. The story, otherwise crippled by sentimentality and awful cheesiness, is brought to its feet by this enormous mass of motion. Ol' Paris anno 1899 is brought to scandalous life and the drinking of Absinthe is glorified by the absinthe fairy, Kylie Minogue. This is the very definition of entertainment.10/10 for an outrageous, insane monster movie musical. I'm off to buy the soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absolutely stunning film that reinvents the musical.,"Any filmmaker that can reinvent a tired genre, bring new magic to the screen and to the hearts of a younger generation, deserves kudos. Baz Luhrman is this man - although we should not forget his fantastic crew and talented production heads (as well as focus-puller). It goes to show that even in way down-under in Australia (I am half-Australian), far, far from Hollywood, it is possible to do world-class imaginative features, developed, produced, and edited in Australia (Lord of the Rings supports the same supposition in New Zeland).Nicole Kidman is brilliant, as is the set design and the costumes. Nothing, however, outshines the brilliance of the screenplay (Craig Pearce, Baz Luhrman), which magnificently weaves music throughout the ages in through it's classic comic tragedy storyline.Congratulations!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Three Movies in One: All of them Bad,"The Moulin Rouge is a theater in Paris known for its elaborate and and somewhat racy shows, now a favorite for tourists visiting the city (I myself have fallen into that category).  With all of the media attention bestowed on this project because of Nicole Kidman, and the fact that this was a musical, I was curious to see how it had turned out (plus my girlfriend wanted to go).The film begins quite promisingly, with an elaborate computer generation of Paris in 1899, including some whimsical touches, showing very interestingly the area of Paris in which the Moulin Rouge (""Red Windmill"" in English) is found.  I was reminded immediately of Tim Burton's work, with the attention to detail, and slightly surrealistic atmosphere; (I was also reminded of Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" with its rooftops of London scenes). This alone makes the movie worth seeing (well, almost).The movie starts out cheerfully, and somewhat goofily, in a good natured way, to introduce the protagonist, an aspiring writer on sojourn from London.  When he begins to sing ""The Hills are Alive (With the Sound of Music)"" as suggested lyrics for a show on which his bohemian upstairs neighbors are laboring to produce for the proprietor the Moulin Rouge, the movie takes a turn into what I thought was parody, but sadly, was a harbinger of what to expect for the next two hours.Nicole Kidman is a prostitute employed by the moulin Rouge as a singer, but she refers to herself (and her occupation) by the more noble sound epithet of ""courtesan"".  This may elevate in some way her status in the film, but unfortunately for her, it does nothing to help her singing, which is generally on the level of a medium sized high school musical.  Editing techniques vary from styles lifted directly from the (very) old 1960's TV show The Monkees"" to the frenetic MTV music video genre.  All of this is pasted onto a very tired old plot about star-crossed lovers and a buffoonish wealthy rival for Miss Kidman's affections. Anachronistic uses of modern songs become jarring, like some Saturday Night Live skit that drags on and on; (some in the audience laughed heartily, blissfully unaware that it wasn't supposed to be funny).By the film's end, it is nothing more than a poorly scored and overbloated opera, or Shakespearean tragedy.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

You'll Either Love It or You'll Hate It ...,"... because I cannot imagine feeling neutral about this film. I happened to love it, although I admit that it took me fifteen to twenty minutes to adjust to its frenetic pacing, its farcical tone, and its fanciful melodramatic presentation. 'Moulin Rouge!' is a film to contend with; its images are sometimes spectacularly beautiful, at other times dark and nightmarish. It looks like one or all of the following could have directed it: Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Orson Welles, and Bob Fosse. Set in 1899 in the Montemarte section of Paris, during the rise of the bohemian movement and awash with colorful characters, savory and unsavory, 'Moulin Rouge!' is the retelling of the famous 'Camille' story (a.k.a. 'La Boheme', a.k.a. 'Rent'). At the heart of the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub is the fabulous Satine, a courtesan of unbelievable beauty and renown, performed with lusty opulence by Nicole Kidman. Satine is being pursued by two men--a rich and worldly Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, who all but twirls his moustache around his finger as evil epitomized; and by Christian, a naïve and penniless writer, played in a winning performance by Ewan McGregor, who instantly gains the audience's empathy with his large and expressive, aquatic eyes. Satine needs the financial backing that the Duke can provide to assist her in becoming a real actress, but falls in love with Christian, who captures her heart with his simplicity and his idealized concept of love. Early on the audience learns that Satine is consumptive, thus setting the stage for light farce transfiguring itself into rich tragedy. The costumes are wildly extravagant and gorgeous; the sets sensual and voluptuous--fantastical buildings and exquisite skylines that, at first glance, look as if they were conceived by a psychopathic drag queen on a hit of acid. But the backdrops are in themselves necessary characters to this eye filling production. The songs--most of which will be familiar to the MTV generation--are magnificently arranged and are given new meaning by their context in the movie; you will never hear them quite the same way again. McGregor's surprising vocal talent--at times a soft and delicate delivery, at other times surging and strong--gives new life to Elton John's 'This Is Your Song'. It is a scene as joyful and uplifting as watching Gene Kelly singing and dancing in street puddles in 'Singing in the Rain'. Kidman's voice is a bit thin and breathy, but she more than compensates for it with her astonishing abilities as an actor, and is delightful in the clever combination of 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' and 'A Material Girl'. A Carmenesque, flamenco-stylized version of The Police's 'Roxanne' is dangerous and spine tingling. Perhaps the most outrageous treatment of our recent pop past is of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'; it is reminiscent of the title scene from 'Hello Dolly!', hilariously overblown, complete with dancing and singing waiters. Like I said, this film isn't for everyone. Many will be put off by the apparent overacting of the cast, misunderstanding the intentional quality of melodrama that is inherent in the concept of the overall piece, and by its lavish cacophony which gives the film its carnival-like feel. It is, in the end, a beautifully realized, intentionally bohemian enactment of an oft-told bohemian tale--at its core is the movement's motto: 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love.' Who could ask for anything more?  A triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wonder what the ancients would have replied to the moral stated here?

"I also love ""Moulin Rouge!""","I wish I could come up with some better lines on why this movie is excellent, but I was blown away, aamazed, my eyes gleamed through the whole film, I gladly added a new favorite movie to my big list. Everything was just so grand. The best thing about MOULIN ROUGE was the fact that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman did their own singing. Ewan had such a beautiful voice. It was so emotional. He talks of releasing his own album, and I hope he does. I hear of people who say that the movie rips off so many songs, but that's not the case. MOULIN ROUGE does not take credit for these songs. The essense of the songs were used to bring out the theme of the movie, and the peopel who created these songs are given full credit, especially for having created such meaningful music in the first place. Besides singing wonderfully, Ewan and Nicole gave wonderful performances. I think Ewan should have been nominated for best actor at the Acadamy. And then he should have won. (Even though Denzel was great.) Jim Broadbent was also a fantastic note. His character of Harold Zidler was outrageous. He had so much energy, and was extremely theatrical. I loved his antics. Richard Roxburgh was also very good in playing a weasly villain. His mustache and floppy hair really added to his rodent like features that just made him so irritatingly evil, that I wanted him to lose in the end. I hope everyone realizes that the four themes of this movie are true, and I hope that they spread to everyone. I can honestly say that I was inspired after watching MOULIN ROUGE. While I don't isolate myself into movies, I do believe that they teach us how things should be, and MOULIN ROUGE is no exception of a film that shows us true meanings in life.

"Both ""old-fashioned cinema"" and ultra-modern film-making.","It has been said many times (here at this comments board as well as other places) that MR is one of those films you either love or hate. There is no real 'middle of the road' option here. For that reason alone, any serious film buff should watch it and make up his/her own mind. Take it or leave it - MR is an important film.Personally I took one long look at it. And another long look. And yet another. I was brought up watching classic MGM musicals as well as MTV. I may well be the target audience. MR's synthesis of old-fashioned musical magic (just note the ensemble work of the ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" scene) and what some critics have called 'postmodernism' (such as the Bollywood-meets-Marilyn Monroe scene) works for me. It truly does work even if the film sounds absolutely nuts on paper.Visually it is a feast. I cannot remember the last time I have seen such a beautiful, well-designed film. Aurally it is a feast too - I'm not going to give away all the delightful musical references, but some very inspired montages made me simultaneously laugh and gawk.However, the main reason it works so well is because of the actors. Nicole Kidman has been singled out in many reviews - and she is excellent and manages to lose her Icy Queen demeanour - but the film is an ensemble piece. Every tiny part is cast to perfection - at first I was admittedly not sure about the villaineous Duke, but I suddenly realised he was a sinister version of Cecil Vyse of ""A Room with a View"". It made perfect sense. Still, I do feel the need to single out Ewan McGregor. Baz Luhrman has described McGregor as an injection of warm blood into the film. It is easy to tell. McGregor is clearly having the time of his life dancing and singing his heart out. t puts a huge smile on my face.Usually I'm reluctant to give high praise to films - but to me, MR was a clearcut 10. It is a homage to the possibilities of cinema, it is a good-spirited celebration of The All Good Things In Life and finally it is simply just a fantastic film.

deeply disappointing,"Considering the hype, I was not surprised at how poor this flick was, but it did get respectable reviews, so off I went.  The opening sequence did not bode well; altogether too high energy to build on, it left the eye with nowhere to rest and, oddly, nothing to look at.  It all went downhill from there.

One of the best movies I have ever seen,Moulin Rouge was a truly wonderful movie that I will love for many years to come. I had never been into love stories of any sort until I saw this movie.

Baz Luhrmann did a wonderful job at making the Moulin Rouge and all it's characters come to life. It was amazing to me how they took all these hits and made them seem like new again. The costumes were amazing and gave it all the more life and energy. The Dance numbers were exhilirating and amazing. It was a truly wonderful movie and will always be at the top of my list. Not only because it is original and unique but a journey told through song and dance about to people who love eachother but are pulled apart by jelousy.

absolutely one of the best films of 2001!,"Moulin Rouge! is breath-taking and a wonderful film. It's been a long time since I saw any good musicals in the films (the last one was Evita).It's a stylish piece of art, and a movie that you will treasure.

MOULIN ROUGE (DIDIER BECU),"Strange how one of the biggest things in Hollywood, namely the musical, has vanished the last decades as the recent years we only saw ""Dancer in the dark"" and ""Chicago"" making it big and of course this superb masterpiece from Baz Luhmann. Baz does something strange, he brings us back in the early 1900 namely in the decadent Paris at where we are invited to the strangest parties at Le Moulin Rouge. This is a musical that's never been done before, as even if we are hundred years back we hear modern popsongs (Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana) performed in a pure Broadwaystyle and it works splendid. It tells us the impossible story of a poor novelist who has to win a dancer Nicole Kidman who is destinated to sell her body, and for the sake of the Moulin Rouge she must marry the evil duke who put all his money in the cabaret. The cinematographic stills are amazing, so are the costumes and decors as this is indeed like you're in the middle of some decadent show. One of the most inspiring movies I recently saw and again an amazing Kidman.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
But if you're open...,"This is a very unusual film, and certainly one that that many viewers will not even watch all the way through.  It is also a shocking film, but not in the sense the word is generally used.  There is very little in the way of explicit sex or violence, and the humor, while a far cry from the standard Hollywood fare, does not attempt to push the envelope of bad taste. Moulin Rouge! is shocking in that every aspect of its design, from the over-the-top acting, to the frenetic editing, to the lavish sets and the unconventional manner of telling the the story, is a spectacular departure from conventional filmaking.  This is why so many people dislike it, but also why, for those who do enjoy it, repeated viewings are so rewarding.  The more comfortable one becomes with the film, the better it seems.  For my part, I was not sure what to think of Moulin Rouge! the first time I saw it, but I liked it enough to see it again, and I have seen it several times since.  It is true that it is not for everyone, but I would encourage just about anyone to see it at least once.  To use the words of the movie's male lead, played by Ewan McGregor, Moulin Rouge! ""is very modern... and may feel a bit strange at first.  But if you're open, I think you might enjoy it.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bohemian storm is brewing!!!!!!,"Moulin Rouge takes you back in the 19th century France,in Paris,in the worldwide known cabaret ""Moulin Rouge"". Moulin Rouge is the tale of a beautiful courtesan Satin the star of the cabaret, who falls in love with a young ambitious poet, Christian. But Satin wants to become a famous actress and if she wants to achieve this she has to be with the Duke,the man who produces the theatrical play in which she will star.So Satin will have to make a choice either to follow her dream and become a well known actress or let herself enjoy her romance with Christian.The movie is a fantastic dramatic musical directed by the visionary director Baz Lurhman.The cast is magnificent too, Nicole Kidman dazzles as Satin and her co-star Ewan McGregor is very charming (They both do their own singing in the movie). Let Moulin Rouge take you to another world, where you will be amazed by the set,the costumes,the bohemian world of Toulouse Lautrec(played by Jonh Leguizamo) and the music composed by Armstrong.

Please tell me it was a spoof....,"WEll...as I do every year, I make a late end push to see all the films with oscar buzz, thus I found myself renting Moulin on DVD.   First the good points:A) the technical merits were all stunning.  The lighting, sound, cinematography,(esp the opening CGI shot), costumes(brilliant) and art direction were all world class. As I sat and watched the film I said to myself ""this may give LOTR  a run for its money in all things technical that arent CGI"". So, kudos to the grunts who did the tech workNow the bad parts.Script, script, script.  All of the above was ruined once the actors openend their mouths.  Now, granted, I didnt walk into the theater expecting say the drama of Eisenstein..but still, for an oscar-touted film I expected some sort of ...I dunno....depth to the screenplay.  Around hour three,(right around the time my rear started to really ache) I finally said to myself ""you know...maybe  its like a spoof..an Homage to the culture of the late 19th century fin-de-cicle Paris...maybe its intent is not to *really* tell a story as much as it is to paint a sketch of the time period...""  I really hope this was the case. Any decent opera fan will have flashbacks of familiarity during the film. It is a combination La Traviata( doomed courtesan(whore-)with comsumption(Tuberculosis) gives up her idealistic(and dim) lover to save him and goes under the protection of a powerful Duke), and one part  La Boheme( poor, penniless artists of late 19th cen paris[ Mcgregor and CO} live it up while their writer friend [Mcgregor]  falls in love with a woman doomed to die of consumption[kidman]).  So, with that pre knowledge of the genre and of the time period I thought to myself, maybe the director is giving an homage to these operas and the time period in general, and making them accesible to the modern viewer by using 'pop'  melodrama instead of an original score to underline the story.  Now, that idea settled better with me than the trite garbage that I sat thru for close on three hours.  But still, even if it was the directors intention, its nearly a waste of good lighting and costumes.  Now..I enjoy a silly spectacle as much as anyone ( I love Rocky Horror, hell, I even own a copy of Pirates of Penzance on VHS...but those movies had no pretensions of serious filmaking in either case nor the budget of Moulin)....but, I just found the whole film , while pretty to look at, trite and vapid.  Granted, the storylines of the original operas arent that much better...but at least they had the brilliance of Verdi and Puccini to elevate the words and give them meaning...sadly, Madonna doesnt quite do that in this film.In short....its a visual spectacle, but at the end, all I really wanted to do was put on my cd of La boheme and flush the taste of this movie out of my mouth.Incidentallly, I also saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch that night, and by far that was the smarter, and better made musical....with original music to boot!  However, Moulin did win on eye candy.  But, I do think that maybe one reviewer on here had it right when he said this film was sort of an experiment, on just how far you can stretch a story with the soundtrack. Lets face it, the mark of movie lacking any real strong storytelling is the proliferance of the score to give weight to the 'emotional' moments of the film ( see Titanic, Pearl Harbor, LOTR,nearly any Speilberg movie  etc) So, this movie takes it one step further, by incorporating the score into the actual storyline...I must say, judging by the result of the hoopla, MR. Luhrman may be on to something...and thats very sad to learn.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bombastic fun.,"Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Moulin Rouge, and cinema's fourth visit, is a boisterous musical journey into the famed seedy underworld of early 2oth century Paris. Visually arresting and with more energy than Tom Cruise on speed, Luhrmann's film strikes a rare balance of appearing to be on the brink of losing control while remaining sharply focused and fully on key. For a cast with no track record in musicals, there's an inherent 'holding of breath' before each characters melodic introduction and although it's clear that neither Kidman of McGregor are ever going to win awards for vocal prowess, their commitment and respective charms are more than enough to keep the central love story alive while allowing us to marvel at the stunning musical arrangements that cover a colourful medley of everything from Rogers and Hammerstein to Nirvana. Beyond all the razzamatazz and histrionics there lies a central love story. That such a thing as true love could exist in a world fuelled by exploitation and sex is an excellent jumping off point for the story of Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) who as a writer, has come to Paris to capture a flavour of the infectious bohemian spirit perpetuated at the lively Moulin Rouge. It's there that Christian encounters Satine (Nicole Kidman) who as the nightclub's most coveted attraction embodies all the traits of the tortured starlet. Satine is beautiful and talented, but her ambition to attain fame beyond the confines of 'the rouge' means selling herself to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness in favour of stardom. Christians naivety and innocence is attractive to Satine and his ability to break through the illusion and lies of her world begin to entice her away from the things she has always strived for. Circling like a predator is 'The Duke' (Richard Roxburgh) who forms the third part of a dangerous love triangle. The Duke is a powerful man with the means to provide Satine with her big break, but only for the price of her affections which gives way to an emotional tug-of-war played out through a series of perfectly bombastic song and dance numbers. At times it becomes a game of name that tune as one infectious melody merges into another. One number that threatens to steal the show is Jim Broadbent's 'Like A Virgin', which is so over the top in delivery that it's hard to deny a constant smile. Indeed, for much of the runtime, the film aims to captivate and arouse that sense of cheeky, nod-nod-wink-wink humour in way that's never overly salacious and falls on the right side of good taste. In summary, a good old fashioned story of love set against a decadent backdrop and told with an agreeably trippy verve with likable performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film will simply dazzle you.,"Forget everything you thought you knew about the Hollywood musical.  Forget anyone who ever said that the musical was dead; that it was a relic of the past, and that reviving it was a recipe for disaster.Baz Luhrmann never listens to people like that anyway, and Moulin Rouge - his latest in a career seemingly based on flying in the face of conventional wisdom - is a stunning masterpiece of visual and musical achievement, and richly deserved all the accolades it received as one of the best films of 2001.Set in 1900, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a struggling writer who falls in with a group of Bohemian actors and tries to sell a show to the owner of the famed Paris nightclub Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).  To get his pitch heard, Christian approaches the most desired courtesan in the club, Satine (Nicole Kidman), and while he finds himself smitten by the girl's obvious charms, is competing for her heart with the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), whom Zidler is wooing as an investor in the Moulin Rouge.Basically, it's a formula plot straight from the grand musicals of the fifties - girl must choose between true love and a wealthy suitor - and one of the many brilliant points of the film is that this very plot is also the subject of Christian's production: the very aptly named Spectacular Spectacular!From the first time Christian sets foot in the Rouge, the film takes the viewer in every direction imaginable, never content with just a straightforward telling of the love story.  Everything is wrapped in dramatics and theatrics, song and dance, costumes and flair - and it's both familiar and original.The songs are inspired in choice and arrangement, as most of them are covers of love song standards (Elton John's ""Your Song"") or very unusual choices (""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" or ""Lady Marmalade""), mixed in with some Beatles classics and Whitney Houston ballads.  But none of these are quite the same once rendered by the impeccable voice talents of Broadbent, Roxburgh, MacGregor and Kidman.  Every anguished confession of love is sung through one of these timeless lyrics (or the occasional original song, such as ""Come What May""), and woven into the story seamlessly, as if they were written directly for the screen.  Nothing seems out of place, no matter how different it might be at first glance.  Even ""Roxanne,"" by the Police, is reinvented as a tango, and is one of the more haunting set pieces as it's interspersed with Christian's budding jealousy towards the Duke.MacGregor and Kidman, not noted for their singing voices in the past, acquit themselves very well here, showing off good ranges and talents combined with their well-earned acting chops.  This is no throwaway story in their hands; you yearn for Satine as much as Christian does, and you weep when she weeps, and you ache when they both ache.The Bohemian tenets of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love are all in effect here, as Luhrmann takes his vision and paints the canvas of the screen in a beautiful array of visuals that most directors would never even imagine, let alone try.  Perfect costuming, a frenetic pace, and a game cast willing to try anything for the show provide two hours of blisteringly good entertainment.By the way, don't be ashamed if this film makes you laugh, makes you dance, makes you sing, and makes you cry.  It's worked quite hard to make you do all of those things.Brilliant film-making.  Don't miss this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Beautiful and Imaginative film,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.Musicals have been undergoing a comeback since the release of two new musicals: Moulin Rouge and Chicago. Both these films were impressive musicals that I love. Musicals have never been my favorite genre but when they are well done, the time passes by very quickly. Both of those films qualify.Moulin Rouge could have something to do with Chicago's success. Yes, Moulin Rouge only gained around 50-60 million and Chicago gained over 100 million. But Moulin Rouge was nominated for a fair share of Oscars. It started the comeback and Chicago only made it more successful.Both films are quite different. Moulin Rouge is much more of a visual feast than Chicago, and what a feast this is. The sets are beautiful and imaginative. The costumes are flashy and stunning. In fact, this film is such a visual feast, that many could call it overkill. Did they over do it? Yes and at times some things seem a bit excessive. But Baz Luhrmann is known for this and he does not care.With the exception of one, the musical numbers all have magic to them. I did not much care for the ""so exciting"" number. Other than that the numbers are all great.The acting is mostly good. Nicole Kidman stunned me with this performance. Her voice was perfect and she did not stumble at all. She definitely deserved the oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor is the perfect match for her. They have great chemistry together and McGregor does a good job singing. Jim Broadbent also does an excellent job and was robbed of a nomination. Really, the only casting complaint I have is John Leguiziamo. He was terrible and irritating.Moulin Rouge is a very good film and definitelyy worth a look. It is a beautiful and magical experience. Unless you are put off by really fancy sets, which I do not think many are then watch this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moulin Rouge:Dick Tracy...both overacted,"DISCLAIMER: I walked out after 25 minutes so this is what I thought of what I saw and why I left.First off all the editing was too quick made me dizzy because I couldn't focus on one shot long enough to take everything in. I wanted to see all of the beautiful details but never got a chance. The sets, make-up and costumes were amazing, but again, I wanted the pace to be a bit slower. The music was wonderful and I especially liked the use of contemporary songs. What I couldn't stand was that I felt everyone was overacting. I know that was somewhat the point, but the overacting was overacted. I thought Kidman did a decent job as Satine but her character was just so ridiculous I couldn't help but wince at every line. And everyone elses lines too. I left right after her introduction to the Duke. So did my three other friends. This reminded me of when I walked out of ""Dick Tracy"". Oh well. I did manage to go to another theater and see Bridget Jones...thank God for multiplexes!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Art, Trash, Love, Tragedy & Post Modernism in one amazing film","Okay, let's get one thing straight out of the gates.  Art is a subjective thing and everyone has their own personal definition of what is good art and bad art.  I'm not going to come out and say that Moulin Rouge IS cinematic art, but I think I can safely say that it's trying to do what good art has always set out to do, and that is engage the audience and make them work a little, think a little and feel a LOT.  I think it's great the the film has generated such a polarized response in viewers.  If nothing else, that means that it's definitely NOT a middle of the road movie.  Let's forget about Baz Luhrmann and his rhapsodizing about ""heightened reality"" and ""establishing a contract with the audience"" or ""decoding the period for modern viewers."" What he's done in this lavish, challenging and often extreme film is what the very best art attempts to do; communicate the basic human experience (In this case, love and the beauty/tragedy thereof) by stripping it down to bare essentials, by exaggerating certain elements, by putting all the artifice available to modern artists in order to explore a basic and primal element of our lives.  In a world where we have come to acknowledge that there's no such thing as an original idea, only original variations, it's nice to see someone produce a wonderful, original variation that is unapologetic, dynamic and engaging.There is nothing naturalistic about this film, but then there is very little naturalistic in what most consider the great works of art our time.  It is fun, it is BIG, it is fast, touching, sentimental, rebellious.  It is the very essence of the Bohemian ideals it espouses if Bohemians were given a multi-million dollar budget and lifetime supply of absinthe for ""inspiration"".This is not a movie for everyone.  Literalists should stay far, FAR away. Lazy viewers should not even leave the house, because it's not that kind of film.  But if you're willing to work a little, to buy into what the movie is selling, and to take the hand extended to you when the rollercoaster arrives, you'll find a movie full of hard work, technical mastery, amazing performances and, best of all, a reason to maybe not be so cynical about people, the world we live in, and above all things, love.Bazmark productions should be very proud of what they've created.  They set out to provoke something in the world of movies and I think they've done that.  This film will be an influence on young film makers, dreamers and lovers for years to come.  I applaud Baz Luhrmann for doing what so many aspire to and few actually do; taking a risk on something that matters. And being willing to let the rest of the world see it.",,Anonymous,Romance
"If possible to describe it in one word, emotional roller-coaster. I loved it!","The only way to start this is to say just what I thought of Moulin Rouge, it was great. I only write comments here when I really feel that a movie is just so bad (ie Lord of the Rings) or when I love a movie so much (ie A Beautiful Mind). And I've been writing quite a few of these lately, and I noticed in my ones for Pay it Forward and A Beautiful Mind, which I did about a month ago I said ""best movie I've seen in a while"" because they were just that good. So is Moulin Rouge.This movie is just plain spectacular, spectacular, visually stunning, incredibly acted, and over all so good. Nicole Kidman is amazing as Satine, giving a mind blowing performance, I didn't think she had it in her, she was great in The Others... but wow. Ewan McGreggor also gave an incredible performance in the role of Christian, and again, for him too, I didn't know he had it in him. The story is very sad, but so good, but it isn't for people who aren't comfortable with love stories. Baz Luhrman's direction was incredible; new, hip, fresh, interesting, and dramatic. The whole film is just something to be taken in, a real work of art.Now, if you haven't seen the movie maybe you shouldn't read this paragraph, ship it over, but maybe not. Because if is revealed in the first part of the movie that, she dies. I didn't think that this took away from the story as was what I heard a lot of, I thought it added to it, Christian says that Satine is dead, but he doesn't say how that happened, and all through the movie it was just, just, you have to see this is you haven't, see what you think of it.Concluding, I loved Moulin Rouge, WOW acting, incredible directing, the sets and everything were just, there's no other word to use to describe it WOW, and a great story. That is above all things about love. If you haven't seen this great movie; do yourself a favor and go do.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Amazing musical, very cutting edge.","Personally, I thought McGregor and Kidman were excellent, as were Roxburgh and Leguizamo.  The musical numbers were done quite well, and I found a good bit of humor in the usage of modern-day songs in the storyline.  I appreciated this movie much more after the second and third viewings.  Ewan McGregor does a more than credible job of carrying his role, and I wasn't aware he had such a piercing tenor.  I was not put off by some of the camera work and visual imagery as some other reviewers - I found the frequently changing camera angles to be much more of a visual enhancement than a distraction, which added to the overall effect of the film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

They have a lot of talent and the songs they sing are wonderful. Whoever put together the songs was very wise about their choices, because in scenes like the dance hall and the Roxanne scene the layered songs sound wonderful together.I think the best part was the green fairy sequence.

Spectacular! Spectacular!,"Absolutely breathtaking.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is director Baz Luhrman's pop music masterpiece about Christian, a struggling writer who goes to Paris, France in 1899 and falls head over heels in love with Satine, a courtesan in the French nightclub known as the Moulin Rouge.  ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!"" Filmed entirely on soundstages in Australia, this haunting love story with a bittersweet ending has become a worldwide sensation.  Vastly superior to the subsequently released  and disappointing Hollywood musical, ""Chicago"" (2002), which undeservedly won ""Best Picture"", ""Moulin Rouge"" appears to have revived Hollywoods interest in musicals.  ""Moulin Rouge"" creates a colorful magical world with remarkable sets, flashy costumes, delightful songs and an amazing cast who uniformly deliver riveting performances.  Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking performance is the ill fated ""Satine"" who struggles with the choice between love or fame and fortune.  Ewan McGregor is touching as the heroic and naive young writer, ""Christian"", who fights for her love.  John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburg are all three incredible in meaty roles which are both unique and truly astounding.
