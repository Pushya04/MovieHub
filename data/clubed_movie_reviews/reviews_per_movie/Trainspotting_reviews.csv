Now I See Why,"I'm an old guy. I'm also a movie fan with an open mind. This is one of those films that is often referred to by critics as being very important. When I read the description of it, my first reactions was to totally avoid it. But it has in it some really great actors and I've been taken with the guy from Elementary. Well, was I surprised. While it was hard to watch as these young men dropped into the depths of addiction, I began to be fascinated by them. They were individuals who had aspirations and lives; they were good and bad. But were continually brought down by their mistakes. Those who say this glorifies drugs have totally missed the point.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a horrible movie! Two thumbs up!,"Trainspotting is the story of a humor, violence, goofiness, abuse, friendship and sadness in heroin-addicted Scotland.It's a really vulgar film, with lots of disgusting scatological humor, pointless violence, and the pain of a life on heroin.But it's very well done, with a snappy, realistic script, lots of genuinely funny moments, some truly moving and sad scenes about this horrible existence, and, in the end, many important things to say.I ended up liking this movie, even with the harshness of some of the scenes. I don't know if I necessarily need to see it again, but it's worth seeing once.8 out of 10.Barky",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose life,"Trainspotting is a magnetic, exhilarating, repulsive film based in a seedy underbelly of Edinburgh. Thieves, drug addicts and a violent type of underclass live in doss houses with babies crawling round innocently unaware of the dangers they face.Renton (Ewan McGregor) is a heroin addict living day to day, stealing and looking for that hit. It is an empty life and he realises he needs to kick the habit but each time he tries to get off heroin something drags him back.Renton experiences the high side of heroin but he knows the low side is too high a price to pay. His friends and associates are making it difficult for him to stay clean.Director Danny Boyle infused the film with a kinetic energy helped by its soundtrack. It is trippy, disjointed, hip even amoral in places. Despite its cool reputation it shows the ugliness of addiction. Especially with the character of Tommy who is a fitness fanatic and clean but turns to drugs when his girlfriend leaves him and he dies a horrible death.Like the movie A Clockwork Orange the film is driven by the narration of its central character which keeps the story together and brings out the dark humour.I only saw the film for the first time twenty years after its cinema release and was impressed how well it has stood up to the test of time.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sublimely excellent,"After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say ""Look at this, its cool."" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best films of the 1990s.,"In the aftermath of _Pulp Fiction_, much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear ""edgy"" within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value cliches. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino's masterpiece._Trainspotting_, however, somehow manages to take the excesses of the mid-90s and rise far, far above the cinematic cliches that it easily could have become. A film that tackles any hot-button social issue can, and usually does, simply become a didactic propaganda piece. Thankfully, _Trainspotting_ is vastly more intelligent in its edginess and its shock.In order to appreciate _Trainspotting_ fully, the viewer must abandon any preconceptions about what defines truly great cinema, because this film defies convention at nearly every turn. And with the rapid pace of its plot, that's quite a bit of ground to cover.Though a great deal of the picture's brilliance is derived from director Danny Boyle's consistent rejection of typical cinematic techniques, the most satisfying and _best_ aspect of _Trainspotting_ is that Boyle creates a film that is neither pro-drug or anti-drug. Instead, he maintains a rare objectivity throughout the film, depicting this fascinating array of complex, beautifully acted characters with an honesty that it seldom captured on film. And, given the life that each character lives, it's nearly incomprehensible that a director would refrain from influencing the viewer's impressions in any way, yet that's exactly what Boyle does.The dialogue-- or at least what portions of the brogue-drenched dialogue American viewers will be able to comprehend-- is alternately hilarious, raw, and brutal. And Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle bring a remarkable compassion and depth to their portrayals of characters that could have easily lapsed into cliche.Despite its sheer brilliance, _Trainspotting_ is not a film that's easy to watch. The viewer is bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort in their horror-- this movie contains two of the most graphic, horrifying scenes I've ever encountered. But, amazingly, none of these elements is used merely for shock value. Though the viewer will be mortified by some of the things that happen onscreen-- the well-documented dive into Scotland's most vile public toilet, for example-- these scenes all make _perfect sense_ within the context of a masterfully told story.In order to notice all of the subtlety that also exists in _Trainspotting_, repeat viewings are necessary, primarily to reduce some of the most powerful shocks ever-so-slightly, though their effects are never lost entirely. Some of the images will likely haunt even the most cynical, jaded viewer for weeks.RATING: 10 out of 10. Never patronizing and completely unpretentious, _Trainspotting_ is one of the most daring, unconventional films ever made. It inspires a level of discomfort rivaled by very few movies, because, even at its most graphic, Boyle never insults the viewer with mere shock tactics. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, with a truly rare objectivity that allows each viewer to interpret its story on his/her own terms.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One Of THE Defining Movies Of The 90s And A Milestone For British Cinema,"I remember what a raw shock of creative energy this film was when it came out, and I still marvel at what an imaginative way the director found to tell this crazy, immoral tale. The superb cinematography; the amazing cast of young actors (who have all gone on to become hugely successful in film and tv since); the iconic soundtrack: it all just fits together perfectly. 'Trainspotting' is as hilarious as it is deeply disturbing, but most importantly (and unlike many other films concerned with addiction) it's one hell of an entertaining flick and doesn't drag for a second.We all know drugs are bad. The problem is, they can also be fun - at least at the beginning, which is one of the reasons people are drawn to them. 'Trainspotting' is the first movie I remember watching that actually conveyed that seductive quality of drugs and managed to honestly portray the reckless, hedonistic lifestyle a part of my generation - the so called ""Generation X"" - fell victim to. It's an amazing achievement, in every regard; not only does it manage to be true to its serious subject matter without resorting to moralizing, it's also masterclass filmmaking and a milestone of British Cinema. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A triumphant masterpiece,"Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is a film in which everything goes the right way. Few films are fortunate to 'be' at the right time and right place and take the world by storm as ""Trainspotting"" did, but the ultimate proof of this film's greatness is that if you watched it alone or with a large group of people, in 2008 or in 1996, it has the same effect- absolute power. This film is nothing more- or less- than one of the most effective and perfect artistic works ever committed to celluloid.The film follows the lives of a group of drug attics in Scotland in the late 1980's but is constructed less as a conventional narrative and more as a series of vignettes connected by characters and set to the film's dazzling soundtrack (the fact that I mention the scenes being 'set' to the soundtrack is proof of its importance in this particular film). Almost every scene is as powerful as the next, with three montages in particular being possibly the definitive examples of how to do a memorable cinematic montage.Pop culture has been kind to ""Trainspotting"", remembering it as a unique and great film, especially in Britain. I certainly do not disagree with this consensus, but I feel the film has been hurt by familiarity, with even television series like ""Family Guy"" parodying the film's well-known scenes (and badly). This doesn't mean that the film's popularity is being hurt, but that it doesn't feel as fresh and original to people now as it did back in 1996. This is hardly the thing the film's reputation suffers most from however, with the significantly large number of people who claim the film supports and promotes drug use. I have to ask, and forgive my rudeness, how stupid can you possibly be? No, drug addicts in this film are not vilified, but they are consistently shown in a brutally realistic and horrifically tragic context, and just because the film doesn't go out of its way to emotionally manipulate you into completely hating its characters doesn't mean that it promotes drug use, it means that it's a knowing film careful enough not to become a sappy, melodramatic Hollywood product.The acting is phenomenal, the music is terrific, the film is a pitch-perfect example of energizing editing and brilliant use of montage, and its script is one of the best ever written, alternately hilarious, horrifying, tragic, and benefiting from a rare level of depth and resonance. A British classic is what Trainspotting is recognized as, and a British classic is what it is.10/10",,Anonymous,Drama
Gritty portrayal of urban poverty,"This film is dark but also has a deep sense of realism. The subject matter of this film invites comparisons to Requiem for a Dream (2000). Relatively speaking, Trainspotting has more nuanced characters who seem to have more control over their lives and have more of an active choice in every situation, whereas Requiem for a Dream has characters driven by false hope and losing control over their lives entirely. The endings are still quite tragic in both cases though, as drug addiction ultimately has no winners. This film shows a wider view of the characters' lives and their hobbies, crimes, interactions and quirks, along with the environment around them. It's depressing as you'd expect, but has more of an ethnographic, ""chummy"" feeling compared to the hard-hitting rollercoaster ride that is Requiem for a Dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Take the best orgasm you've ever had multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near ""Trainspotting.""","In 1996 John Hodge took Irvine Welsh's novel ""Trainspotting"" and with the help of Danny Boyle's direction created one of the most influential, modern cult classics Britain has to offer. Commonly ranked among the greatest films of the 90s; ""Trainspotting"" delivers satisfactory viewing every single time. The essential drug film.The term ""trainspotting"" in this case, is not the non-drug based hobby, but has two meanings for this film. A) The act of ""trainspotting"" is UK slang for trying to find a vein to intravenously inject drugs. And B) A joke not featured in the film, but two of the characters go to a disused train station to buy drugs and say they are going ""trainspotting"".Ewan McGregor stars as Mark Renton, a performance that put him on the map, a man who spends; or wastes, most of his time taking drugs with his friends in one of their apartments. Until he decides to finally pack it in and go cold turkey. We see the highs and lows of the drugs as Renton attempts to build a new life. He battles the strain and the influences of his mates; including Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) a man who stops at nothing to take all, Spud (Ewen Bremner) a fast-paced anxious performance and Francis Begbie (Robert Carylye) a frighteningly intense character who is possibly my favourite of all-time; and Renton's sex life.Vibrant colour is used to exaggerate the actions to intensify the imagery on screen. This also makes it stand out from other films creating a massive impact on the viewer. Unforgettable. The soundtrack consists of the pop culture the characters themselves love and some regularly featured in real life at the time. The film captures the era perfectly.Danny Boyle's stylish direction is what mainly is so appealing about the film. Delivering an expertly structured adrenalin rush. The daring topic of the film was well perceived by critics and audiences to claim universal praise. But, they were still unsure if it was supporting drugs or an anti-drug film. In a way it is both.We are guided through the film with Renton's narration, making it an extremely watchable viewing, one irresistible to want to experience several times. A hilarious triumph. This is movie-making at its most exhilarating.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
My new favorite movie,"Trainspotting is the best movie I've ever seen!  Danny Boyle did a excellent job of directing a movie based on Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel about desperate and hopeless Scottish heroin addicts.  And all the cast did a superb job acting some of the most outrageous and offensive characters I've ever seen.  The only downside of this movie is understanding those thick Scottish accents, but that also adds a bit of humor to the movie.What I liked best about Trainspotting was the characters.  They were the most unbelievable low-life, junky, sleazy, immoral, trash I've ever seen. I loved it! They'll make you both despise and pity them while loving them at the same time.And the plot (which can be credited to Irvine Welsh) was unbelievable. Although some of the shocking elements this movie had distracted me from the story at first, repeated viewings of it made me appreciate it as one of the most profound stories ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mixed feelings,"I've just watched this film again for the first time in a long time and though i found it 'watchable' that's about as far as I can go. I've never found that the film does the book any justice. With its flat and ridiculous characters and romanticising of narcotics, the film to me is just mildly entertaining - if unpleasant at times - crap.The book is another story altogether. I've never read anything quite like it, and was always surprised that Irvine Welsh seemed to like the film so much. The characterisation and impetus of plot and narrative are exceptional in the book, you literally can't put it down. Whilst the book cleverly deals with an underbelly of Scottish life, the film makes me cringe to be Scottish. The book lives and breathes reality, the film seems like a David Bowie video.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Hilarious, imaginative and very anti-drugs","Renton is a heroin addict.  He is one of a group of friends who live their lives day to day and hit to hit.  When he tries to kick the habit he manages it for a while but eventually falls back into his old way.  Meanwhile his friends are as messed up as he is, whether it be Spud's pathetic addiction, Begbie's violent rages or the fact that he is sleeping with a girl who still goes to school.When it came out this film was very hyped, the poster became a must-have on every student's bedroom wall and the media went nuts over it's supposed glamorisation of drug use.  The plot is very difficult to summarise, as it doesn't really have a narrative flow other than the very disjointed experience of Renton.  However it manages to be very funny and imaginative all the way, using many different tricks and touches to be funny.  The dialogue is very well written and I must admit I found it a lot funnier than the last few comedies I watched.The media may have condemned this film as promoting drug use, but I can only imagine that they watched a different film from me.  Sure, the film shows drugs as being fun and enjoyable but, like Renton says, `why else would we do it?'  However the film clearly shows a massive downside where people's lives are destroyed, people OD and lives go day to day just trying to get high.  True, it does show this downside in a stylish and funny way but there is no question that the film is promoting drug use in any sense.Too often I see films that are style over substance; Trainspotting gets it just perfect, stylish but not at the expense of dialogue, character or film. It is helped by a great cast.  McGregor jumped to stardom off the back of this role and he deserved it.  He keeps his character both likeable but repulsive at the same time and carries the film with surprising ease.  The support cast is excellent, even if they lack the same good character of Renton.  Whether it is the comic Bremner, the violent Carlyle or the tragic McKidd.  While not all their characters are well developed, they do all give good accounts of themselves, whether it is comic or showing the effects of heroin on their lives.Overall this is a great film that is refreshing to see now without all the `cult student cool' hype or media feeding frenzy over it's supposed pro-drug approach.  It is stylish, funny, depressing and downright sobering.",,Anonymous,Drama
Danny Boyle you are a genius.,"Renton is trying to to clean, but the world of drugs is a fun and exciting one, plus his circle of friends are specialist drug users.It's a classic, brilliant movie, one of the greatest British movies of all time, just as Lock stock did, it truly manages to capture, the feeling, spirit and very essence of a 90's Britain.That opening sequence is awesome, so much energy, it really sets the tone for the film. At times it's fun and uplifting, and times it's downright bleak and harrowing, the baby scene is truly upsetting.Renton is perhaps the central character, but Sick Boy will forever be my favourite, who will forget that tongue.If you're considering taking drugs, or are close to slipping off the wagon, I'd recommend watching Trainspotting, there are some opinions out there that suggest the film glamorises drug taking, I'd argue the truth is far from it, you really do get to see the bleak side of drug taking.The soundtrack is still awesome, you'll be downloading Born Slippy once the credits have rolled.Awesome movie.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"I don't see what most of the fuss is about, honestly.","Judging by the high rating the other users of this site have bestowed on this film, I guess some people might say I'm off my rocker to rate it a mere 6, but hey...what can I say? Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. And in mine, I can't help but feel this movie is a bit overrated.Let me start by saying I like movies in this sub-genre. As an ex-drug abuser myself, I find solace in watching fictional characters struggle with an affliction that was once part of my own life, and there's a sort of therapy involved there that seems to make one feel as if someone, even a fictional someone, at least understands the pain an addict goes through. I also just plain like raw, dark, and gritty movies. I'm not a ""Mary Poppins"" or ""The Sound of Music"" kind of guy, and any movie that sheds light on the seedy underbelly of society is okay in my book. Sure, the message is often bleak and depressing, but at least it's not contributing to the lie that mainstream movies try to sell, where everything is cute, life is wonderful, the bad guys always get punished, and any conflict is wrapped up with a nice little bow in the end.With that being said, I went into ""Trainspotting"" fully prepared to feast on the dark nature of the film and find myself immersed in a cast of characters that I could relate to. But I was sadly disappointed. Things started off well enough: I loved Ewan McGregor's opening monologue, describing the pointless, cliché choices we as civilized humans tend to make in regards to our lives...as if we're all just drones, doing whatever society tells us we should do. I know that I can personally relate to feeling like this at many points in my life. But sadly, it was all downhill from there.If I had to point out any one, main problem with the movie, it was my lack of attachment to any of the central characters. I felt unable to sympathize, or ever really care what happened to any of them. And in a movie like this, such a thing is critical. The cast was all fine and dandy, so it was nothing to do with that, but I just felt...detached. I think it might have had something to do with the fact that from the moment we are introduced to these characters, they're all already drug addicts. Part of the impact of these sort of films, for me anyway, is being able to witness the fall from grace...to see a good life gutted and destroyed by drug abuse. But as it stands, we never get a glimpse of what life was like -before- these characters were all on drugs, and to me that leaves a bit of a void.And for however ""dark"" one may think the film is, I personally didn't find it all that bleak. ""Requiem for a Dream"" (my personal favorite movie about drug addiction of all time) makes this look somewhat childish in comparison. That's not to say that there aren't dark moments in the film, because there are, and when they do it hit, they leave an impact. But overall, I felt more emphasis was placed on the weirdness of the characters, and some of them were a little too much for me to handle.The film is surprisingly void of any intense drama, which I sort of expected considering the subject matter. I realize this was probably intentional and done to avoid being ""cliche"", but I could have done with a little more intensity and drama.This bland feeling overpowered me through most of the movie, and I found myself checking the running time to see how much time had elapsed, which is usually always a bad sign while watching any movie. I have to say the film did redeem itself in the end, and probably made me add another star to it than I normally would have. I really liked the outcome of the story, which makes it a shame that both the beginning and end caps of the film were filled with what was in between.I realize I'm going against the grain here with this review, but I see no point in hailing this as some sort of modern masterpiece when personally I don't see it myself. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I feel it pays to be honest in these matters, and I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and call this a fantastic movie when I don't really believe it is. Something about it felt empty to me, and it wasn't nearly as impacting as I had hoped it would be. It's no ""Requiem for a Dream"", that's for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Greatest British Movie of All Time,"This film became almost a cultural phenomenon as soon as it was released in Britain in February 1996.Adapted from the first (and best) book by Irvine Welsh, the film shows the lives of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts.The film is a black comedy, at times hilarious, tragic, surreal, brutal and uplifting.  The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh's Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" headfirst.The film doesn't condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.The film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.

A badly appreciated and misunderstood movie that uses wry humor to convey a serious and dramatic message against drug use.,"I confess that I began to see this movie with little expectation about it. I knew it was one of the most acclaimed movies in cinema for many. Even so, I was not enthusiastic about it. And I ended up enjoying the style of the movie.The script follows the marginal trajectory of a group of young people from the Scottish suburbs. Everyone, in one way or another, is linked to heavy drug use and crime. And everyone, one way or another, pays for it. Thought of as a light film, it is more serious than it looks and addresses strong themes in an innovative and intelligent way. Contrary to popular belief, the film is not a comedy at all, nor is it a favorable view of the drug world. Quite the opposite. The movie is much more serious, there are truly tragic moments (such as the dying baby, almost symbolizing all innocents, suffering and indirect victims of the drug, by the hands of those who get involved and addicted to the drug) and a clear anti-drug message. drugs by showing how each young person suffers the consequences: years in prison, death ... Although drug use is clearly shown to be recreational in the movie, and the characters take pleasure in the drugs, the movie also shows how their lives (and those of people who love them) are ruined by addiction.The characters are complex and intense. Each has its own characteristics and psychological profile. The dialogues are excellent and the use of a Scottish accent carried by Scottish actors gives it some authenticity and originality. Ewan McGregor got his springboard here for well-deserved stardom, and he might not have been the renowned actor he is today if he had not participated in this movie. With a controversial and unpleasant character, he is the star of the movie. Along with him, a number of actors who each had their own opportunity and talent to shine: Ewen Bremner, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd, Kelly Macdonald, Jonny Lee Miller ... there's room for each to stand out at the right times, and I believe that their careers have taken full advantage of this.Technically, the movie is flawless. Without ever taking the focus off the storytelling or exaggerating putting style ahead of content, the film features groundbreaking features in photography, film angles and soundtrack, considered by many to be one of the most interesting in contemporary cinema with tracks. by Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, New Order and other rock names.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
absolutely fantastic,"This film is, to use that old cinematic cliché, a rollarcoaster. The film portrays the lives of a group of friends, most of whom are heroin addicts and the story of their seemingly relentless march towards simultaneous self destruction and discovery. Having lived in Scotland all my life the film does what few mainstream box-office smashes dare to, which is to give an accurate and truthful (if not slightly comical) portrayal of life for drug addicts and the lower classes in Scotland. This is made all the more poignant by the fact the story is set in Edinburgh, a city renound for its beauty and wealth, but which has a seedy underbelly of poverty, violence and drug abuse in the city's peripheral housing schemes (ignored by the wealthy inhabitants of the city centre). A strong plot excellent characters and a brilliant soundtrack all contribute to this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose the best British film of the nineties,"Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's 1993 debut novel was so central to young British culture at that time that it was always in danger of being forgotten as a mere curio of a bygone Britpop era. Thankfully, good comedy leads a long life, especially the black stuff. In the meanest, wittiest way, Trainspotting said ""bollocks"" to Britpop - in fact, it said ""bollocks"" to every fad and fashion going - and so it became immortal.Welsh's novel is, like many of his works, essentially a series of short stories bound together by a group of amiable, self-centred protagonists who share a common interest in the procurement of a life-affirming experience - in this case heroin. Unfilmable as such, Boyle and Hodge do an astonishing job of wrapping up a majority of the best Edinburgh tales in a tight 90-minute narrative. The misadventures of Renton (Ewan McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner) et al is alluring because their lust for life eclipses their need for skag - the physical enjoyment is never denied, and yet neither is our heroes' desire to see above and beyond the depravity and the mundanity. The film-makers are not simply allowing us to relate to these emaciated thieves - they are necessarily ensuring it.The casting is spot-on. McGregor puts in a signature performance as the amiable Mark Renton; Bremner brings the sensitive Spud hilariously to life; Robert Carlyle is unforgettable as the monstrous Francis Begbie - a man I fear we have all met and to whose jokes we have all felt obliged to laugh. Johnny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, and feature débutant Kelly Macdonald support superbly.What's the point of it all? you might ask. To say its simply about capturing a moment in British pop culture would be to deny the quality of its storytelling. Trainspotting is more than a zeitgeist because, for all its swagger and the brilliance of its soundtrack, it possesses an intricate, multi-taloned narrative navigated by 3D characters, more than one of whom finds his way to an uplifting and hopeful conclusion.

I decided to watch this movie after I'd seen it advertised in numerous places; namely in the top-films list on this 'site. It did retain a quirky, original kind of vibe all the way through; helmed by somewhat unappreciated director Danny Boyle, who has a unique approach to film-making. The 'anti-drugs' message is relatively clear: I suppose this is the embedded message within the film, asking the audience: ""Would you like to end up like these people?"" I felt the soundtrack and its usage added a redeeming quality to the film but I just don't agree this should be within the top 250.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb,"An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I've met, you've met and we've all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved inare most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of ""Human Traffic"" and the somber tone of ""My name is Joe"" and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of ""Perfect day"" and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise. Superb.",,Anonymous,Drama
With God's help I'll conquer this terrible affliction.,"The last time I remember seeing someone going through withdrawal was Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm: ""You mean just stop? Cold turkey? You don't understand! The pain...""Renton (Ewan McGregor) was a little more expressive: ""I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post. That's for sure. I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment. Too ill to sleep. Too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea. Pain and craving. A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on its way.""The truth about drugs and the awful toll it take is clearly shown here. The most awful moment come after the baby dies and the mother is quick to ""relieve her pain."" The most disgusting moment was the toilet: an apt illustration of just what you will do for drugs. The amorality of sex with a schoolgirl is also apropos.This film is funny at times, but certainly there was no glamor. It was just some sick people with their lives going in circles.John Hodge's screenplay was magnificent. Danny Boyle's (Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later...) direction was super. Along with McGregor, the performances of Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty, Human Trafficking) and Kelly Macdonald (What's her connection to Sinatra?) were impressive.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Top Gear,"I identified with the film when I first saw it because I was in my first year of college and I hung around with a pack of druggies. Not as intense as that crew, people were just starting to discover heroin and shooting up was a bit taboo at first, but overall I recognized a lot of the same vibes and attitudes. I think it's a really honest portrayal of drugs and is perhaps the finest ""drug"" movie out there.I think there's a lot of comedy and laughter in that movie, something missing from Requiem for a Dream which is a deep pit of despair that never really lets you go. There's a joyous feeling coupled with despair that really pervades that film and I think it does the subject justice. Because honestly, that's what it's like a lot of the time. It's funny, you're laughing, you're talking about lofty subjects in a very fumbling, cursory sort of way, and expressing your discontent with everything. So the way the good times were juxtaposed with the bad times is authentic, and reminds me of truly great films such as Boogie Nights (only very tangientially though). The circle you do drugs with tends to go deeper than just normal friendship for some reason.I thought the ensemble cast was good and the style all produced a really cohesive whole that felt very authentic to me in a way that Requiem sometimes didn't... plus, it has a lot of laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Flawless adaptation of a groundbreaking book,"It is doubtful that there is much new that can be said at this stage about this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's triumphant 1993 novel of the same name. The film follows the misadventures of a group of extremely dysfunctional characters who are immersed in an underworld of addiction, crime, and violence. Their darkly funny antics are shortsighted, aimless, and nearly always have a tragic outcome. In this universe, the humane become casualties and only the most unprincipled have any chance of escape. Nearly all of the main protagonists are addicts of one sort or another, with heroin being the drug of choice. However, this film does not glorify drug use. The addict lifestyle and worldview is portrayed as being just as pointless and empty of meaning as the materialistic values and aspirations that are promoted by mainstream society.The richness of the material allows the audience to read ""Trainspotting"" in many ways: as a scathing social commentary, a superb existential black comedy, a bleak human drama, a gritty portrayal of addiction in it's many forms, or as a meditation on the meaning of self and the nature of friendship in a brutal world. However one chooses to understand it, this film relentlessly challenges it's audience. It is by turns compelling, hilarious, and horrific. Danny Boyle's direction is truly outside-the-box in terms of his depiction of amoral characters in an amoral world. The dialogue is razor sharp and the acting is top notch. Special mention should also be given to the cinematography and set-design, and the soundtrack is flawless. This film is a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

I love how the movie is shot and I love the choppy cadence of the monologues. I really want to go to Scotland now after seeing this movie. I think all the acting was amazing and the characters were great. This movie has not one, but two jamming soundtracks. It is a definite in my DVD collection, as well as my CD collection. I haven't read the book, but I really want to. With a movie as well done as this the book must be amazing. It also makes me want to say no to drugs. Heroin looks like an all around bad idea.

A junkie film that bites,"I've seen a lot of films that are either pro or most of the time anti-drugs, this film is neither.The film makers just want to tell a simple story of a junkie, Renton, played very well by Ewan McGregor, who struggled to get out from Glasgow's drug scene and in the process fighting the gravitational pull of his friends and the drug itself. No preaching and that made this film wonderful.The portrayal of drug use and effects of its depravity are disturbing and surreal and fresh owing to Danny Boyle's style of shaky camera movements.Robert Carlyle's performance as Begbie is brilliant, even though most of the times I don't quite understand what he is talking about because the dialogue is extremely ""Welsh"" (from author Irvine Welsh).Worth watching: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Like the main character, I just don't care.","If a middle-aged man were to walk outside his house right now in a chicken suit and started attacking small children, a lot of people would say he lacks maturity. Or, perhaps, that he's a pervert. If he sustained his attack long enough, he'd be on the news, and the police would come, handcuff him, and laugh in the guy's face. Lack of maturity is something that is obviously negative in out society. What I find interesting, though, is: what is labeled as immaturity in real life is labeled as sublime quirkiness on the movie screen. Sometimes. Other times, in case of shows like The Wiggles, immaturity is labeled as stupid. Other times, in case of comedies, immaturity is labeled as hilarious. Other times, in case of books like Naked Lunch, immaturity is labeled as offensive. Other times, in case of movies like Trainspotting, immaturity is just generic, boring, and I've seen this so many times I know exactly what's going to happen in five minutes, oh look! I was right.I'll just get right to my point. Trainspotting is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen in my life. From the opening surrealist toilet scene (which was used in everything from video games to books to artwork to cartoons long before Trainspotting was even an idea in the writer's head) to the childish DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! ending and everything between those two points.The nihilistic characters are trite and safe, copy/pasted from some MTV reality show that contains 2% reality and 98% what looks cool. Their generic nihilistic actions are so safe, most eight-year-old boys would think they're lame, but, for some reason, the middle-aged crowd calls them ""intelligent"". The entire drug-addiction plot line plays out exactly like it did in that DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! video you had to watch in high school health class.My point? It takes a lot more to shock people than a couple kids playing around in a toilet. There is absolutely nothing disturbing here whatsoever. Why? Because this is the pansy crap we see every single anti-drug movie ever made. It's so unabashedly unoriginal, I fail to see how anyone can even call it art, being that the definition of art is ""an original body or work"" . . .The cinematography is generic, and is only even slightly inspired when it rips-off Kubrick. The acting is generic, being that I don't think it's hard for a young twenty-something to act as a young twenty-something. I don't even know why they even bothered giving the characters names, because they completely lack any sort of identity that real people have. The only identity they have is that, they're boring, flat, copy/paste characters who are addicted to heroin . . . and they do heroin . . . yeah. And even if people say this lack of identity originality is the point of the movie—which it's not—then I'll say back, Brent Easton Ellis' novel Less Than Zero did that exact thing ten years before this movie came out and seven years before Welsh's book came out, and it did it infinitely better and more realistically than either one.If you liked Trainspotting, I pity you.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Day in the Life of a Drug Addict,"Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film that has left me perplexed ever since the first time I viewed it as a teenager nearly a decade ago. I remember, as I finished the film, thoroughly hating it. There was something about its subject matter and characters that I immediately found off putting. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing of the picture that I really understood what Boyle was going for.It's supposed to be off putting and the characters are supposed to be unlikable. The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life. It destroys it to the point where heroin because the only that the really matters. For these young drug addicts, the only thing that gets them through the day is the anticipation of the next hit. By using over-the-top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.If I have a problem with the film it's that it really doesn't go far enough. Less quick cutting and hyper stylized editing and more human characters would have made the film deeper and more palatable. But, maybe that wasn't what Boyle was going for. With his use of editing, he shows just how much can be lost when one is stuck in the sad world of drug addiction. That, in and of itself, makes the film something special. The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today. I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A true classic,Trainspotting one of the few films I would sight as masterpieces in their art. I love everything about this film and feel that it has a brilliant energy that's not seen in most films. Director Danny Boyel has truly outdone himself with this brilliant work exploring drug use. I also view it as one of the best adaptations of all time as Boyle uses the source material and then outperforms it using the techniques of filmmaking. Also this being one of his earliest films truly shows how as a director he is a master of his craft and is truly underrated. I do believe that this films is criminally underrated by the general public and critics alike most likely downtown its subject matter but the true genius of the film is in not how it glorifies drugs which it certainly does not but it instead takes the view of the protagonist showing what the characters endure and the realisation of their situation. The cast is phenomenal with performances all round being superb especially from a young Ewan McGregor showing his talent at an early age. Overall I would say that this is one film that I will always love and view as a true great work of cinema. I might also add that if you enjoyed this film you should definitely take a look at the sequel as it is a brilliant return to the characters and i myself view it as one of the best sequels of all time. So please watch this film if you love cinema.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Profoundly irreverent, Crude, Ugly... I loved it!","I spent half the duration of this film with my eyebrow raised and occasionally wincing. This movie is rife with cursing, nudity, drug use, alcohol, disturbing images (that doesn't just mean dead bodies, although there is one in it) crudity, screaming, psychedelic flashes, crime, twisting minds, feces, pornography, knives, treachery, madness, blood, noise, you name it! The result is a movie which not only boasts incredible acting, but a tangible plot line, and a lesson that one can learn because it is immersed in such a vibrant and... eh, different plot.Do not mistake this movie for something like 'Requiem for a dream'. This i s not a movie that intends to spread anti-drug propaganda. Nonetheless, that is exactly what we get out of this movie, after we see how revolted we are with the main characters, only two of whom are worth anything. In the main 5 characters, we have a drug-free, irreverent psycho with a temper to match Timur's. We have an addicted young man who tries to quit, but just can't get free of his dirty lifestyle and eventually betrays all of his friends in a scam. We have a not-quite right in the head junkie with weak bowel control (oddly enough, maybe the one most appealing character in the movie). We have a blonde addict with certain criminal tendencies and a dead baby on his mind. We have a semi-crazed addict who breaks up with his girlfriend because he lost a porno with their video in it and eventually resorts to eating cat feces (charming).These five characters do things that would revolt the most twisted, demented incarcerate. One shoves drug-pills up his *** and then dives into a VERY clean toilet to get them (needless to say, this is sarcasm). One would fight/maim anything up to and including architecture. One...Well, it's useless to describe the main characters and their actions. This is something that has to be seen to believed. But WARNING:...This movie is not for the weak-stomached or perfectionists. Here, you will see what is possibly the worst of humanity in all of it's dirt, crudity, and viciousness. Here, you will hear cursing that would make a sailor stop chewing and cross himself (actually, only 'In Bruges' has more curse words per minute).A triumph. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
F*cking brilliant,"Trainspotting is what film should be: honest, imaginative, surprising, and groundbreaking.LIke Goodfellas, Trainspotting is a meandering movie that manages to grip you the entire time. It is funny and heartbreaking at the same time, anchored by Ewan MacGregor's absolutely devastating performance as Renton. Put his performance up against the Best Actor nominees in any given year and I dare you to say it doesn't belong.Contrary to what others have posted, Trainspotting absolutely made an impact here in the States. That may have been to Danny Boyle's detriment as he's never quite reached the same heights since.But for us, in the U.S., you have to realize that it was basically a foreign film because you can't understand about 25% of the dialogue because the accent is so thick. Begbie's dialogue is purposely opaque, I think. Not that it matters - the performance is rock solid.If you haven't seen the movie, go out and get it. It's in my all-time Top 10, and it holds up beautifully over time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Film Liquet on Trainspotting,"-""Choose life""
The film is about making choices, choosing everything you want. Danny Boyle, the director, shows heroin as an alternative lifestyle, that the characters chose. They chose their life, the needle and they don't regret it. The film does not glorify drugs in any way, most of the viewers will find many scenes disturbing, dirty and not pleasant at all. It won't be easy to watch, but it's not meant to shock, the scenes make perfect sense in context of the story, showing life of day to day heroin addicts.Without any certain plot development and chaotic storytelling, the film still takes you along the rollercoaster ride of Edinburghs aesthetics and terrifying truth of drug addiction with the help of Mark Rentons narration and portrayal of that times youth. The decision to become clean and get rid of the addiction was not an easy one for Renton, but how much your surroundings, so-called friends(basically, the only thing in common between them was heroin) can affect you sometimes and get back on the path you just rejected.The structure of the film makes a circular plot. In the beginning Renton denies choosing life, being a normal person, he chooses not to choose, he chooses heroin. Events of the film change him, make him realise he's growing older, more mature, that his friends are not really friends and can betray you at any moment, and he chooses to choose life.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unimportant Garbage,"Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position.

I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters.

Shocking yet profound,"This movie has a reputation as an unpleasant experience. And I'd have to say for a reason. Yet what often goes unmentioned is the fact that this movie is quite often classified as a black comedy. Again, for a reason.The story tells of a group of Scottish youngsters struggling through life despite their crippling addiction to heroin and other hard substances. We see them throughout the course of a perhaps a few years. Their highs and their frequent lows. Yet despite all this misery in their lives, they retain a surprisingly chipper attitude about life. They crack jokes, they talk in their thick Scottish accents, they have parties. Yet just beneath the surface, the heroin tightens its grip.And it's not like director Danny Boyle wants to glorify or romanticize drug use. No, it's still clear that these people have ruined their lives and those around them through their awful life choices. But the movie argues the point that these people are not stupid. There's a reason why people use drugs. Quite often they are the symptom of a life gone wrong rather than the cause.Very much a movie not for everyone.

brilliant!,"i cannot say enough about the importance of this film. it has everything one could ask for in a good British druggie film. its got dark humor, and actually gives a surprising twist to the argument of using heroin. unlike films like requiem for a dream, a film that has you scared senseless into never so much as looking at a syringe, trainspotting shows some of the decent pros of being a junkie. now this is not to say it promotes it, because we do see on several occasions of heroin wrecks lives in various horrifying ways. what trainspotting does is go deeper into why a person does it, having valid reasons, and seeing what is intriguing about heroin. on another note, the actors could not have been been more better suited for the roles they played. renton (ewan mcgregor) is the wonderfully likable and respectable main character, who we see going through an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film. the supporting cast is excellent as well. there's a variety of junkies, from those trying to clean up, to those who actually seem to want to continue to live this lifestyle, to my personal favorite, sickboy, the sean connery enthusiast. brilliant! i couldn't have asked for more from a film! ten out of ten!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Enter British disturbia...,"Chronicling the lives and trends of a group of addicts, Trainspotting is a raw, deep and honest look at the pros, cons and horrors of abusiveness to addiction.As Renton (Ewan McGregor) and Spud (Ewen Bremner) hurl down the street with the energy of a Duracell bunny it's apparent that there's something very powerful about Trainspotting. As the Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' pounds through your ears it may be difficult to realise at first. Is it this iconic choice of soundtrack? Could it be the pain that you feel along with the actors, who gurn and gasp as they push their way through the streets of Edinburgh? Or could it in fact be the startlingly stirring voice-over provided by Ewan McGregor? Yeah, that would be it, though it is important that you remember something. This is the 1996 Ewan McGregor. Before Star Wars, or Moulin Rouge! and it was well before The Island. This is Ewan McGregor when he had to dive into toilets, and dig bodies. This is Ewan McGregor who didn't have the luxury of multi-million dollar deals or stunt doubles. This is Ewan McGregor who is only a stone's throw from the drug addled character he's playing, and above everything else that shows.One of the many initial criticisms of Trainspotting has been that it seems to be promoting drug use and it doesn't take long to see why. The film starts off startlingly realistically with Renton sneering that he wouldn't do drugs if he didn't enjoy it. With this, we learn at breakneck speed that the world of drug abuse that we've been taught about and steered away from is like any other addiction and that to an extent, we, the average viewer, are no better than these people. So light-hearted is the first quarter of the film, common sense seems to leave and it's not made entirely open why drugs are considered bad in society. But the enjoyable caper that you settle comfortably into doesn't last for long and soon it's apparent that director Danny Boyle is showing the good and the bad; the Heaven and the Hell. Whilst watching Trainspotting you're in junkie limbo.Among the themes of drugs, there are others relating to everyone. A core idea is the Choose Life movement, a phrase repeated throughout the film to perfectly nauseating effect. ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a f**king big television"" Both stark and hideously blunt, the truth about conformity in materialism soon sets in to make it apparent that 'choosing life' may well be exactly the opposite. On top of that, in case anybody is worried that they might not be able to relate to Renton's drug issues, addiction on other levels is explored thoroughly. A commentary on how prescription pill popping is just as damning but seen as much less crude by society is but one.Considering that Trainspotting isn't quite an ensemble cast film, it's surprising to what extent most of the main characters are explored. Before the end, qualities, problems, traits and secrets of just about all the major characters are exposed and examined. There is no character that could be accused of being a strict (or even slight) cliché. Naturally, because Renton is an addict, you wouldn't really trust him if he tried to tell you his life story in the pub and so frequently, he is played off as an unreliable narrator. There are numerous times that he exclaims that he will do something, usually get off the heroin, to no avail at all mostly because he simply hasn't the power to do this. At around the 65 minute mark, you really come into a full opinion of who he is and how much control he does (or doesn't) have over himself, his life and his addiction.One of the main reasons Trainspotting excels at being such a disturbing film is that it doesn't back down at the thought of having to push the envelope and employ some abstract ideas in order to truly get a message across. The most effective uses of these are without doubt when juxtaposition is used to take an innocent idea and put it in a horrifyingly grim environment. Not only does this create a spellbinding effect, but Boyle and his crew also raise the bar by taking advantage of these moments to create real suspense.From a technical standpoint, the camera-work and cinematography are fluid, inventive and original. The music is interestingly diverse and always fitting. The story itself is nothing new but is written and executed in such a wild fashion that everything seems fresh rather than recycled. However, you can only go so far on recycled material and as the stakes are raised, the film starts to lose focus of what has throughout, felt like the most core theme of the film. Not drugs, not addiction, but friends. Despite the advertising and the views of the film-makers and the controversy the key idea of friends always being there for one another is what feels like the blood pumping throughout the body of this film to keep it moving and invigorated. After all, with who else would you be able to ramble about the trivial knowledge you've garnered of James Bond over the years, shoot dogs with air rifles, recreate the legendary Beatles album walking across a road or refer to everything via your own personal favoured pop culture?Trainspotting is a film for anyone who wants to take a trip to the dark side but also see the light that keeps people there. It's a film for anyone who's not afraid to cross the line. It's a film for anyone who chooses life.4/5 (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Funny, gritty, harrowing...and brilliant","Funny, gritty, harrowing...and brilliant.Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, we follow the life of Renton (played by Ewen McGregor). Despite attempts to get clean, he is a heroin addict, as are his friends Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and Spud (Ewen Bremner). We see their lives and how drugs affect them, their friends and their friendship. Meanwhile, another friend, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), is not a drug addict but gets his highs from confrontation and violence...The second movie by Danny Boyle. His first, Shallow Grave, was excellent. This is even better.Hilariously funny at times yet incredibly dark and gritty too. The drug scene and effects of drugs are certainly not glamorised - we why they do it, how difficult it is to break the addition, the short-term consequences...and the long-term ones. Not as confronting or as gritty as Requiem for a Dream or Christiane F in terms of showing the effects of drug abuse but still a fairly harrowing ordeal. Besides, those movies didn't have any humour in them..Good plot, though the ending feels like too much of a soft landing. The conclusion would be the only negative, and it is a minor one, and really open to taste. I would have preferred a tougher ending, that's all.Solid performances all round. This is the movie that launched the career of Ewen McGregor (though Shallow Grave readied it for takeoff).Great soundtrack, with songs from Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Elastica, Pulp, Blur, New Order and Primal Scream, among others.A great exploration of drug abuse and its consequences, humorously told.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Dark, disturbing, funny and life-affirming, this slightly sardonic shot-to-the-vein makes no judgement (on its characters or its audience) and pulls no punches.","'Trainspotting (1996)' is a slightly sardonic slice-of-life story sent as a super-speedy shot to the veins, a hyperactively eclectic look at four vigorously degenerate, disenchanted and desperately destitute individuals who each navigate through what they've come to call their lives and somehow like it. The characters occasionally glimpse their existence through a lens that allows them to see the filth in which they lay and the perceived perfection of the greener grass on which most others make their beds. Though the simple thing would be for the flick to focus upon the negativities of the protagonists' chosen lifestyle and to portray the quote unquote 'outside world' as the drug-free and consequently utopian society so many pictures of the kind seem to do so, it instead chooses to place the audience within the headspace of its characters, no matter how misguided that headspace may be, and allow them to decide whether they agree with the characters' actions, instead of spoon feeding them the easy answers so many may crave. It's in this ambiguity that the film finds both its nuances and its entertainment factor. Though it is, at times, an affectingly tough and even teeth-clenching experience that never shies away from true darkness (and even some disturbingly surrealist horror), it is also an enjoyable and funny flick that finds humour even in the darkest of situations. A general sense of aimlessness does sour the piece ever so slightly, but it doesn't dampen its overall effect. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
It Took Pure Talent,"This movie was positively mind-blowing, a favorite in my circle of friends after it came out. Even the soundtrack hit on so many things we all knew and loved, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Underworld. It pulled us in from the opening scene with a great monologue and the old school thumping of everyone's favorite punk rocker.When it came out we loved it. It was brutal, it was funny, it was tragic, we hadn't seen anything like it.But we were 16 when it came out and living in Chicagoland. We were a long way from the source and had never heard of Irvine Welsh. It wasn't until a few years later, when we finally got a Borders in our area that we would find out how monumental a movie this was.When we did, we found Welsh, we found the book the movie was based on and that somehow made the film all the better.""Loosely interpreted"" would be a very fair thing to call it, but that isn't a shame, that isn't a negative.The source material was as mind-blowing as it was frustrating. Each chapter narrated by a different character and each one written in a Scottish accent.You longed for Sick Boy's chapters, you could tear his apart in the blink of an eye, but Spud, Spud it took a month to translate that accent into anything near comprehensible.There are more characters and, if you take the time to work through the accents, the book is a far greater prize than the film.But when you read the novel, when you review the source material, you are stuck wondering how on earth could they ever turn a novel like Trainspotting into a movie? Yet they did. They not only turned it into a film, they turned it into a great film, a beautiful and funny look into the lives of addicts that is as tragic as it is hysterical.They beat the odds with Trainspotting. Rarely, if ever, do you encounter such a brilliant translation of a novel that seems so monumentally difficult to turn from prose to film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Trainspotting > Requiem for a Dream,"I find that the two dug depicting movies that have marked audiences the most are Requiem for a Dream and Trainspotting. After several viewings of both movies, I came to the conclusion that Requiem touches upon audiences emotions and sentiments while Trainspotting touches upon their reason. Trainspotting offers a realistic depiction of drug use, making audiences enjoy the movie and not cry at then end as Requiem quite often does. An extremely intelligent script and famous ""trippy"" scenes (notably the famous, or even infamous to some, toilet scene) all add up to this movie's uniqueness in its genre. As the protagonist Renton puts it after all there is a concrete reason for their habits which are frowned upon by society. The realistic depiction of drugs like heroin are not enough to make a movie great. It is the subtle social implications raised which bring out the idea behind Trainspotting. Here, I am referring to the first lines of the movie, and when Renton evokes his mother's ""socially accepted"" drug addictions among many others. Also, the flow of the movie is really enjoyable, as the ending leaves its impact on the audience. Nonetheless, it isn't a positive depiction of drugs. The dark colors, the apartment's constantly decaying state, the dead baby, and Renton's friend's death reveal the utter realism of drugs.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"sex, drugs and rock and roll","One of the cult-movies made in the nineties, often compared (a bit wrongly) to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), ""Trainspotting "" is the revelation of a new talented director: Danny Boyle. If his previous movie ""Shallow Grave"" (1994) was not accepted unanimously, ""Trainspotting"" was critically praised and made a beautiful commercial way, notably in Great-Britain.Danny Boyle's opus is served by a galaxy of actors who are all outstanding (Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle at head) and whose characters are well-rounded. Moreover, McGregor's voice-over makes the movie more thrilling. It is to be noted that if Boyle perfectly used this device in ""Trainspotting"" it will not be the case four years later with Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Beach"" (2000).Then, we deal with a dramatic story, it is indisputable but it is told on a comedy tone so as to avoid the movie to fall in absolute horror and the sordid and of course, this is often black humor that prevails.""Trainspotting"" confirms Boyle's master of the directing too. Nevertheless, it includes faults that spoil somewhat the movie. For example, this one, by moments evokes a clip. Besides, in connection with music, there is an excellent original soundtrack even if sometimes we feel that its constant and discreet use surcharges the movie. On another hand, through Mark's trouble with heroin, this is a realistic vision of a British society undermined by unemployment in the eighties. Even if the last movie is full of optimism, it nonetheless remains ambiguous. Indeed, as Mark walks on the bridge and enumerates the things he will know, the picture becomes increasingly blurred. It probably means that Mark's future will not probably be bright...""Trainspotting"" is a vivid, sometimes raw movie (the sequences that involves heroin) but never boring. It deserves to be watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Choose life, choose a big television, choose to watch this movie...","The best British film of the '90s? That's right, Trainspotting is a hilarious, dark, weird and sometimes painful masterpiece. Based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel (Welsh appears as a dealer, by the way), it's one of the most compelling, entertaining and shocking looks at the effect drugs can have on people, and it's to director Danny Boyle's eternal credit that he doesn't depict just one side of the story: we get to see what these people enjoy about getting high, so that we can, if not forgive them, at least understand them.The film takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, home to five youngsters who hang out and cause trouble together. The team's ""moral"" leader, not to mention the movie's narrator, is Mark Renton (Ewan Mcgregor, in a career-defining role), who knows he's slowly ruining his life and tries to kick the habit several times. That he'd rather have sex with an underage girl (Kelly MacDonald) than give his decision any serious thought doesn't speak very well on his part. His mates, in sanity order, are Tommy (Kevin McKidd), who's sane enough to stay away from heroin (he shoots DIY sex tapes instead), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a James Bond-obsessed pervert (ironic, since the actor's grandfather, Bernard Lee, played M in the Connery and Moore era), Spud (Ewen Bremner), so lost in an everlasting high he can't speak properly, and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), whose personal drug consists of beating up people, especially when they're not Scottish.What gives the film a bit more edge compared to most dramas about drug addicts is its unrelented, anarchic energy, evident from the beginning, when Renton and Spud are running away from the police, with Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life"" blaring on the soundtrack and the narration imposing itself with the famous ""Choose life"" monologue, arguably the best sample of junky philosophy in the entire movie. Boyle never stops for one second, but continues to jump between funny and tragic, real and imaginary, cheeky and serious, using Scorsese-worthy camera angles and movements and state-of-the-art dream sequences to grant us a rare view of the addict's mind and soul.The double aspect is present in the performances as well: Miller and Bremner play it for laughs most of the time, therefore lightening the tone whenever Carlyle's madness or other external events threaten to make the picture too bleak. And then there's McGregor, the one caught in the middle between hilarity and darkness (literally, in the case of the terrifying overdose scene), who tells the story with the right combination of earnestness and irony.Trainspotting isn't a lecture: it shows the ""fun"" part of doing drugs (the toilet dive) and the downside of it. It's not Ken Loach, it's Danny Boyle, which means it's one of the coolest, edgiest pictures of the '90s. A masterwork. It's also got the catchiest music of the decade, after Pulp Fiction, that is.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Choose life. Choose a career.,"The U.K. smash hit ""Trainspotting"" was potent and lively entertainment for this viewer, a stylish look at the underground drug scene in Edinburgh, Scotland. It shows both the horror and the humor of this day to day reality for these unfortunate souls. Screenwriter John Hodge (adapting the novel by Irvine Welsh) and director Danny Boyle give us a rich variety of moments throughout: some comical, some serious, some downright uncomfortable, and even some that are wonderfully surreal. The acting is solid all the way down the line, the soundtrack is impeccable (with Iggy Pops' ""Lust for Life"" getting us off to a good start), and the pacing always efficient.Ewan McGregor plays Mark Renton, one of a group of junkies who's deeply immersed in this world, but still has the ability to be perceptive, and ponder their sorry condition. He would like to leave the life behind, but the allure of drugs and loyalty to his mates is usually too strong. His best attempts to go straight are most often thwarted in one way or another.Sometimes ""Trainspotting"" is a little violent, even hilariously disgusting in one key comic sequence, but it successfully walks a line between its various tones. Boyle draws you in right from the start, giving you a real eyeful of characters and their environs. At no point are the filmmakers ever condoning drugs (which was the mistaken assumption in the North American market), and they never glamorize or overly sentimentalize anything that's going on.McGregor is rock solid in the lead. You like Renton and root for him, and the witty, funny dialogue flows from the lips of him and his castmates with ease. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sean Connery expert ""Sick Boy"", Ewen Bremner the affable ""Spud"", Kevin McKidd the earnest Tommy, Kelly Macdonald the underage girl Diane, and Peter Mullan the drug dealing Swanney. Robert Carlyle tends to steal the show whenever he's on screen, playing the hot tempered Begbie.This is remarkable entertainment that may get fairly grim but never loses its sense of hope for our protagonist.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose...what?,"Choose life. What does that exactly mean? Well, to me it means a lot of things but if you want to explore what ""choose life"" doesn't mean to some people, you should experience Danny Boyle's cult classic ""Trainspotting"". In a way, all these characters seem to have chosen a way of life, but apparently see it as something closer to death.Not with those exact words Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) explains the commitment of being an addict, but somehow he manages to expose his philosophy to the viewer while introducing us to his friends; some who support the philosophy, some who don't and some who don't even care. But I don't think that's ""Trainspotting's"" main point: showing how drugs can affect people.For instance, there's one character, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), who doesn't consume at all but has (maybe) a bigger problem: an obsession with violence. He enjoys kicking people around and making them bleed. That's another point, another issue that affects Renton and the rest of his friends; the silly Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the unpredictable Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the lost Tommy (Kevin McKidd).The real star of the film is John Hodge's screenplay, based on Irvine Welsh's novel. It contains a heavy dose of character development that can be spotted clearly among the heroin injections and delusions of his creatures. It reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (with the exception of character development) because, like that film that also focused on drugs, ""Trainspotting"" has no defined plot line: it's like a roller-coaster ride that finishes and starts again without you being able to get off your seat. There are two times where you clearly sense the movie's coming to an end, but suddenly Hodge and Boyle bring something new to the table.Like in ""Fear"", ""Trainspotting"" has a heavy load of narration (by Renton) that helps and confuses the viewer at the same time. It helps to understand the inner feelings of someone so consumed by an addiction like Renton. There are two beautiful scenes that leave no doubt of Boyle's inventive visual style: one follows Renton to a hospital after hi faints with a dose of heroin, another shows him in his own room recovering from his problem (this meaning not having a 'hit'-an injection-for weeks). Both scenes are visually stunning in a way that I would like to detail but don't want you to miss; so I'll just say they almost border surrealism.Some time before these scenes, something occurs that provokes a major change in the film. At that point, if you have gotten used to the fact that the plot is not defined and lies beyond confusion (Renton's narration is confusing because it has some contradictions and sometimes doesn't let the viewer to think by itself), you might appreciate the final moments of the movie, like when Renton goes to London and Boyle creates a ten-second take of the city's most iconic places and it looks like a tourism commercial that doesn't fit with the tone the movie is employing at the timeBut it works; because it's funny and original.Unlike Ewan McGregor's performance, for example. His Renton is the kind of role that gets a Scottish actor out of Scotland and catapults him to Hollywood. It involves being 'too Scottish', fairly good-looking and very charismatic. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, I'm just saying it's not difficult to achieve, and it helped McGregor's career greatly.The rest of the guys basically have to do the same, which is something I adore in a way. I adore how British writers/directors/actors or whatever deal with friendship. It's a more disinterested way; you feel like no matter what happens, they'll always be there at the end of the day. It's just a true feeling, and I'm not telling you to expect it in this film, but if that were the case; it shouldn't matter whether you choose life or any other thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant film - very honest,"What I liked most of all in Trainspotting - above the brilliant directing, acting and storytelling - is the completely objective portrayal of heroin. I never used heroin myself and i'm not going too, but it is very nice to see once in a while a film which does not tell you ""do not do drugs, it's evil"" - but rather portray them from objective point of view - the good, and the bad. And ironically, this fact made me even more afraid of drugs, and deliver the perfect anti-drug message.While the beginning might seem like it is praising heroin (""take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by 1000 and you're still nowhere near heroin...""), it proceed to a different direction, and shows, sometimes in very disgusting ways, how much the character depend on the drug. For example, the scene where Berton dives to the most disgusting toilet ever (while viewing the scene, remember - this is chocolate!) just to get his drug... The number of times a character states ""i'm out of it"", or ""this is my last shot"" is huge, yet they are having great difficulties to stand by their word.Overall - the movie is entertaining, funny, and very recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

We used to just sit in his living room, going ""ohhh. So now what?"". Practically, every time the answer was: ""let's watch it again"". The first time you see this film, you are left with little but a big time fun (which is, by the way, not at all a bad thing). But this film grows enormously with every successive time you watch it. Every character gains substance, and you begin to comprehend the depth of each one of the situations portrayed. This movie achieves to entertain, with a near-perfect pace, gorgeous performances and unbelievably wit lines, and still manages to tell an actually very important story, to reflect the view of the world that most of the people of our age share deep inside: the anger towards the modern empty ideals and the futility in resisting them.

The sporadic nature of the speech, as well as the different pronunciations of words, prove to make the conversations interesting.There isn't much that I don't like about this movie. I can honestly say that I wasn't thrilled at the two dick shots in the movie and a few scenes were pretty disgusting, but I think they were presented for the purpose of showing how disgusting and desperate the main characters lifestyle was.In comparison to other movies about drugs, I believe that Trainspotting has a much better message or at least presents the story in way that shows the consequences of drug use. For instance, I believe the overall message of Pineapple Express is that one should always befriend their drug dealer, especially if they're James Franco. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was hilarious and I also realize that marijuana is not a hard drug like heroin, but I think I make my point.

"Charm, culture and subtlety: but who needs that when you've got heroin?","After more than 100 film reviews, I've decided that 9's or above are for films that knock me out in one way or another and completely immerse me in their world. Typically, it's incredible actors in their characters, or an atmosphere that bleeds out of the screen, epic scenes or wonderful music.Trainspotting defies this rule: it just raises its hand in class, says ""Here"" in a thick Scottish accent, then begins. Trainspotting is superb and subtle, impossibly charming and quirky, with just the necessary amount of serious to remind you that drugs are no joke. Danny Boyle's direction is genius; he knows exactly what to show, for how long, and keeps the film concise.Interestingly, Trainspotting, a film about heroin addiction, doesn't spend an hour and a half shaking its accusative fist at heroin, saying ""Bad! Bad!"" Unlike Requiem for a Dream, which is 100% damning of the drug, Trainspotting is more about the heroin users than the drug itself. And as Renton, the charismatic, slacker protagonist says early, they wouldn't do heroin if it was all bad. Because it's a recreational drug, it makes you feel good, and then you get addicted. To the lifestyle. To the people. Your ""friends"".Trainspotting establishes a very unique identity by fully embracing its Scottish 'pride', not that Renton would agree. There are Beatles references, Sick Boy can't go a scene without talking about Sean Connery, and the club scene is copy-pasted with love from A Clockwork Orange. Hearing Begbie speak, or the now- nostalgia inducing soundtrack with Iggy Pop and Underworld forces a smile on your face. Even though the film's about heroin and has some sick, sick images.Everything about the film is honest. Renton is honest. Mostly. All the characters have issues, and we love them. Even Spud. The acting is just what it needs to be, not serious philosophical looks at the human condition but some 20-somethings who make weak attempts to quit Junk. If anything I wish we saw more of the supporting cast: though the film's pace is incredibly fast, it would've been nice to see a little more of Tommy and Dianne, who get much less time on screen than I remembered from my first viewing. To add credibility to this: True Romance features the most magnetic character Gary Oldman has ever played, a trash pimp. Even though he has no purpose but to ****spoilers* die *end**** his one scene is extended and it's the best scene in the film.An issue with drug films is that no matter how well they are made, the message is always the same, and it's a no-brainer. Drugs are bad. So I tried to find something else watching Trainspotting, and I came up with this: the film is a metaphor, saying ""quit screwing around with excuses and do something with yourself"", using the most powerful addictive substance as the vessel to convey this. If there's something you want to change about yourself, you won't escape it by staying in the same environment. Peer pressure ensures this. Perhaps those ""friends"" aren't really your friends after all.I remember being 13 seeing this for the first time. I enjoyed its plot, though I couldn't understand any of the dialogue or any of the subtle symbols or literary devices. Ironically now, the one I saw it with didn't get the message, and now, years later, he's ""trainspotting"". Trainspotting is an amazing film that holds you dear. 9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Trainspotting,"25 years on, and this Danny Boyle effort has lost little of it's authentic, gritty, potency. Set in mid 1990s Edinburgh it follows the antics of a disparate group of friends whose only goals in life are to survive, maybe get laid, and to take each day as it comes... ""Begbie"" (Robert Carlyle) is their psychopathically charged leader, who thinks nothing of smashing a glass in someone's face; ""Spud"" (Ewan Bremner) and ""Sick Boy"" (Jonny Lee Miller) just lurch from one day to the next looking for a fix; ""Tommy"" (Kevin McKidd) at least tries to live with some semblance of normality - he has a steady girlfriend ""Diana"" (Kelly Macdonald) and finally Ewan McGregor (""Renton""), whom along with his worldly, and in their way loving, parents, might just see a way of escaping from this relentless misery... What helps this stand out is the fact that director Boyle misses few opportunities to depict the grim depravity in which these people live. Its graphic, violent, distressing certainly, but it is also funny and eminently human - there is a definite sense of ""there but for the grace of God"" about many of the scenarios and they tugs at the heart strings whilst simultaneously making you cower and wince in disgust or sometimes even fear. The efforts from the talent in indistinguishably good - especially Bremner and JLM whose roles are not so significant as Messrs Carlyle & McGregor's, but who add a depth and richness to what could otherwise just prove to be a rather downbeat tale of hopelessness and emptiness. For once, the gratuitous (for, that it is) use of good old Anglo-Saxon expletives doesn't not appear merely to compensate for a lack of script-writing skills; here the language and violence add significantly to the plausibility of the whole thing - it's ghastly, yet compelling to watch and watch again. It works well again on a big screen, even though the cinematography doesn't really require anything to present scale or grandness, and the soundtrack adds a deliciously contemporaneous dollop of nostalgia, too. Not for the fainthearted, but - in my view - the finest work from all concerned that stands the test of time very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
An underrated masterpiece!,"""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career... But why would I want to do a thing like that?"" Even if you haven't seen Trainspotting, you'll be aware of the opening lines of Danny Boyle's 1996 masterpiece, and those opening lines are a pure reflection of whats going to happen and why you should avoid doing whats been done in the whole movie, if you want the option to ""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career...."". I saw this movie recently and in my opinion it's a masterpiece, a lot of people don't give the deserved credit to this movie simply because they've missed the point of the movie, this is not a drug appealing movie, this is a anti-drug movie. Trainspotting is brave enough to bring a humour and levity to the subject of drug abuse, without ever ignoring the accompanying and unavoidable squalor and devastation, and that's why this movie deserves so much credit, after 20 years this is still useful to reflect about life choices and drugs.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated Trip,"A couple of weeks ago, the British Film Institute (B.F.I.) ranked ""Trainspotting"" in number ten (10) in a list of the one hundred best British movies. I found this rating exaggerated and decided to see this movie again for my personal reevaluation. The politically incorrect story of the Scottish heroine addicted Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his supposed friends Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the athletic Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and the violent Begbie (Robert Carlyle) has a very original screenplay. In spite of having many disgusting and sick scenes, many moments of apology to heroine and a very amoral conclusion, the plot is not bad. But I would never list this flick among the IMDb Top 250 or rank it as the tenth best British movie ever. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Trainspotting  Sem Limites"" (""Trainspotting  Without Limits"")",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Revolting,"This rambling film looks at Scottish teens doing drugs. There isn't much of a plot. The teens sit around shooting heroin and talking about mostly uninteresting things in thick accents laden with Scottish slang. There are some repulsive scenes, such McGregor sticking his hands into the filthiest toilet in Scotland right having done his business and before flushing it. We are also treated to blood-splattering violence and scenes of needles penetrating the skin. While Boyle displays an interesting visual style, it is not clear what the point of this film is. It's either glorifying drugs or saying that drugs are bad. Either way, it does not qualify as entertainment.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
"An all-time favorite dark comedies, a true glimpse into everyday British life.","Most think this is an exaggeration but it in fact shows us how most British live. Not the relatively few royalty or high-level business men and women. But the ordinary people, mostly guys, who live off stealing and government benefits to waste away their lives with drugs and frivolity. It deals with some rough subjects - hard drug use, HIV, premature death, theft, bloodshed. But the core story is about one of these miscreants who tries to go straight and ""choose life"", but his 4 dastardly friends end up making that very, very difficult.It starts in Edinburgh, moves to London, then back to Edinburgh. The situations and dialog generally are very well written and performed. You have to have a sick sense of humor, like I do, to appreciate this scene, but the one where he ends up in the ""worst toilet in Scotland"", then realizes he has to retrieve his suppositories, is just great!This was the first movie for Kelly Macdonald who had just turned 19.

"Edgy and brazen ""Trainspotting"" still holds up to current indie standards","(This review was updated in 2016)Independent cinema in the UK – and the world, frankly – has never been the same since ""Trainspotting."" The counterculture spirit of Irvine Welsh's novel was the perfect source for a film that would effectively raise a middle finger to mainstream tastes and challenge storytelling norms. Director Danny Boyle makes on a shoestring budget the type of film that studios actively try and produce in today's day and age.The film follows a group of mates living in Edinburgh, Scotland, most of who are heroin junkies, and Boyle gives their story a seedy, grimy, punk aesthetic that will make proper filmgoers' skin crawl. John Hodge's script aggressively confronts anyone of ""civil tastes"" with a voice-over monologue from main character Renton (Ewan McGregor) talking about societal pressure to choose certain norms. Renton chooses heroin, and if you're not willing to hear him out, then you can go **** off.""Trainspotting"" walks a fine line between glorifying addiction and being direct about the horrors of getting hooked on the ""shite."" On one hand, Renton and buddies Tommy (Kevin McKidd), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) appear to have this spontaneous, invincible 20-something lifestyle, and on the other hand they're all sick and it's clear their lives are dictated by smack, either because they're slaves to it or because they're on the roller coaster of trying to get off it. Hodge's script presents the highs and the lows in equal measure and Boyle uses a combination of music and imagery to amplify them both.Boyle was among those filmmakers in the '90s who absolutely set the tone for movie soundtracks (along with Quentin Tarantino, for example). These directors understood the way audiences respond and relate to pop culture, that our identities and feelings grow around them and inform how we go through the world. Such is the case for these characters who love Iggy Pop, for example, or – like Sick Boy – get philosophical about Sean Connery roles because he was the only image of Scottish masculinity at the time. Music in particular is tied to emotion, and Boyle uses it to create a range of moods for the film.He also achieves so much with practical effects and set design. Renton's withdrawal hallucinations have a perfectly creepy tone using simple set design elements and camera angles, and he utilizes a number of subtle shots and effects to capture the more blissful drug highs. The ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" sequence captures the horrible realities and the strange surrealism of drug addiction in one rather unforgettable clip.Although the style of ""Trainspotting"" definitely stands out more than the story, a second or closer viewing reveals that the film definitely isn't choosing style instead of substance. Renton's role as narrator really helps facilitate that, offering a means of both the character and the audience to process and reflect on the often wild and obscene events that unfold. The film's ending, for example, doesn't work without some insight into Renton's thought process and the underlying ethos.To this day, Renton remains one of McGregor's best characters. His roles have gotten stiffer and more dramatic over the years (with a few exceptions) since he broke out with ""Star Wars"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" and Renton is a nice reminder of his versatility and ability to play more of an everyman, in this case one who ping-pongs from likable to despicable to pitiable and everything in between through the short course of the film.""Trainspotting"" contains so many contemporary indie filmmaking trademarks that it could be remade shot for shot today and it wouldn't feel the least bit dated; you'd only know that it took place in the '90s – you wouldn't guess that it was first made then too. What was once avant-garde in ""Trainspotting"" is now commonplace, yet 20 years later it still has an exciting edginess to it that will likely still connect with future generations of viewers.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Unique movie,This movie is just different than what we usually see in movie theatres. In this movie we look at life with drug addict Mark Renton eyes and how he sees everything. This movie is also about friendship and I like the fact that everyone from that group has different characteristics. Movie also shows how even a single choice can change their lives and this movie is not fictional it shows how much dark can reality be to someone and tho they are drug addicts you still try to sympathise with them. Movie from a start to finish is just addicting after one time you want to watch it again and again and the movie was executed beautifully. Its sad that this movie didn't get the attention that it needed but it's not too late to change that. I recommend this movie to you 100% !!!!!!!,9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Locks you into its world  a staggering achievement,"For Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his mates in Edinburgh's working class there are only two ways to get through life  to be high or to try to get high. But what happens when one junkie in the gang decides to quit?Danny Boyle's raw, energetic, sprawling surge into the drug-world zooms in on a running triumvirate of heroin-junkies escaping from the cops in the first scene of the film, Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life"" playing vibrantly in the background. Cut to Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) and his mates shooting up on the carpet of their seedy flat, discussing the merits of James Bond like it is the most natural thing in the world. ""Trainspotting"" revolves almost circularly (it lacks a bit of focus, it needs to be said) around this group of Scottish junkies. They are living from hit to hit, robbing tourists, shooting up, beating, trashing  and although they are our heroes, we feel so, so sorry for them and their nightmarish existence.Pity is exactly the reason why this is an anti-drug film. It was mistakenly condemned by conservative viewers for promoting drug use but here it is clear that it does everything but. If anyone has the slightest desire to use any kind of drug afterward they should see a shrink. The film is incredibly brutal and brave in its exploration of the darker sides of drug addiction; it takes an unflinching look at the after-effects on addicts, the loss of the 'drug camaraderie' and the desperate circumstances that surround a junkie like Renton. In doing this, the film clearly transcends the viewer's comfort zone. There are disturbing images of a baby crawling in the seedy junkie flat among needles and f uck-ups, shots of McGregor literally swimming in a vast murky pool of faeces, McGregor getting high and having sex with a 14-year-old girl and gritty shots of violence. It is not for the faint of heart.But its greatest accomplishment is not its graphic portrayal  although this part is certainly captivating  but the raw adrenaline-pumping energy that Boyle applies to several scenes in the film. Even when Renton is strapped down on the bed to quit heroin, descending further into nightmarish illusion and becoming increasingly apathetic about his condition, the film never tips over into despair; it never loses itself in darkness. The twinge of energy and the dark humour are always there; Trainspotting keeps the sparkle in the eye.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A magnificent piece of cinema,"Trainspotting was very well received in Australia. And with good reason.The film was very original and insightful, with good comical overtones and magnificent performances. But what won me over in this film more than any other was the fact that it was made by europeans.European film-makers generally make slow paced films that work on the characters - their eccentricities, their behaviour, their emotional contrasts and develop their ""being"". The insightful and often candid portrayal of the characters allows the story to delve into the deepest pockets of human emotion, making it moving and intriguing, irrespective of whether you identify with the characters.I always can pick a grand film such as this by the fact that the plot can be explained in one line, but the film is what it is because of the work put into developing and opening up the characters to the camera.For instance, Trainspotting is basically about a long term battling heroin addict who finally breaks free of his addiction and friends and starts over. Similarly, another European film like Paris, Texas is simply about a guy who wonders out of the desert one day and reconciles with the life he left behind.The plot and story isn't the focus of these sorts of films. The characters are and it provides a richness and intrigue that is often lacking in over-acted and overdone films such as American Beauty (which had a convoluted and absurd story line).Anyway - back to trainspotting. This film is really a metaphor for moving on with life and abandoning a lifestyle and relationships/friendships that seem to hold us back or otherwise keep us moving in a circle. In many respects, heroin plays a less important role than most people think. It's simply a representation of a vice (or vices) that young generations now have to overcome before moving onto the next stage of their life. However, it could be substituted for just about any hurdle we eventually have to face (usually in our 20s).The title of the film, Trainspotting, is an activity that some old lonely men engage in. They go to train stations and simply note down which trains are arriving/departing and at what times. This is a repetitve and ultimately pointless exercise that keeps them occupied as time passes on. Very fitting title, wouldn't you agree?",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Read the book. If you like this movie, do yourself that favor.","I usually hate it when people tell me, ""The book was better than the movie."" Of course it was! Two hour of film cannot possibly hold the content of hundreds of pages of text. I know, you know, we all know. However, if there is one movie that I cannot stress the old trite adage on enough it is ""Trainspotting."" My friends, my brother, my cousins, people I didn't even know kept telling me over and over that I NEEDED to see ""Trainspotting."" My life was incomplete without watching the movie. Even after I told them that I've already read the book, they still told me to forget the book and that the movie was probably better. So, I buckled. I saw it...and quite frankly I'm glad that I read it first because the movie was kinda weak. The movie bare-boned the plot, left out some of the best scenes in the book (Rents did more than just dive into a toilet in a bathroom), left a couple of pretty interesting characters out completely, and SICK BOY SHOT THE DOG!! The directing and the acting were both very good, but the script seemed to be fueled solely on heroin. The whole movie revolved around heroin, and the book didn't. Heroin was very important to the story, obviously, but that wasn't it. The book actually dealt with the ideas presented by Rents in the all-too-famous opening lines. I felt the movie worked under the assumption that drug-culture IS anti-culture. It's not. The movie irked me in the way that hippies irk me, you're not sticking it to the man by doing drugs. Anyway, the movie's decent, but hear my words...IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES, TAKE THE TIME TO READ IRVINE WELSH'S NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead...,"This is from ""Barfly"" which is to alcohol what ""Trainspotting"" is to heroin. This would make a helluva tag-line for the British cult-classic, but I'm not sure the feeling would last. Sepaking for myself, the worst toilet of Scotland is such a nightmarish vision it cured me from any temptation. Yes, I would keep my horrible life if it could spare me the use of laxative suppositories (I'm the type to cover the bowl with toilet paper before sitting).Being less than a decade younger than most of the cast, I can say the word 'drug' belonged to my dictionary since childhood, I didn't know exactly what drugs were but that was the point, I wasn't even supposed to try to know. Even my favorite kids' magazine dared to employ the S-word to describe drugs. It came to the point that I avoided cigarettes like the plague because I thought the first one magically started the addiction. Well, it wasn't far from truth either but I wouldn't have tried to check if this also stood for drugs, well, not heroin anyway. That's just to say heroin (or cocaine) is the ultimate interrogation mark and I owe most the answers to movies. I guess ""Trainspotting"" stands in the Top 3 behind ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Panic in Needle Park"".Things I learned about heroin from movies: there are two feelings when you're into them, one that transcends your highest perceptions of orgasm, and when the effect is over, the need for more drugs. Dependence and pleasure, that's the cycle of addiction. And having stopped smoking two years ago, I know how it feels to be dependent, you only wait for the next cigarette and everything is structured around drugs, in fact around addiction. And this is what Danny Boyle's directorial debut is about, the structuring effect of drugs in one's life and the alienating effect from the others' lives. The film sets the tone with its opening sequence featuring the three protagonists running in Edinburgh streets, why and where they run to isn't significant, it's all in Ewan McGregor's speech.The opening monologue could have been delivered by Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"", an ode to anarchic freedom devoid of greedy impulses, the independence from the diktat of fashion, consumption or the whole baloney about having a regular life, family, kids etc. The merit of this scene is double: it has the honesty to say that once you're in drugs, you don't really care for the norm, in fact, you can't care. The second is to grab the viewer from the collar and take him into this journey with a promising and catchy soundtrack that made the film one of the most emblematic of the 90's (hell, they even included Dance Music), the whole things feels exhilarating, cool and young. And you know what this immersion reminded me of? Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"".This is the kind of film that plunges you into an underworld with its codes, habits, or lack of, and the way their members look at the rest of the world, girls, family, law, and by the magic of the screen, make their lifestyle look almost (I say almost) appealing. Of course, organized crime has a slight edge what's with all the money, cars, suits, but in ""Trainspotting"", there's this dilettante quality, this detachment combined with a camaraderie between those 'who know'. We wouldn't want to try, but if there ever was another way to get an idea of what their lives feel like, we would. That's the mark of great films: to make you part of an experience, following protagonists from start to finish and see what lessons they or you learned.And ""Trainspotting"" benefited from a an A-list of unforgettable characters, who complete each other perfectly. Mark (Ewan McGregor) is the guy under the influence, oscillating between heroin and Diane, his heroin so to speak (Kelly McDonald's debut), he talks so many times about quitting that we stopped taking his motivation as a serious factor. Spud (Ewen Bremner) is the goofiest of the bunch but also the nicest, he also tries to settle down and find a job but I'm not sure I'd try an interview under the effect of speed. Tommy (Kevin McKidd) is the clean guy with a weird habit to shoot himself while banging his girlfriend and by shooting I mean with a cam, only once he'll try with a needle, and it will be one time too many (Karma is the bitchiest of all). And there's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) who talks about Sean Connery and overrated awards movies like a legitimate IMDb user.And in the obligatory anger management department, Begbie (Robert Carlisle) pulls a Tommy De Vito in every single scene he is. Whenever you watch his pretty head, you know there's trouble coming. This is ""Trainspotting"" in a nutshell, it doesn't make drug look cool, like ""Goodfellas"", there's a moment where everything falls but it asks more questions than it provides answers. Speaking for myself (well it's a personal review what did you expect?), I spend so much time on IMDb, I love chatting about movies, sharing stuff with fellow movie geeks and reviewing that I wonder if it's not an addiction.Indeed, I review whatever I see, and right now, I should be watching a film, but I've got to finish this review before, and tomorrow, I'll start the film after the review of ""Trainspotting"" etc., IMDb won't have the same effect as heroin, but after these years, I can say IMDb won and structured my life. This is why you can't expect a 'total victory' in ""Trainspotting"", only a series of new beginnings, new cycles and maybe this is the secret of its enduring appeal, when you finish it, you wouldn't mind watching it again, in case you missed something.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Writing as a non-European reviewer,"I am writing in reply to ""MaderR's"" comment which stated that the movie was not as popular outside the UK as it was in the UK itself. I've watched a lot of movies from Western countries, Britain and USA included and i have always applauded the Americans for trying their best to suppress their diverse accents to make it more cognizable among oversea viewers. The producers of Trainspotting missed this point by miles.Coming from a background where English is mainly used as a second language, i found it utterly daunting to keep in track with the accents employed by the characters in the movie. I am not advocating for complete diluting of their roles but instead a softening around the edges to make the movie less of a task to follow through. Other than this, Trainspotting was a decent movie with a more than decent set of characters that interacted perfectly and drew us closer to them.On the issue of promoting drug use, i totally disagree with critics of the movie who base their arguments on these grounds. The miserable conditions in which the ""junkies"" are living are all too apparent and any mature adult knows how harmful drug use can be to both our social and physical lives. The death of the baby furthers this point.On a scale of 1 to 10 i gave the movie a 7 which would have been an 8 had i been able to grasp every word uttered by the characters.

"Morally disgusting (yeah, right, whatever!)","I know what you're thinking  disgusting, heroin chic movie; I also know you're wrong. Trainspotting can be disgusting (dead zombie babies, the worst toilet in Scotland, Begbie going psycho on some innocents, but that's it)) but if you're sensitive why are you watching a film about a bunch of junkies?  If you're American the shots that show the needle being inserted are cut out (or so IMDB claims)!!! Heroin chic? Now that is wrong! Everything that these bunch of junkie loser scum touch turns to dust. There is almost nothing cool about Renton, Spud or Sick Boy. Some of the characters dialogue (Take your best orgasm multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near [the highs of heroin]' for example) could be construed as to be glorifying heroin but they aren't; they're explaining why they take heroin. Anyway just watching them or seeing what heroin turns previously nice-guy Tommy into is enough to turn you off heroin. Forever. For a film to be able to do that it has to be powerful and that is exactly what Trainspotting is. The acting is of such a high calibre that someone deserved an Oscar. No, Trainspotting deserves ALL the Oscars, the soundtrack, the screenplay, the supporting actors, the supporting actresses, everything is perfect. What deserves especial praise is the fact that it is funny. Black humour is rampant throughout the film; the philosophical dog/park/airgun scene is typically Trainspotting  disgusting and hilarious. Trainspotting will never get mentioned in the same breath as Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Sound Of Music, even though it should, because of its subject matter and that makes me sad.

"An Intense, Surreal Look at Drug Abuse,","Trainspotting is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's a very in depth look at the drastic effects that heroin abuse will do to the people using them. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, very straight up and blunt in its portrayal of drug usage, one scene in particular is difficult to watch.It did feel like it was a little unsure of itself in terms of humour. There is certainly a fair bit of comic relief here, but it felt like the director was a little unsure of its delivery as a result of the heavy subject matter. In my opinion, the humour should have been more in your face and consistent, which would make sense as the seriousness of these conditions means nothing to these characters as they are in it.The cast is all around terrific, Ewan McGregor, in particular, shines as Renton, he really embodies the soul of a character spiraling in to addiction. He is also joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes the versatile Robert Carlyle and the powerful Jonny Lee Miller. The chemistry between each cast member is stellar, with each relationship well established.It is a film with a deeply profound message that is delivered subtly, not trying too hard to move its audience. Intense and very well acted, Trainspotting is a film that I would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a good drama.A young adult is influenced by his friends to take up heroin, an addiction he quickly struggles to get out of.Best Performance: Ewan McGregor",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great film for anyone,"In what can be described as one of the best movies to come out of Britain, Danny Boyle directed a film which will stand on its own for quite a long time. With a strong cast to back up the tongue in cheek dialogue, this film takes on another view of friendship unlike his previous work, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor was excellent as the troubled and weak Renton, giving us both a tragic hero, yet one with vices that tend to control him. Overall, I felt the story was very strong, and the other actors (Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd and Kelly MacDonald) brought in a rather quirky and dysfunctional backdrop to Renton's troubles. One of the best anti-drug movies of all time, hopefully this is one which will be remembered for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Boyle's best,"Irvine Welsh's cult novel 'Trainspotting' is the grim, irreverent and defiant story of Edinburgh's drug-addled counter-culture, told in a fierce Edinburgh patois.  The achievement of Danny Boyle's film is its reinterpretation of what is a decidedly literary accomplishment in a cinematic form while nonetheless staying true to the spirit of the book. Ewan McGregor is excellent is a lead role that grants no glamour to its star, while Robert Carlyle is hilarious as his psychopathic 'friend'. Indeed, the easy way in which the film combines humour and the lowest depths of the junkie life is very impressive, although (perhaps inevitably) the overall tone is slightly less grim (and somewhat more crowd-pleasing) than that of the original.  Incidentally, while the true nature of its enigmatic title, 'Trainspotting', lurks in an excised chapter of the novel, those of a mountain-spotting persuasion will recognise an appearance by Leum Uillam in a minor role.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose Welsh,"Trainspotting remains in style faithful to the book by Irvine Welsh, but sometimes deviates from it. For example the end is very different because here Renton comes out clean and 'normal' but in the book he stays on to be a junkie. The movie has the same punk-like edgy form as the book and is well translated to screen: Fast edited sequences, it radiates energy, breaks its own form (fantasy elements), cultural landscapes changing and even a balanced view on drugs. The many excrement scenes are not for everybody's taste, but shows only the filth sometimes associated with drug use.The characters are rather unbelievable as junkies. Here they remain clean-shaven, relatively fresh-looking, social and to an extent trustworthy people, where real users have the opposite characteristics. And the sometimes beautiful, long sentences coming out of the mouths of some characters being linguistically deprived are not very believable either. But the ""Choose Life""-voice over narration in the beginning is still great.It has intelligent storytelling, for example how AIDS is first introduced by means of the quiz and the fact that Renton in one scene already puts his passport in a locker. The change in music and drug culture is well done here.But from the London-part onwards the best parts are gone and it transforms more into a buddy-movie with a twist.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Music, casting, acting and scenes are well fit together, creating a wonderful composition.I like the occasional surreal of the story. And, as much as I love the story as a whole, the movie itself fails to convey the high amount of emotions involved in many of some particular scenes. Omitted, or just doesn't matter at all. The story is told by a sociopath junkie, maybe that's the reason for negligence of some conveying?So far, this has been the best movie of Boyle that I have ever watched.

He is screaming in every frame, 'Drugs Are No Good'! His message is noble. But the writing and the direction, are so abstract, dark and brutal, that one fails to grasp the goings-on, at least I failed to understand it. Danny Boyle has been better, and I am sure about that!Performance-Wise: Ewan McGregor does well, while Robert Carlyle hams to the hilt. Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller & Kevin McKidd are compelling.

"Choose Life, Choose Trainspotting","Whenever we meet someone new, or want to have a conversation with someone we don't know that much, we constantly rely on hobbies. People ask questions like ""What do you do on your free time?"" or ""What is your favorite song?"". But the toughest question to ask somebody is what their favorite movie is. A non-regular movie-goer might not have a bad time answering. A girl might go for The Notebook or Titanic, while a male might chose Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or any action flick. I personally have trouble deciding among Clockwork Orange or Pulp Fiction, but my favorite movie of all time must be Trainspotting. Trainspotting is a Scottish movie, based on a book by the same name and starting Ewan McGregor as Renton. Although he is the movie's main focus, we meet other characters who enrich the cinematic experience. Sickboy, Spud, Swanney, Tommy, Diane, and Begby. Most of these guys with a little problem, they're heroin addicts. Some try to quit and others join in the process. The movie clearly portrays all the risks and disadvantages of being involved in this world and the negative things it eventually leads to, but, at the same time, the characters never deny the satisfaction that this vice gives to them. ""Take the best orgasm you've ever had... multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it"", Renton narrates at some point in the movie. The real reason why this is my favorite movie is simply because your average friend can watch it and know for certain that he has seen an excellent movie. He will not be confused by Pulp Fiction, or distressed by A Clockwork Orange. Certainly it is a movie you should see if you still haven't. It gets you glued to your sit until the fabulous ending. The soundtrack is also a highlight, featuring songs from artists such as Blur, Brian Eno, Pulp, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and of course Underworld, with its memorable song, Born Slippy, all placed in perfect timing with the movie's screening. So next time you go to your video rental, ""Choose Life"", choose Trainspotting.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An instant classic = irresistible + unforgettable,"Trainspotting, the best British movie ever made, I really mean it. A movie, adapted from a very outstanding Irvine Welsh's masterpiece. I still remembers the first time i saw this movie back in 1996. I was very amazed by how this movie left a very strong impression in my memory, and i just bought the DVD about a week ago and honestly it still has the same fun and thrill.Even though, it's been like a 9 years, the movie still deserves my attention. The way it brings out the characters' personality with a perfect pace and flow make this movie really fun to watch.Renton, with his drug addiction. Spud, with his stupid behaviour. Begbie, unforgettable with his rageous emotion. Sick Boy, really fits his name. tommy, the tragic one.these characters really live in this movie. they look very real and unforgettable. thanks to irvine welsh who made these characters born in the first place.but the most amazing part of the movie is the creative idea in the cinematic way. there are lots of unforgettable scenes and what makes it more perfect is soundtrack that provides the mood which i think was the best motion picture soundtrack ever. it really illustrates the mood of this movie.trust me one thing, when you watch this movie just don't ever get up from your seat. don't you miss even a single bit of it, cause the fun starts from the very first beginning of the movie.and let's just hope for the sequel",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A frenzy rollercoaster ride into the lives of junkies,"A masterclass in character study, Trainspotting depicts the lives of heroin addicts as they struggle to distract themselves until they can get their next 'hit' with sex, mayhem, and other substances. All the characters come alive with superbly crafted dialogues and performances from the entire cast, and coupled with a frantically-paced style of direction from Danny Boyle that combines apt pop music inserts with innovative dream sequences, the viewer is presented with a piercing look inside the mind of a junkie.There were some sentiments surrounding the movie about how it glamorises drug use, but if one were to look just a little deeper it's easy to see that's not the case at all. The film pulls no punches when it comes to depicting tragic events and sickening actions from various characters due to their drug use. For that I believe this is actually the perfect anti-drug film: beneath all the humour and catchy songs, what the viewer gets is an honest and convincing depiction of what drugs do to someone, nothing more and nothing less.Overall, an unforgettable dark comedy that expertly balances the 'dark' and the 'comedy' that will have you reeling from laughter to disgust from one scene to the next.

"""Who need reasons when you've got heroin?""","As you can see, I love the narration in Danny Boyle's """"Trainspotting"". This is a film which understands the nature of drug addiction. The introductory voice-over by the needle-hopper Renton (Ewan McGregor) is surprisingly argumentative and intellectual. You get to understand and even relate to the victims of the needle. Not that I encourage drug consumption--absolutely not! Stay in school, kids!""People think it's all about misery and desperation and death [...] but what they forget is the pleasure of it"". This film is not pro-drug, but it is not anti-drug either. This is an unbiased, unpretentious, unpolished look at what is, in the end, an addiction like any other. ""Trainspotting"" does not bother with the classical moral mumbo-jumbo, it understands there is no point in arguing with a drug addict from a societal point of view. They become programmed, lost on emotions, completely overwhelmed by hitting the needle once again.Renton, though, tries to get out of the lifestyle, and we are shown how he methodically prepares himself by locking himself in a room and barring the door. Not soon enough, that fails. No spoiler, come on, you didn't actually think it's going to be that easy. His deadbeat friends include the naive Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the ""intellectual"" Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the short-tempered Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Renton always seems like he is more than them--he denotes a certain maturity but, because of his addiction, this is the best he can get.Despite this raggedness and realism, ""Trainspotting"" has a few frustrating scenes, mostly the surreal ones. Take the scene in which Renton is in desperate need of number 2, so he finds a public bathroom in a bar. The disgusting way in which the bathroom is presented feels sensationalized and patronizing. I felt my stomach turning and there really was no need to push it even more (those that saw the film know what I'm talking about). Boyle then attempts an art-house surreal scene when Renton is locked in a room in his parents' house later in the film. Boyle is too much of a down-to-earth filmmaker to make surrealism stick here and the scene feels like a drag.From a screenwriting point of view, Renton throws motives and justifications on why he needs drugs. It's easy--first because of curiosity, then because it feels good and now because he is addicted. Hearing the Scorsesian narration going along the lines of ""we would have injected Vitamin C if only they'd made it illegal"" nullifies all his initial reasoning. This didn't bother me that much, not as much as the last thirty minutes, anyway. Nothing really happens after this point except, of course, that nail-biting ending. That gave the film a sweet taste after watching it.""Trainspotting"" is a good film. Despite its occasional flaws, I respect it for its non-judgmental approach. Danny Boyle always knew how to relate to people struggling in life, whether they got to their lowest point by their own hands, or by fate. By keeping it unpolished, he made this one of the most effective examples.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Trainspotting - A truly brackish and unusual universe.,"My opinion-.""Trainspotting"" is a movie by Danny Boyle, adapted by Irvine Welsh's best-seller in 1993, describing the adventures of a group of young Scottish heroin addicts and it was this movie that launched the career of The actor Ewan McGregor, who takes the lead. Beyond the addiction to drugs, the film explores the sordid living conditions of the younger generation in a Scotland in full economic depression. ""Trainspotting"" does not constitute an apology for drugs, and thanks to a great script that dares to unveil this glaucous universe of Scottish junkies whatever junkie is a universal word and the situations in Scotland are the same everywhere. Danny Boyle approaches with humor and almost a certain lightness, a taboo subject that is drug, the movie is also very well realized and on a very good rhythm. A movie that I advise",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Best British Movie of recent times,"I can safely say without a doubt that this is the Best British Movie of recent times, definitely the best film of 1996. It is amazing how the story can focus on such a controversial story and contain an incredible amount of humour, as well as intense sadness and fear. It is all those elements that stimulate the soul that makes this such a compelling and wonderful film.Set in Leith and Edinburgh, this film focuses on a young Scotsman called Renton (The charismatic Ewan McGregor), his addiction to heroin, and his relationship with his friends, who are all different in their personality, yet all unified by their old friendships. However, it is Renton's realisation at the life of horror that he is living that gradually threatens to destroy the relationships he has with his so-called mates, and makes him review his views on life, which he lays out in the funny yet shocking opening monologue.This film explores with genuine success how drugs in modern culture is viewed by many different people who live in a place which is notorious for the activity of drug addicts. It tells how the addicts live with it, how they try to keep it, how they view life, and how others view them. The reason for it being controversial is that it both seems to glorify drug use but it more than balances out with the shocking consequences that come of its use.Ewan McGregor gives his most charismatic, enduring and humorous performances to date as the troubled Renton, who deals with the series of events unfolding around him. But, McGregor is not alone with his amazing portrayal. The performance of Robert Carlyle as the psychotic Begbie is flawless as is Kelly MacDonald's portrayal of the charismatic Dianne. You won't see any of the actors giving a better performance than they do in this outstanding film.Based on Irvine Welsh's incredible book of the same name, this film deserves to be given praise for the issues it raises, the awareness it brings with it, and it's relevance to modern culture even now as it reaches its 10 year mark. Embued with wonderful performances, a perfect Soundtrack and humour that will make you laugh and cringe at the same time, this is a film that simply must be seen before you die. One warning, this isn't for the light-hearted.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thought Provoking and Enjoyable,"I have to say that having read the book and watched the film, I thoroughly enjoyed both. Ewan MacGregor was excellent as Renton and Jonny Lee Miller was fantastic as Sick Boy.I think for us Brits the film suffered a little from the typical over hyping of all British Films to hit the big screen but even with that it was one of the best British Films of the 90's.I don't agree with the glamorising drug use argument as a reason to not watch this film, you only have to watch the scenes where Renton is going cold turkey to realise that.But I can see how non scots would struggle with the dialogue at times, which is very broad, but if you can't understand the film i would not even bother trying to read the book.in summary, an excellent film, great character portrayals, a must see for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Seems Danny Boyle has a fascination with filthy places XD It was also very funny when Robert Carlyle had outburst on the fat guy munching snack, making him lose his concentration on the 8 ball and jabbing cue into the table mat 🤣 The music was really cool at times.

Despite The Hype It`s Carlyle`s Film,"TRAINSPOTTING exploded in a burst of hype in 1996 . I`m not sure if this helped the movie . It`s a good movie but no film can live upto the amount of hype this one got , compared to TRAINSPOTTING the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy was a production that went straight to video with very little fanfareThe script was Oscar nominated and deservedly so since Irvine Welsh`s cult low concept novel was deemed to be basically unfilmable , but there is a slight problem in that an all important scene where Begbie stands waiting for a train to take him away from Leith hasn`t been included . This passage from the book explains the title . What suprised me though what wasn`t included in the Oscar nominations , for example the editing where Rents hides under the bedsheets only to be met by Begbie is superb and talking of Begbie he`s without doubt one of the most evil characters ever to have appeared on the silver screen and this is down mainly to Robert Carlyle`s heart stopping performance . Ask yourself this : If another actor had played Francis Begbie would TRAINSPOTTING have been half as good ? Of course not . It`s like watching DIRTY HARRY without Andrew Robinson or GOODFELLOWS without Joe Pesci and it`s shocking that Carlyle wasn`t even nominated at the Oscars for best supporting actorAs a personal footnote I`d just like to add I was born in Leith where this story is set . I do hope that gives me some street cred",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"oi, overrated hipster shite","Judging by the 8 out of 10 overall score and the overwhelming strong reviews, you'd think this is the 'Citizen Kane' of the early 90s, Mirimax, not quite independent cinema movement! It's worth a good laugh watching Renton and his punky, hipster druggy friends shoot dope, go to pubs and clubs, attempt to get jobs, get in violent altercations and discuss being downtrodden Scottish folk through a bunch of gimmicky camera tricks. It IS a good, fun romp through through low-life land with a really good soundtrack, a few laughs, lots of Iggy Pop reference and a naughty sex scene.But parents be warned! This is NOT an anti-drug movie! Yes there are those awful consequences but these are not the WORST consequences and judging by how the movie portrays dingy, low-rent apartments as 'cool' while Renton and crew load up on the good old H coupled with the relatively happy ending, this movie is very likely to insight a few copy cats who don't know any better.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Maybe I'm just getting old too....,"...but if you're older, married, have kids, live the normal suburban life, you probably won't like this movie unless you are truly a film fanatic who just has to see everything that's out there.  I guess I left those days behind...Now, on the other hand, if you want a glimpse of the low-rent, depressing, hopelessness and anger-inducing life of everyday heroin addicts in Scotland who rail against the establishment, then this is the movie for you.Other reviewers have given good synopses and their own critiques of the film so I won't need to repeat them.  I just know that my free time is becoming more and more limited at this stage of my life so that I'd like to spend the little time I have for movies watching ones that are unique, spectacular, entertaining, uplifting, insightful, engaging, or just plain fun.After watching ""Trainspotting,"" I felt that I had just wasted two hours of my life.  Sure, I got to see the movie that may have made Ewan McGregor, and yes I got to see the seamy side of heroin-addiction as a ""normal"" way of life in Edinburgh, but looking back now, I think I could have lived my life without having experienced that and not felt that I had missed anything.Anyway, if you're younger than say 35 and still living that single life and am proud that you haven't ""sold out"" to the system, you may like this movie. If you're older than that, and ""are"" the establishment nowadays with that steady corporate tax-paying job, the 2.1 kids, the house in suburbia, and the weekend house on the lake, you'll either: 1) Have disgust for the slacking lifestyle portrayed in this film, and wonder ""What a waste!"", and/or 2) Be amazed at how much YOU've changed from being similarly rebellious in your own youth (well, maybe not a heroin addict) and become what you are today.Whether this film will appeal to you depends on your age and life-situation. Although I felt I pretty much wasted my time watching it, it would have added insult to injury if I had paid to rent this.  If you really feel you must see it, then do what I did and use a free-rental coupon.

Choose Life,"Comedic and stylish, Trainspotting manages to tell stories of heroin addicts in a highly energetic way. Trainspotting, directed by Danny Boyle, uses different cinematic techniques, music, and comedic timing every five minutes, if it were any other film the movie would have been completely incoherent, but the varying use of techniques does not hinder the movie's pacing but instead establishes the tone of the chaotic life of a heroin addict.The comedic timing in this movie is on par with most, if not every joke seemed to hit it's mark, and sometimes the humour came from the most unexpected places. Every minute the movie could make you giggle at heroin addicts, AIDS, a dead baby and the absurdity of all. Moreover since they are using touchy subjects as a point of humour they could also make commentaries while giving the audience a honest laugh.The performances were all top notch but the obvious standout was Robert Caryle who played the psychotic Bigsby. Everything from his posture to his varying emotions shows that he and his knife were a force to be reckoned with. Jonny Lee Miller playing Sick Boy, while not as grandiose, was on the same level as Caryle. Using his wit he effectively brought charisma to Sickboy. Because of these two actors, Ewan Macgregor's Renton seems to falter at times but because he played Renton in such a reserved way there was a greater juxtaposition with his highly volatile emotional self which made for a great comparison.My only complaint about the movie were the thick Scottish accents which made it impossible for me to understand until I turned on the subtitles. However it is hard to call that a flaw as most of the actors even though they are not Scottish, managed to pull off the heavy handed dialect with a very authentic voice. So while my ears would have liked less accents I know that if the actors spoke with the audience's ears in mind they would have not been able to pull off a genuine performance such as this.With that Trainspotting was a solid movie that's able to show the comedic part of being addicted and the tragedy of being sober.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of my all-time favorites!,"I saw 'Trainspotting' when it was first released. The reason I saw it was because I was a huge fan of Danny Boyle's 'Shallow Grave' and boy was I in for a surprise. At the time, I had never read the book by Irvene Welsh so I didn't know what too expect. Nevertheless, I was blown away with end results!What an amazing stylistic film with excellent performances and interesting if not unlikable characters! I liked Ewan McGregor in 'Shallow Grave', but he was outstanding as Renton- the drug-addled Scot who keeps trying to give up smack. The supporting performances were also great, 'Trainspotting' introduced me to Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Robert Carlyle as Begbie, Kelly McDonald as Renton's love interest in Diane and Ewan Bremmer as Spud. All are fairly well-known now, and all were great in 'Trainspotting' but Carlyle here shined as the angry and volatile Begbie!I've watched 'Trainspotting' numerous times, and it's still funny, stylistic, cool, intriguing and sad, but most of all, it shows the depravity of hard-core drug addiction. It's is certainly anti-drug in my mind, as I walked away from the movie vowing to never touch smack! 'Trainspotting' is not everybody but it certainly doesn't glamourise drugs- so if you don't mind films with drugs, this one is worth a look. 'Trainspotting' is an amazing and memorable film where the Scottish dialect is simple to understand if you listen. Heck, most DVDS have a subtitle option anyway. Highly recommended to people who like unusual cinema/video and, in my opinion, it's one of the best films of the 1996 and one of my personal favorites!

In My All-Time Top 10 List,"Trainspotting grabs you by the proverbials from the first scene and doesn't let go. An astounding portrait of friendship, addiction, sexuality, young adulthood, poverty, Scotland, misery, perseverance, loyalty and redemption. It skewers mainstream values while showing that the rejection of these values in favor of a junkie's lifestyle is ultimately a dead end, and just as vapid as mainstream life can be. The film develops it's characters extremely fast and with precision. We are drawn to them and feel an affinity with them for a variety of reasons, even though they are all in one way or another, degenerates. But we pull for them to beat their habits, to get out of their miserable conditions. But we never pity them, because despite their predicament, they manage to live it up and live life, and feel emotion and express their desires. There is also plenty of humor to go around, much of it dark. The editing, soundtrack, acting and story suck you in to an ""experience"". The film has heart and soul and set a new standard in it's way. It is such an original work of art, with many memorable scenes.

The Shallow Grave team of Andrew MacDonald, John Hodge, and Danny Boyle go for the throat, and deliver a deliriously cinematic jewel that is equal parts fantasy, comedy, and harrowing drama.Superb use of music and eye-opening set pieces (like the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland"") never upstage the colorful characters -- people who behave despicably and deplorably, shamefully and amorally, and yet endear themselves to viewers who find their wicked wit and charming smiles irresistible.

Grip of the Past,"Escaping the present and living a life free from our past is a task many dream of. Renton, a drug addict who's constantly encircled by his friends, attempts to change his life on multiple occasions but always retrogrades.

Although Renton and his mates appear free and in their own world, they are unaware of the dangers they put themselves in. Going through each day as an adventure is fun but putting your life at stake each time for such little reward is futile. This is a realization Renton slowly makes.Everyone goes through rough patches but these boys seem to hit it all. Prison, death, sickness and emotional breakdowns are just some of their problems that seem to never fade away. Not always so obvious, getting away from life isn't so easy.Over time, the boys evolve like any young men. Some proceed to stronger drugs while others try to get their act together.

Danny Boyle's greatest film - perhaps even the greatest of the 90's,"I discovered the work of Danny Boyle when I watched Trainspotting (1996) with my friend in his apartment, about two years ago. We could relate to its themes (friendship, growing apart, heroin-addiction etc.), since my friend and I were in fact heroin-addicts ourselves back then (thank God, I'm clean now!). Film-critics have criticized Trainspotting for glamorizing drugs - I don't agree. Trainspotting is supposed to be almost a journey in the life of an addict, and although we do see the good times of heroin-use, we certainly also see the bad ones. Portraying heroin-addiction in any other way would be looking down upon the film's audience.""People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that sh*t which is not to be ignored, but what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not f**king stupid. At least, we're not that f**king stupid."" - Mark Renton, TrainspottingTrainspotting is pure cinematic art. It has a unique visual style (play with distinctive colors red/green in rooms, several surrealistic scenes etc.), a great rock/80's-pop/classical/electronica score by artists such as Iggy Pop (with David Bowie), Lou Reed, Underworld and Mozart and fabulous method-acting (especially by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle). It's very artistic, avant garde-ish and at the same commercially. This in itself is one of Trainspotting's great strengths.Trainspotting can't be described.

Trainspotting precisely captures the spirit of the age through tracing the lives of four heroin-addicted Scottish friends, depicting their ups and downs, and their struggle to come clean and start a new life. The movie is highly graphic and quite shocking I have to say, but this somehow corresponds with the gravity of the experience itself that Boyle has brilliantly and vividly conveyed to the audience in fluttering stages: the absence, the denial, the realization, the struggle, the relapse... etc. The film doesn't lecture or blame; it doesn't treat drug use as an individual case but as a societal phenomena that has everything to do with the atmosphere back then.

I think the film is good how it allows the viewer to make up their own minds on drug, rather than pushing an anti drug/pro drug agenda. There are some sad parts to the film, but in general the message I got was 'do what thy wilt- but choose life if possible'.A kind of Crowley-Esq modern take if you will.TS has so much going for it still, wonderfully shot and written - with superb acting from all of the cast. I don't need to go on about how good it is anyway as it's reputation precedes it. What I would like to add though is that in regards to T2- I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope that Danny Boyle doesn't do a JJ Abrams on it and basically re does the first film (A new Hope) and sell it as something original (The Farce awakens), because judging by the trailer - he might unfortunately do just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Addictive stuff,"Hard to believe it's five years since Danny Boyle's classic film Trainspotting took the world by storm but while you ask yourself what has happened since it opened on March 8, 1996, just reflect on the movie's legacy for a minute.Just about every firm in the UK borrowed its ad campaign; Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Kelly MacDonald became huge stars while Boyle himself went on to make the sublime A Life Less Ordinary and current video release, The Beach.As for the soundtrack? Iggy Pop, Leftfield, Blur and Pulp helped turn it into one of the biggest sellers of the year.In case you didn't know it, the movie was based on a cult novel by Irvine Welsh who writes largely in broad Scots and makes an appearance as drug dealer, Mother Superior.`He's called that on account of the length of his habit,' remarks Renton (McGregor). While the movie was seen by many sniping critics to be glorifying drug culture, what it actually did was far more clever than any `Just Say No' ad campaign by the cast of Grange Hill.By taking the (at the time) radical viewpoint that the drug culture exists, the film-makers didn't judge. Instead, Trainspotting depicted the squalid lives of its inhabitants and the ultimately fatal consequences of being a heroin addict.Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and writer John Hodge amazed the British film-making community when they made such a hit movie on home turf.Even before their outstanding debut, Shallow Grave, was released, producer Scott (The Firm) Rudin was offering them $250,000 to make any big screen project they wanted.Most people expected them to upstumps and set up camp in America, like so many film-types lured to the States by the big bucks.The cash may be great in la la land but creative freedom? Not a chance. Had Trainspotting been shot across the pond, there's a good chance it would have been made as a comedy vehicle for Jim Carrey - or whoever else was big at the time. The drug element would have been removed completely and the addiction would have probably been something safe like chocolate or coffee.As for the ambiguous title? Forget that.Thankfully, Danny and company stayed put and delivered one of the best British films of the last decade. A biting, shocking satire which goes for the jugular and stays in the mind no matter how much you'd like to forget it.The sight of a baby crawling along the ceiling of Renton's bedroom remains one of the most shocking dream sequences I've ever seen. Three days later it kept returning like an unwanted guest that just won't leave.No movie is created in a vacuum and the Trainspotting crew borrowed heavily from another cult flick for their inspiration: A Clockwork Orange.The near inaudible scene in the Volcano nightclub is almost a carbon copy of the Velocet Milk Bar from that Stanley Kubrick classic and in a fine in-joke, even features a track by Heaven 17 (who took their moniker from the same controversial movie.)If you only see five minutes, don't miss Renton attempting to seduce Diane as his libido returns with a vengeance. Aside from boasting one of the best shots in the movie as they leave the club, it also features Kelly MacDonald delivering some delicious dialogue.",,Anonymous,Drama
Pretty good but not my kind of movie,"I had heard of this movie a couple of years ago in relation to some survey of British films(Total film, I think). This movie reportedly ended up on the 4th place. I guess that shows the inherent popularity of this movie set in Edinburgh.My first reaction was that of indifference. Sure, it was entertaining but it was not as impressive as I thought it would be. But then, I really don't think it was my sort of movie at all.The plot is as follows. Mark ""Rents"" Renton(Ewan MacGregor) is a drug addict who spends time injecting heroin along with his friends who can be best described as eccentric and aimless. Begbie is a psychotic man who is surprisingly not a drug addict. In the words of Renton, he gets off on starting fights with random people for no reason in bars. Spud is a guy lacking social skills and who could be described as the nicest person in the group. Sickboy is another weirdo of the group who is absolutely devoid of moral scruples whatsoever. Sick boy can be described as the charismatic face of the group and he is most interested in movies and the pop culture of the time. Tommy is another guy who is not a heroin junkie and becomes one after his girlfriend dumps him over a lost tape(this might be the saddest story of all).The movie portrays the gradual change of Mark Renton from heroin junkie to respected real estate professional who tries to live the regular life. The sarcasm in this movie is evident in the way Renton describes the supposed normal way of living - a long monologue listing various home appliances and material things in a resigned, monotonous tone. This appears in the beginning and end of the movie.The movie switches from dark comedy to tragedy to dark comedy again in a matter of minutes which is likely to jolt viewers a bit. There are a few scenes involving scatological references which are not likely to appeal to some people's tastes. Also the relationship of the lead character with an underaged girl may not be palatable to certain people. There is also a very shocking scene(according to me at least) involving a baby which may leave a lasting impression on the viewers.The movie then deals with the struggles of Renton, who tries to go to rehab and tries to extricate himself from his poisonous friends.Good points? The soundtrack and movie score is actually pretty good and is one of the high points of the movie. Another positive is the great performance of Ewan MacGregor who stars as Mark Renton. Ewen Bremner is especially noteworthy as Spud and he is the one most likely to elicit some sympathy from viewers. Robert Carlyle as Begbie has given one of the best performances on film(according to me) as the psychotic Begbie. Truly one of the most frightening performances ever. The fast moving screenplay is also one of the positive aspects of the movie.I recommend this movie to moviebuffs who are interested in the lives of drug addicts and also the youth culture of Edinburgh in 90's. This movie is perfect for people who have a taste for British style dark comedy.Overall I wasn't so impressed overall but then it just wasn't my type of movie so that influences my opinion obviously.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Leaving the garbage behind,"An incredibly written, gut punching story that better than any other, shows the sick world one enters when one dabbles in drugs. Anyone can enter this world, a rebellious teenager, an all round junkie, even a well bread man who up untill then lived a life without needing it. There are explanations as to why one enters sed world and there often aren't, but once you get in, it takes a great deal to get out. A hard endurance through reabilitation isn't always necessary, sometimes it just takes one shattering event that brings you all round. And it doesn't just concern drugs, sometimes the very thing to put past one's self are the so called friendships, who can either be fulfilling, or can serve as an anchor one can't pull back in. As much as one can praise John Hodge for the incredible adaptation from the original book, or the immaculate and in their contest picturesque performances, that which really stands out is the incredible direction by Danny Boyle. He shows clarity, limbo, happiness, insecurity and doubt in such a realistic way that one feels like he's a part of what's happening on screen. The movie moves along in a rather steady pace, not at all overstaying it's welcome and is just the right length. Trainspotting truly is one of a kind and a can't miss for any cinefile.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"20 years on, choose something else.","This is it. One of the big ones. One of the biggest films in both British cinema and culture, as well as general cinema. It took a glimpse at and captured late 90s British culture, has garnered endless praise by critics and audiences alike, has influenced many films and filmmakers since, got nominated for numerous awards and even has a cult following to boot. But after 20 years, does it still hold up?The plot is Renton among his various heroin junkie friends wander around life in late 1990s Scotland and England, experiencing addiction, drug withdrawal, employment, theft and the changing culture of the time. If I'm sounding like I'm making the film look weak in terms of plot, that is how the film presents itself, and is rather the fault of the film than of my own. One of my biggest problems with the film is its utter lack of a coherent plot and/or structure. There is no overreaching story arc whatsoever throughout the entire film, sans the occasional subplot, and as such, it makes the film hard to connect with due to a lack of a strong narrative to pull the viewer in. This sort of style can work; Five Easy Pieces for example is a wonderful demonstration of how to do a wandering movie correctly.However, the big difference between Five Easy Pieces and Trainspotting is that while both have major douchebags in the leads, the former's was at least sympathetic, the latter isn't. And that is my main problem with the film; the characters are too unlikable to engage with. Far too nasty, narcissistic and selfish to really attach onto. Only Spud seems like a legitimately good guy, and even he is too pathetic and easily manipulated to support. The rest of them are just horrible and self-indulgent narcissists perfectly happy to stab each other in the back when the plot serves that need, most notably Renton's betrayal of both Spud in the courtroom early on and then his ultimate back stab at the end. It doesn't make a for a bunch of likable protagonists, of which makes the viewer wonder why are they bothering to watch?In comparison, someone like Five Easy Pieces' Bobby Dupea may be for many an unlikable guy (being moody, spoilt and generally selfish), but at least he is charming, and cares enough for people for people around him to make him a likable enough guy with some sense of a moral compass. Trainspotting has none of this. The characters seem to care little for one another beyond anything superficial, they have no likable character traits, and given the fact that they range from stupid losers to borderline psychopaths (hi, Begbie), they aren't pleasant people to be around either. Of which makes watching an hour and a half movie with these fools as the lead somewhat problematic, given that I don't enjoy their company at all. Meanwhile, they don't have the excuse films like Sweet Smell Of Success, Fight Club and even Boyle's own Shallow Grave do in that the characters in those movies are similarly rotten to the core, but they were also charming, had some moral compass and got their comeuppance in the end, even if it is somewhat minimal for say Fight Club, none of which happens in Trainspotting, especially given that the 'comeuppance' that happens at the end of the film is benefitting another unlikable character and making another more likable character in Spud worse off so it means nothing. And at least in those movies, when they were backstabbing one another, those affected were at least ready to take the heat and fight back as opposed to Trainspotting where innocent or unlucky victims are often in the firing line for the main characters' antics (like getting an innocent dog owner attacked by his own dog, one guy unknowingly sleeping with a minor of whom then blackmails him to keep up the relationship and pretty much everything that happens to Spud from having his job interviews messed up by friends to being sent down while friends who helped him in crime walk free).So here's my underlying problem; there is no substantial enough plot to get the viewer engaged and the characters are too unlikable to make you care enough for the situation. As such, why am I watching in the first place?After all this, you probably think I hate this movie, but I don't, as I think it's OK. The acting is terrific, it's very stylish and it is entertaining at the least. The film can be funny at points (especially some of movie references thrown about and narration parts) and it does have a wonderful soundtrack. The film's production values are very good for the most part (sans some embarrassingly fake effects like the crawling baby during one of Renton's hallucinations) in terms of cinematography, location shooting and editing (even on a low budget), of which helps to create Trainspotting's unique tone of both bleakness and weird sense of hope, especially towards the end and in certain scenes (like the Worst Toilet In Scotland scene). And even if it potentially dates it somewhat, I do like how it is a great reflection of late 1990s Britain, celebrating both the highs and lows of said culture, making a great historical document in that sense.But despite this, I'm not a huge fan. Between the lack of a strong plot and any likable characters, Trainspotting may be an easy film to admire, but a very, very hard one to like. It may look very nice and is very well made, but unfortunately has nothing to grab the viewer in terms of anything emotionally driven, a big failing for a drama like this one. So overall, it is OK, but it doesn't hold up as well as it does over 20 years ago. Choose your future, choose life and just choose a better film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Terrible film,"I figure that all the people praising this film must be young. I usually have no problem with profanity but it was over the top in this film. The film also has an obsession with excrement. I know that life has its ugly sides but what this film shows grossly overstates the negative side of life. I recall a film I saw in the late 1960's that did a much better job of portraying drug addiction. I don't get the relationship between the parents of the girlfriends and the guys. Is it usual in Scotland for the parents to let the guys stay overnight? Finally, the accents were very hard to follow. I say this even though I usually have no problem with accents.

But that baby part was freaky. I really think the guy who wrote this movie had to have had some personal experience with the junk that they were doing.

One of the most influential films for the British film industry.,"One of the most influential films in recent memory for the British film industry, skyrocketing the careers of Ewan McGregor and Danny Boyle.Set in contemporary 1996 Scotland, Trainspotting follows a small group of youths trapped in the grip of heroin abuse. One of them, Mark Renton, looks to better himself but finds the task monumentally difficult, not only because of the addiction but also because of the losers he decided to call friends.Trainspotting made colossal waves in the mid-1990s. Director Danny Boyle (now famous for Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours) would become a household name in the United Kingdom as one of the great contemporary British directors with this stylish, low-budget black comedy based off of Irvine Welsh's novel of the same name. Watching it now, over twenty years later, not only do I feel old but Trainspotting is a time capsule; a resoundingly 90s movie! This is mostly due to Danny Boyle's music choices, which would become a trademark of his movies (with exceptions like sci-fi flick Sunshine) and here is a tremendous example of his skill at picking and choosing his soundtrack. Perhaps the other nostalgic element, and most famous, is Ewan McGregor's voice-over ""Chose Life""; single- handedly challenging society while also making great observational comedy. Of course, Trainspotting is also a deeply uncomfortable experience. Much of its fame is controversy; the shiny, bright and well off society of 1990s Britain being shown with drug-addled youths, lost generations and death. All from the perspective of these unhinged people ""living life"", a cold contradiction that they and those around them suffer yet they seem casually unfazed by it all. Jovial even! Indeed, the film goes to some dark places, and all within the first half! Within twenty minutes we have Ewan McGregor on a drug-fueled diarrhea trip, impossibly climbing into a toilet head first to reclaim lost suppositories. What!?!It feels at times like a British answer to Quentin Tarantino. Irvine Welsh's writing coming through the screenplay with wit and banter, at times long ranting monologues (one of my favourites coming from Renton while in the middle of a Scottish moor) the film is as quotable and memorable as it is brutal and nihilistic. Then there is Robert Carlyle as Begbie, the only one who isn't a drug addict and he is more terrifying than any of them!Trainspotting is a hard film to like, but an easy film to respect. An absolute must for anyone studying film (its screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award) and film history; it inspired many budding British filmmakers. Personally I can see the demented love, fun and confidence that the cast and crew poured into the film, and while I cannot relate at all, its rebellious and almost perceptive nature makes it rewarding regardless of the dark pit that it resides.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

An entertaining film,"having never seen a film or anything in my own accent, it took me a while to get over the novelty of this and the fact that the dialogue sounds a bit laboured to me.  Getting over that, this is an excellent film, getting across no points other than the quality of danny boyle and 'dont touch smack'. The mixture of the hard reality of ""intravenous injecting of hard drugs"" and surreal alice in wonderland scenes such as renton climbing down a toilet. The scene where his mum and dad lock mark renton in his room is sheer genious.  Everybody's felt fevered like it, but to have it discribed so acurately is unnerving to say the least. A wee note on the side, you know the bit when renton is trying to get away from his parents and his friends to get another hit, and he jumps off the wall. The next shot is of him landing at mother superiour's place like a cat.  Beautiful",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Bold, crazy and wild","A wild, freeform, Rabelaisian trip through the darkest recesses of Edinburgh low-life, focusing on Mark Renton and his attempt to give up his heroin habit, and how the latter affects his relationship with family and friends: Sean Connery wannabe Sick Boy, dimbulb Spud, psycho Begbie, 14-year-old girlfriend Diane, and clean-cut athlete Tommy, who's never touched drugs but can't help being curious about them...I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It is a shocking look at the effects drugs can have on people and the same time it poses some interesting questions about the world we live in and the youth. It has a very original screenplay and one of the most stylish directions I have ever seen. It is a energetic, imaginative, and vibrant film and at the time it came out, it must have felt very unique. I really enjoyed it but had I seen this film in 1996 ( I was too young but I'm talking hypothetically ) this film would have made a much bigger impact in me (specially the visual aspect of it) and the reason why is because the director Danny Boyle, uses certain filming techniques, and certain effects that are truly mind-blowing and make for great scenes but, as of 2009, this techniques are now fairly common and have been used by several directors. And again, I think Trainspotting is great but had I not seen such films as Requiem For A Dream(2000) and Garden State(2004) just to name a few, I would definitely think more of this one. Anyway, the film balances extremely well, humorous moments with the more disturbing scenes, and always staying truth to itself. At times, the narrative isn't as focused as it should be but this is a minor flaw. Of all the actors two deserve being mentioned, first, Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, one of the so called mates of Mark Renton, a very unlikable character but extremely well played by the actor, and second, Ewan Mcgregor who's terrific as the lead character, Renton, and delivers probably, the best performance of his career so far. The soundtrack is great as well and fits perfectly with the crazy and chaotic scenes of the film. Trainspotting is definitely a must-see for any movie-lover.8/10",,Anonymous,Drama
Confusing film - but still pretty damn good.,"I didn't see this film at the cinema, which was probably a mistake. I think its impact would have been all the greater on the big screen. As it was, I settled for the Green edition.Is this film pro-drugs? Given that it shows the deaths of both a baby and the friend of the central characters as a result, hardly. Is it anti-drugs? Not so you'd notice - it doesn't preach. It shows you the lives the heroin addicts live, and leaves you to draw your own conclusions.Marvellous acting, centreing (of course) on Renton, although Begbie was a fascinating role, which made you think: why DO these people associate with such a nutter? Favourite character has to be Spud, wonderfully blissed-out.There isn't a strong plot running through the film, it's more a succession of scenes illustrating the lives of the central characters. The sub-plot connected with the big drug deal felt a bit tacked-on and unconvincing, but that's a fairly minor quibble.Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached, although the Worst Toilet scene goes into surreal overdrive, while Spud's 'accident' is just plain funny.The additional scenes in the Green edition - rough cuts that didn't make the final edit, following the end of the film - were a welcome bonus; I felt that one or two of them would actually have made the film a bit more coherent.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A must watch which hasn't aged a day in 24 years,"Trainspotting follows the lives of five 'friends' who navigate heroin addiction in 90s Scotland. Pretty heavy stuff and as you'd expect this film is deeply depressing, sombre and shocking in parts. Despite this, somehow Boyle also manages to bring a moments of levity to this film, with some excellently executed dark humour.This is in my opinion Boyle's best film. The whole film just fits so well together, with the script, performances, camera work, and soundtrack blending together perfectly. Boyle captured the absolute worst of drug addiction but also managed to find some semblance of hope. The flow of the film was seamless and, given the context, this film could have been a huge swing and a miss. The plot of Trainspotting is very solid and there was so much potential that Boyle squeezed out to its full extent. The fact that Boyle managed to make a story of addiction so artistic, rich and energetic is astounding - a true celebration of British film making.The standout of Trainspotting really is the cast. Ewan McGregor was exceptional, and really carried the film as a powerful lead. His representation of a man's relationship with drugs, fighting addiction and trying to piece together his life was heart breaking and so well done. Johnny Lee Miller, Robert Carlisle, Ewen Bremmer and Kevin McKidd were all fantastic. The chemistry between them was so toxic yet so believable at the same time. Their relationship simultaneously made no sense and perfect sense, which the actors all expressed well. You can tell that the actors had a great amount of trust in Boyle and were all in on making Trainspotting.Trainspotting is oft regarded as a classic and its easy to see why. Clearly Boyle's best film which delivers a shock to the system, some laughs and some hope at the same time. A must watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Do they add anything to it?  Um...that depends on whether you like seeing them in movies.As for the movie...I hated it the first time I saw it.  It was just too much.  I had been recently watching a friends brother deal with heroin addiction and this didn't help matters any.I just saw it again and I liked it more this time.

'Trainspotting' does have plenty to say - and boy does it portray it!,"Not the most enthralling, but 'Trainspotting' does have plenty to say - and boy does it portray it!There are particularly strong performances from Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle. I didn't like watching the bunch of characters given how severely unlikeable they are. Of course, that is very much the intention so it's a credit to the actors and the filmmakers at how convincing it all is. The humour is weaker than expected, perhaps due to the horrors of the plot taking centre stage.Their struggles are showed in a heavy manner, to the point I did feel uncomfortable seeing them do their thing. I do feel post-watch that I'm missing something from it in regards to being able to appreciate it higher, I can't shake that feeling.

"Oh, man! That baby on the ceiling is still shocking! The toilet scene too.","So my favorite story about this film is that I have a Scottish grandmother who would go to our local arthouse theater anytime there was a new movie set in Scotland. Well, here's a new movie about heroin addicts set in her hometown of Edinburgh. I did not watch TRAINSPOTTING with my grandmother, but I do remember asking her what she thought about it and her response was, ""I'd forgotten how much people swear in Scotland.""I was pretty excited about this film when it came out because I loved director Danny Boyles' prior film with Ewan McGregor, SHALLOW GRAVE, a jet-black comedy about a group of friends whose new flatmate turns up dead with a suitcase full of cash under his bed. They then struggle whether to keep the money and dispose of the body or do the right thing by going to the authorities. You can guess which direction they go. TRAINSPOTTING is equally dark in its humor but is far more hard-hitting in its take on drug addiction and drug culture. Besides stylish direction, a great cast, a sharply written script, and one of the best soundtracks of all time, I think what sets this film apart from other tales of addiction is that it dared to show the ""fun"" and attraction of the drug addict lifestyle; robbing, conning, and the pleasures of the high of drugs. However, the film goes incredibly dark when the addition get uglier and uglier. I think REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the only film about addiction that is even harder to watch. While REQUIEM is a masterpiece, it's so hard to watch, it's not a film I really want to revisit, though TRAINSPOTTING, as hard as it is to watch at times, is a fantastic cast of characters who are fun to revisit over and over again (like a drugged addicted British version of the kids in DAZED AND CONFUSED).

Movement is key,"I love Trainspotting because of the way it attacks your sense and plays with the conventions of moviemaking. This movie flows fast and furious from beginning to end with a killer soundtrack that perfectly compliments the movie. Though it's about drug addiction, I don't think Trainspotting glorifies the use of heroin at all. True, it may paint a more realistic picture, but it does show you the horrors of withdrawal. Trainspotting is so vibrant, so alive, that even when the Scottish accents are a bit hard to understand, you still get a sense of what's going on. The dialogue is hysterical at times and the way the Irvine Welsh's novel was adopted for the screen was well done, in my opinion.

With ""Requiem For a Dream"", the end was clearly against heroin. Here, it is a bit more ambiguous, because the characters have so much fun. And, with heroin today (2014) being as big a story as it was mid-1990s, the film again becomes relevant.Regardless of message, this showed the world what Danny Boyle could do with a small budget, and it was quite a bit.

Say No to Drugs!,"""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?""I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed.The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him.For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Go...Renton...,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was extremely creative and provided a great look at the life of a Scottish heroine addict Ewan McGregor played a stunning account of Renton, the main character.Well...I shouldn't say that he was the main character because every character played an extravagant roll in whatever place they were in. I especially loved the opening scene, the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" scene, the bar scene where no one goes home alone, and the scene in which Renton goes home to his parents. I could only find this video on the internet for sale but I loved it so much. I was eventually able to find it for sale at some small convenient store. they had it marked up to about 150% of what it should have been but I bought it any way. I probably watch it once a month.

The film is built up to explain the effects of the drug, people living in disgraceful flats, not caring about anything else but ""hero"".

Not quite what I expected.,"I ought to start by saying that I liked the film. I had known about this film for a while, thinking it was something akin to other 1990s crime comedies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels or The Big Lebowski. In retrospect I suppose that was a bit naive. Trainspotting is often described as a comedy but while it has comedic elements to it the film felt much more like a drama/surreal fever dream. While such imagery would usually remind me of David Lynch the aforementioned comedic elements and the presence of illicit drugs reminded me more of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Francis Bacon in particular was cited as an influence and it makes sense. Dealing with the harsh realities of drug addiction the film certainly wasn't pleasant and kind of hard to watch in parts. But these aren't appealing themes. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) our protagonist narrates to us his difficulties with social pressure (to get off drugs), shots of the Edinburgh drug scene into which he is immersed, the degradation of his life on drugs, his unreliable friends, and the perceived mediocrity and boredom of life without drugs. As a result, while I can't relate to many of Renton's issues I can still empathize, even though he makes plenty of bad decisions that continue to drive him into a hole. Marking down an opinion then is difficult. While more gritty (and even depressing) than I expected it to be Trainspotting is still enjoyable and you can't say it's not a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose This,"Trainspotting may be one of those films we love to hate. The actors are great, (what a marvelous McGregor), the music is excellent, the story is not bad, blah, blah, blah..We may think this is the kind of movies that rocks the young people, because that's the kind of thing we (oh no...) live every day (is that true?). And not only the youngs, ask your parents or teachers if they saw it.And yes, this is like an anti-drug film, maybe not for all tastes, but hey, this is not a fiction of an irish, this is close to the truth. The drugs destroy, the life is a paradox, and the choice is up to you. Trainspotting is a cool way to show how bad can be this form of life",,Anonymous,Drama

Great movie about drug abuse.,"This is a great movie about drug abuse. A true drama. While watching this movie you will learn a lot about the life of drug addicts. It's a really good drama. There are times that will bring tears to your eyes from laughter and other times, tears of sorrow.This is a pretty graphic movie but it is very good. Depicts the life of a drug addict and his struggle plus his good times with heroine. This movie really pulls you in. The dialog, the situations, it's all thought out very well and very realistically. It shows the effects of withdrawal from heroine and the chemical side effects due to rapid withdrawal; since heroine gives you a chemical dependency it's dangerous to just stop taking it.The acting in the movie is very good. Ian McGregor is overall a good actor and he didn't come up short in any scene of the movie. Facial expressions, reactions etc were all very natural.Overall this was a pretty good movie that could teach you a lot if you take the serious parts seriously and not get convinced that this is a comedy despite some pretty funny scenes. It's a drama about drugs and is a very powerful movie with an intense plot squeezed into less than 90 minutes so it won't bore you either.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

one of the most visually powerfull films ever.,"When i first saw this film I wasn't at all prepared for its power and impact. I was transfixed by it. it gripped me like few other films have ever done. Its stylistic exuberance,its visual inventiveness, its sheer energy is unbelievable.It mixed despondency with humour,bleakness with wit,bitter realism with surrealistic fantasy. Poignant,hilarious,harrowing,upbeat in turns,it did what no other drug movie has achieved:to present us with believable, rounded characters we can identify with, instead of the one sided caricatures other drug movies portray.These are people like us, they could be us;they laugh,they cry, they suffer,they try to make sense of their lives and the fucked-up world that surrounds them, they analyse their own cosmotheories, they get depressed, they grieve, they try to find a way out of the debris that surround them.OK, they are also addicted to smack, but isn't their addiction a reflection(on a bigger scale) of our own little ""domestic, socially acceptable"" addictions,be it nicotine,caffeine,reality shows,tv quizzes,mobile phones, designer clothes,carreerism...This film enraged many people,cause it refused to fall back on old clichees and easy answers,namely that ""we"" are respectable citizens and ""they"" are freaks and scum.

Whoa!,"This movie deals with some of the most frightening and disgusting subjects imaginable; it has sex, rock, and especially drugs and yet is wonderful. While other films try desperately to interject youth and cutting-edge displays of bad taste, this movie is wonderfully alive even while its subjects are killing themselves.  ""Objectionable material,"" which I certainly was turned off by at first, turns out to be nothing more than an intimate and realistic portrayal of the sad and sometimes exciting lives of those Scottish youth. Thought-provoking in every way and extremely enjoyable in others, it brings us characters that we would rather not deal with and makes us feel for them in a way no other film can.  All the performances were wonderful, especially (as is often commented on, and rightly so) Mr. McGregor's fantastic work.

Ride unlike many others!!,"Trainspotting is truly a wild ride down a path that thankfully many of us don't see. We all know how the overuse and dependency of drugs can destroy a life, the gripping struggle many endure to pull themselves out of that toilet, and the ruin they can bring to others around them. But Trainspotting is a movie that shows more than just the dark travails of this ugly trip as the movie 'Basketball Diaries' does to excruciating detail. It reaffirms why life, as is wonderfully described in a Dylan like way by Ewan McGregor in the beginning of the movie, is worth living. What separates this movie and elevates it from other movies that cover this same tone and subject material is that the main character is not totally destroyed and left in a dark hopeless state at the end just to emphasize the why you shouldn't do drugs lesson. The movie ends with great hope and answers McGregor's own opening question of why choose life. And I will say emphatically again it is one hell of a ride. We follow McGregor and his excellently casted mates through all the stages of drug abuse and the Alice in Wonderland like adventures that follow it. Robert Carlye played the volatile Francis Begbie to an Oscar like perfection. His outburst struck me like a dark comedy where you almost hate to laugh but your true honesty leaves you no choice. Definitely one of the most memorable characters from a movie in the 90's.  From drug dens to night clubs the cast mixes so well. The humor bounces wildly off the wall like something you get out of a gum ball machine. You never know when it will jump out in front of you so be ready. Danny Boyle deserves a great nod and a raise of the glass for a directing job well done. He chooses shots from great angles and adds all kinds of perfectly captured perks as well. One of my favorite scenes is the shot from the floor as McGregor has just taken a large hit of heroin. He proceeds to sink into a large red rug right through the floor. Every proceeding shot is from this unusual point of view until he is brought out of his dazed state at a local hospital. For someone who has never done heroin (and doesn't particularly plan to) this is one of the feelings I can imagine the drug delivering me to as I watch McGregor dip into the floor. That folks is a sign of a good director. When you have a camera in your hands and you want to have the audience truly feel what something is like why just tell them? Too easy and makes for a dull movie. Which is an incurable disease eighty percent of filmmakers have today. Show them dammit!! Use your imagination and create uniqueness. Make your movie stand out. The soundtrack compliments Trainspotting to a tee and adds to the movie's slick electric settings and rich cinematography. The only slight problem with the movie is that at times some of the Scottish accents get as thick as something out of a broken espresso machine. You will find yourself trying to understand what the hell is being said but just pay attention to what is going on within the scene and you will make it through with flying colors. This movie was not what I expected. It thrilled me in many different ways and added new life to subject material that I am sure hasn't seen the last foot tracks come its way.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Still As Brill As The Day It Was First Released.....,"What can I say..? What a movie indeed. First off, I will mention the cast who are brilliant all through out the film. With out a doubt. Ewan McGregor, a great actor made his acting name in this movie, playing ""Mark Renton"", the heroin addicted no good. Ewan's performance is always strong and it never fails. Trainspotting made him a start. So if you are a fan of him, this is a must because quite simply he plays this character with his eyes closed, to perfection.Robert Carlyle even manages to let us see his wide range of acting skills by playing the extremely violent vicious character ""Begbie"". All though a small role for Carlyle a very rememorable one at that. A scary performance that will leave you thinking I can't believe he's just done that...Others main people in the film are British actor Jonny Lee Miller as the heroin user turned pimp ""Sick Boy"" who likes to sell other people's passports to dodgy dealers and who knows a lot about Sean Connery. And the dumb, but stupidly nice ""Spud"", who can't help getting himself into all sorts of trouble here and there. Then there's ""Diane"", the girl who's got an old head on some young shoulders you might say.Even when you've seen this movie over 10 times, you will then start to connect with them in someway or other. The characters are solid, and you never get tired of watching them on screen. One of the best scenes is right at the end, when Renton is walking over the bridge smiling. That just great, for some reason it's hard to put your finger on it. It just gives you a feeling of release now that Renton has become a good person again.This movie is brilliant, probably the best British film of the last decade, for everything, script, scenes, filming, soundtrack (which including really great tunes from the likes of Underworld, Blur, Pulp, Leftfield, Lou Reed and not forgetting the infamous Iggy Pop) and the humour.

"Raw Energy, Rough Edges","Trainspotting is a film that captures raw energy and offers a captivating glimpse into the lives of its troubled characters. The performances are a standout feature, particularly Ewan McGregor, whose portrayal of Renton is both charismatic and compelling. The film's direction and soundtrack complement the high-octane narrative, creating an immersive experience that grips from start to finish.However, while the film is undeniably powerful, it does have its drawbacks. The narrative can be disjointed at times, with some scenes feeling more like a collection of edgy vignettes rather than a cohesive story. The film's gritty and unflinching portrayal of drug addiction might also be off-putting to some, as it can be harsh and unsettling.Overall, Trainspotting is a high-energy film with standout performances and a distinctive style.

It's a thousand different emotions all rolled into one concise package, with a dozen scenes that had me laughing out loud, an equal number of gut punches, a few manic spurts of action, a load of excellent off-the-cuff conversations and one giant, trainwrecked final score. A nonstop, chaotic adventure with a well-rounded cast of characters and a knack for extreme moods, it's occasionally tough to discern the dialog thanks to the abundance of thick Scottish accents.

British Cinema's Smacky-Whacky spotting of Drug Camp. Hilarious yet Classy.,"Trainspotting (1996) :British Cinema's Smacky-Whacky spotting of Drug Camp. Hilarious yet Classy. I love saying such words for a film especially when the film actually has content on upper side. It wouldn't have been satisfying experience if it was only about fun and smack-ing stuff, Trainspotting pulls off both the ingredients successfully. So its a story of drug addict and everyone connected to him such as his friends, girlfriend and family. He tries to quit drugs house and have a stable normal life but can he succeed to overpass his own desire and his friends influence who are firm drug addicts? I won't spoil, you Find it out in the film because there is tasty & crunchy twist over that part in the climax. Basically, it is a plot with less content but what makes it get going is comedy, humour, brutality, realism and uncompromising vision of storyteller. In the runtime of around 92 minutes Trainspotting provides solid entertainment with tight grip and in between throws out some mind boggling dialogues. The one about choice in life is on the Poster, the second one i loved the most goes like this, ""1000 years from now, there will be no guys and no girls, just W-a-nkers. Sounds great to me."" About characters i would say, i liked them all, i mean every single one of them even they are bad, but they are sensible in bad way which is rarely seen. I liked Ewan McGregor too, and his narration is more impressive than acting because he got more to speak as a narrator than an actor. Comedy is brought convincingly through some gaggling life facts, you're gonna love them for sure. The most impressive thing for me was the storytelling which is naturally the most important part of any film. It begins on high note, then introduction of characters is interesting then conflicts make it intriguing and some twisty flavour in climax makes a solid cocktail shake. A Sensitive Topic in Hilarious yet Classy Manners is very rare, believe me and do watch it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A story about changing times and friendship,"Trainspotting is a wonderfully brilliant movie that everyone should see! The story follows a young Mark Renton as he tries to find his place in a world that is ever changing. It is a story ultimately about friendship- with childhood mates (all of whom are classically different), girlfriends, and... of course... drugs. It is a story that almost all can relate to in some way because we have all found ourselves at one point teetering between the two realms of growing up and moving on with that of the comforts of old habits, places and people. It is a brilliant look at the trials of lost souls- how they live in and function in the world- and what it was like to be young and Scottish during a period of dramatic change. From the charming Sick Boy to the shy Mark Renton, the world of Trainspotting provides a character for everybody. Even though Mark is, in a way, an anti-hero, he is charming and captivating enough that can't help but root for him and ultimately fall in love as you watch him and the story unfold on screen.

For my English class,"Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film about the seeming everyday life of the average heroin addict in Edinburgh, Scotland. Based on the book of the same name, written by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting focuses in on Mark Renton, a young man who cyclically drops his heroin habit, and jumps back on. His group of friends, ranging from fellow junkies Sick Boy and Spud to a psychopathic, adrenaline-addicted Begbie, keep him tied to his old habits, whether he wants to be or not.The film is as dark as one would expect the life of a junkie to be. Boyle uses dim lighting in already murky and dirty sets to denote a sense of muck. The soundtrack can only be called relevant, grabbing music from the popular UK artists of the day. The music coordinates with the scenes well, whether it be a thumping house-beat in a nightclub, or an immersive, mid-hallucination psychedelic piece. The dirt and grime in the scenes is almost tangible. Boyle works his characters into a believable world of drug abuse, petty crime, and filth.The film opens with Renton and his friends fleeing from what one can only assume are police officers. Mark Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, narrates over the scene, speaking about why he and his friends choose to commit themselves to drugs, to choose whatever it is they have chosen, over what Renton calls ""life,"" which includes things such as a family, career, and a big television. Renton struggles to answer the question as to ""why?"" throughout the movie, while also struggling with the ins and outs of a junkie's life.

Impressionable young people will be influenced by the character of Renton who is portrayed as cool, amusing, and attractive to women, but is also a drug addict. Addicts are also portrayed as hard, take-what-they-want, and outside normal society, appealing characteristics to disaffected teenagers. The scene where taking heroin is referred to as better than a thousand orgasms or whatever is atrocious. This film is grossly irresponsible and should never have been released.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
A fine portrayal of the lifestyles of drug addicts and its consequences.,"Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is a brave attempt on showing the destructive lifestyles that drug addicts lead and its disturbing consequences on both them and society. What makes this movie different is its fashionable way of unfolding itself which really deviates from conventional film-making. Instead of looking from a viewpoint of a non-addict, it taps into the head of a drug addict and shows the audience the bizarre world of such individual. The disturbing images blended with psychedelic music create such a world effortlessly.The movie which is based upon a popular novel by Irvin Welsh is a about a group of drug addicts played energetically by a gifted cast. ""Renton"" played by Ewan McGregor can be identified as the protagonist, who narrates the story and someone who will have no problem in diving down a filthy toilet in order to recover lost drugs. His fellow drug addicts include ""Spud"" who is seeing as the ideal naive bloke who ""hurts nobody"" but screws everything up; ""Sick Boy"" who brags about theories and philosophies of life, but never follows them; ""Tommy"" who was a newbie for the whole drug routine finds himself taking drugs too many and finally ""Begbie"" who doesn't use drugs but is a screw up who bubbles with rage and cause havoc wherever he goes. They do drugs in an old warehouse, sleep wherever they can and then come up with ways to find money (preferably robbing, which is their only option) to score the next hit of drugs in order to cease the impending effects of heroine. Funnily enough, they even consider quitting and to find them doing even more drugs all over again.This movie is well made with memorable scenes, but it is not without its flaws. It sometimes gets caught up in the situation of dragging itself too much without engaging in something new. However this is not to say that it is dull or dreary, far from it, it is filled with memorable dialogues and performances which makes this a refreshing mind bender to any movie goer.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Even though Sick boy is the antagonist in the film he is by far my favourite in the film, he is funny, witty and a free spirit that does what he likes without a fuss. I give this film 5/5 stars I watch this movie almost every night and every time it gets better and better!!! Danny Boyle has such an incredible mind when it comes to stories like this he is a great director and every film he directs is brilliant!!

Incredible,"After watching this film for the first time on DVD, i watched it again straight away because of its brilliance. Even after repeating watchings, the film loses non of its original fizz and shocks. The audience of this film becomes submerged in the story line, making you feel like one of the gang. Because of this, you follow the emotional highs and lows of the characters on the screen, as they battle their own personal problems face on.The soundtrack to he film perfectly complements the action, as it acts as a guide to the time period the film is set in. The opening memorable scene would not be the same without the music, as shown later on in the film. There are only minor problems such as sometimes the accent is quite hard to understand, but nothing can take away the brilliance of this film. You must see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Alfie for 90's generation.,"This sort of film isn't usually my cup of tea, but like my taste in music, my taste in films is eccletic. There are echos of the Michael Caine film Alfie, Alfie spoke to his generation in the swinging sixties. His ""vice"" was womanising, which led to unpalatable consequences, and possible redemption. Sounds familiar dosen't it? In Trainspotting, Renton speaks to his generation, in the hedonistic 90's.
The closing credits are very similar as well.

Scots' Tissue,"Why was this made? Because someone felt that there was a market for an edgy film. This is edgy, but mostly in cheap ways: scat, death, desperation, loneliness. Lots of character shots of the different dumb ones. So it delivers what it intended.Is that enough? To judge from the IMDB comments, it is also a convincing antidrug film. Is that enough? McGregor is a promising actor but even that is not enough (see him in ""Pillow Book"" if you are looking for REAL edge).Sorry.

No emotional anchor became a nuisance!,"I really liked how cleverly it captures the struggles of an addict, even if it does so in its own unique style. However, I found the tonality and the overall approach to be a bit confusing or rather convoluted.The film kicks off in a really strange way, and it took me a while to get used to the setup. Then, just when I finally started to feel the vibe, and thought it was about to get rid of the comedic bits and will dive into something deeper, something thoughtful, they switched gears again and went back to the dark humor.Not implying that was unwarranted, I just wish there was a better balance between those two contrasting approaches.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie is what it is, a story of low life junkies that shows you every aspect of a low life junkie in grave detail. The acting wasn't poor, but the basic premise is something you can learn from a crap 30 minute health class movie, as in, there's not much of a story line to connect with or care about.

Unforgettable,"So I sat on my watch on the NATO drill, reading Irvine Welsh book. When Renton took the dive into Scotlands most disgusting toilet, - 38 celsius didn't feel so bad in comparison.

It was a perfect adaptation of a book I never imagined someone actually could make sense of. It was the new pop culture, with new, uprising stars. Even the soundtrack was awesome, for a dude who prefer metal. I read somewhere that TS glorified drugs. Oh, really? You wanna take a dive in a toilet? Experience what OD is like?

An All-Time Favourite,"I'll start off by saying that this is my favourite film of all time, so if you're looking for anything other than reasons to watch it, you should probably move on.Though the subject matter of 'Trainspotting' is dark, gritty, and somewhat disgusting, the movie itself is uniquely charming. It's an objective view on drug addiction and the culture which surrounds it, and it still manages to be engaging, intriguing, and often hilarious. There seems to be a lot of criticism that this film simply glorifies the use of heroin, but that's definitely not the message here. The perspective of the viewer allows us to see the effects of the drug, without being ham-fisted in an attempt to dissuade from the use of it.As a film, it's fantastic. Every shot is artful and beautifully arranged, even when the scene involves something like fishing through a public toilet for lost opium suppositories. The acting is also brilliant, with Ewan McGregor and (most notably) Robert Carlyle both giving the performances of their careers, and creating captivating characters in Rents and Begbie.This is only scratching the surface of the successes of 'Trainspotting', though, as the soundtrack, pacing, dialogue, and lighting are all practically flawless. Everything in this film works well together to create a very grimy - yet beautiful - masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent piece of British cinema...,"I first saw this film a few years ago after viewing some other films by the director Danny Boyle and also out of interest from reading the original novel by Irvine Welsh.The novel was well written, darkly funny and shockingly disturbing in places too. The film adaption follows in the same trend.Featuring some of the most notable and talented British actors, the film is portrayed in a very authentic and believable fashion, often with a light comedic influence. It would be hard for me to write about the performances of the various actors cast in the film with out spoilling it for people who are yet too watch it, but the cast do play the film out exceptionally well.Trainspotting is in my opinion Danny Boyle's greatest film, well choreographed, well acted and has a score fitting to the scenes in the film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Enjoyable, if you can handle the content.","Trainspotting is about Mark Renton, proud heroin addict, and his friends. When they're not getting into trouble, they're shooting up or just talking. There's no real story; the movie is more of a look into the lives of these junkies than anything else.One of the main strengths of Trainspotting is that it only shows. It doesn't judge these people or the drug, it simply shows their lives and is careful not to take a side. But it doesn't pull any punches, either, so quite a few people won't want to watch the graphic heroin injections. The movie also goes too far at several points, showing both Renton taking a dump and a dead baby, just to disgust and shock the audience, it seems.It's not an easy movie to sit through because of its graphic nature, but it can be likable as well. Despite obvious reasons to dislike the character, Ewan McGregor's performance as Renton makes him at least a little appealing. His witty and clever narration is very enjoyable, and the best part of the movie. A few chuckles are hidden here and there, and director Danny Boyle makes Trainspotting visually striking, particularly with creative hallucinations and fantasies.But it's also rushed. Renton and his friends are barely established before things go wrong and change, while the third act seems to belong in another movie. As a whole, though, it's a picture that has quite a few things to enjoy, but not everyone will be able to sit through because of its content.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A very well made film,"Movies about drugs are always interesting to me. Being a pretty straight up person I've had little dealings with them in my life, and so find the subject matter quite fascinating. My favourite film to this day is 'Requiem for a Dream'. 'Trainspotting' is quite different to that film in a lot of ways, it's a comedy for one, but it also bears a lot of similarities. In fact almost every drug-based film seems to carry the same message (at least to me) and that is stay the hell away from them.The film works on two levels. Firstly, as a comedy. It is genuinely funny and had me in hysterics in two particular scenes. It is rare for a film to do this to me once, let alone twice. Also it works as a drama. The subject matter is heavy (at times very much so) and a brilliant acting display from the entire cast makes it work perfectly. As someone pointed out, and I tend to agree with, it never really feels like a movie. It feels like you are just a fly on the wall watching some very messed up people go about their lives.A sequel to this film has just come out and I will be very interested to see it. The film has a very open ending, that you would almost never see in cinema anymore, which will make it very interesting to see where things go to in the sequel. 'Trainspotting' is a very good film that hasn't aged badly at all, and in fact would put most modern films to shame with the class it is made with.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Apart from that it oscillated from sickening to bizarre with little or no redeeming qualities. No, it wasn't just because some guy stuck his head in a toilet that made me want to turn this movie off. There were several scenes that just were plain offensive as they were there merely for shock value as in Reservoir Dogs- another disgusting 90s mess.

I appreciate this for what it is... a masterful look at heroin abuse, friendship, and desperation in Scotland in the.late 1980s, during the AIDS outbreak. And while it is darkly amusing at times, it is, at its core, a realistic and depressing look at lives being willfully flushed down the toilet due to drugs and a lack of education and opportunity.It's brilliant and disturbing, upsetting and dazzling, and, like the need for another fix, impossible to resist. All that said, I didn't love it, but I respect every aspect of it, from the writing and Danny Boyle's direction, to the bleak cinematography, to the incredible performances by the actors.

An entertaining look into the experiences of drug addicts.,"As someone who has never done drugs, I have no way to know what the experience of being high on heroin or cocaine is like. Fortunately, I don't have to do these drugs to get an understanding of the sensation. In the early years of film, most movies about drugs were usually cautionary tales (as was the case for Reefer Madness (1936)). By the ""free-loving"" decades of the 1960's and 1970's, drugs were more acceptable but often were seen in a comedic context (a la ""Cheech & Chong"").The societal excess of the 1980's and 1990's beget an epedemic of harder drugs like heroin and cocaine. Consequently, we started to see more films that would glamorize drug use, but would still show the consequences of extended use of these harder drugs. Perhaps the most famous film that fits in this category is the hard-to-watch Requiem for a Dream (2000), which really played up the ""consequences"" part. A few years before this film, though, was Trainspotting (1996).While Trainspotting was less intense than Requiem for a Dream, they both had stunning visuals to help the audience understand the drug experience. Sure, there are similarly horrifying elements of Trainspotting, including the worst toilet in Scotland and a ceiling-crawling baby, but they are mostly cancelled out by the more ""fun"" sequences. At the very least, Trainspotting seems to succeed via its main protagonist Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor, in an early role) putting forth the effort to get clean instead of always succumbing to his heroin addiction. That's not to say the film doesn't glamorize these drugs by adding in the counterpoints of sex and rock and roll, but at least there's an effort to have a bit of a moral at the end.An entertaining look into the experiences of drug addicts, I give Trainspotting 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unforgettable,"Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit.Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi.

Gut-Level Intelligence Meet Really Bad Habits,"Now a quarter century old, ""Trainspotting"" stands as truly bulletproof moviemaking. Floating in an artistically liberated space vaguely shared with ""Pulp Fiction,"" Danny Boyle's master class matches Tarantino's in its spiritedness, violence, and drug-centricity, yet this 1996 dark comedy is also imbued with an eviscerating, street-level British intelligence, resulting in a legendary film with a fingerprint all its own.Its structure is freeing and brilliant. ""Trainspotting"" is narrated by Mark Renton (Ewan MacGregor), a young street urchin and smack addict whose habit hasn't diluted the venom he spits at England, Scotland, and shoot-up partners Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller). Once they find heroin, they look to find more. But despite that unchanging end-goal, these are brilliantly sketched characters exhibiting a criminality and shiftlessness that perversely endears.""Trainspotting"" showcases elite storytelling by counterpointing the dehumanization of addiction with elite and vibrant humor.

Endlessly inventive masterpiece,"Trainspotting is the definitive film when it comes to depicting the highs and more importantly the lows of drug addiction. It's a disgusting, disturbing and harrowing film that also finds the time for some very funny humour. Everything it does is done masterfully as it deliberately goes round in circles to emphasise the spiralling cycle of drug use whilst also capturing the angry aimlessness of 90s youth in a specific location.Thanks to his iconic narration and faultless performance, Ewan McGregor's Renton is the ideal protagonist for this story due to his cheeky nature and desire to get a better life regardless of the consequences. Ewan Bremner is really endearing, Jonny Lee Miller is overconfident, Robert Carlyle is absolutely terrifying, Kevin McKidd is so tragic and Kelly Macdonald is playing the character who is easily the most put together.Few films have as much as energy as Danny Boyle's endlessly inventive direction imbues in this and the same applies to the masterful tonal shifts. That incredible energy is sustained by Willie Cadden's striking lighting, Masahiro Hirakubo's airtight editing and Brian Tufano's electric cinematography.

True, the protagonists in this flick are a motley crew, but even in the depths of despair and degradation hope comes through.  Albeit often in morose ways.  Sick Boy's agony over the babies death for example shows even the most craven usurious junkie has a basic element of human decency.  The heroin scam, while an angst filled undertaking, is an act of hope on their part that can be likened to the hope of degenerate gamblers trying for that big win.

Drug addiction and what it does to the lives of all it touches, including infants, is the overriding theme. At the same time one also feels the horror of day-to-day life for these young men with little faith in themselves and despair at the dead end of their young lives.

Not the cultural touchstone that critics say it is.,"OK, so with all of the kerfuffle about ""T2 Trainspotting"" coming out I thought it was high time (no pun intended) that I watch this film.As it happens, I heard interviews with Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) and Danny Boyle, who directed the film, just prior to writing this review. Both men are engaging interviewees and, had I heard the interviews before seeing the film, I might have had even higher expectations.Sadly, my expectations were not met. There's nothing even remotely attractive to this film. The characters are not in the least sympathetic. We can't really care about their miserable, thieving lives. They are just a pitiful bunch: Renton, Spud, Sick Boy, Tommy and Begbie. Begbie is particularly odious.We don't really learn much about life in post-industrial Edinburgh other than the fact that these sad characters spend their time stealing, shooting heroin and drinking in the pubs. Why are they unemployed? Why is there no work? How did they find themselves in this situation after leaving school? Where do they get the money for heroin, other than from stealing? We never find out.There's a technique that the writer or director (or both) use in an attempt to make these characters likable. They make them well- spoken, using words that we would generally not hear from such low-lifes. This, I assume, is intended to persuade the viewer that they're just like us, but just fallen on hard times. Even better: give one of the characters a quirky interest that he can ramble on about at various points in the film. In this case, James Bond films and Sean Connery. ""Aww, isn't that cute"", we're supposed to think. It's not cute, it's a technique to manipulate the viewer that I despise.I would hope that no one sees this film as representing a generation that came of age in the 1990's because it is not representative.Watch it if you must, but be forewarned: it isn't the cultural touchstone that critics will say it is.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brilliant, dark & Recommended!","This is Danny Boyle's second feature film and I must admit that by the time I'd seen this one I was convinced he was Scottish. Fortunately I know better now. This one's all about drug addiction and the consequences of it. Sounds a drag, but believe me, it's one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see! But more on my thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go cold turkey in the back room while I write the next paragraph).Set, for the main part, in Scotland, this film tells the story of Renton and his friends, Spud, Sick Boy, Tommy and Begbie. It tells of their flirtations with heroin and all that brings. How they rip each other off, ruin each other's relationships, get high, get low, get sick, get off the drug, get back on it again it's all here. Eventually Renton decides to get off it entirely and moves to London, but that is far from the end of it. I'm going to leave it deliberately brief and vague because this is a dish best served without too much prior knowledge my friend.First of all, it's a great script by John Hodge based on the novel by Irvine Welsh; add to that the directorial skill of Danny Boyle and you have a bit of a masterpiece on your hands. There are times where things do get a bit surreal, but I think it all adds to the brilliant execution of this tale. Really great performances all round, particularly from; Ewan McGregor as Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Kevin McKidd as Tommy and Robert Carlyle as the psycho, Begbie.There are scenes in this film that are quite hard to watch but I believe it is all included to show just how real the effects of drug addiction are. There is also a lot of humour in this film which, kind of, plays against the grain in a couple of places, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment too much. Over all, with an iconic soundtrack, some great performances, a tremendous script and some brilliant filmmaking, this one is very, very highly recommended.My score: 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

This film belongs to the first group.A gorgeous cast, or rather a quartet.Music that I listen to all the time.Directing. Well, what can I say. Danny Boyle shot one of the best English films almost at the beginning of his career and can only be compared to it in quality 28 days later.It was a separate pleasure to get the book on which the film was made. But here the story is not about books, so I'll just say that the film adaptation carefully skips unimportant moments for the overall plot and only the original title will not be fully understood if you do not read the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
No holds barred.,"""Trainspotting"" is one of the strongest and best movies of the nineties. The subject deals with skag addicts in the most realistic of ways. Their is feel to this movie that make it look like a documentary. That's probably a reason for people to hate it. The common man these days is just to fueled up on Hollywood and the happy-go-lucky movies and don't want to see the terrible problems that exists in our world. This is indeed a pretty graphic movie but this full on style suits me perfectly.The slick camera work and editing makes ""Trainspotting"" reach a higher level and a solid cast helps it too. Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle are really good and adds dimension and depth to their characters.This movie was a great success in Europe, particularly in UK but was never big in USA. Many critics say that this is because ""Trainspotting"" is glorifying heroin but it's actually pretty obvious that it doesn't. The atmosphere is dark and you can see how the characters suffer when they abuse the drug.""Trainspotting"" is a must see, and you ought to rent it right now.9/10",,Anonymous,Drama
"Well done, but short of its potential...","An excellent creative team, fabulous cast, great story...so what went wrong? A bit of a loaded question, because the film was still fantastic, even though it missed its mark. What went wrong is that the film could never compare to the book...and although I'm probably a bit biased due to an adoration of Irvine Welsh's writing (well...most of it;), the film really screwed a bit up too much to be forgiven. Having the original screenplay, I admit that it was partially due to time constraints...they cut a lot of scenes out that would have improved the film. But there was a lot that just shouldn't have been done.Let's start with Diane. Diane is unforgivable, as she's actually two characters combined into one. In the book Dianne was the high school girl Rents ended up sleeping with, but the girl he ended up with, who wrote to him in London, was another girl completely (Kelly?) And the way he ended up with Dianne was different, she was much less sharp tongued and much more naive, and the whole breakfast and post-breakfast scene was completely different.The second major beef I had was with the ending. In the book Rents stole the money with no qualms and no regrets. He didn't leave a cent for Spud and he didn't plan on giving up the skag and turning clean. He was going to heave off to France and live in a heroin paradise; not working and reverting to drugs.Thirdly, Tommy was much more bitter and dejected; he blamed Renton for his AIDS and was never able to deal with it properly.Finally, the entire reason for the title was dropped. The whole 'Trainspotting' scene has not even a mention in the film, not even a mention of Begbie's father...And then there's Rents' brother, who barely rates a glance in the film...A gripe I have about the film itself, is that some scenes are overdone, even useless. The scene where Renton kicks is horrid; the whole baby crawling across the ceiling/Spud in chains/Tommy as a haggard AIDS victim (though we don't even know he has it at that point) is just too much. And a waste of time. Definitely one scene that could have been sacrifice; or at least they could have found a better way to do it.And a lot of scenes were sloppy...much of the information that is essential to the story is given in passing, or we find out facts after they've been displayed. I think this is because of the shape the original script took, and the cuts seem to have harmed the story in a way that should have been repaired.But all that aside, the film was cast perfectly (Dianne aside, who shouldn't have really been as important to the film as she was, even). Jonny Lee Miller is the absolute perfect Sick Boy, and MacGregor is brilliant as Rents. Ewen Bremner is hilarious as Spud, especially in the job scene (the Renton half of that scene, which is missing from the film, is even more amusing;) and he also makes an appearance in the other Irvine Welsh film, The Acid House, which anyone who liked this film should go out and watch... Top off that cast with Robert Carlyle as an amazing Begbie, and Irvine Welsh himself popping in as Mikey, and we're all set.Overall: The errors and changes in the film don't really ruin it, but fans of the book may be disappointed somewhat. This film doesn't come close to Danny Boyle and John Hodge's previous effort, Shallow Grave, but it's still a fabulous film. Anyone who hasn't read the book will appreciate the film even more, and who could ask for a better cast?? All gripes aside, I still rate this an easy 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Hard-Hitting & Disgustingly Funny,"Disgusting. Disturbing. Funny. Emotional. Riveting. Breathtaking. Just a few words I'd use to describe Trainspotting.I first saw this movie when it was released way back in 1995, and I honestly didn't know what to make of it. After watching it again, almost 20 years later, I've come to the conclusion that it is indeed a true classic.Now, a good few people will think (and will try and tell you) that this movie glamourises drugs & crime. In brutal honesty, though, those people don't know what they are talking about because this movie does anything BUT glamourise that lifestyle. The only thing it ""glamourises"" is the actual supposed high you get from taking these drugs, but that is fleeting because it quickly brings you down to earth with a massive bang. From showing you the squalor that these people live in for the majority of the time, the mishaps that they get into, and what happens to some of them, if this is ""glamourising"" then I'd hate to see what a movie that is against drugs & crime is like.For me this movie tells you one basic message - if you take drugs and live a life of crime then this is what your life will end up being like. The acting and performances are nothing short of fantastic and the actors will make you feel less & less sympathetic (if you have any in the first place) towards any of their characters. Renton - very likable & you always hope that he beats his habit; Spud - again, is likable and you end up feeling sorry for him as he's just one of those lemming-type's of people that follows his ""friends""; Sickboy - just purely selfish and uncaring; Begbie - a really vicious b***ard, always looking for an excuse to fight, and you always hope he get's his comeuppance; Tommy - the sensible one of the bunch (or is he?).This is a really powerful movie, and is not really for the feint of heart as it's pretty disturbing (as well as gross) in a good few scenes. In saying that, though, it most definitely makes for compelling viewing.Definitely recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
1 word.. awesome!!,"I love this film! Why it didn't get a higher rating on IMDb is beyond me :oSThis film ranks among my best of all time, and it isnae likely to drop out of it as long as i can absorb films. The performances given by the main characters were top-notch. The plot, as grim as it may be, does strike a chord with the audience and with the upbeat ending (at least for one individual) makes for excellent viewing. The character of Begbie is my all-round fave, his never-ending search for trouble cracked me up big time!The soundtrack is highly recommended, the songs have been finely chosen and compliment the relevant scenes perfectly!One extra ""goof"" that was never picked up, having been reminded of the incident where some viewers never saw the condom being tossed onto the bed. It might just have been bad lighting, but did any1 notice after the sex scene, when Renton is sitting up on the bed, its faintly visible that he does NOT have the condom on, yet wen he is ushered out of the room, Hey Presto! He now has it on... (if I'm wrong forgive me!)Nevertheless, an outstanding film. Seen it many times on TV and VHS and it never gets boring!

Anti-Slogan Sloganeering,"What today may now be more popularly recognized as the film that launched the career of adolescent Obi-Wan Kenobi to become; was once a touchstone for the neo-punk-rave-hardcore-dance subcultural amalgam of the English-speaking world during the mid 90s. Yet the anti-slogan sloganeering of the film's opening sequence (later reprinted on bedroom and dorm-wall decorative posters, ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a _______""... (spoken with a Scottish accent) (...inverting the Talking Heads' Once in a Lifetime)) marked yet another moment of self-conscious subversion on behalf of the underground; pre-dating and possibly foreshadowing the release of the UK anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba's single ""Tubthumping,"" a year later. Both the film and the song ironically castigate the excesses of hedonistic drug culture and again, both have similarly been championed by the very people against whom their creators railed.Post-Pulp Fiction, the cringe/revolting factor seems to have been ratcheted up a few notches; potential viewers should certainly be ready to be disturbed. Where Trainspotting shined, however, was in its delivery of these disturbances. In contrast to other drug films and the setting for many scenes (run down hotel rooms, decrepit squats, and especially ""the worst bathroom in Scotland""), Trainspotting presents a polished clean image. The stylized gleam is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's cult favorite, A Clockwork Orange (1971). Trainspotting's heightened nasty(vomiting)/immaculate(Donald Judd!) dichotomy would later be used (and even elaborated on) in Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000). As a result, the film looks great, but unfortunately for its inhabitants, it depicts the human condition in only the bleakest terms. Despite this, Trainspotting, is none the less a skillfully constructed feature with definite entertainment value.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A disturbed masterpiece,"Prepare to be shocked, horrified, disgusted, appalled, and entertained all at the same time by this electrifying film. Danny Boyle's sophomore film is, without a doubt, one of his best. It's a darkly comic story of depravity, depression, and heroin. It follows Renton, a young heroin addict who is constantly trying to kick his habit but is only drawn back in every time by his friends and his edgy lifestyle. The film chronicles a multitude of different events that happen in Renton's life in a kind of free form method, all involving sex and drugs. The film doesn't hold itself back on the disgust and shock it so easily elicits, making it incredibly memorable in the most hilariously deranged way possible.From the opening shot of this film we get a nice feel for what is in store for us. We open with Renton and his friends running through town, jumping over cars as Renton narrates about life and normality, setting the stage for the overall motif of this film. Renton observes a normal life and he recognizes it, but he just doesn't see the use in it when he has heroin. After listing off a plethora of ""normal life"" things in his monologue he ends it by saying, ""I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"" And that is how the entire film flows. Renton tries to get rid of the habit but then the allure just draws him back in, each time drawing him in deeper, causing his despondency to grow worse and worse.But Renton isn't the only reason why this film is great. The rest of the characters are fantastic. The supporting cast of this film is incredible and they really drive the story to its greatest heights while Renton keeps it moving so we never get bored. Each character shares the same problems in one way or another and then some are just insane. There's Sick Boy and Spud, Renton's junkie friends who cause more problems than solutions in Renton's life, but he can't escape them. There's Tommy, the clean friend who chooses not to pollute his body with heroin and yet still has problems of his own. Then of course there is Bigbie, played to perfection by Robert Carlyle. Bigbie is the definition of insane. He is a man who will kill you as soon as look at you. He is a violent, angry, and unpredictable man whose every moves make you uncomfortable. All of his scenes are hilarious, yet at the same time so disturbing. He perfectly fits the film's feeling of over-the-top insanity mixed with a harsh biting realistic element that allows you to connect and be fascinated by these characters.Trainspotting is a disturbed masterpiece. It's characters drive the story so powerfully and so electrically. And when you couple that with Danny Boyle's rough and rugged direction and an brilliantly witty script it makes the film that much better. It is hard to comprehend what you are supposed to take away from this film, but by the end you know you obviously took something away because of how strikingly incredible the film is. It's sporadic insanity drills itself into your mind, leaving you with so many scenes that you just can't shake. Trainspotting is brutally hilarious. It is one big oxymoron of greatness and you'll never see anything else quite like it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A sincere philosophication of popular nineties culture.,"First of all, I must say that this is a truly disgustingly biased comment. I really don't want to address those who disliked this film as having read all of Irvine Welsh's novels, novellas, short stories, plays and magazine columns, I do feel a genuine rapport with this genre and just want to recommend any fans of this movie to pick up a copy of either the Trainspotting novel or a copy of Mr Welsh's best novel, Filth. This you will enjoy. Now for a critical analysis of the movie. Initially, Danny Boyle did a fantastic job here, some beautiful shots and a energetic vicious pace. The characters were very believable with notable credit to be given to General Franco Begbie.

Its a brilliant film that shows, for some people, for the first time that Scotland is all hills and lochs and big green monsters called nessie, it shows what were really like, vulnerable, sick, and as weird as anyone else out there.

Classic of its generation,"""Trainspotting"" probably had its merits back then but kind of faded together with its generation. More than a film about drug addiction, it's about another evergreen of modern cinema: the lost youngsters who are unable to blend in with a society they refuse. The themes are treated quite decently here, as cynicism and irony are chosen over sentimentalism and empty moral statements. There is nothing particularly original, intelligent or controversial, but I have to say that, a couple of lapses in taste and poop jokes aside, it's still a mildly fun black comedy with memorable characters and some cool trippy scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

'Choose Life',"'Trainspotting' is a bold and audacious film by British director Danny Boyle which launched the career of then unknown actor Ewan McGregor. The day-to-day struggle of a group pf heroin addicts in Edinburgh could never be told so stylishly and clever, equipped with both big laughs and horrific images. It doesn't judge it's characters and their addictions, just portrays them as what they are: young people without a clue as to what direction they're heading down in life.

Choose Life. Choose Britain's Greatest Ever Film!,"""Trainspotting"" – The knockabout 1996 heroin-addict ensemble piece which put Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor on the map, immortalised Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel and proved a shot in the arm for 1990's British Cinema and it's greatest creation.It is the 1996 British black comedy-drama film which starred Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle, and Kelly Macdonald. A classic which underwent the direction of Danny Boyle, the narration of Ewan McGregor and a screenplay by John Hodge based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh — resulting in an unexpected pop culture phenomenon, defining not only the 90's generation but setting the future tone for British Film Institute as well. It's a film that made British cinema seem exciting again and restored its golden period rather than a fusty factory of period dramas which was ongoing for half a decade. And it became a classic that is still being talked about today, with a sequel finally on the way in less than a month. It is often described as black comedy, but I would liken it more to a drama with a crude, dark sense of humour. Trainspotting is the rare drug addiction-tale to tackle serious material without taking itself too seriously.Although set in Edinburgh, almost all of the film was shot in Glasgow, apart from the opening scenes, which were shot in Edinburgh, and the final scenes which were shot in London. The film showcases the misadventures of mainly five young men in Edinburgh trying to find their way out of joblessness, aimlessness to aimless relationships and relentless drug addiction. Some are successful, while others hopelessly are not. The title, ""Trainspotting"" is a metaphor. The ""Trans- Potters"" are people playing a kind of game is to watch the trains go all day and record their numbers. This game is synonymous with boredom and from all forms of addictive or compulsive activity, so you can make a comparison with the drug. But the metaphor can also represent, as Renton sees trains to take, opportunities to stop the drugs and leave his friends, but he does nothing, except at the end where he took his chance and chose the train (of life). The film's story-line eventually divulges into an epic tale of struggle with both addiction and poverty through the lives of these young drug users or heroin addicts, trying to make their own journeys.Renton, a pro heroin-addict, played by McGregor is the main protagonist. He is also the narrator as the film centres around his life and the scuffles he undergoes with addiction. Although he eventually wants to change his life and quit heroin. But his willpower gets caught in between his junk habit and his never-ending lust for one final shot before he'd quit or can finally quit. He believes: when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. Human relationships and all the other things really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.All the characters in this film, apart from Renton are also well defined and have very specific characteristics. However, they share the same idea: to escape society's rules by taking drugs, each in his own way. They refuse to integrate the universal mode and the consumer society, much more despaired than they are. This aversion is clearly shown by the image of the parents of Renton, leading a sordid life and bouffant of entertainment in their pathetic homes. Mark, Spud and Sick Boy choose drugs to touch the bottom, that is to say, the sense of life.McGregor is more than ably abetted by a superb supporting cast, including Jonny Lee Miller as suave, Byronesque sociopath Sick Boy, Robert Carlyle as snarling, repressed, hard-drinking psychopath Begbie, and Ewen Bremner as the endearingly inept Spud. Their behaviour towards one another is often deplorable, but the film is propelled by an underlying sense of camaraderie. As critic Roger Ebert so astutely observed at the time: ""The reason there is a fierce joy in Trainspotting, despite the appalling things that happen in it, is that it's basically about friends in need.""The actual theme of the film was rather simple. Friends are your companions through bad times and good times as they say but with Renton's situation, these friends are actually an option. Would you take them or not? Being comfortable and at ease with your friends is good as long as we know our limitations because friends can't always prank you on what's on their minds.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"praising paragraphs of the movie's style, actors, and story","Trainspotting is a wonderful movie, and one of my all-time favorites. The use of music, humor, and even the use of color enhance this film and make it a pleasure to the eye as well as the mind.Renton, the main character, guides you through a series of events happening all around him, on account of his life-style and his choices. This character was portrayed very skillfully by actor Ewan McGregor. He really stole my heart in this movie. You can't help but pity him, yet there is an undeniable urge to help and comfort him. Other characters that shone were Sick Boy, played by Jonny Lee Miller, whose main obsession in life, other than the obvious, is Sean Connery and the plethora of Bond movies. This, among some other very funny conversations and situations, is particularly amusing. It took me a few times watching it to realize that it is included in almost every ""Sick Boy conversation"".The use of color in this film, though perhaps subtle, really adds to the overall feel of it. Though it has the potential to be a very drab, gritty film - and the potential to be preachy - the simple use of bright colors gives it a vibrant look and a somewhat upbeat feel. The use of vivid reds, blues, and greens (lighting mainly at Mother Superior's)tends to give it a surreal look.I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. I even got the Collector's Edition DVD, I was very pleased with the bonus features and have yet to watch them all. Another entertaining film with a similar ""feel"", I thought, was Spun.Anyways, those were my opinions and thoughts, hope you enjoyed them.",,Anonymous,Drama
I Can See Why TRAINSPOTTING is a Modern Classic,"I've found that, the more I watch Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING, the more I enjoy it. I'll admit that I wasn't blown away when I first watched it, but I imagine that's because it became a victim of its own hype. Boyle's sophomore directing effort has got a major cult following and I've heard plenty of praise from some of my more film- obsessed friends. I didn't actually see it until a month or so ago and, while I enjoyed it, I wasn't sure why it was such a big deal. So I gave it some time to sink in, then went back and rewatched it again recently and fared a little better. Maybe it was the thick Scottish accents making dialogue difficult to follow at times or the retro nineties vibe, but it didn't sit well originally and a second viewing let me get past all that and enjoy it. TRAINSPOTTING follows some Edinburgh hood-rats living the junkie life and going where it takes them. There's Renton (Ewan McGregor), persistently on the verge of going clean and giving up his hedonist lifestyle; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a schemer and troublemaker with an encyclopedic knowledge of 007; Spud (Ewen Bremner), dopey and loyal to his mates; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), the smart one who seems capable of maintaining a (mostly) mature relationship and knows enough to keep away from the heroin habit his friends have sunken into; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a drunken psychopath who abhors his friends' love for heroin but doesn't mind putting a glass mug through some poor random pub patron's face.Poor Ewan McGregor. The first thought that comes to mind when his name is mentioned is the unfortunate STAR WARS prequels, foregoing the fact that the man obviously has loads more talent. His character, Renton, is the film's closest thing to a protagonist. We follow him from the depths of addiction through the struggle of going clean and trying to lead a normal life. Sure, he makes some stupid choices over the course of the film but you can't help but cheer him on. The kid's got charisma. Most of them do actually, despite being somewhat despicable human beings. I found myself feeling sort of sorry for Spud. He didn't strike me as the sharpest knife in the drawer but he was loyal to a fault. He was the only one in the crew that didn't seem to have an ounce of trouble in him (that wasn't injected intravenously anyway). Begbie's a royal trip. Carlyle is absolutely great, when you can understand him. I needed subtitles at times to get through the thick Scot accent but he was funniest part of the movie. The man's a powder keg and it doesn't take much to light his fuse. Sure, he hates heroin and gives his friends (rightfully) a hard time for their addiction but he's got more than enough flaws himself. He's violent, over-confidant, and possibly compensating for something. Sick Boy's the bad apple in the bunch. He's a man who relishes the junkie life and has little regard for those around him. And, finally, there's Tommy. Tommy doesn't fit well within the rest of the crew, as he seems to have some humanity in him. Tommy's character in the movie seems to exist solely to remind the audience that, as funny as the movie may be at times, heroin addiction is no joke and he serves as an example in his fall from ""normal"" to, well, that'd be a spoiler.TRAINSPOTTING may be a comedy (and a dark one, at that) but it doesn't shy away from its subject matter. Heroin is a plague in the world and it's claiming new victims all the time. The laughs from the crew's heroin-fueled antics are often interrupted with reality checks to serve as a reminder of the consequences. A junkie mother pays the ultimate price for her obsession. Spud serves time after a little harmless shoplifting with his buddies to feed their habit. Renton discovers the full extent of the withdrawal experience. And Tommy, well, just watch the movie if you've never seen it. TRAINSPOTTING is right up there with Darren Aronofsky's REQIUEM FOR A DREAM as a movie that serves to dissuade any fools out there from finding glamour in the life of drug addiction. Despite the laughs, it's an effective PSA about the dangers of heroin abuse.I've seen the movie a few times now and I'm still ready to back for more. I've come to understand why TRAINSPOTTING has got the reputation it does as a ""must-see"" film. It's equal parts fun and cringe inducing. It's a solid character film that established Boyle as a major cinematic talent and led McGregor down the dark path to something far worse than heroin: George Lucas' STAR WARS prequels. Kidding, of course. Heroin sucks.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
well...,"Cinematography and musical score were excellent!However, when it comes to the story, something was missing. I can't quite define it, but I think even though the messed-up life of heroin addiction was shown, the film could've gone further. I expected it to show the really bad consequences of heroin use.Sure, you could argue the film was told from the perspective of someone who enjoyed heroin. But this is a serious topic, and I don't think heroin should be shown in any positive light in films, as it could encourage people to try it. I'm not saying this film was promoting heroin, but I just wish it had shown more of the real consequences and how hard it is to get out of addiction.What I'm trying to say is that it felt unbalanced. The film focused on the day-to-day, dream-like experiences, but not enough on the tough reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Couldn't get through it,"I hated this movie.  I started watching it, I found it annoying and I was not interested in it at all.  Very boring, and being a british movie made it hard to watch. It was so slow, just some guy running around talking about drugs and the problems he has trying to quit. I turned it off before the half way mark, then I watched Fear and Loathing and was happy, Johnny Depp was awesome in it, and it was actually funny.  Trainspotting did well, but I would never see it again.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
I never thought id give a movie a 10,"But this title seems worthy of that number, to me a movie can never be really perfect, that's what makes it special in a sense as well, however this film is beyond that to me. The characters are fun and painfully real, they have their needs,. wants and dislikes and a life philosophy. Even tho we follow the main character, we aren't always rooting for him, he ruins life for everyone around him, and even when he tries to be better he does it still. the story and characters besides, if i were to watch this movie on mute i'd still enjoy my time, because the camerawork and scenes are a pleasure to look at, the film has fun with its visuals where it can, making many very memorable scenes have that extra touch to make them even more memorable. Its packed with scenes that matter, leaving almost no filler, its both fun and depressing at times, but always seems to know when to be which. The Scottish setting and accents added a great feel of authenticity and making it neat and dialogs, although sometimes harder to understand, much more memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant!,"As I watched the first 40 minutes of Trainspotting ... I was disgusted and rightfully so. This movie is dirty, sad and disgusting. It gets to the nitty gritty of drug addiction. Now I cant say whether Heroin addiction is really like that or not but the way it was portrayed truly showed how horrible an addiction like that can be. The camera work in this movie is excellent but the true winning part of the movie comes at the end. The end scene is one of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen in my life. That one scene turns around a primarily sad and dirty movie and makes this movie worth the wait.My advice would be not to give up on this movie halfway or a quarter through. Watch the whole thing! As mentioned before the camera work is excellent and the acting is out of this world. The way that heroin addicts are portrayed in acting is nothing short of extraordinary! Ewan McGregor shows us with his body how his character is struggling with his addiction Overall this movie is a must watch for anybody who can take a dirty and gloomy movie and is ready to wait for the brilliant end!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A childhood Memory and a Realisation of How Good This Film Really Is,"I remember the first time I watched Trainspotting I was only 19 years old I decided to go to watch a film randomly with a friend and had no idea what it was about as my friend suggested we go watch it.From the opening scene to the feel good ending I remember enjoying every second, the same night I went to a nightclub with my then girlfriend and at some point during the night the DJ dropped a track from the film called born slippy the place exploded and discussions about the film started it was quite an experience.Last night the film was being shown on my local TV station again I enjoyed every second even all these years later, a young Ewan McGregor demonstrating a new up and coming talent alongside Jonny Lee Miller who I personally think has not had the best roles over the years but both are enjoyable to watch. I like Robert Carlyle but his character in this film is freighting way to many resemblances to people I used to know.The basics of the story are a set of friends living in Scotland addicted to drugs, the film shows a depressing side to life in a poverty stricken area including some very graphic violence, drug taking all with comedy aspects leading to a final conclusion discovered by one.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perhaps the best British film since Brief Encounter!,"I watched Trainspotting under the recommendation of my dad. He actually bought it for me for my 15th birthday, telling me that he thought it should be shown at schools as anti-drugs education. Now, after several viewings, I believe he was wrong; not about the undeniable quality of the film, but over the idea that it was anti-drugs.More on that later. The film itself is a powerful piece of work, a recipe of equal parts comedy, tragedy and plain disgusting. The director Danny Boyle leaves his mark all over this film; bright colours stand out in an otherwise bleak landscape. The soundtrack is perhaps one of the best compilations ever assembled, tracks such as Born Slippy and Perfect Day in particular. But what perhaps makes these tracks all the more powerful is the incredible editing. Editors often do not get the recognition they deserve, in Trainspotting this has never been more obvious. At the start, when he gets his first hit while he gets knocked down in the football match is fantastic, just one example of an amazing performance from the unsung member of the cast.And a very good cast it is too. No one stands out as a dud, even Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) as Mikey Forrester. Robert Carlyle is at his psychotic best, Jonny Lee Miller debuts as Sick Boy and Ewan McGregor is fantastic, playing the part of Renton to perfection.Back to my dad. Kinda. Trainspotting is most definitely not an anti-drugs film. it throws you in a very personal situation with Renton, without making judgements on the drug use. Of course it shows the terrible effects of a drug addiction, the baby dies, Tommy dies; and yet he openly admits just how good the hit is. We end the film with Renton out of the addiction, without the same scars that we see in a more moralistic, more graphic without being as emotionally affecting, film such as Requiem for a Dream. (which somehow finds itself in the top 60, although thankfully not in the top 50!) Trainspotting is clearly a better film as a result, because it is actually a FILM, with a real story to tell, rather than using heavy-handed scare tactics. Cinema should be about entertaining primarily, and while one way to entertain is intellectually by making you think about the subject matter, this should never overtake the enjoyment of the film for the viewer.The film itself excels in managing to balance dark humour with the weighty subject matter, and still have an uplifting ending, reminiscent stylisticly of A Clockwork Orange, (a film whose influence we see in the club scene a la Milk Bar). It is endlessly watchable, you get something new from it every time you see it. A fantastic film, rather than a replica of the book (equally good), which i would recommend to any film lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Vibrant Portrait of Youth,"Trainspotting is more than just a ""drug"" film; it's about a group of people in their early 20s wasting their lives away on excesses that will one day kill them. Danny Boyle gives the film the same boundless energy the characters live with, and the actors give appropriately energetic performances. Ewan McGregor stands out especially, as he gives his character ore depth the any of the others. The film's style evokes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, though Boyle is not as flashy as either of the aforementioned two, and this film puts more emphasis on the actual story than the style or dialogue. The depiction of drug use in the film is graphic, though it is not distracting or overly gratuitous. I would rank this film among the ranks of Requiem of a Dream and Traffic, as it delivers a strong anti-drug message while maintaining a compelling plot and well-rounded characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Classic,"Instant classic movie, from the soundtrack to the cinematography. It's already a cult flick and quite deservingly so.The film depicts the life of a few Glaswegians with a heroine habit. Pretty serious stuff. With the scenes of the injections to the tragedy in the middle, the topic covered are quite heavy and not something to take lightly. But that is precisely what Danny Boyle and the author Irwin Welsh has done. The art is to take a serious subject and without making it trivial, make the subject approachable and thereby reach out the message.The casting was quite brilliant and from Ewan MacGregor to Robert Carlisle to Johnny Lee Miller; these are real actors.The question is what do you remember after the movie is over. I, for one, remember the humour first and then afterwards, the awful state of affairs.The film does not glamourise drugs or the culture. Those who do either didn't see the movie or thought that Rambo made killing seem good and fun!",,Anonymous,Drama
Fun but not profound,"Well, I don't know.  I was expecting the same kind of profound statements on drug use here that I found in ""Drugstore Cowboy,"" but for me it was more of a fun look at drug culture.  The visual imagery, use of color, and surrealness of the protagonist's hallucinations are superbly done and a joy to watch.  The fecal humor, on the other hand, is not.  Human excrement is about the only thing in the world that really sickens me, and there are two or three scenes in this film that never made me want to take a crap again. I think the film could've evoked that yummy fecal imagery in just as effective a way if it were left to the viewer's visual imagination instead of being thrown in our face (literally), but that's just me... I'm probably just a chicken that can't stand the sight of poop.Personal problems aside, the performances are great, many of the (non-fecal) scenes are incredibly funny, and I like the fact that the film has neither a pro-drug nor anti-drug attitude.  Rather, you get equal parts of both sides, a feel of both how great and horrible it would be to be on heroin.But what made this movie ""fun"" rather than ""profound"" for me was, I think, the fact that I never really got attached to any of the characters--they were all very enjoyable to watch and had interesting and extreme personalities, but they were all portrayed as caricatures rather than as three-dimensional individuals with emotional complexity.  This is partially due to the perspective through which we're watching the film--we see the world through the eyes of a heroin addict named Mark Renton.  He's always referring to his companions as his ""so-called friends,"" meaning that his friendships are ones of pure convenience.  As a result, none of the characters ever have an emotional conversation with one another, or reveal any honest emotional content at all.  The advantage of this was that I was really detached from the characters and had the ability to laugh at their misfortunes, but the downside of it was that I couldn't really relate to any of the characters at all because of it; my lifestyle and outward behavior is completely different from theirs, and I never got a chance to look into their head because they never expressed their thoughts or feelings, so I just couldn't relate.  I suppose that Renton is a possible exception to this, since the film is told through his point of view and we hear all his thoughts.So, I guess my only valid complaint about the film (the poop problem is just a personal ""pet peeve"") is that I can't relate to any of the characters except Renton.  Everything else about the movie makes it really fun, but not too profound or insightful because I just can't perceive most of the characters as human beings.  Maybe that will change on a second viewing, though.  As it is, however, the film is definitely worth watching for its superb visuals, its caricature-like individuals, its humor, and its portrayal of drug culture... Though for me, it's still not as blatantly brilliant and heartfelt a statement about drug use as Gus Van Sant's ""Drugstore Cowboy.""",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Simply brilliant,"The more I think about Trainspotting, the more I consider it as close to perfection as I've seen. I was probably 17 when I watched it, and it captivated me until the very end.It's possibly the only film I've ever watched that has truly shocked me, where my heart has genuinely stopped at certain revelations in the film. It somehow balances the truly dark and gritty nature of its subject matter with a peculiarly upbeat feel.There's a reality about this film and its characters that makes it totally believable. For example, everybody is at least aware of someone as unpleasant as Begbie, and it's uncomfortable to watch his callous behaviour throughout. To me, that's how it should be.It goes without saying that McGregor is fantastic, and Boyle's trademark of a superb soundtrack is as present in this film as any other. It's a classic that, for those of us who never really experienced the drug subculture of that time, is still a fascinating and incredible film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose life or choose heroin?,"1996's ""Trainspotting,"" an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's cult novel about heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a deliriously funny and imaginative ride through the pitfalls of addiction. However, the movie never glorifies addiction; if it did, we wouldn't see the grim aftermath of so many instances that are otherwise avoidable if its characters chose to remain sober.The film wastes no time in establishing that the main characters are addicts, each of them shooting up in a rundown apartment. They are a loose group of fellows, with Renton (Ewan McGregor), violent drunk Begbie (Robert Carlyle), Sean Connery-enthusiast Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the nerd-like Spud (Ewen Bremner), and life-chooser Tommy (Kevin McKidd).What we get for 90 minutes is unrepentant drug use from the leads and the resulting depravity. We watch the funny/grim aftermath of wild sex romps for each of the main characters while some time down the road, we're treated to visions of dead babies and the inevitable overdose or death.But despite all these grim underpinnings, there is a faint glimmer of hope, and that hope rests within our emotional connection to Renton, who knows he has a problem and tries to correct it, despite the influence of his friends.We watch as Renton painfully goes through withdrawal, the horror that he witnesses, and the aforementioned dead baby crawling on the ceiling.""Trainspotting"" is an intricate and funny masterpiece of what it's like to be an addict and on the loose.

Extremely ambitious but hard to watch....,"Trainspotting is a fast-paced, uncomfortable, and very ambitious film about the heroin addiction of Mark Renton.Boyle is a great director and I have thought that of him for some time now. His films 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 Hours' strengths lie on his ability to conjure up real excitement and passion, and it always comes across perfectly. His direction is needed in this fast-paced script. The dialogue is pretty brilliant, and there is a lot of it, so a lot of it may pass over you without even knowing it. However, it's pace allows it to always be entertaining. The film is darkly funny, but it also disturbed me and made me feel uncomfortable in a way, especially in the most brutal scenes.I am noting that this is actually not an actual review, but at at this moment I don't have enough strength in me to write an actual review of the film.

Now this isn't depressing at all they add funny moments mixed in with intensely dark moments. The main character is played by Ewan McGregor and all he is trying to do is kick the stuff but of course it is hard because he is addicted and he has friends who don't want to kick it you know peer pressure. If you can't tell this is a character piece.The characters all have there own problems, one is a psycho path and will fight and attack people for no reason at all. Others are so addicted they will land in jail or just throw away there whole life just to get one more hit. Ewan McGregor is the character you want to see get a normal life and get out of this mess so when you see him make these bad decisions or thrown in bad situations you truly root for him to get out.This is directed by Danny Boyle who has made some great films such as Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours and this one is up there not his best but certainly nothing bad. The film is based on a book so but I never read it so I don't know if it is a accurate adaptation of the book.Overall this is a great movie on the struggles of drugs and wanting a normal life.

Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two.Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary ""anti- hero"", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature.

It's a well acted, well directed story about addicts and why they do it. It's almost a documentary following the lives of some heroin addict friends narrarated by the main character played by Ewan McGregor. His performance alone is worth watching but the movie has its merits too. If you don't understand addicts or their world, this is the movie to see. It paints a realistic and very gloomy portrayal of their lives and worlds. It's not pro-drug or anti-drug. It just tells a story about drugs and their addicts (Trust me, the drugs own the addict and not the other way around).

But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?,"I have not read the novel, though I might consider it. This is one of the best British films made, as well as one of the best about drug use.

Guess what? That approach doesn't work, it doesn't deter, lying in order to scare kids away from things you don't want them messing with costs you credibility and does not, in fact, always prevent them from pursuing whatever you were trying to get them to steer clear of.

It's engaging from start to finish; frankly, I could not take my eyes off it. Even if you've never seen a junkie, you can get into this. It gives you an unforgettable peek at the environment. The characters are well-developed, credible and fully fleshed out. While you may not like them, you can't keep from having a reaction to them; you can't tell yourself ""there's no one like that in the real world"". There is marvelous social commentary and satire in this. This is hilarious, the humor is immensely sharp and well-delivered, almost no joke or gag falls flat, and it does not try too hard. The music is magnificent. Boyle directs this in a stylish(*not* to be confused with ""flashy"") and experimental manner, and every moment of it is treated to excellent camera-work and editing, leading to numerous unique sequences. There is a lot of strong language, a little sex, brief nudity, quite a bit of disturbing content and some violence in this. The DVD comes with a couple of interviews, well worth the time. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to handle it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very good and entertaining drug film,"This is a very good film. Some of the most disgusting scenes I've ever seen in a movie before, like the toilet scene and the baby scene.

Good Movie!,"I don't what made me like this movie so much. It wasn't because it had a strong drug overtone, because it DID have that. Some believe that this should not have been classified as a comedy, but I would classify it as more of a dark comedy.It did show how some choose drugs over rather than choosing life. This especially came to a point when the baby died. The biggest thing was that it didn't make light of any of the horrible situations such as the above mentioned, or the part about Tommy's death.It's a good movie, not one for young kids, but none the less, good!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best British movie ever made.,"This movie is the best artistic and disturbing film ever made. Whenever Franco is on the screen,most likely you'll be concerned about what he's doing more than anyone else. He is an absolute Psycho, but is performed brilliantly by Carlyle. Ewan McGregor definitely makes his mark here, surely this is the film that made him most noticed around the world. But it really is a Carlyle film all the way. If you want to see a film about good characters than this is it. Its one hell of an amazing Masterpiece that will never be matched for its gore images, and its consistent use of the word,c**t. A film that all film critics must see. Don't' miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Class,"The pun was intended (A Class movie and heroin is an A Class drug). Anyway the movie is a very good Scottish production that everyone has to see.  It is one of those movies that everyone has seen.  Abit like Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver.  I have watched Trainspotting many times and each time it gets better.  Whilst the Scottish accent might cause some trouble to those of you who have not lived there for atleast a couple of years, the story was fairly clear to my Australian mates.  I didn't need to do much translation.  I recommend that you go out right now and buy the DVD or video.  It is a must have movie in your collection.  The acting and the plot are very well done.

"If you liked Requiem for a Dream, you're probably going to like this","This movie reminded me of Requiem for a Dream. I'm not implying that one movie copied the other, nor am I implying any negative connotations. Just simply noticing the similarities. It had very interesting depictions and point of views of what one with a drug addiction might encounter. The story, at times, can be very emotional. There were also times where what was going on was creepy or strange, with intentions of making the viewer catch a glimpse of the protagonist's world. A job well done on that as well. The directing, writing, and acting were all exceptional. This movie is an emotional ride-along with the protagonist, which was, to say the least, insightful. Going back to the aforementioned movie, Requiem for a Dream; if you liked that, it's almost guaranteed you're going to like Trainspotting.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Especially the music they used and the way they used it... Brilliant! When one chooses to use songs like 'Perfect day' (Lou Reed as you will all know) or songs by artists like Iggy Pop, one should be very careful not to abuse them. In this movie they used these evergreen's in the way the were meant to be (in my opinion). It also shows that a good movie is made by a great plot and great actors instead of a lot of money.

"One of, if not the best British film ever made...","Looking for something that can make you laugh, cry, cringe and feel a litt bit uncomfortable? sometimes all in the same scene... then look no further.Directed by Danny Boyle, starring an at the time reasonably unknown cast of Ewan Mcgregor, Ewan Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle. Trainspotting is set in the late 1980s in Edinburgh. It follows the day to day life of Mark Renton and his ""friends"" who are all addicted to some kind of substance wether it be heroin, speed or alcohol (if you are not okay with drug use and drugs in general then give this one a miss).With it's low budget feel, electrifying soundtrack and brilliant dialouge this film ticks all the boxes for a proper british cult movie much loved by a generation and generations to come.The storyline may sound poor and quite frankly disturbing but don't let it put you off if you somehow haven't seen this movie before. Because this movie hits you emotionally more than most others, it puts you into the shoes of these characters who in real life you would turn your nose up at as you walked past them on the street. It makes you fall in love with them and gives you a real understanding into the life of a ""junkie"". But ultimately it is about friendship, betrayal and the numerous problems that occur in your life.I must have seen this movie 40 times and I never get bored, I would also recommend reading the book of the same name written by Irvine Welsh, the book believe it or not makes the movie look tame... and that is saying something HA!Have fun watching this classic guys and remember.....

the film is very gritty and realistic but also entertaining.,"the film Trainspotting has been argued by critics to be 'glamourising' drug use and being a bad influence on teenagers, however, being a 16 year old teenager myself, i did not find myself wanting to go out and start taking heroin, in fact, this film made me realise i never want to be involved in drug use. the film shows the taking of drugs as what it really is; dirty, dangerous and illegal. however don't think this film is completely depressing, it is also very comical and entertaining because we sympathise with the main character and laugh and moan at his mistakes as the film progresses. all in all a very good film well worth watching but also a very thought provoking film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

I merely wish to let others know that possibly, in my opinion, the popularity of this film may have been due to a simple ""bandwagon"" effect.And by the way, those that have compared Trainspotting to Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas may not have even seen F&L, as there is nothing connecting the two other than the word ""drugs"".

The best film of the 90's,"This film is a pulls-no-punches tale of a group of friends in Edinburgh circa 1993 trying to kick heroin, find love, and get rich quick. Based on the 1993 Irvine Welsh novel of the same name, this film shows us the world according to Mark Renton, the anti-hero of anti-hero's. Funny, poignant, disturbing, and completely un-sugarcoated, Trainspotting shows us life as it truly is: often depressing, frightening, dangerous, and sadly way too short. Definitely the polar opposite of those 90's ""teen"" films that show life as all beautiful people who, in the end, go on to great things and are always successful. There is no beauty here. Just life at its most raw and ugly state. In other words, IT IS REAL. If you haven't seen this film and have a strong stomach, I highly recommend it. If you haven't read the book... what the hell's wrong with you??? As great as Trainspotting the film is, the book is far better, and paints a clearer picture of the sordid characters who make it all happen. 10/10 stars I have loved this film since i first saw it 7 years ago and continue to read everything Irvine Welsh publishes. The soundtrack is great too!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose a Lust for Life.... Choose a Life Affirming Movie... Choose Trainspotting,"This film is a milestone in the lives of many people. For those of that 'Chemical Generation' as we were dubbed back then, this film had a huge impact in so many ways that current generations will find it hard to understand. This was before the internet boom, we went to stores to buy records and books.This film was a shot in the arm for British culture building on a high with the indie Britpop cultural phenomenon, and this film just slotted in perfectly. It is a story of a group of young hedonistic heroin addicts plus a sociopath, centring around Ewan McGregor's character Renton. All are selfish in their own ways, but in their cul-de-sac, they are trapped in their personal hells, and heroin is their only escape as well as a trap.Unlike the book, which I've read, this film is clearly anti-heroin, but it doesn't force it down your throat like some corny government advice advert. This film shows the grim reality of their world, but also shines the torch to show the humanity and humour too. As a viewer, despite any repulsion, you will actually begin to empathise with some of the characters regardless of whether they are truly loathsome or not to you.The underlying themes are what gives it all gravitas. Do the 'friends' really trust each other, are they really their own enemies? Despite desires to escape the vicious heroin circles, do those attempting to do so actually want to? The film reflects on blue-collar life, perceived hopelessness, depression and fear, but also fantasy, love and hope.These are all themes when you are young and still developing that really come to the fore. This film captures these emotions brilliantly, with an incredible soundtrack that has stayed with me for life. To the average Briton from the 1990's, the soundtrack to this film is as much a stamp on those times as Oasis and Blur.I'm writing this having just watched the sequel, and rewatched the original. The whole film still stands up now, but as I'm older it has still a great power and hold, and different themes come out to me. I'm admittedly a major Trainspotting devotee, having read all the Trainspotting books to date, and just re-read the original after 20 years. It all still holds up brilliantly, and the film still works its magic.For Scots this film has huge resonance, and it is only now after so many years that you can feel the impact that a certain rant in the film by the main character had on the country. It also brought Scottish culture to the fore, which at the time was going through a renaissance with some great writing, film work and music being generated. The influence culturally from this film has been great, and there are many parts of the film that Scots will recognise most keenly.I would heartily recommend this film to anyone, especially teenagers and those in their early 20s. Read the books too, this film got youth back into reading again. Hugely influential.You'll learn a lot, and you'll revisit this film. It will always be in the hearts first and foremost of the 'Chemical Generation' but I hope it will also touch the hearts and minds of following generations too.Give it a go, it will give you a Lust for Life.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Hard to watch, but a film everyone should see","As a recovering addict, I first saw this film while I was detoxing and sick. I would NOT recommend watching this while going thru withdrawals. It does not glamorize drug use, quite the opposite. I related to the characters doing anything they could to get their next fix, and the withdrawal scene was the best I've seen portrayed in any film.There's not much of a plot, just following around an addict and his friends. Watching them commit crimes, get high, and experience highs and lows. I'd recommend this film for everyone, especially younger people that are thinking of getting into drugs. The baby scene is tragic, and some people think unnecessary but I'm sure it happens all the time.FYI used close captioning if you're from anywhere but the UK or you'll miss a lot of the conversation as their accents are very thick.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the great gen x movies,"This movie is well written, smartly directed, and brilliantly acted. Ewan Mc Gregor gives his best performance as Mark Renton, a young Scottish screw up.

Irvine Welsh's vision of the downtrodden youths is uncanny, real and worthwhile. The actors,notably newcomer Kelly McDonald act without overacting. Making the characters engaging and believable.This film became so popular because it can be viewed by many different viewers on many different levels. Some can watch it for the junkie screw up value.

This movie really had a great way of showing what drug addiction is really like and how it can really mess up your life. The soundtrack is also great, Iggy Pop's lust for life is one of my favorite original songs and fitted really well with the opening scene.

"Trainspotting is strong, realistic and highly enjoyable peek into rather grey Mondays in 1980s Scotland","Based on a novel of same name by Irwin Welsh, Trainspotting is a satirical film about a pack of Edinburghians (is that a word?) who have burned all bridges behind them and chosen something completely else. They've chosen heroin.Main character of the plot is Mark ""Rents"" Renton (Ewan McGregor) whose self-observing mentality and lust for life lifts him momentarily away from drug inhabited life. Dramatic, tragic and at times very comic situations ensue while Renton observes his relationship towards friends and family. Not to mention the whole world.The reason for this film being one of my all-time favorites lies simply in characterization. In addition to Renton and plenty of other casting, pack includes narcissistic Begbie (Robert Carlyle), sympathetic Spud (Ewen Bremner) and egomaniac Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller). Director Danny Boyle builds steam from a grain of salt casting this movie. Don't believe it? Check for instance Renton's hallucinations inside men's room toilet, Begbie's outbursts of rage in pub or Sick Boy's obsession to Scottish icon, none else than, Sean Connery.Trainspotting is strong, realistic and highly enjoyable peek into rather grey Mondays in 1980s Scotland where life has its ups under the influence of heroin, alcohol, 'fitba' (soccer) and Iggy Pop gigs.

THIS film,"Despite an offshoot of moral crusaders berating 'Trainspotting' in 1995 for allegedly 'glorifying heroin' there seem to be few who can doubt the greatness of such a cult classic.Yes, it is about a band of horrible, nasty people, but - most importantly - it does NOT glorify any form of drugs. On the contrary, it would recommend that this film is shown to youngsters as a way of showing just how wretched and awful people's lives can be when they're hooked on substance abuse.Ignoring 'Shallow Grave' this could be considered as Ewan McGregor's 'breakthrough' performance and, although he does steal the show in every scene, the whole 'ensemble' cast should not be forgotten - special mention to Robert Carlyle as 'Begbie' who is a truly terrifying on-screen psycho.It's hard to imagine there are too many people who don't like Trainspotting. It's a great British film which catapulted many of those involved into mainstream stardom. Some people say that it's quite bleak and, although the subject matter is pretty dark, the cast handle it with enough wit and charm to have us - sort of - rooting for them (or at least Ewan McGregor's 'anti-hero' - Renton). Yes, it can be a bit dark and disturbing at times, but the real life 'horror' of the 'junkie lifestyle' has to be shown in all its glory if its really going to portray it accurately.So, if you're any way interested in popular culture the Trainspotting perfectly sums up the nineties. Even if you're not, it's one of those films that you really should see before you die - if nothing else then sooner or later you'll find yourself in a situation when all those around you are talking about it and you really don't want to be left out!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very good film that relies on visual style over narrative but delivers an anti-drug message, amongst other things, all the same.","A film like Trainspotting can split your opinion right down the middle; a split more akin to the sort of opinion you might take away from a horror film. This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.Trainspotting is one of those films. Like I mentioned, horror films usually have this effect. An example could be Wolf Creek or Hostel; two films that gave me a distinct feeling of unpleasantness but some other recent horror films, such as The Descent or Miike's One Missed Call can leave me without any feeling at all as they meander along to their inevitable conclusions; throwing in plenty of blood-soaked action or dull jumps along the way. Are Wolf Creek and Hostel 'better' than these two because I had more of a reaction to them? Or are The Descent and One Missed Call 'better' because they didn't gross me out.Trainspotting isn't a horror film, but it borders on being a horrible film and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film is so vile and disgusting in its visuals and establishing of certain situations (one in a public toilet springs to mind) that you just can't help but admire what they've done effect-wise but feel a little uneasy all the same. It's this emotional juxtaposition that director Danny Boyle pulls off here and I think it's this that makes Trainspotting the film it is, especially given the fact it is not particularly plot driven. Obviously you hear and take in a lot of what's already been said about a film as well known as Trainspotting and a film as 'accepted' as Trainspotting but it's more than a mere flavour of the month for a certain generation.At the time when this was made, the British crime genre (and later the gangster genre) could be seen as genres in a state of transition. Two years previously, with Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Shopping', there was a film that revolved around Britain's youth as they get up to youth orientated activities to do with crime. Then came Boyle's own Shallow Grave before this, a story about lowlifes doing low brow things always connected to crime. But it isn't the demonising of ram raiding and joyriding as seen in Shopping that is being studied here, more so the frequent use of the class A drug heroin. The film revolves around Renton (McGregor) and his cronies, all of whom are introduced somewhat perfectly at the very beginning echoing a tactic the godfather of British crime films Brighton Rock used at the very beginning of that film and something Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch.' would later re-use.Trainspotting is told from a second person point of view, that is the narrator is involved in the events he is telling us of. It's easy to miss but Renton actually comes off heroin on two occasions, from memory, in this film with the final time adding to the film's overall final twist. As an anti-hero, Renton fits the bill quite well. Whilst utterly despicable in his casualness at talking about and taking heroin, scenes that will no doubt have you winching if needles are not your bag, he sort of redeems himself when he talks about wanting to come off it and is put across as a social person who does seem to have certain hobbies and interests outside of being a junkie; namely talking about actors, films and Academy Awards.As with all youth orientated films, youth orientated activity plays a big role. Since the principal study here is the damning of heroin, secondary studies like casual sex and the over consumption of alcohol can be wrapped up in double quick time and take nothing away from the film. In fact the film can deliver these moral messages in more ways than one and actually turn them into entertaining scenes without ever feeling like a lecture or lesson. The scene where Renton tries to pick up a young girl at a club only to find out she was underage is one demonisation; Begbie's (Carlyle) incident with a cross dresser in an ever changing world he is in ignorance of is another incident and on another occasion a character and his partner wish to watch a previously recorded sex session as they commit the act once again; only the guy accidentally lent the tape to someone else thinking it was another video. Panic ensures when they assume it to be back at the video rental store.So while Trainspotting is a thrill ride that conflicts pleasantries with your filmic mind and that lust for a good, effective film; it holds up. There is a switch between realism (in general) and surrealism when he ventures down a toilet to find drugs and comes home wet to the eerie 'rehab-at-home' scene in which an apparent ghost of a previously dead baby climbs the walls and terrorises our hero as his friends and family slip in and out of the bed with him. Trainspotting is fast, furious and unrelenting in its content that can be funny; suspenseful; quite scary and downright disgusting  it's one of those film viewing experiences you don't forget in a hurry.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Choose Trainspotting....,"The novel from which Trainspotting was adapted is one of the most exhilarating reads I have ever had. Savage, hilarious, disgusting, authentic and wise, Irvine Welsh's book was almost a cultural phenomenon in itself back in the day. It didn't seem like the kind of novel that could be transferred to the screen though seeing as its fragmented narrative was essentially a collection of short stories, albeit interconnected ones. We needn't have worried though as the film version of Trainspotting was a dynamic instant classic and one of the best British films for years.The story is about the goings on surrounding a group of Edinburgh youths. Most of them exist in the heroin scene which was deeply prevalent in the city back in the 1980's. In might seem hard to believe now but back in those days Edinburgh was known as the Aids Capital of Europe as a result of the problems caused by the widespread heroin use. So the book Trainspotting evolved from a very real place. Where the novel itself is very much no-holds barred in its approach, the film most certainly presents events in a far more palatable light, although it does retain the spirit and the humour. Nevertheless, the film version is hardly a tame film itself; there are a number of pretty heavy scenes and it can be very uncompromising.Director Danny Boyle and screen-writer John Hodge have to be given enormous credit for the success of this feature. Where Hodge selected material from Welsh's terrific prose exceptionally skilfully, Boyle then tied it altogether in a fast-paced movie that he has ensured has a real inertia from start to finish. Happily the film-making approach taken isn't the sadly predictable one all too often taken by British film-makers: gritty social-realism. No, Trainspotting takes an altogether more stylized approach and one that uses the cinematic medium a lot more interestingly, and it's all the better for it. The acting is universally exceptional, with particular stand-out turns from Ewan Macgregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle. It looks terrific too, and the soundtrack perfectly captures the mood with its clever selection of songs from the likes of Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Underworld.This surely is a must see movie and one I really can only highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Terribly overrated, juvenile","Boyle directs this in his usual teenage-style of fast cuts, cool music, and with little real empathy for his characters.

Was there any need for it? Does anyone want to look at human feces on screen?Boyle is not a good director, despite the hype.

From the high-octane, masterful start to emotional ending, this film has to rate as one of the all-time top 20 great films in my honest opinion.  You really do feel for the characters and can sympaphise with their not exactly ordinary, drug-fuelled lives.  In short, a great film mixed with dark humour, sick jokes (who will ever forget the excrement in the bed sheets scene...) and excellent story-telling.

Sick boy strays away with his formal ware, but he still looks killer. Not only does this move have great tunes and slamming outfits it actually has a decent plot and great acting. The story is about misfit junkies creating ruckus around Edinburgh and doing anything they can to pay for they drugs and then having small bursts of trying to get clean. All the characters work well to create a smorgasbord of crazy enjoyable characters. This movie really takes boys will be boys to the extreme.

The Agony and the Ecstasy,Trainspotting is a quintessentially British film filled with thick Scottish accents and dark wit. It is highly stylized and brims with color and manic energy. It is appropriately dark at times and vibrant at others. The balance is always right.This was most people's introduction to Ewan McGregor and he is terrific as Renton. His speech about why Scotland is shite is a classic. No role he has played since has given him as good an opportunity to show off his acting chops.Ewen Bremner is hysterical as Spud. How come this guy doesn't get more work? Robert Carlyle is intense and fabulous as always.Trainspotting doesn't beat you over the head with an anti drug message. Perhaps it is more honest than most drug films because it explores the pleasurable side of drug taking. But the negative effects are clearly shown too and each character must decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. The ending is somewhat ambiguous and the film is all the better for that.,,Anonymous,Drama

Still one of the most important films to come out of Britain,"Has Britain ever produced a film so influential on pop culture? Whether it be the stylish posters, portraying it's various colourful characters in a manner of poses, decorated with that eye-catching use of orange and white, the use of title cards at the beginning of the film introducing us to the various junkies, thugs and pushers who inhabit the film, or that memorable soundtrack, which tapped into the underground rave culture of the 1990's, Trainspotting was the most iconic film since 1994's Pulp Fiction. But, an alarming 18 years on, does Trainspotting still maintain it's raw power and grimy hipness? The answer is yes, with a touch of no.Most of the controversy surrounding the film at the time was it's unflinching, and some would say glamorous, portrayal of heroin addiction. The opening 15 minutes is a relentless, highly energetic introduction to the Edinburgh drug scene, where addict Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) informs us of the delights of heroin, a life choice for the characters in the film as opposed to the 2 point 4 children suburban life we're all meant to be striving for, where washing machines, dental insurance, and electric tin openers are necessities. Why does he prefer to spend time shooting drugs with a bunch of low-lives, sat in the squalor of a drug dealer's house? Who needs reasons when you've got heroin, Renton tells us.But the style doesn't eclipse the substance. Director Danny Boyle, making his second film after the excellent Shallow Grave (1994), is wise enough to keep focus. Renton's life is fascinating and sometimes exciting to watch, but it doesn't make us want to move to a council estate in Edinburgh and spend time with these types of people. Renton's closest 'friends' include pimp Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), an expert in James Bond trivia; the speed-addled Spud (Ewen Bremner); the clean-cut, weight-lifting Tommy (Kevin McKidd); and the sovereign-wearing, utterly terrifying psychopath Begbie (Robert Carlyle). And with heroin, comes destruction. Boyle shows us an overdose beautifully scored to Lou Reed's 'Beautiful Day', and a truly ugly cold turkey scene.But the film has becomes a victim of it's own stylish choices. Back in 1996, Trainspotting felt fresh, exciting, and slightly dangerous, but it's been ripped-off so many times in such a lazy and poor fashion that it has become slightly dated. Just three years ago, another Irvine Welsh adaptation, Ecstacy, adopted the same poster layout as this. Don't get me wrong, Trainspotting is still an excellent film, it has just lost some of it's youthful vigour and confrontational attitude that served it so well almost two decades ago. McGregor is excellent: a charming, charismatic, yet often repulsive narrator akin to Malcolm McDowell's Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange (1971), and his mug will no doubt decorate the walls of many a student house for years to come.

This film really kick-started the career of Danny Boyle onto the international stage with a good combination of talented actors, cool music, amazing script and imaginative film editing.I was totally blown away by the film. The narration by Mark Renton, played by Ewen McGregor, throughout the film brings a depth to the film, which is balanced by the antics of the Mark's friends, who are a larger than life group of drug takers and deviants. The 'Choose Life' speech at the start of the film is one example of interesting social commentary narrated over scenes of drug taking, thieving, football and fighting.Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner, Kevin McKidd, and Kelly McDonald provide the main supporting roles. There seems to be a good camaraderie amongst this group of mates that makes for a dynamic film, which is just as well because there isn't much of a story, just a tale about friendships and how to break free from the past to make a brighter future for yourself.Not sure why 'Trainspotting' - trains really have no part in this film at all except as background objects.

Choose Life,"Trainspotting is a visceral and unflinching masterpiece. Directed by Danny Boyle and released in 1996, this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's cult novel is a darkly comic yet harrowing exploration of addiction, friendship, and the struggle for redemption. It remains one of the most iconic films of its era and a defining moment in British cinema.Set in Edinburgh, the story follows Mark Renton, played with raw intensity by Ewan McGregor, as he attempts to break free from the destructive cycle of heroin addiction and the toxic influence of his friends. McGregor delivers a career-defining performance, portraying Renton's wit, despair, and yearning for change with unflinching honesty. His narration provides biting social commentary, adding depth and dark humour to the film's bleak subject matter.The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Robert Carlyle is both terrifying and magnetic as Begbie, a violent and volatile presence who looms large over the group. Jonny Lee Miller shines as the suave yet morally bankrupt Sick Boy, while Ewen Bremner's portrayal of Spud brings both tragic innocence and comedic levity to the narrative. Kelly Macdonald, in her film debut as Diane, is captivating, offering a sharp counterpoint to the chaos surrounding Renton.Danny Boyle's direction is nothing short of electrifying. The film seamlessly blends surreal, nightmarish visuals with gritty realism, creating moments that are as shocking as they are unforgettable. Iconic sequences, such as Renton's withdrawal-induced hallucinations and the plunge into ""the worst toilet in Scotland,"" are masterclasses in cinematic storytelling, combining visceral imagery with a darkly humorous edge. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography captures both the grim realities of addiction and the raw beauty of Edinburgh's streets, enhancing the film's immersive atmosphere.The soundtrack is an integral part of the film's identity, featuring an eclectic mix of tracks from artists like Iggy Pop, Underworld, and Blur. Each song is perfectly placed, amplifying the film's energy and emotional weight while cementing its status as a cultural touchstone of the 1990s.Despite its dark subject matter, Trainspotting finds moments of humanity, humour, and hope, balancing its raw depiction of addiction with a deep exploration of friendship, self-destruction, and the possibility of change. The film's ability to address such challenging themes with style, wit, and unrelenting honesty makes it a timeless work of art.In conclusion, Trainspotting is a bold, unforgettable film that tackles the complexities of addiction and the search for redemption with unparalleled energy and creativity. Its exceptional performances, striking visuals, and iconic soundtrack ensure its place as a landmark in cinema, offering a gripping and thought-provoking experience that resonates long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Choose this movie,"I'm not sure if Danny Boyle, John Hodge, and Andrew MacDonald can make a movie again that has the perfect balance of sick humor, surreal imagery, grunge, drama and truth like TRAINSPOTTING again. From the likes of A LIFE LESS ORDINARY, it's a tough call.It doesn't matter if you can't get through the thick Scottish accents, you get the main idea as the film, based on the Irvine Welsh novel, goes up and down the downward spiral (like a toilet bowl?).I don't consider this a pro- or anti- drug movie. It just shows the reasons behind and consequences of heroin abuse, and that is that. Ewan McGregor is such a charming presence here, even as he goes through danky Scotland, stealing money for drugs or drugs from the hospital to trade in for money to get more drugs. Heroin is, it seems, a delictable favorite. But only because the high is so extraordinary, you don't want to come down, so you go back and forth. Addicted to it.McGregor's Renton is the flawed hero of the movie who can't get off the smack habit no matter how PAINFULLY hard he tries. He's in great company of lowlifes. The equally charismatic Johnny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, a suave James Bond fan who puts money over his friends any time. Robert Carlyle as Begbie, a beer-swilling hothead who gets high on violence rather than heroin (he's an echo of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). Ewen Bremner as Spud, the nerdy follower who is the most luckless of the clan. Kevin McKidd as Tommy, the clean jock-type who strange enough hangs with this group of misfits even though he doesn't do drugs. Kelly MacDonald (in her first movie role) as a temptress schoolgirl who falls for Renton and is as smart as she is unusually mature.Danny Boyle gives us some very funny and psychedelic moments in this cult fave, all under thumping beats of techno and new wave British pop music. But at the same time he raises some poignant thoughts. Renton tells us to choose life, a job, a big television, washing machines, a big couch to sit on and watch mindnumbing, spirit-crushing game shows. That might not be as satisfying of a life as you wished you had, but it's much better than being forced into slavery with a needle in your arm.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I guess my definition of funny isn't watching people injecting heroin, babies dying of neglect and people crapping themselves. You'll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film. While director Danny Boyle did a good job of making it all seem realistic, the film was so repellent that I can't understand its popular appeal. And now that I finished watching it, I am thinking twice about my crazy notion of seeing all 250. Gross and unappealing.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
give this film a chance,"I first saw this movie in the theaters on a first date.  The girl was pretty cool, I had fun---we both liked the movie.  Since then Ive seen it a couple more times, and Ill have to say that due to the heavy Scottish accent the more I watched it the more I picked up.  As for hearing about what friends say about it---it seems most dont like it,  for reasons of ""I cant understand what they are saying"" to ""I just cant get by its rawness"". Anyway, everyone is different, but I have to say, if you like movies then give it a chance. See it through, try to take a meaning out of it, and then judge it.  The movie does have a strong purpose: 'you make choices in life, and then you live with them'.  Everyone can relate to that.",,Anonymous,Drama
How did I love this movie? Let me count the ways..........,"WOW!!!!! The last movie I saw that came anywhere near captivating me as much as this one did was ""A Clockwork Orange."" This movie is absolutely wondrous: beautiful, stylish, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, hilarious, obscene, terrifying, arousing, and extremely quotable. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. This was the star-maker for Ewan McGregor, and very deservingly so. He's nothing short of splendid. It is a rare actor who can do with this role what he did. He is truly unforgettable. All of the other characters were wonderfully developed, with all concerned doing a marvelous job. The editing, direction, sets, etc. were all fabulous. Begbie's creeping menace was scarier than hell! Sick Boy was poignant, funny, and devious all at the same time. Diane was likable because she's a teenage girl who knows what she wants- a rarity in movies. I've never been so close to puking while still laughing as I was during the Spud-in-his-girlfriend's-kitchen scene. My roommate cried her eyes out at baby Dawn's unhappy fate. That's about it: we laughed, we cried, we hurled. A movie quite beyond compare, and one that I suggest to anyone wanting to see what a true tour-de-force looks like.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It seems that Danny Boyle may have eclipsed his career with this film, not to say I do not entirely anticipate every film he touches.  The story is unbelievable, encompassing not only the story of Mark Renton's (Ewan McGregor) personal change in life, but also the story of the changing world, the changing music, and the struggle to grow beyond your friends, who in Begbie's case, are a complete drag on his life.  The dialogue is entrancing, even when it borders on incoherent.  A funny, intelligent and empowering film!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's very good but where were the trains?,"The only criticism that can be levelled against ""Trainspotting"" is that there is only 1 train in it. I'm sure that there's a good reason why the film has this title despite its low train count but I'm too thick to ""get"" it.I can only imagine what real trainspotters (that shrinking group of anoraks huddled at the end of railway station platforms with their timetables and cameras) make of a movie like this. They probably sit there in gleeful anticipation of a 2 hour-long treatise on the joys of sighting a Deltic in the sidings at Runcorn, then their faces drop as they realise they're watching a film about drugs.Yes, ""Trainspotting"" is most definitely about drugs. Not only that, but about people who really enjoy taking drugs. The film's triumph is that it makes you sympathise with most of these thieving, scamming skag-heads.Ewan MacGregor had already impressed us in another Danny Boyle film (""Shallow Grave"") but his performance in ""Trainspotting"" as Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton marked him out as a true movie star. No less impressive is Robert Carlyle as the psychopathic Begbie, and the whole cast never falls below the level of ""Bloody Good"" in the acting stakes. Even variable turns like Johhny ""Sulky Pants"" Lee Miller and Kevin ""Carboard"" McKidd put in credible performances in their supporting roles. Ewen Bremner's Spud is a stand-out character and this fine Welsh actor fills the screen in every scene where he's given space to do so. Even non-acting novelist Irvine Welsh turns in a good cameo as opium suppository peddler Mikey Forrester.Comic, tragic, shocking, surreal, violent and pathetic (mostly all at the same time), ""Trainspotting"" is unique. Nobody had managed to tell a story about drug taking in quite this way before, and plenty of people have fallen flat on their faces trying to borrow from its success since its release. 10 years on, I can still quote a huge chunk of Renton's ""Choose Life"" opening monologue. Me and a lot of other people, I expect. I've never been into hard drugs, but ""Trainspotting"" gives me the feeling that I know more about heroin addiction and its effects than I really ought to.Shame about the lack of trains, though.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Trainspotting,"I've read most of the other comments and am not really surprised to see that most of them are complaining about the Scottish accents being 'too thick'. Hmmmmm. Well, it is set in Edinburgh. Maybe i'm biased (most likely) because i'm not only Scottish but from Edinburgh, but i think that a lot of Americans who watch this can be a bit lazy trying to understand accents that don't sound exactly like their own. They immediately say ""i can't understand that"". I've lived in the States for 8 months now and it does get frustrating when i know i'm speaking perfectly clear English and i get met with furrowed brows and odd looks as if i'm speaking in a foreign language.

"Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs. Who needs em'?","Trainspotting is a laid back drama about a man named Renton, who is deeply involved with drugs and tries to clean his act by staying away from it for as long as he can. For him it is hard, since he cannot stay three feet away from it and his friends have a big impact on it, which he cannot stay away from either. This is the third Danny Boyle film I have seen and the last I've seen of his for a long time. Trainspotting is funny on most counts such as the bb gun shot to the dog who attacks its owner and the toilet scene. The characters in the movie were good and this movie shot up McGregor's career a bunch, which lead to The Phantom Menace for him. I knew this film was about drugs, but most drug scenes were quite disturbing and let off a complete distraction which reminded me of Requiem of a Dream in some ways. Most of these scenes pretty much explain why you should not take drugs. Anyways, the soundtrack was good and the cinematography was perfect as well. With a couple flaws here and there, overall, it was a good film with entertainment spread all around it. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland.Despite all that, it is a tale of ultimate hope, as Ewan McGregor spouts 'choose life' even through the midst of it all, and with the gags aside, this is great hard hitting stuff from Danny Boyle, who's kinetic and steady filmmaking never lets up for the entirety of the runtime.Performance wise the entire cast is solid, especially McGregor himself who looks the part and ties it all together with Boyle.

This movie uses a lot of music and camera scenes to set the tone and pace of the story. The story is straight forward, not complicated, but yet realistic and sincere. Young Renten is stuck in a life he really doesn't want or enjoy, but he has no other alternatives until, finally, through a series of disasters, he is forced escape to London, where he begins to change his views...on life, drugs, his friends, and what paths he will end up taking.

The duality of life,"Life is a hard business. On one hand most of us enjoy the beautiful aspects of life such as friends, lovemaking and fulfilling a purpose. Turn that around and you find your friends holding you back, your spouse screwing you over and yourself stuck in a meaningless spiral of despair. Trainspotting shows us this duality by introducing us to the crime, drug and sex- induced life of Mark Renton. Mark is a heroin addict who wants to quit but keeps getting dragged back into the life he wants to leave behind. On the surface we the viewer are thinking he could just quit and get on with it, but what seems to be an easy choice on the surface usually is more layered and harder to make as Mark shows us in this great film.While being a truly hard to watch hard hitting film, the way director Danny Boyle shows us the duality of life is a joy to watch. From diving in «the worst toilet in Scotland» to taking in the beautiful city of London in full parade is truly astounding to watch. The way in which director Danny Boyle uses music to express the highs and lows of the film is great, and the crescendo with underworlds «Born Slippy» at the end is the icing on the cake.While the film has been criticized for promoting drug-usage this could be no further from the truth of the matter. While this film certainly shows us that taking heroin is short- term pleasure, it doesn't come without a grim outcome after the short-lived enjoyment. As mark says in the beginning and in the end of the film: «Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fu**ing big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers» It all beats being stuck in a spiral of despair in some deep hole taking Heroin.My rating: 85/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Funny, sick and informative at the same time","This is a great anti-drug movie.  Once you get into the movie it is a funny, yet very gritty view of the drug scene in Scotland.Throughout the movie there are many hilarious moments, and there are also some quite horrific scenes.It is designed, I think at least, to discourage people from joining in with the rapidly increasing drug scene in Scotland, and because of this it includes many harrowing images that would discourage anyone from even looking into it.  The view of withdrawal symptoms from heroine, its effects in essentially ruining a ""junkie""'s life, and showing the effects on an overdose, really do provide a grim view of drug use.Although it has these disturbing scenes, it is interlaced with some extremely funny scenes, good screenplay and a great soundtrack.The characterisation of the movie is also great.  By the end of the movie you will feel pleased for Renton, sympathy and affection for Spud, and you will be quite worried that there can be people like Frances Bigby around Scotland.Finally, this movie will definitely discourage you from using an Edinburgh pub's toilet if you have an American accent.Watch this, either for the comedy, the insight into the Scottish  drug scene, or to discourage someone from using drugs.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Seriously Good,"This film along with Requiem For a Dream was quite controversial due to the subject matter. Anybody that likes Rom Com films or other eye candy would be best advised to steer clear of this. For people who want a serious insight into the world of drugs then this is a very good movie. Whilst some people would argue that it glorifies drugs, I would argue that it does the opposite. At times the film is funny, at times depressing, at times optimistic, but at all time engaging.This is McGregor's finest hour to date at Renton and oh what a shame he couldn't instill the same amount of energy into his Star Wars role.

"Relevant and still current, ""Trainspotting"" could easily take place nowadays, since the doubts, difficulties and expectations on top of the young man's head","Danny Boyle is certainly one of those directors' worth watching closely. With a very varied filmography, ranging from the zombie apocalypse to biopics, as is the case of the recent Steve Jobs, the director always seeks to keep the focus on the psychology of his characters and, in the process, ends up highlighting the talent of countless actors still rising. Trainspotting - Without Limits is no exception, and plunges us into the world of drugs in such a disconcerting way as Requiem for a Dream, which would be released four years later. The production became a cult and, later, a young classic, being celebrated for its dynamic language, for the authentic and stylized way in which it portrayed junkie culture and, of course, for helping to introduce the world to actors like Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle.The plot revolves around Renton (Ewan McGregor), a young Scottish man who from an early age surrendered to heroin addiction. Similar to the aforementioned film by Aronofsky, the story already begins with this state of character established. The curious thing is that, even so, what we see is the peak of this phase of his life. As everything goes downhill, the protagonist is forced to fight the substance, even if with great reluctance. We can say that the work is, therefore, an alert of how difficult it can be to give up this habit and how the person is always pulled back by the drug. But limiting Trainspotting to just that would be a mistake, since, more than a feature that seeks to present a moral, it translates as a true sensory experience.There is a touch of rebellion in the off-screen narration that soon introduces us to the central characters of the work. From an early age, we understood Renton's need to escape the sameness, this system so cliché that it takes away any hope of individuality. We understand that he seeks to feel life and not just go through it with his personality erased and surrendered to the day-to-day routine. With that, we already feel an immediate proximity to the protagonist, while the narrative structure follows the mold of ""Os Bons Companheiros"", for example, which first shows us the attractions of that life, and then deconstructs them. This voice works together with the diegetic elements to build the scene, it does not seek to explain something that is already shown. Through it we understand what goes on in the young man's head, great merit for the script adapted by John Hodge, who deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work. McGregor still manages, in his voice, to convey a great deal of feelings that perfectly match what we are watching, as if his mind was actually being transcribed by audio.The opening monologue, when Renton (Ewan McGregor) talks about the ""life choices"" he has chosen to give up in order to be a ""free"" heroin addict, displays an obvious contradiction in one of the most addictive drugs being responsible. For freeing someone. But it contains another contradiction, it is less evident: the freedom of those who ""choose life"" is nothing more than an illusion. So, if Renton is a heroin addict, wouldn't the rest of society be addicted to a predictable life? Which addiction is worse?When Renton decides to give up heroin (he does that a lot), he talks to drug dealer ""Mother Superior"" (Peter Mullan), who makes light of it. Notice that, despite both being exposed to the same light source, only Renton is red. This color is a symbol of virility and power. This rash decision was made during a heroin ""crash"", and this red indicates how much he is influenced by the drug. But not Mother: he is not an addict, he just sells. For him, heroin is not fun, but work. It doesn't affect you.The narratives in Trainspotting hide their dramatic weight in a caricatured representation. Tommy's disgrace, brought on by Renton for absolutely no reason; Spug's total lack of control due to his addiction; the psychopathy of Begbie (Robert Carlyle), the only one who does not use heroin; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), who has lost some of his humanity in a traumatic event. Not just a critique of society, Trainspotting is a character story. Its conclusion, like the introduction, is purposefully paradoxical and contradictory. The evil that is done to make good possible, but that is not done by anyone with noble intentions.The protagonist lived by Ewan McGregor is also the narrator of the story. User addicted to heroin, Mark Renton begins the narrative already questioning himself for his actions, which keeps him on his feet and decides to drop the drug, entering a process of detoxification and rehabilitation. Hence the story follows. The intensity of the scenes that show his reality and that of his friends impacts the viewer both in eschatologies and in the pain passed on and experienced by young people. Even at the time of its release, the film was well criticized by some political fronts for saying it contained an apology for the consumption of narcotics.In a way, even if there are no direct similarities, it is possible to identify with the characters, especially with Renton. His dissatisfaction, contempt and mockery for routine justifies not only his habits, but also those of Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), Begbie (Robert Carlyle) and Diane (Kelly Macdonald). In a world where opportunities only appear to those who follow an aesthetic, ideological and non-questioning standard, criticism of the capitalist system is presented in the incessant monotony of suits, ties and job interviews. As the story basically revolves around him, Rents shows us all the alternatives he sees as possibilities: what would be his entertainment, which presents itself as monotonous as the job/house/home/job life he tries to follow, the flirtation with illegality even knowing the consequences and inertia.The ironic, tragicomic tone of the narrative and its soundtrack, characteristic of the nineties with the ""new wave"", sometimes seems to mask how frustrating and exhausting it all is. The, shall we say, mild line that the story takes throughout the film reveals the intensity with which the heroine remains close to Renton, even in an exhaustive attempt to distance herself from her. This scene, while his parents lock him in the room in the hope of detoxifying him, clearly shows a feeling that the film wants to shock and so it does. All his attitudes, weakness and reflexes stare him down.The photography in ""Trainspotting"" always adds layers of understanding so the film doesn't lose its frantic pace with explanations. At the beginning of the feature, practically all the shots of the protagonists are counter-plongées - camera below the eye line, pointing upwards - which practically elevate them to the condition of gods. As the story progresses, the camera stays in line with the characters' eyes, reflecting their rise or fall. The power of a camera on the ground filming a fallen person is devastating. Another element that gives Trainspotting dynamism is the montage. With upbeat electronic music and fast cuts, the film tells the story of Renton, Spud (Ewen Bremmer) and Tommy (Kevin McKidd) nights. The use of visual rhymes and cuts where the action continues in a different setting also help the viewer fill in the gaps and follow multiple narratives simultaneously.Danny Boyle knows exactly when to bring closer and closer shots, in order to mimic the effect of the heroine, Boyle throws us inside his main character's head. The practical effects used are also impressive and manage to bring us an unprecedented immersion, which keeps our attention completely fixed on the screen. His madness, his journeys become ours and a short projection of just 94 minutes expands, giving us the impression that we are following Renton for hours on end. And this is not a negative point, it is essential for presenting the protagonist's need for change, since he needs to bring us the perception of the tiredness of this life full of inconstancies, which, obviously, has a very close expiration date.But not everything is flowers and, as I said before, the film shows the deconstruction of this utopian life that Renton had created in his mind and Hodge's script acts very sparingly, bringing us small doses, a priori, of the dark side of this life, to gradually show us only the negative aspects. With some strong scenes and events throughout the plot, the text manages to bring the perfect transition from the protagonist's mentality and the way he thinks becomes ours, bringing even great relief when, in fact, he manages to get away from his addiction. Wisely, Boyle builds his film almost entirely with subjective time, conveying all the euphoria of his characters and leaving us, at the right dose, lost in relation to how much time has passed since the story began.Unfortunately, this subjectivity creates a small break in rhythm in the second half of the film, when Renton starts to act as a real estate agent. Our perception is that a new chapter has begun and we are forced to get used to it again. Fortunately, the narrative manages to quickly hook us and brings us a simple climax, but with great force by resuming the initial scene through, again, the off-screen narration, bringing us a cyclical air, which works as a joke in the script, since, in fact, the protagonist managed to escape his vicious cycle that dominated much of his youth.Trainspotting"" follows, despite in a different and unique way, a critical, shocking and questioning line of some films of the same decade. ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Fight Club"" and even (why not?) ""The Matrix"". In all these films, in a way, we find a protagonist in a boring reality who, by wanting to question or get out of it, sees himself in something much bigger than their will alone is not enough to change things. Relevant and still current, ""Trainspotting"" could easily take place nowadays, since the doubts, difficulties and expectations on top of the young man's head.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A new favourite,","Quite frankly a bloody brilliant British film.

More importantly, people do talk with Scottish accents. I've been confused in real life by Scottish accents but this film was a doodle to understand (with the exception of Carlyle, but really the whole point of him was to be a maniac so it went hand-in-hand). It's about culture people, different accents and dialects do exist.The film may have been sickening at points, like the discovery of the dead baby and the later withdrawal of Renton but really, that's the point. It's not meant to glamorise drugs, it's not heroin-chique it's about trying to strip away the veneer of drug using and show it for something repulsive.

Without a doubt Boyle's magnum-opus, this drug infested romp through the underbelly of Scotland takes us on a wild ride that is equal parts black comedy and plain strange and disturbing.Renton (Ewan McGregor) is an Edinburgh lowlife scumbag trying desperately to throw off the rags of heroin addiction. But no matter how hard he tries, there seems to be no getting rid of the syringe.McGregor gives the performance of a lifetime - he grabs us by the balls and refuses to let go until the final frame has disappeared. Trainspotting launched the actor straight up into the big time, and it isn't difficult to see why. One only wonders why there can't be more actors with the intense need to please the audience in such an intensely perverse way.Trainspotting is a film that must be seen in one sitting, and that you will want to see again. The problem is that it is so disturbing, you won't really be able to watch it again.And that is what makes it such an exciting film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
What to do with the reasons when you got heroine?,"A masterpiece, an ingenious comment on the 90's western lifestyle. Marc Renton is a hero of our times. He himself is a reacting junkie, unwilling to adopt to the modern way of living, of choosing life,and getting things straight,  for no reason. More or less, what to do with the reasons when you got heroine?He is surrounded by his ""so-called mates"", Sick Boy, an heroine addict and dealer, Begbie, a mean misanthropic beast, and Spud,a poor junkie who hasn't hurt nobody in his life. While the others keep falling all the way to the bottom , Renton will try to set up and go on.He looks forward to be just like us.

true as watching society's mirror,"Trainspotting is my kind of movie, it reflects both the feelings of the characters but at the same time the exact situation that many, many, young adolescents live today everywhere in the world. Great acting, great angles, perspectives, colors, camera movement... The plot of this movie could be summarized very simply: A man who wants to get out of heroine addiction.I must admit that the baby scene was very horrifying and touching. I almost felt high at some point, and I felt tired and patience-less and horrified when he is trying to sleep with that need for heroine. I believe that TRainspotting is a piece of art you can't miss... this are the movies I want people to rent, I want people to pay for, so society knows that still some are against drugs...

The best film I've ever seen,"The first time I saw Trainspotting was at the age of 15 about three years ago. Since that day it has been my favourite film of all time. This is a film that divides people in 2 categories; they either love or hate it. You certainly need to have a good sense of humour in order to like this film. It has certain images in it that might shock a sensitive person if not watched with an open mind. So to all you serious people out there: you have been warned!Everyone must know what the story is all about by now. But just for the repetition; Trainspotting tells a story about Scottish Mark Renton and his friends. Together they form a group of junkies who are addicted to any drug there is. It's a sad story about life's losers and their difficulties to ""choose life"". But this is not the thing that makes it so great. The best thing about it is it's continuous sarcasm and the fact that this is a film you really can't watch without feeling nausea and amusement at the same time. It makes fun of the serious things that people usually don't talk about and that's definitely one of it's best sides. The atmosphere of the film has been created very commonplace so it's quite easy to identify with the characters. The hilarious dialogues alone make this film worth seeing. Added to all this there's really great music that makes Trainspotting a cult movie for good! The book's not nearly as good as the film.ATTENTION all you Trainspotting fans out there! Does anyone know where the title Trainspotting comes from? It certainly hasn't got anything to do with spotting trains! I'd truly appreciate it if someone bothered to answer me somehow! It's been bothering me for years now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Requiem for a Dream was much sadder. Seeing this movie once is fine but repeated viewings of it are not recommended. I do not think that the characters are very deep and I only feel slightly sad for one of them. The only thing I learned from this movie is that Heroin use causes you to have disgusting poo.

sublime,"I have to say that I have seen Trainspotting so, so many times and never get tired of watching it. People who don't like or understand this film are probably the same stupid people who get their news from tabloids or who think Britney Spears is a talented artiste. Why do I love Trainspotting so much - it captured and still captures the absolute alienation and cynicism so many millions of people feel, living in a cold, soulless, heartless, commercial chain store-dominated state answerable to no-one, which you are forced to be part of, often against your will. It comments magnificently on the hypocrisy of society (""my mother in her own socially acceptable way is ALSO a drug addict"") and the ignorance of the ""moral majority"" towards drugs. Drugs are complex things - heroin DOES have some redeeming features - so deal with it! The serious message is offset by a very dry and intelligent humour, which still has me in stitches today - often the greatest mirth is to be found in the most profound despair - Our PC times try to deny this but it is true. This says so much about Britain and our lack of naiveté - the contrast with other European countries is starkly illustrated.. Above all though this is a profoundly moving film - which explores the sheer extremes of the human soul. For me it is up there with Casablanca, Some like it hot and Taxi Driver as one of the all time great films. Superb acting, top soundtrack Underworld ""Dark Train"" a techno classic and above all a poignant message.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lust for Life,"Trainspotting is a Great British drugs film. It is story about a group of friends, some addicted to heroin, some are not and focuses mainly on Renton (Ewan MacGregor). It shows them dealing with a number of issues, including obviously drug use and withdrawal, cot-death, teenage sexual behaver, Scottish working-class life, crime and the drugs trade.In the film a lot goes on. Renton goes through phases of being addicted and withdrawal of heroin. The characters are unable to say away from the pull of heroin. The characters in the film also act like normal men, they go out drinking and clubbing, playing football and having sex. However throughout the film the character lives start to fall apart, including prison, death and sickness. They end up going into a life of organised crime.To me Trainspotting is one of the Best British films ever made. Some people have criticised the film to be glamouring drug-use, but if you see the film it does anything but. It tackles a lot of issues and isn't afraid going head-on. The film is well-written, and is based on a novel by Irvine Walsh. I admit I haven't read it but I know some of the easter-eggs like the Hiberan poster in the background. This is Danny Boyle's best film as a director and shows his talent to the full. The acting is also top-notch and many of the actors have become successful, especially Ewan MacGregor, Kelly Macdonald and Robert Carlyle. The film also have a very good soundtrack, with songs like Lust for Life by Iggy Pop, Born Slippy by Underworld and the drugs song Perfect Day.Trainspotting is an excellent film. If you like this film then you will like Requiem for a Dream and vice versa.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

(who can forget the drug overdose with Lou Reed's Perfect Day playing along in the backgound?)Overall, this is a harrowing tale that at times makes viewers sick, and at times is downright hilarious.

the best film about heroin ever,"This is a film that did so many things. First of all, it actually told the truth about heroin. Its emphasis on the highs and especially the lows of the drug is excellent. Some of the scenes, such as the baby crawling across the ceiling, are amazing. Trainspotting also managed to launch quite a few careers. Would Ewan Mcgregor be starring alongside one of the biggest actresses in the world in Moulin Rougee without Trainspotting? I think not. What about Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller? How many of us had heard of them before Trainspotting? The film itself is about a young Scottish heroin addict, who hangs around with a group of fellow addicts. As the film progresses, Renton (Ewan Mcregor) becomes more and more dependent on the drug. After a bad experience of cold turkey, he moves down to London. Unfortunaetly he cant escape his past, and in particular one character Begby, who is, in my view, the scariest person in cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterpiece...,"""Trainspotting"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a young man living a life full of drugs in Edinburgh trying to clean up. He has to try very hard and not be influenced by his friends and the temptation of drugs.I enjoyed this movie very much and I believe that it's a pure masterpiece. The plot was interesting and it contained plenty of dramatic scenes and intense moments. The direction which was made by Danny Boyle was very good and he presented very well his main characters, their problems, their fears and their dreams, something that made possible for the audience to understand them and relate to them. He also presented some very important issues of that time such as drug addiction. The interpretations of Ewan McGregor who played as Renton, Kelly Macdonald who played as Diane, Ewen Bremner who played as Spud, Robert Carlyle who played as Begbie and Kevin McKidd who played as Tommy were very good and their combination worked very well. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Trainspotting"" is an amazing drama movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A shot in the arm for UK cinema,"The biggie: the one that made the world sit up and take notice (if only of the box office receipts). Trainspotting proved a real shot in the arm, not only for the UK film biz but also the music, fashion and advertising industries - a huge coup for Film4 and an early example of modern 'packaged' cinema.Sporting outlandish visuals and an achingly trendy soundtrack, it colluded with its target audience in a way few British films had done before, utilising already established scenes - such as those surrounding Britpop (then privately mired in smack habits), ecstasy culture, and heroin chic - to add a synthetic veneer of cultish cred. Not bad going for an adaptation of a novel encompassing urban sectarianism and smack, and written in the broadest of brogues.But Trainspotting the film was a very different beast from the book: it was selling a lifestyle. Controversy has dogged Boyle from The Beach to Slumdog Millionaire, but until the latter's release, it would remain Boyle's most talked-about and scandalised achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Welcome to another real world,"Years go by, and Trainspotting is still my favorite movie, and as a matter of fact, I believe people that speak against this film, is just because they didn't understand it as a whole.First, as it has been said before, it does not praise drugs; just because through the movie the cast show how they like or need heroin, that doesn't mean that the entire context doesn't show where does drug abuse can take you.Second, at first time it may seem to want some cheap shocks, but if you think about the style the story is told, whether in the book or in the movie (hyper realistic), it just needs to be shown that way, because those things happen in real life; if you do not deal with drug addicts, you may not understand what happens to them, or what could they do, so you may think the movie doesn't make sense.Third, I've never been in Europe, but the acting was convincing enough, to make me believe that it was real enough, maybe too much, specially that brutal little b*****d Begbie.Fourth, and very important, something that may be not quite clear, since I've rarely seen any comment about it, but the topics of social denounces are not just about drugs; anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, it is very hard in the U.K. to escalate social classes, which means that if you were born a working-class child, so you will be as an adult, and without that kind of chances, it is very normal to see people doing drugs; although somewhat superficial, some other topics include dysfunctional families, the obsession with the mass media, the early awakening of sexuality, etc.And last but not least, that soundtrack is a goldmine, if you're mad fer british music, so it didn't hurt me.Overall, a pic to show you how life could truly be in the 90's, shown in an uneasy, but funny, tragic and very clever way.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A rather depressing, but brutally realistic view of the world of heroin addicts","""Trainspotting"" is one of those movies that you don't rent when you're really depressed, because it won't help your mood at all.  It follows the trail of Rent-Boy, Spud, Sick-Boy, Begbie, and Tommy, five Scottish friends into heroin and illegal dealings.  The film is funny, sad, depressing, and even a tad hopeful at the end.  The truth is that this movie makes the already rather tainted world of drugs look even more unappealing and dismal. Despite its necessary gloominess, the movie is smart and moves well, although it does seem a bit long.

Tough Film To Watch,"The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, `Trainspotting,' directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a `way of' life, they have `become' his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to `Rents' the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to. 	The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the `filthiest toilet in Scotland.'  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go `cold turkey.'  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.	 	McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not. 	The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, `Trainspotting' will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable. A great companion feature to the more recent `Traffic,' this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.  I rate this one 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overhyped and Distasteful,"Trainspotting (1996) aims to provide a raw and gritty portrayal of addiction but instead feels like an exploitative, chaotic mess. The film's attempts at shock value overshadow any meaningful narrative, leaving the story disjointed and unengaging. The characters are shallow and unrelatable, making it difficult to invest in their struggles or journeys. While Danny Boyle's direction is visually creative, the stylistic choices often feel like a distraction rather than a complement to the story.

""Trainspotting"" is a thought-provoking exploration of addiction and the consequences it imposes on individuals and society as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good movie,"Trainspotting is a movie that has violence and drug use.The movie follows Renton, a drug addict, who at the beginning does not like the conventional life stages people have. However, throughout the movie, he makes an effort to join that sort of lifestyle after being confronted with certain life events.I liked how the movie was directed differently from other drug recovery movies as we see Renton's struggle with addictions and the actions, he is taking to get out of it, and how is dragged into it by his friends and his ""lack of discipline"" with his recovery. We are left with him having aspirations of following the normal life like other people however, we don't see this as the movie ends. For me, it gives optimism he gets better however the way the movie was directed shows how hard the road of recovery is. But I think his last few actions he did in the movie, showed he probably went on to achieve his goals.The directing, acting, and score were all good. Personally, a lot of shows/movies that have drug use over act however all the actors here did a good job. I especially liked it when Renton came home and was experiencing hallucinations. The directing of the movie was great all the shots were good, there was no wasted time and the transitions between some shots were the best I have seen in movies.I think I would have appreciated seeing what happened to Allison after her event.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
How could anyone say this film glorifies drug use?,"Most people told me ""I didn't like the topic. It wasn't fun like I thought it was going to be. It would make kids want to use drugs.""  Well, life is never a rip-roaring fun-filled adventure. It is often harsh and presents chilling realities to those who indulge in forms of destructive escapism. The film is exceptionally well written and directed. The casting was excellent and overall it is both an excellent cinematic work and a PSA (Public Service Announcement) displaying the horrific  consequences of drug usage. A must see by any standard.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Definitely deserves it spot on top 250,"I loved this movie. Just everything about it is perfect. Almost too perfect. I thought this movie was a great ode to the films it homaged. Stanley Kubrick would have been proud of the scenes reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange.I thought all of the performances were great. Ewan McGregor did a very good job as Renton(my friend and I both agree he is a very underrated actor). But I must say the standout performance is Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, a cold fiery fight picker.I was so in love with the bright color scheme this film used. Especially the club scenes. The cinematography was great. The Worst Toilet in Scotland scene was so well done. The cinematography made me so claustrophobic, sick, and bewildered all at the same time. A very surreal scene. Also, GREAT MUSIC!There are scenes in this film that are very scary. Trust me you will no which ones. I know a lot of people will disagree with me when I say this but I thought this was better than the very good Requiem for a Dream.I know I probably should not put this in my review but I feel so strongly about this I have to. I'm sorry to say this, but if you thought this movie was pro-drugs; you are an idiot, plain and simple. If you cannot see this movie is anti-drugs, you are a very ignorant and narrow-minded person. Sorry, needed to get that off my chest.The only fault I find with this film is a very awkward one. I usually complain that a movie is too long, but I think Trainspotting could have benefited from being longer than it's 94 minute running time. Oh well. Whatever. This movie is truly a treasure and I am puzzled why I didn't watch it sooner. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A funny but dramatic piece on drug fuelled Scotsman,"Trainspotting(based on the book by Irvine Welsh) is just a Great movie and one which many consider a cult classic which blends comedy and drama, darkness and light heartedness and also show's you the perspective of the drug user and how he thinks and acts and then what a whole group of them can be like. An excellent movie with potential to rise higher and here is why I think so below.We'll start with the story which is well different to many other Drama's in the sense it nearly could have a little comedy genre under it's title as some parts can be quite hilarious. The film is also very serious as well and as you will see if you watch it, part's can be hard hitting and you see the hard effect drugs have on the addicts and the one's they love as well. I loved the ending I am sure you will too as out of the bleakness some parts can be happy and in a certain way philosophical too, with Ewan McGregor's character showing us his mind and what he thinks' about life and it's adventure's.Danny Boyle the director and future Oscar winner(he won for Slumdog Millionaire in 2009), does a great job here and make's the fine actors he has at his disposal even more dramatic and his artistic vision I think came off the way he wanted it too. The screenplay is fantastic and all thanks to John Hodge who is unknown in truth but this film wouldn't be what it is without it really. The film's set's are also fantastic and the heroin dens are superbly set out to make the film authentic and a strange city in Edinburgh which you really ever connect with drug addicts.McGregor is great in the main role and even his voice as the voice- over is fantastic too. The supporting cast are also fabulous with particular praise going to Robert Carlyle and his fairly insane character who seriously should not be angered. There isn't really a truly clear villain in this but you could say that in the end the drugs were the villain stopping the characters from living a truly normal life and whenever any of them try to give up, they get sucked back in again.If any bad come's from this film in a critical sense it is well, well, it is hard to find wrong's really but I guess at the beginning there is the humour part of it but from the middle till the end the film get's very serious. I won't write too much because it is hard to be critical, this isn't my favourite film of ALL time but nonetheless it is still hard to criticise.Recommend the film for those who like a film that is drug fuelled and that makes the world seem dark then bright and then back again to being bleak. I think many won't like the drug part because it has serious drug taking and a lot of swearing so not for those who don't appreciate 18 rated films but generally if not I think anyone who like any films can love this.Overall it was safely Great, it wasn't quite near being superb in my opinion but nonetheless pulls away from just being very good. It has potential to be much better but that is for you to work out, it is a film where you can sit and sit back well and just enjoy an excellent piece of Drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

As reciveribg addicts we can relate to rhe film in so many ways but its a classic film qnd ill always love it... Trainspotting 2 is fab too,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A rollercoaster of a movie,"This movie hit me like a lightning. I was never so tensely watching a film in a theatre before. It captured me from the first minute to the very last. The actors are brilliant, the music too and the story is just hilarious. After seeing it, I also read the book by Irvine Welsh, which made me a big Welsh-fan. The movie makers even improved some scenes that were a bit boring in the book. So I just recommend to everybody: Go, see this picture!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Choose life, choose Trainspotting!","Wonderful darkly comic tale of a group of Scottish twenty-something's and their pathetic lives. Highly controversial on its release, Trainspotting was accused of glamorising the use of drugs when it clearly doesn't instead showing how they can get out of control and totally destroy lives. The story centres around heroin addict Renton (McGregor  in a career launching role) and his loser pals, Sickboy (Jonny Lee Miller  Hackers), Tommy (Kevin McKidd  Small Faces), Spud (Ewen Bremner  Snatch) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle  Plunkett and McLane). Renton narrates his way through his struggle to beat his habit and change his awful life for the better. McGregor is good and so is debutante Kelly McDonald as his schoolgirl girlfriend but Carlyle is the star if the show with a truly psychotic and chilling performance.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Buy Now, Pay Later","Set in Edinburgh in the last decades of the 20th century, the film is equally as relevant to any contemporary location. It most obviously comments on 'drug' culture, but also on the hypocrisy of more widely accepted substance use and the quick-fix-have-now-pay-later society that so willingly buys into the same ethos. Painful scenes portray the widespread superficial understanding of the depth of the issues surrounding substance abuse and the devastation, despair and lack of control felt by the abusers and by those around.Consequences and matters of trust are demonstrated effectively, though there is no judgement and often the brutality of the subject is seated against tragic, tender and even funny moments.The focus of most of the characters' efforts are singularly related to getting kicks - whether through substances, behaviour, or sex. Despite this, the British, mainly Scottish, cast still manage to portray the characters as multi-dimensional bound together in mistrusting common purpose...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
It Took Pure Talent,"This movie was positively mind-blowing, a favorite in my circle of
friends after it came out. Even the soundtrack hit on so many things we
all knew and loved, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Underworld. It pulled us in
from the opening scene with a great monologue and the old school
thumping of everyone's favorite punk rocker.When it came out we loved it. It was brutal, it was funny, it was
tragic, we hadn't seen anything like it.But we were 16 when it came out and living in Chicagoland. We were a
long way from the source and had never heard of Irvine Welsh. It wasn't
until a few years later, when we finally got a Borders in our area that
we would find out how monumental a movie this was.When we did, we found Welsh, we found the book the movie was based on
and that somehow made the film all the better.""Loosely interpreted"" would be a very fair thing to call it, but that
isn't a shame, that isn't a negative.The source material was as mind-blowing as it was frustrating. Each
chapter narrated by a different character and each one written in a
Scottish accent.You longed for Sick Boy's chapters, you could tear his apart in the
blink of an eye, but Spud, Spud it took a month to translate that
accent into anything near comprehensible.There are more characters and, if you take the time to work through the
accents, the book is a far greater prize than the film.But when you read the novel, when you review the source material, you
are stuck wondering how on earth could they ever turn a novel like
Trainspotting into a movie? Yet they did. They not only turned it into
a film, they turned it into a great film, a beautiful and funny look
into the lives of addicts that is as tragic as it is hysterical.They beat the odds with Trainspotting. Rarely, if ever, do you
encounter such a brilliant translation of a novel that seems so
monumentally difficult to turn from prose to film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Lurid Reality Pumped Through Fantasy. Few Films Can Manage To Be Bleak, Miserable, Tragic and Therefore Depressing While Still Remaining Amusing","In Britain, during the 90s clubbing was at a high, literally and drug abuse was a regular problem concerning the government. Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non-existent losers who're living their lives to their ""supposed"" full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behaviour that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say ""drugs are good at first"", but then the film goes on to saying ""but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever"". It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realise the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerising study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialogue is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
