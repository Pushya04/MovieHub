Entertaining as an Action Movie,"In 1978, the skilled and ambitious TWA pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) smuggles Cuban cigars to increase his income. Out of the blue, he is contacted by the CIA agent Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), who asks him to work for the CIA photographing facilities over Central America using a state-of-art small plane. Soon Barry contacts General Noriega as a courier for the CIA and is contacted by the Medellin Cartel that wants him to transport drugs to the USA. Then Schafer asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua. Barry invites pilots that are his friends and plots routes to smuggle drugs for the cartel. The CIA closes eyes to the scheme and Barry becomes richer and richer. He uses the Arkansas town Mena to laundry his money. But the DEA and the FBI are tracking him down. When the CIA shuts down the scheme, Barry is left alone and arrested by the agencies. What will happen to his family and him?""American Made"" is an American action movie based on a true story and told like a comedy despite the seriousness of the situation, with the American government interfering this time with the Central America nations. The plot is engaging and entertaining and the despicable Barry Seal is depicted as a family man by Tom Cruise that has good performance. The background of corruption, political interference, trafficking of weapons and drugs are treated like something usual by the story that can not be taken seriously. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Feito na América"" (""American Made"")",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Entertaining & Exciting Stuff! - Here is an actor who always (with some exceptions) delivers.,"Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series ""avatar"". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, ""Barry Seal never says no"" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend.You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, ""I am just a gringo who always delivers"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining, but quickly fades","American Made was a good watch - the story keeps a good steady momentum, the direction and editing are vibrant and dynamic. It has the vibes of something like Wolf of Wall St or a Guy Ritchie film, where despite the nature of the events you find yourself rooting for a criminal and laughing at the black comedy of how things unfold.But it stays firmly in the mode of fast-paced 'zany' without ever really digging into emotions, desperation, or any human reflection. Barry Seal as a character remains a breezy, zany blur. Its just that kind of film. I think Cruise has a lot to do with that - his vanity as an actor, having to be seen as either confused- smiley or cool-intense in any given moment limits his courage to do anything else (Born on the Fourth of July was a real anomaly for him in terms of range).Its as entertaining as any two episodes of Narcos - but without Narcos' complexity and variance. Good but not great, definitely worthy of a viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top flight,"In director Doug Liman who Tom Cruise has worked with a few times, Cruise has found someone who he could loosen up with a little, make a lower budget colourful flashy film where Cruise can be a little chaotic and free wheeling.American Made is a fast paced film. A wily, naughty mischievous risk taker Barry Seal who goes from being a TWA pilot to a CIA contractor who ends up supplying arms to trafficking drugs for Escobar to training an illegal right wing Nicaraguan army.Seal makes so much money he does not know what to do with it or even hide it. Of course there is a downside, eventually they are all after him and even his cunning cannot evade them all. Pursued by the FBI, Police, DEA, various cartels, Seal really has nowhere to run or hide.Cruise seems to be enjoying himself on screen, Liman keeps the film moving but in a sense it is a familiar story. Once Seal makes it big, has a few bumps along the road, you even get that scene when you know the decline in his fortunes will start.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cruise makes a Comeback,"Tom Cruise is back with a vengeance and after the train wreck that was The Mummy i can safely say that this movie proved that Cruise can act and Liman can direct.While the narrative structure isn't always the best flowing the movie delivers great performances, an atmosphere that sucks you into the time period, and well made shots.A highly underrated movie that i would personally recommend and a definite 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doug Liam and Tom Cruise make such a great pair,"Very few directors have tapped the clown in Tom Cruise the way Doug Liman has. He had directed Tom in Edge of Tomorrow which was humorous and was set amidst a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.I felt Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the pilot in an extremely light-hearted and funny way. Cruise is known for playing roles that ooze oodles of dare-devilry. But most of those roles are of fictitious characters. For once Tom plays a real man whose daring knew no bounds. Captain Barry Seal was like a real-life Ethan Hunt. Hence I feel casting Cruise as Seal was an extremely appropriate decision and should help in filling Universal Studios Entertainment's coffers.If you were awed after seeing the aerial sequences in Dunkirk, wait until you have seen this film. The planes are subjected to go through some intense acrobatics which will please you. If you were disappointed with Cruise after watching The Mummy, I can assure you that you will heave a sigh of relief after watching this film. The film's story is not only engaging but also witty and hilarious. There are hardly any stagnant moments so the probability of you getting bored is very low.A very ironic thing about American Made is that in 1986 when Barry Seal must have gone through whatever turmoil he did, a young Tom Cruise played a pilot in Top Gun which released that year. Did he know he would pay a real-life pilot who was very relevant during those days almost 31 years later ?Watch American Made . Don't watch it for Tom Cruise's stardom. Watch it because you deserve to watch an entertaining and great film on the big screen that coincidentally has a superstar playing the leading man. I humbly apologize for the length of this post but sometimes I just can't control myself from pouring my thoughts out",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"' DoubleCrossed"" with dennis hopper  was better",I do love Tom Cruise movies...he is great... but in this instance....this movie is yet another remake....it should be called American Re maid....the original with the late Dennis Hopper was more believable and funnier.......Tom should keep his flying movies to Top Gun and its sequels.....So watch this movie with a grain of salt and than go watch Double Crossed...and tell me what you think... I believe you will be pleasantly surprised!!1,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cruise Flying High Again.,"If you ask anyone to list the top 10 film actors, chance is that ""Tom Cruise"" would make many people's lists. He's in everything isn't he?  Well, actually, no. Looking at his IMDb history, he's only averaged just over a movie per year for several years. I guess he's just traditionally made a big impact with the films he's done. This all rather changed in the last year with his offerings of the rather lacklustre ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (FFF) and the pretty dreadful ""The Mummy"" (Ff) as one of this summer's big blockbuster disappointments. So Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was sorely in need of a upward turn and fortunately ""American Made"" delivers in spades.""Based on a True Story"" this is a biopic on the life of Barry Seal, a hot shot 'maverick' (pun intended) TWA pilot who gets drawn into a bizarre but highly lucrative spiral of gun- and drug-running to and from Central America at the behest of a CIA operative Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson). All this is completely mystifying to Barry's wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) who is, at least not initially, allowed to be 'in' on the covert activities.The film is a roller-coaster ride of unbelievable action from beginning to end. In the same manner as you might have thought ""that SURELY can't be true"" when watching Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"", this thought constantly flits through your mind. At each turn Seal can't believe his luck, and Cruise brilliantly portrays the wide-eyed astonishment required. This is a role made for him.Also delivering his best performance in years is Domhnall Gleeson (""Ex Machina"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as the CIA man with the (whacky) plan. Large chunks of the film are powered by his manic grin.As an actress, Sarah Wright is new to me but as well as being just stunningly photogenic she works with Cruise really well (despite being 20 years his junior - not wanting to be ageist, but this is the second Cruise film in a row I've pointed that out!)). Wright also gets my honorary award for the best airplane sex scene this decade!Written by Gary Spinelli (this being only his second feature) the script is full of wit and panache and - while almost certainly (judging from wiki) stretches the truth as far as Seal's cash-storage facilities - never completely over-eggs the pudding.Doug Liman (""Jason Bourne"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") directs brilliantly, giving space among the action for enough character development to make you invest in what happens to the players. The 80's setting is lovingly crafted with a garish colour-palette with well-chosen documentary video inserts of Carter, Reagan, Oliver Stone, George Bush and others. It also takes really chutzpah to direct a film that (unless I missed it) had neither a title nor any credits until the end.The only vaguely negative view I had about this film is that it quietly glosses over the huge pain, death and suffering that the smuggled drugs will be causing to thousands of Americans under the covers. And this mildly guilty thought lingers with you after the lights come up to slightly - just slightly - take the edge off the fun.   Stylish, thrilling, moving and enormously funny in places, this is action cinema at its best. A must see film.(For the full graphical review of the film please visit http://bob- the- movie-man.com. Thanks.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" A Fun Lie Based on a True Story!""","American Made is about as close to a true story as Fargo was claimed to be. That is, not in any way. Doug Liman takes the bit between the teeth and attempts to make some sort of adventure comedy about a guy, who undoubtedly while having a pair, was likely to be a greedy creep. That Liman succeeds to an extent, is largely due to his directorial skills, Tom Cruise's natural charisma and Gary Spinelli's script, which serves up an entertaining blend of one part fact, mixed with four parts fiction.Cruise, who is the physical antithesis of the real life character he plays, brings a boyishly devil-may-care exuberance to his role of Barry Seal. Seal was a former TWA pilot who may or may not have flown missions for the CIA, but eventually did become a drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s.Punters who love Cruise and fancy a ""Jesse James was really a fun guy looking for a few thrills"" type of story will undoubtedly enjoy this lively romp, which features many historical figures earnestly addressing the screen in newsreel footage seamlessly integrated into the central narrative. Me, I just couldn't shrug the feeling that despite the professionalism of all concerned with the production, this is a story that didn't really need to be told in this format. Seal was no Indiana Jones type hero, who was seeking the betterment of his immediate community. He was as crooked as they come and ultimately probably got what he deserved.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A seriously fun Cruise lead comedy/thriller,"While we all eagerly await the release of the recently announced Top Gun sequel, Tom Cruise's latest slice of polished Hollywood entertainment American Made, allows us all to see what it's like when Maverick becomes a little naughty in his retirement from flying fighter jets, verbally sparring with Iceman and making out with Kelly McGillis.Re-teaming with his Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman, American Made is a relentlessly energized and seriously fun examination of the true life story of American Airlines pilot Barry Seal, who gave up his life as an everyday pilot to not only become a CIA recruited pilot delivering messages, guns and various other treats to South American contacts, but a drug runner for the Pablo Escobar Columbian drug trade, which makes for a wild ride that would be utterly unbelievable were it not in fact based on truth.Fair warning to all, Liman and his leading man are totally uninterested in giving a dry history lesson of Seal's exploits, as American Made sees the two Hollywood heavy hitters instead turn their trajectory towards delivering a heightened and often over the top examination of these events and with Liman bringing his Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow expertise with him to the event and with Cruise seemingly having the most fun his had in years, the risk to go for something different other than an awards baiting or dialogue heavy expose has paid off hugely, with American Made easily becoming one of the year's most purely fun and enjoyable rides.At almost 60 years of age you'd be rightfully thinking it's about time that Cruise take a seat back and enjoy a more quiet time in his career but the unstoppable and enthusiastic leading man is having a blast here bringing Seal to life.In almost every scene of the film, Cruise and Liman continue on with their rapport that they built in Edge of Tomorrow and Liman should be commended for bringing out Cruise's natural talents for comedy and when mixed with his easy going charisma that has made him such a beloved acting figure, Seal offers Cruise one of his best and most interesting roles in his long and varied career, no small feat when you consider the quality of his often underestimated C.V.American Made's frenetic and sometimes scattered focus may detract from some viewers experiences and those looking for a more sombre take on a no doubt very serious topic may be disappointed but Liman and his cast's (that includes great bit turns from the likes of Sarah Wright as Seal's wife Lucy and Caleb Landry Jones as Lucy's dim-witted brother Bubba) ability to extract the absurdness and craziness of this whole situation and turn it into such a fun piece of entertainment should be a winner in the majority of cases, much like Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street did.Final Say –With Cruise on top form and Liman instilling his film with a breathtaking amount of energy, American Made is a pure piece of cinematic entertainment and an awesomely fun companion piece to Cruise's other well-known plane centred star vehicle.4 future presidents out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Remade,"Fun movie, if not for the fact that the truth was changed to protect the guilty.In real life, Barry Seal was fired from TWA in '72 when he was charged for smuggling plastic explosives across Mexico. He flew tons of coke into the States for multiple drug kingpins, including Escobar. When he was busted, he started working for the DEA as an informant. He was overweight, poisoned his fellow Americans with drugs; and didn't care about his family enough to enter WITSEC.From a historical perspective, it should be taken with a grain of salt that a guy like Seal, given his position, can be placed in a situation where everything is cool, time after time after time after time again.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
TomCruise at his best,"A great story perfectly representing those years and with a stunning performance by Tom Cruise. I would say one of the best movie ever, in this genre, which is midway between a CIA based film and a biopic one. Barry's narration, delivered direct to camera, takes the form of a series of clips from a fuzzy home video supposedly shot in the mid-1980s, laying out the historical background in a dense fashion (he pretends at one point to confuse two countries) which seems most directly indebted to Adam McKay's The Big Short. The biggest coup is the casting of Cruise, who functions as a pure icon, recycling all his usual mannerisms – the grin, the hand gestures – and even revisiting his past as a pilot in Top Gun. The catch is that his depthless showboating for once seems intended as anything but likable.",,Anonymous,Biography
Often interesting yet never completely grabbed me,"This fictionalized account of smuggler Barry Seal has much to recommend it. Cruise is his usual charming self, the film is interspersed with these interesting montage moments, and there is breezy humor and an intriguing story of criminals working hand in hand with the U.S. government.But by the midpoint I was just feeling kind of disengaged. I wasn't quite sure what the point was. And Cruise felt slightly off in a role that would make more sense to me if he seemed a bit stupider and trashier; it seemed the equivalent of casting George Clooney to play Lyndon Johnson.In the end, I would say American Made was perfectly fine, but it's the sort of movie I will have completely forgotten in a month.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long and feels repetitive,"American Made starts off interesting enough. And Tom Cruise is likeable, as usual. But this movie drags on too long and feels somewhat repetitive.

The Fun Way of Showing Biography of Barry Seal's Unique Life,"For a biography movie, this one was interestingly done. The way the story was told made it seemed quite fun. Some portions were using dark humor and Tom Cruise was real charming in here. I could actually picture him as this real unique character. His relationship with his wife and family was also real fun to look at, especially during the moment when he tried to convince her about the good about his works.One cool thing about the movie was the very good costumes and sets. It was like we were transformed into the world of the 1970s and early 1980s when the film was set. Especially the make up effects of Tom Cruise was also exceptional. He looked a lot younger than his actual age here. Even my wife was very amazed with his appearance and looks. In addition to the costumes and sets, the film was also having some songs from that period which enhanced the aura of 70s and 80s here.The main attraction of this movie was definitely the uniqueness of Barry Seal's life as a pilot and smuggler and also the impacts he had in the US history during the Ronald Reagan's presidency then. It even had some political figures mentioned as well. The title of the movie also suit the story very nicely. You would understand why it has such title by the end of the film.In the end, you could already guess the conclusion of the movie. Especially if you are a history buff who already knew the story of Barry Seal. There appeared to be various versions of his life story, so I am not sure either whether the one we saw here was the real actual version. But anyway, in term of entertainment, the movie was made into a non boring kind of biographical movie. However, those who were expecting to see Tom Cruise kick a$$ in this movie would probably be disappointed cause this is not that kind of movie. There were some action scenes but this film could not be categorized as action type. There were no very emotional moments as well (which I found rather odd as usually biography movie would have some of those parts).Finally, if you are looking for a good biographical crime movie, this one might be a good option. Though this was not as heavy as other movies in such category, it was still interesting to see Tom Cruise's portrayal of one of the controversial character in US history. It was also directed by Doug Liman who was the director of some good and/or commercially successful movies such as The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Edge of Tomorrow and few others. But for those who are looking for movies with lots of actions by Tom Cruise, better wait for his next Mission: Impossible movies.For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cruise and Liman make a great pair again,"Always reliable if not exactly visionary, director Doug Liman has another entertaining outing with Tom Cruise, reinventing his charm, swagger and grin as tools for finding easy cash and marital respect when honest work doesn't exactly get one far enough.Cruise plays a totally reprehensible and despicable character and yet manages to keep everyone invested in the ride that accelerates with every misstep on the way, fully captivating the audience to wait for the extent of the looming train wreck. Cruise is entirely game here, not once trying to make audience feel sorry for his character or thinking that maybe he had a heart of gold, after all.Worth pointing out is also a stellar turn from a less prolific Domhnall Gleeson whose ambitious CIA operator is equally blind, naive and brilliant, and Gleeson makes his oily presence wonderfully effective.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fast-paced and zany action-drama is Tom Cruise's best movie in YEARS,"""American Made"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Barry Seal. After a clever 1970s montage featuring Jimmy Carter's infamous feel-bad speech, the movie introduces us to Seal, a TWA pilot Who is not adverse to shaking things up a bit (literally causing turbulence). It's not long before Seal is approached by a CIA agent to do clandestine reconnaissance in South America. It's not long before Seal gets involved in the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia... At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie reunites director Liman with Tom Cruise, who previously teamed up on the well-received ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (for which a sequel is being planned). Here they bring us (""Based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the movie) the story of a TWA pilot turned CIA informant turned drug runner. The movie is divided up in chapters, from ""CIA '78"" to ""Colombia '80"" and so on. While the subject matter is quite serious and Barry Seal not particularly likable per se, the movie is fast-paced and zany, and is helped tremendously by Tom Cruise's charming and very effective performance. The supporting cast are for me relatively unknowns, including Sara Wright as Barry's wife, and Domhnall Gleeson as the CIA handler. A minus point is the incessant use of hand-held cameras as well as the use of extreme close-ups. Enough already! We get that it is an action movie! There are tons of great song placements in the movie, and when George Harrison's ""Wah Wah"" plays of the closing moments and the end titles, it perfectly captures much of the movie's ebullience.""American Made"" opened wide this weekend, and I was looking forward to seeing it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (about 20 people in a huge auditorium), much to my surprise. Perhaps strong word-of-mouth can generate a stronger box office performance in theaters. Regardless, this is bound to find a wider audience on VOD and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for a quick-paced and charming drug-smuggling action movie that is Tom Cruise's best movie in, literally, years, you cannot go wrong with ""American Made""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An enjoyable if somewhat lengthy movie,"I was lucky to get an advanced screening. First off, at least it kept my attention the whole way through. I had previously seen Cruise in the ""Mummy"" movie recently released and was not impressed with his acting there.In this movie he returned to form and therefore the story-line was far more plausible. I say story-line, but in reality it is one of those docu-drama's, being based on fact. I wonder how much was dramatization as there were some parts where you would ask ""did this sh*t really happen?!""Would I be inclined to add it to my DVD collection, no. It was good as a one time showing. I suspect the length of it worked somewhat against it. A long movie needs to build up to a crescendo, and whilst this had lots of action it never seemed to hit that top note.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fails to Get Off the Ground,"At this point is there a person on earth who doesn't already know the CIA was up to some shady s**t in Central America? Those who might still be in the dark about this stuff please do yourself a favor and read ""Castles Made of Sand"" by Andre Gerolymatos or ""A Great Place to Have a War"" by Joshua Kulantzick. If you want something a little more specific to this film's subject matter there's ""Smuggler's End"" by Del Hahn. You can also watch: Bananas (1971), The In-Laws (1979), El Salvador: Another Vietnam (1981), Alsino and the Condor (1982), Under Fire (1983), Latino (1985), Salvador (1986), Romero (1989), Walker (1987), Down Came a Blackbird (1995),Blow (2001), Voces Inocentes (2004), Guatemala: The Secret Files (2008), Harvest of Empire (2012), Princesas Rojas (2013), Escobar: Paradise Lost (2014),the TV show Narcos (2015-present), Room of Bones (2015), Finding Oscar (2016), The Infiltrator (2016) and if that's not enough, the hearings on the Iran-Contra Investigation on Youtube.All of these options and more would give you a more cogent, compelling and satisfying experience than sitting through American Made; a light, mediocre and curiously smug, bug-eyed view of important historical events. In it a TWA pilot turned CIA stooge makes a little side cash smuggling drugs, guns and people to and from Central America. While doing so, the movie frames the larger collusions and convolutions not as the result of a deeply flawed man sticking his thumbs in various proverbial pies but as an awkward jumble of ""and then"" filmmaking in spite of him.Barry (Cruise) fits neatly into the recent crop of true-life protagonists too stupid to realize they're in over their head. He smiles crookedly, trying to hide his intentions under aviator glasses – mostly to the amusement of his CIA handler played by Domhnall Gleeson. He's clearly playing with a bad hand and everyone including the infamous Medellin drug cartel knows it, but damned if they're not entertained by Barry's good 'ol boy braggadocio. He's like a composite of the dudes from War Dogs (2016) only with the serendipity (and obliviousness) of Forrest Gump (1994).What exactly makes a man like this tick? The movie doesn't really seem that interested in answering that question. Instead it seems more concerned with giving us a history lesson based on Barry's limited first-person perspective and various camera collage techniques that make American Made look like an episode of Arrested Development (2003-Present). This is of course told without wit, irony or the requisite anger needed. One can't help but think that if director Doug Liman brought the same level of ire to this movie that he did in the under-watched Fair Game (2010), American Made would have been a bit more palatable tosomeone.As it stands however, American Made is for no one. It's a frustratingly mediocre waste of marquee space that's too dense to be entertaining and too cavalier to be worth a good discussion of Cold War foreign policy. It lacks characterization and perspective, leaving only Tom Cruise's boundless charisma to push it past the runway with any alacrity. As much as I'd like to say Cruise pulls it off, American Made as a whole should have stayed grounded for a little while longer.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Feels like watching a movie length montage,"I had virtually no expectations for this movie other than a trailer I had seen.Turns out the entire movie is like a trailer. The whole movie was a series of jump-cuts from scene to scene. There were a ton of montages of Cruise flying, smuggling, etc. It felt like the movie tried to hard to not get bogged down in details, but as a result I found the movie hard to connect with. It didn't help that Cruise's character doesn't have much of a persona. He likes to fly and has questionable morals (such as being willing to smuggle drugs) but there is not much there beyond that.I think they wanted to show that he loved his family but he made so many questionable decisions that put them at risk that it was hard to like his character. Plus some people have described this as a comedy but it totally lacked any laugh out loud moments or even internal chuckles.I feel like this story could have been better told with more of a cohesive story line, rather than having Cruise montage his way through it all. It felt like a 2 hour trailer to me.I gave 5 stars because the movie is somewhat entertaining, but I feel like it fell short of it's potential and I wouldn't watch it a 2nd time.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Essentially Mission Impossible Featuring Barry Seal,"As a sucker for storylines centered on Pablo Escobar & the Medellin Cartel, American Made comes with immediate appeal. Here, Doug Liman & Gary Spinelli shares on screen the uniquely interesting escapades of Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot who became a drug smuggler, WHILE serving the US government. Liman's picture however, veers away from the serious & harrowing, ushering a snappy, lighthearted drugs & vices-movie that absolutely compliments its preposterous narrative. Liman's approach is then mostly comical and fun-loving, featuring egotistical, oblivious characters and Soderbergh-esque filmmaking tenets such as quick-fire imageries, documentary-style hand held camerawork, old school saturated aesthetics and good ol' loose dialogues. As for the performances, this Barry Seal characterization seems THE perfect Tom Cruise persona, as convincing charm amidst the craziness becomes the name of the game. Cruise does wonders here, crafting an intriguing central character whose motivations are simple & reachable, and mannerisms entertaining.Overall, American Made finds success in the successful pairing of Liman's fast-and-loose direction and Cruise's devil-may-care portrayal. Admittedly, the picture does give off inconsequential & forgettable vibes from its unserious attitude. The watch experience however, is as entertaining as can be.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An entertaining and fun well-made film boosted by great direction and acting.,"Doug Liman and Tom Cruise paired up together again for a fast-paced and colorful biography on Barry Seal. American Made may not have the blockbuster action but it holds up on its own firmly with the help of a great direction by Doug. Tom Cruise is definitely the main highlight of the film and he is what made it so entertaining.The story: The pace is brisk; it takes the audience on a crazy ride from the start and never slows down. Though it never felt boring, sometimes I felt that it could have slowed down for some development. After the film ended, it seems that Doug and Tom had a clear mind on just keeping the audience as entertained as they can be. It cuts to the chase and never dwells on anything such as emotions. It moves quickly from event to event. Advantage is that I was not bored at all. Disadvantage is that it felt like a 2 hours montage on Barry Seal's life. There is no real tension or character's development. The realism is helped by the smart decision of filming like a documentary. Be warned: Action genre fans may be disappointed that is no big action. It is strangely classified as action.Acting wise: Tom Cruise looks like he had lots of fun filming. It is just entertaining watching him immersed himself in the crazy and fast-paced world of Barry Seal. The rest of the cast are decent but not impressive.Music wise: Christophe Beck created a decent mood of the different years. Since Doug wanted the film to feel realistic, it is not jam-packed with music. There are many moments where sounds and ambiance take the front seat.Overall: It is not impressive but it is a solid entry to Doug Liman's and Tom Cruise's filmography. I went in with low expectation and had no idea about the outrageous stuff Barry Seal did. And not only was I entertained, I was immersed into the world of Barry.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
7/10 -- PRETTY GOOD!,"Tom Cruise carries the hell out of this film. Don't get me wrong, the story is incredible, but the camerawork is awful and I found it very distracting. There's a scene where they're in a diner and it looks like something out of The Office. Shaky, then zooming in on the person's facial expression. Other moments looked amateurish as well. On the contrary, the flying scenes were pretty great.Most of the acting here is also pretty subpar, but I get a strong feeling that it stems from bad writing rather than bad acting. I've seen a lot of these folks in other films and from what I remember, they're pretty good. (Caleb Landry Jones, for example, is a phenomenal actor, and even his performance here felt off.)Supposedly they were working with a budget of 50 - 60 million dollars. I gotta ask... Where'd it go? I don't see it. If you told me this flick was made with twelve million and change, I'd believe you.I hate to be such a Debbie Downer, but yeah, a 7/10 almost feels too high. Had it not been for Cruise, I'd be putting this at a 5. So much potential here left untapped. I hate seeing these incredible true stories fall into bad hands.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal. A man who works for the CIA, as well as a man who was very sneakily smuggling drugs in and out of the USA. I thought the concept was really clever, and he managed to do it was really well thought out. The problem with this movie is it doesn't really go into much detail of character.Let me start off by saying that Tom Cruise's performance was spot on and it's best performance in years. Way better than in that horrible movie ""The Mummy."" Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) has kids to feed as well as pleasing his beautiful wife Lucy Seal (Sarah Wright). They are so many huge areas that could have been explored here, but instead they cut corners and just focus on the drug smuggling, and how he does it. It's like they just said ""How these people feel doesn't matter and it's not the focus."" But it should have been. The problem here is that Tom Cruise does not much to work on with his lines. He could have had a very emotional scene with his wife and kids or with anybody, but there's no emotion in any of these people. That's one of the main problems with this film, and the fact that no one had a background made it worse.All that aside, it's Tom Cruise's best acting job in a long time, and how he smuggles in the drugs is exceptionally clever! I always wandered how they do it...now I know the secret! See it for Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise fans will not be disappointed! 3/5 stars. Jay from the Autistic Reviewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Honest Review,"It's always kind of fun seeing Tom Cruise in a role where he has to actually act and not just do the action phone-in-emotion thing...because he is capable of being a decent actor and not just a pretty-boy action star.And, in this he was a decent actor.And the result is a very enjoyable and fun period piece that has just as much drama as it does action and comedy, which allows the time dedication to slip buy unnoticed.It's actually pretty rare that you can watch a film this long and not really feel like you're watching a long film.The only real downside is that the end hits you a bit abruptly, a bit too abruptly for the build up...but who cares when the build-up is this enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining,"1978. Barry Seal, an airline pilot, is recruited by the CIA to fly special transport missions in Central America. Initially it is a matter of information-for-supplies but ultimately he ends up being a drug transporter for Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel and supplying anti-Communist groups, including the Nicaraguan Contras, with weapons.Entertaining. Told in a very light-hearted, fun way it is a roller-coaster ride of humour and action. The humour stems largely from the ineptness and unintended consequences of the actions of the CIA and US government. If told in a more serious way, this would have been a very damning indictment of the US's involvement in Central America in the 1980s, and a powerful examination of how the CIA and US government abuse the loyalty of their own citizens.However, the story is told as a comedy, with absurdity piled upon absurdity, so difficult to believe. Just as well, as, in actual fact, much of what is described is fictional. In particular, the real Barry Seal was hardly a paragon of virtue and only ended up working with the US Government once he was facing jail time.Still, an entertaining story, regardless of its accuracy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inconsistent in what it does but still manages to be broadly entertaining,"Pilot Barry Seal is recruited by the CIA to run a covert operation flying into South America; quickly he gets in deeper and deeper, with money flowing in all directions but significant risk with it.Considering this is a Tom Cruise film, I was surprised how quickly it came and went from the cinemas in the UK. Based on a true story, the film rattles through the plot with a Goodfellas air but an inconsistent control of what it is trying to do and how it is trying to do it. It is a caper to be sure, and it has a broad humor to it; but at the same time it does have consequences and real drama behind it. It tries to do both of these things but it doesn't manage it. As a result the dirty, greasy heat of the drama knocks the swagger out of the fun, while the broad sense of caper it tries to deliver makes it feel disconnected from the stakes and realism of the drama. While both sort of work, neither really work that well.Cruise is equally in two places. On one hand I thought he played it really well and convinced in his performance, but at the same time he never stopped being Tom Cruise with his winning smile and slick ways; it broke me out of the character too much and too often. The supporting cast has plenty of talent in there too, but the fast pace and slightly superficial story-telling means nobody ever has time to bed in and make something of their characters outside of Cruise. Production values are high and do well to give the film a sense of time and place with design and delivery.Overall though, it is a fairly forgettable film that tries hard but doesn't convince. You can see the goals of Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street, but it doesn't get close and generally undercuts itself with inconsistency in what it is doing.",,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining Action-Comedy,"Not expecting an action-comedy when viewing a film about drug smuggling for cartels along with CIA involvement, but it does work on many levels. The chemistry between Cruise and the actor who plays his CIA liaison is great, as is Cruise's interactions with the various cartel members. Cruise's relationship with his wife is somewhat unique and not exactly the typical marital relationship, which is somewhat refreshing: he is a dedicated family man but ""leaps before he looks, which gets him into a lot of trouble. ""The filming style is along the lines of a '80s TV cop show like Miami Vice, which I think is the look they were going for (although not as sleek).

What a pilot...,"""American Made"" is a Biography - Action movie in which we watch an ordinary pilot who was working for TWA before he was recruited by the CIA. Since he was very good at his jobs in South America the Medellín Cartel, associated with Pablo Escobar recruited him because they needed a person with his exceptional skills. With all of these jobs, he became a drug trafficker, gun smuggler, and money launderer and he received the title, 'The gringo that always delivers'.I liked this movie very much because it was based on a true story so, it had a very interesting plot and many good action scenes. It also combined and connected very well some points of Medellín Cartel with Barry Seal and the jobs they did together. Regarding the direction of the movie which was made by Doug Liman I believe that it was very good since he succeeded in making this movie so interesting and with many unexpected surprises and scenes. About the interpretations, I have to admit that Tom Cruise who played as Barry Seal was simply amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarah Wright's who played as Lucy Seal and Domhnall Gleeson's who played as Monty 'Schafer'.Finally, I have to say that ""American Made"" is a nice movie with many good action scenes, an interesting plot and many good interpretations. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to like it. If you are a fan of action movies which are based on true stories or events then this is the movie you have to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Mess,"It's naive to expect truth from 'based-on-true-story' projects, but narrative content should be required ingredient. 'American Made' plays like a movie trailer throughout its two-hour length, stirring together the standard motifs of 1980s cocaine smuggling sagas like 'Blow'. The story boils down to a procession of mustachioed Colombian cartel bosses, DEA agents and drug-courier aviators hauling cocaine, firearms and bags of cash around jungle landing strips, hotel lobbies and small town banks in the ugly fashions of the day.Tom Cruise portrays pilot protagonist Barry Seal as an easygoing coke-smuggling, gun-running, Caddy-driving adventurer. His self-deprecating charm and aerial dare-devilry are supposed to hold the film together, but both charisma and exploits seem stale. After the CIA persuade Seal to aid their anti-communist follies in Central America, he fends off the various suspicions and demands of his dumb blonde wife, crooked associates and two-faced CIA handlers. The script never develops any of these stock characters as the story unfolds with the depth of a music video. At the conclusion, there's little reason to believe a word of it, or care what happens to any of the participants.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Solid crime-comedy yarn,"Based on a story that would be completely unbelievable if it wasn't true, this crime-comedy yarn follows commercial pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) as he undertakes work for the CIA, the Medellin Cartel, and the White House. Often all at once. Not taking itself too seriously—murder, drug smuggling and civil wars all casually occurring with little on screen consequence—this flick is operating in strange moral territory where our protagonist is presented as a kinda-hero living the American dream. It coasts by largely on charm and light-hearted hijinks, with director Doug Liman delivering a spate of stylish filmmaking flourishes to create an exuberant atmosphere of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll that glosses over the moral murkiness. It helps that Cruise is in top gear; his Barry is excitable but level-headed, devious but likable, jokey but intelligent. It's a nice return to form after the excruciatingly bad The Mummy earlier this year. Yet overall the film doesn't quite elevate from good to great. From a comedy perspective it's amusing but lacking laugh-out-loud moments, as a thriller it's occasionally tense without being nail-biting, and as a biopic it's interesting yet never enthralling. A solid truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tale despite failing to truly excel, American Made is a fun and breezy viewing best served by lowered expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

American Made (2017),"Tom Cruise back flying planes again? I'm down for that even if there isn't any Kenny Loggins to vibe to. He's had a terrible time this year starring in the ill-fated The Mummy, so I was hoping for something better this time around. A very positive instrument for the film was having Doug Liman at the helm. I'm a fan of him so had faith that this would entertain. Overall, its not amazing but is decent enough with a typically good Tom Cruise character performance.The film is based on the true story of Barry Seals, the former pilot who gets hired by the CIA to initially get surveillance photos in Central America. However, Seals soon gets drawn into the life of transporting drugs, goods, and weapons to armies and different dealers. He becomes affiliated with the Medellin Cartel and starts doing business with Pablo Escobar. Things get out of hand and he becomes wanted by the FBI and DEA. Seals becomes rich but the costs that come with it become overbearing.The thing I like about Liman is he can work a decent script and works well in close quarters with a minimalist script (this is me basically praising The Wall). I found the events of the film interesting and a bit astonishing, especially if all the government agencies got involved in the ordeal the way the film portrays. Tom Cruise is good in it and makes it worth the watch even when the film falters. His cockiness and energy given to the performance is a strong point.There's a lot going on in the film and you have to keep up with the things Seals is told to do. I found Domhnall Gleeson's ""agent"" character mysteriously enticing, though was sad to hear that there's no real factual basis for the role. Overall, its not exactly a must see but a committed Cruise performance and rich real life basis makes the film a positive viewing experience.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood finally gets it right,"When Hollywood gets it right and stops making movies for children they can actually make a beauty like this one. My wife and I just returned from such an accomplished film some minutes ago: American Made.We have seen Tom Cruise in a number of his previous films (not necessarily by choice) and both of us kind of cringed at his screen presence. He delivered his lines well enough, but we did not see him as a genuine character; he seemed always to be playing his roles rather than living them. The exception was the movie we attended this afternoon; Cruise ""stepped into the role"", he became Barry Seal and us, the audience lived his demise with him from airline pilot to cocaine courier to arms smuggler for the American government.This movie could not have been made while Ron Reagan was alive and the other principles like Ollie North sat in positions of decision-making power close to the Oval Office. This movie was about Barry Seal, Drug Smuggler and tangentially about the evil and stupidity that lurked in the minds of people that ran the American government and caused the deaths of many thousands of people in Central America.This is a brave and thoughtful film that all lovers of America should see; besides its political strength see it because of it is a high film making aptitude.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"American Made has a nostalgic tone and along with it's comedic storytelling, make it a fun drug smuggling movie","You have to admire the people that will do anything to provide for their family. There are those that work the long hours and ones who steal to feed their starving ones. I understand one has to do something in order to be sure that you kids can sleep soundly knowing they'll have breakfast in the morning, but if someone is breaking the law or getting involved with the wrong people, is it still about the family or does it become a selfish need? A lot of that depends on what it is your providing. I guess that line should be drawn if you know there's a chance that your own choices can get the people close to you hurt.Today's movie focuses on a real person who originally went to work for one thing, only to end up with more from the other side. It may have meant a bigger home, more cash, and a happier wife, but like a lot of darker stories involving a crime family, eventually gets too over their own heads. What makes these stories fascinating is how much is explored of their personality that gives them the impression that this is okay. Let's see how American Made can do with this.In 1978, airline pilot Barry Seal (played by Tom Cruise) is put into contact with the CIA through agent Monty Schafer (played by Domhnall Gleeson). Seal is asked to fly missions over Central America to take pictures of rebels and possible Soviet guerrillas. He accepts, and is given a fast plane with cameras. Though he ends up getting shot at half of the time, Seal is a good enough pilot to fly there and back. During one of his flights, he's taken by a Colombian cartel who offers him big cash to smuggle cocaine to the states. The greed gets the best of him and he accepts.When the DEA starts to track him, the CIA moves Seal and his family to Arkansas, giving him a home along with a airport and two thousand acres. As the years go into the eighties, he ends up doing more such as exchanging information with rebels and even flying some of them to the states for military training. This gives Seal so much money that even the banks are running out of space to put it. How long will the CIA continue to turn the other cheek as Seal continues his mission? I will not dare reveal that.Though I've seen drug smuggling stories before (I'm not even a big fan of them), American Made is not only very funny and informative, it's actually a smart parody of the 1980's obsession with materialism and Yuppie lifestyles. The film is shot a lot like a documentary, which gives it an edge to sell this guys story, which sounds like a Hollywood story (though it seems to insane to be made up). Intercut is a lot of explanation with ties to the White House and how this even connects to the Cold War and Gulf War.Typically, Tom Cruise is the kind of actor who is rarely playing a part, and lets his charisma become the character. American Made doesn't slip him into a role, but he seems perfect anyway as this kind of guy would have to be a Tom Cruise-type. As a matter of fact, I liked a good chunk of these actors like his wife, the cartel leaders and the CIA agent. They all sync in line with Tom Cruise and the comedy that this story entitles.I'll say though that as interesting as the story is, it suffers a lot of the same issue that I have with stories of people on top that eventually fall; them enjoying the riches. Had the movie cut at least fifteen minutes, this might have been one of my favorites of the year, but a lot of the movie is Tom Cruise using his money to build his home and the Arkansas townand that's it. It doesn't show many of the characters questioning him (though it does get a subplot going that continues the film's story) nor does it even show his character devolving. Despite the pacing, I can say that I still had fun with this.I'll give this seven beta cameras out of five. American Made feels like a documentary from the eighties that was just found now. It has a nostalgic feeling, but is cinematic enough to feel a bit timeless. Tom Cruise fans and history fans should have a good time with this.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome! Tom Cruise's best movie yet,"Lured by adventure and bucket loads of cash, a gutsy TWA pilot takes on flight operations for both the CIA and a Columbian drug cartel.In this pacey action film, Tom Cruise pulls off the ultimate feat of an A List actor- he disappears in the role of Barry Seale, ace pilot, lover of risk, dedicated husband and father, and player of games with some pretty shady people. It's a fun role, but deadly serious, and Cruise gets the tone just right.The director Doug Liman weaves his magic to recreate the effect of being there- in the naive eighties, in the middle of all the fun of flying and unexpected opportunity, with the cautionary tale of Barry Seal a window into the world of corruption we only only saw glimpses of at the time. My only complaint was that third act dragged a little, but it's a real life story, so what can you do.Full credit to the excellent Domnhall Gleeson as the CIA spy who lures Barry into the web, he's one to watch in the future.And kudos to Cruise who apparently did his own stunts.

Didn't go far enough,"Tom Cruise is an interesting actor to me.  He is rock solid when he is doing his action thing in films like EDGE OF TOMORROW or the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series - it doesn't get much better than he is in these films.  It is when he tries to break free from the ""Action Hero"" stereotype that his track record is spotty.  For every MAGNOLIA or TROPIC THUNDER there is an EYES WIDE SHUT or INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.  So how did he do when he went off the beaten path once again in American MADE?He did just fine.  Not GREAT, not POORLY...he did fine.And that's the issue with this film - it is ""fine"", where it needed to be ""crazy great"" to succeed.American MADE tells the ""based on a true story"" tale of Barry Seal a TWA pilot who becomes a pilot for the CIA, he gets in deeper and deeper and, eventually, is the one the leading players in what would become to be known as the Iran-Contra scandal during the Ronald Regan Presidency.Cruise, on paper, looks like a good choice to play Seal.  He has the swagger and the ""devil-may-care"" attitude that is needed.  What Cruise is lacking, I feel, is to let go of the ""governor"" and just let it fly (kind of like Leonardo DiCaprio in WOLF OF WALL STREET).  Cruise just doesn't do it.  He doesn't let go.  He ""pretends"" to let go, but he never really does.  You can see him trying, yet pulling himself back and it is because of this hesitancy, that his performance, ultimately, doesn't work for me.He is surrounded by a decent (but not strong) Supporting cast.  Seal's wife is portrayed by Sarah Wright - she is ""fine"", solid but unspectacular.  His CIA handler is portrayed by Domnhall Gleeson and he is ""fine"", solid but unspectacular.  Even the wild and crazy Central American drug lords are portrayed in a ""fine"", but unspectacular fashion.  They needed to let go of the governor like Alfred Molina did in BOOGIE NIGHTS, but they just don't go far enough.With almost all of the performances going to - but never crossing over - a line, I will lay the blame on the Director, Doug Liman (so good as a Director in EDGE OF TOMORROW).  I don't know if he toned down the vision of this film to appeal to his Studio Bosses or if his sensibilities just didn't allow this film to ""go there"", but whatever it is, the film falls flat where it could have (should have) soared and was a missed opportunity.This film is ""entertaining enough"" if you go to it, but I wouldn't tell you to rush right out and see this.Letter Grade:  B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Review - American Made,"It is an enjoyable movie, with a really dynamic directing, but unfortunately, it doesn't innovate.The movie would have been way better if it was able to separate from the influence of its predecessors like Lord of War and The Big Short.The cast, in general, is playing decently, but there is zero nuance or facial expression most of the time, and the intervention ""Barry Seals"" when he is breaking the fourth wall are pretty useless to the plot itself, he is commenting on something that we already saw or understood.It is not particularly a movie that I would recommend except if you want to look at all the filmography of Tom Cruise.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The story is interesting and would be outlandish were it not true, but it is also inherently repetitive and seemingly low-stakes for its majority.","'American Made (2017)' feels much longer than it is thanks mainly due to its inherently repetitive and tightly-packed source story. Though it almost lacks any tangible consequences until its very last moments, the journey is thankfully a generally fun and entertaining one which relishes in its ever-so-slight absurdity. It seems strange that the picture would play so light once you know where it ends up, though the memory of the real-life man may have been better served in this way than with some dour dramatic piece, and the seventies funk elements that often distort the feature are a little bizarre considering that most of it takes place in the eighties.

Cruise is superb. Entertaining film about a morally questionable real-life character.,"Cruise is superb in this film, and (in my opinion) his performance captures the audience's attention throughout the film. For me Sarah Wright (the main character's wife), and Alejandro Edda (a Cartel character) also made a mark on the film, with other actors being overshadowed. All in all this was a high-octane and highly entertaining film about real-life historical events that deserved to be made. On the negative side, I would say that it glamorizes the life of Barry Seal and makes him seem like a 'nice fun guy' which is unfortunate. The real-life Barry Seal was a drug smuggler who must have cared nothing for the people who suffered as a result of his drug-running, including the numerous victims of his Cartel 'friends'. Due to the controversial historical and political events portrayed (and also hinted at) in the film, it may have been deemed necessary to do this in order to produce the film in the first place...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid movie,This was an entertaining movie on many levels. Not only did I enjoy the story context of the main characters contribution to history (no spoilers) I thought once again Tom Cruise did a great job. I have one point which is not necessarily a negative but I thought in this movie Tom Cruise was doing his best Matthew McConaughey. I couldn't help but see McConaughey in this role and I have to suspect in my opinion Tom Cruise felt the same.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An entertaining take on a grim story,"Based on / inspired by true events, this movie augments the grimness of drug trafficking and covert operations involving civilians, and unravels the perils caused by a combination of boredom and an unchecked thirst for adventure. Doug Liman has artfully converted a serious storyline into an entertainer. The vintage cinematography very boldly displays accentuated colors, which underscores the seriousness of the story even through seemingly lighthearted scenes. And Tom Cruise has delivered yet another classic performance as a cavalier pilot (reminds you of something?). The screenplay is decent but the camera work can at times feel nauseating. The cast did a good job, but those depicting the drug cartel were less compelling (""Narcos"" has set a very high bar here...). Overall, an enjoyable, must-see entertainer.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I liked it,"A good film but very complicated, trying to remember all the different names and locations, it was useful how occasionally Tom Cruise gave a summary of everything he was doing and the occasional clips of the videos he made at the end of the film helped too.
I can't say I thought much of his accent (and when he was giving the summary of the Cold War on the cartoon map the accent seemed to disappear entirely for some unknown reason?) but the overall acting was good; it was good that there was no 'running scene ' that Tom Cruise has become synonymous for in his past films.
Definitely one to watch again",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mediocre drug trafficking movie...,"I decided to watch this movie because Tom Cruise was in it, but little did I know what I was in for.Now, I can't claim to have much interest in the drug trade history of America, so the story here appealed only very little to me. But I still stuck with the movie to the end.This was nowhere near being one of the best of Tom Cruise movies to be honest. Sure, he was putting on a great performance, but the storyline was just working as an anchor here. I believe that the movie was based on real events, which just didn't help to boost the movie's appeal for me.I will say that they had a fairly good ensemble of acting performers together for the movie, though I didn't even recognize most of them. That was a good thing, because I do like seeing new actors and actresses in movies, as they are not already instantly associated with other movies or roles they have done before.This is the type of movie that you watch once and never again, because it just doesn't have enough contents to support multiple viewings.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Made is based on a true story,"American Made is based on a true story, that takes place in the 1980's, about an American commercial pilot who is recruited by both the C.I.A. and by Escobar's Colombian drug cartel. He first starts out gathering info and taking pictures from the sky for the C.I.A. but when he's made an offer that he cannot refuse by the Colombians to run drugs from Latin America to the U.S., his world changes at a break neck pace and the money starts rolling in.More questions are asked than answered in this movie. The movie itself is too busy relying on Cruise's movie star charm. He's smiles from behind his aviator shades as he deeply emerges himself in his character as Barry Seal. He reminded me of what may have become of a young ""Maverick"" from Top Gun if we were to see him as an adult 20 years later. This story is fast paced and it does manage to keep you entertained.Sarah Wright plays Cruise's wife Lucy. She's hilarious in her role as a girl who was working at KFC when she met her husband to the richest woman in a small Arkansas community where they are placed by the C.I.A. to run all kind of covert operations from gun running to smuggling in Nicaraguans to the U.S. to train them as ""freedom fighters.""American Made is definitely a star driven vehicle for Cruise and, to his credit, he acts well enough to make you forget that your watching Tom Cruise on screen. He's Barry Seal, ""the gringo who can get anything delivered"" and he is very believable. The movie also shows the corruption in that was widespread in Ronald Reagan's government, but that's another story.This movie is rated ""R"" for obscene language and some sexuality and it runs just under 2 hours long. American Made is not a great movie, but it will keep you entertained. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" it rates a LARGE.Hollywood Hernandez",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Drugs Are Bad, Mmmkay?","Doug Liman (Swingers, Edge of Tomorrow, Bourne) is one of those directors who's built a career on confident and skilled filmmaking without actually having much in the way of a specific voice. American Made fits that resume perfectly. He takes some familiar themes (love of money is the root of all evil, dishonesty inherent in the war on drugs) and a true American story, then molds into them perfectly. It gives us a Scorsese-like knock-off that isn't terribly original but is still a solid version of an all-too-true corruption story. Cruise stars as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot in the 1980s who is recruited by the CIA to be a courier for their dealings with Central American leaders, before becoming a drug runner. With intentionally rudimentary animation, edits to old news footage, and general 1980s filmmaking tendencies, it's full of great style and appreciated detail. The plane flying is fantastic, the costuming is sweaty and authentic, and the cash and throwing motifs are prevalent and effective. When Seal is slowly covered over by piles of cash, we get the idea pretty quickly that we are watching a guy get suffocated by his own desires. There's a lot packed into the film, and this is one of those rare occurrences in which I think this would be helped by being about an hour longer. While the details of the story are well covered, the characters, their motivations and their personalities get a bit looked over. Instead of being a full engrossing narrative, it comes off more like an information document. Nonetheless, American Made is a funny, cool and intriguing tale about governmental overreach and misappropriated power.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Another Tom Cruise fan service, with aspirations for more","""Forrest Gump"" flying high: meet the man who was too dumb to settle for an ordinary life like almost everybody else. Tom Cruise's latest is based on the amazing life of Barry Seal, the daredevil pilot who worked for the CIA, the White House AND a powerful drug cartel at the same time. Also appearing: April Billingsley, Domhnall Gleeson, Caleb Landry Jones, Alejandro Edda. Directed by Doug Lima, known for a number of action movies, including Go"" (1999), The Bourne Identity"", and Mr. and Mrs. Smith"". He's, however, much less known for serious"" movies, which he also likes to do occasionally. Let's hope ""American Made"" will be his game-changer, because most of the personality it has owes thanks to Liman's work as director, mixing so-called period piece (the last half of 1970's and the first half of 80's) with his shaky-cam and cameras-up-close approach plus breathless editing first introduced in The Bourne Identity"". It's not a style everybody likes but it manages to give the result its very own unique vibe – and it's also compatible with the whirlwind kind of life mr Seal seemed to prefer. Everything else here is less inspired. I mean, it works fine but, essentially, we are watching the same ""rags to riches to rags again"" type of American success story that we've served countless times over the last 30 years since Oliver Stone's Wall Street"" made it popular. To be exact, the 114 minute movie is eventful, but story-wise we get only this often-copied blueprint and little else. The actors are certainly competent but there are no interesting characters to root for. Caleb Landry Jones is always cool, of course, but he has such a small role. Cruise is, of course, too much of a big star to really go into his character. He doesn't vanish in his protagonist such as, for example, Matthew McConaughey in ""Gold"" (another this year's movie about great adventurer which has copied ""Wall Street"" formula). His version of this unique man is still the same Cruise persona we've known for ages, only this time less ass-kicking and million- dollar-smile flashing because he plays a common man. Of course, Cruise still has a lot of charisma, but he turns ""American Made"" into just another Cruise project – based on good idea, lots of stuff going down, screenplay and characters are not intriguing. Often, this equation can work out quite well, especially in action- oriented movies. The other times, such as in American Made"", I want to enjoy the result more than I actually did. Still, it's probably a better movie than this long-planned Top Gun"" sequel they're still developing for Cruise.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great rebound move for Cruise,Tom Cruise hits a homer with the depiction of real life Captain Barry Seal who was a hot shot ex TWA pilot recruited into the CIA after getting caught smuggling drugs for the Mexican drug cartels during the 1980s. It was good to see him back in a great role and movie after his disastrous Mummy movie. Watching Barry Seal ascend to the top and subsequent fall reminded me of Ray Liotta's depiction of mobster Henry Hill in the movie Goodfellas. The move was a bit of a comedy wrapped around a serious story with an unfortunate ending. I really liked seeing Sarah Wright in this film playing his wife. I have never seen her in a mainstream film but look forward to seeing her in the future.The plot was fast flowing with very little pauses or breaks. I was quite surprised how quickly the time passed while watching. The aerial film sequences and location was worth the price of admission. The film was bright and the sound was great unlike so many crime films today filmed in low light/night. The 80's props and clothing was very authentic and believable. Although the whole movie surrounds drug smuggling there was almost zero scenes showing drug usage. I probably would not watch again as the plot outcome is the big reveal.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

An entertaining take on an unbelievable true story,"If American Made proves one thing it's that truth is stranger than fiction. The story of American aircraft pilot Barry Seal who became a drug smuggler working for the Medellin cartel, casually rubbed shoulders with Pablo Escobar and ran a massive money laundering operation all while being employed by the CIA, would seem a stretch even by Hollywood's standards. Yet it's precisely the ""based on true events"" part of Seal's story that makes American Made such a fascinating film to watch.We are first introduced to Seal as a disillusioned TWA pilot looking for something to put the thrill back in his life. When approached by the CIA to fly reconnaissance of communist factions in South America, he immediately jumps at the opportunity. Flying solo from the US on his own private two- engine plane, it's not long before Seal is intercepted by the Medellin cartel and offered large amounts of cash to smuggle drugs into the US. Ever the opportunist, Seal agrees and soon finds himself playing on both sides of the law and making more money than he knows what to do with. But as the demands from both sides grow increasingly untenable, Seal finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place, with his luck quickly drying up.Tom Cruise brings his manic charisma to the role of Seal, and he's a good fit for the highflying, larger than life character. It's hard not to look with contempt at a man who transported illegal narcotics into the US en masse, but Cruise does a good job in humanising Seal and portraying him as more than just a criminal. At heart, Seal is a family man looking to provide for his wife and daughter but whose unrelenting pursuit of the American dream finds him working on both sides of the law.The charisma Cruise brings to the role goes a long way in making Seal an endearing protagonist, and he seems to have fun in the role. Following the underwhelming performance of The Mummy earlier this year, American Made represents a return to form for him and a welcome return to the more grounded narratives in which he fares far better with.Director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, Fair Game) complements Cruise's commanding performance with his highly energised filming style. The camera is rarely steady for more than a beat and its constant zooming, shaking and moving around lends the film an effective faux doco feel. On the flipside, however, the incessant camera movements are distracting during some of the quieter moments in the film. In one simple conversation scene in a diner, near the beginning of the film, the camera haphazardly changes angles and abruptly zooms in towards the characters as they speak. It's awkwardly staged and distracts from the dialogue. Luckily the film moves at such a fast clip that Liman's hyperactive filming works mostly well but some restraint would have gone a long way during the smaller scenes.Overall American Made is a fascinating biopic about a larger than life character. The film benefits greatly from Cruise's committed performance and Liman's lively direction to provide an entertaining take on an unbelievable true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tom Cruise is outstanding in this brilliantly satirical black comedy,"This movie is an absolutely hilarious black comedy, and all the funnier because we know we really shouldn't find the subject matter funny (as it involves the smuggling of tonnes of cocaine from Colombia to the US), but Tom as Barry Seal is so disarmingly roguish as the happy-go-lucky lead that I found it impossible not to forgive his crimes as a pawn in a really huge game with gigantic major players.Barry starts the movie as a airline pilot in a mundane job which he sometimes tries to shake up (literally) to make it a little more entertaining. He is a small-time smuggler of cheap contraband, and the CIA uses knowledge of this fact to recruit him into the big time. They hire him as a CIA contractor to take reconnaissance photos of the ""commies"" in Nicaragua, and to pick up intel from General Noriega in Panama. This leads Pablo Escobar and his two mates to recruit Barry as a cocaine smuggler, as he is always flying between Central America and the USA with the CIA's help and can drop the drugs out of the plane without detection.The CIA agent in charge of Barry, Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) finds out about Barry's nefarious goings on, and gets him off the hook when he gets gaoled in Colombia on condition that he run guns for the Contras who are fighting the ""commies"" in Nicaragua. Tom agrees, but suffice it to say that the guns don't end up where they are supposed to and the cocaine operation for Escobar and his two Colombian mates ends up getting supersized.To get out of doing 30 years in gaol for drug trafficking, Barry ultimately does a deal with the White House (Oliver North and a senior DEA guy), but these two double-cross him and it all ends badly for Barry, except that he had a great time for eight years and made a huge amount of dough.My only beef with this film is that, unlike in another must-see film about this same subject called ""Kill the Messenger"" (2014 starring Jeremy Renner) this film does not make explicit the connection between the CIAs activities in Central American in the early to mid 80s and the importation of tonnes of cocaine into the USA to finance the war against the ""commies"" in Nicaragua, which Congress refused to back. Rather, in this move the CIA just keeps Barry out of gaol on condition that he fly heaps of guns to the Contras (which he doesn't in fact comply with), and allow Contras to do military training on the extensive property that the CIA has obtained for him in Mena, Louisiana. (Most of these ""soldiers"" just want to get to the USA and couldn't care less about fighting ""commies"", and abscond the first chance they get).Despite the slight bending of historical fact to appease the CIA and company (the CIA admitted in 1998 to using cocaine money to fund the Contras in a 400 page document which went unreported in the US media thanks to the absurd controversy about President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski), this film is a very rewarding and hilarious thrill ride into high stakes espionage and drug smuggling by ""the man who always delivers"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Along the way he got mixed up the drug cartels and started smuggling drugs back the USA. Of course, he made a lot of unexplained money and eventually it was all going to catch back up to him. The movie teaches a good lesson to remember: don't screw over the cartel. Barry met the fate that he couldn't out run once he was outed for spying for the US government on the cartels.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not good.,"First of all, the cinematography was garbage. I guess some directors think that it looks good to film a movie as if it were filmed by an amateur using a go-pro. Not only were the camera shots always shaky, they weren't even good. Some shots just seemed pointless. As if some high school first-time videographer was trying out shots that they thought would look good, like putting the camera on the floor. How creative. Not. Also, many shots seemed like they were zoomed in too far, cropping focal points out of the scene.I personally don't think such camera techniques look good. They look cheap. The idea of a movie is to sink in to it and ""forget"" you're even watching a movie. Well, this camera person didn't have that concept in mind. Not at all.Some videographers & directors take big risks trying out unique camera shots, and for some films their experiments work out. But it many others, they don't. And in this one, their unique camera style did not work.And now going beyond the awful videography, I felt like the writing wasn't even that great. And ontop of that, I felt that the acting wasn't even that great. A real good movie has every cast member fitting a scene. A lot of the characters felt like actors. It felt cheap.And besides the bad filming, poor-writing & sub-par acting, the movies whole storyline seems to glorify criminal drug-runners & make them look like a bunch of fun cool guys. In reality, that's not the case. The big cocaine dealers are hard criminals.And furthermore, while the movie doesn't officially state that the CIA themselves were smuggling cocaine, it's clear they were. And for someone spin that as a good thing; pumping hard life-ruining narcotics into neighborhoods that otherwise would have been void of drugs, is absurd. Doesn't matter if they are ""funding anti-communist matters"". Not only would such tactics be ultimately irrelevant to US taxpayers interests, it in effect destroys US communities.All around I found this film to be poorly produced & a dismal portrayal of any sort of realism. It's just a big Hollywood cool-guy party where are the characters are hip sunglass wearing party animals having fun swimming in money & enjoy life! There's no realism in the characters; it's absurd.After one painful hour I left the theater.I read one reviewer saying ""this is Tom Cruise's best film!""Wow. Obviously their film criticism has no value.To rate this film alongside Mission Impossible films, Jack Reacher, Edge of Tomorrow, War of Worlds & Oblivion is totally absurd.Sadly I'd put this film in the same basket as ""The Mummy"".",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A few too many montages and some underdeveloped characters, but funny & fast-paced with non-stop laughs and thrills","Biopics can be a tricky genre, their conventions prone to becoming stale and boring. Yet Liman and Cruise together brought us a refreshing and intriguing take on sci-fi/action films in Edge of Tomorrow – can they do the same for biopics? In short, yes and no. Though a simple but exciting story well-told and fun to watch, the biopic conventions and structures are the same we've seen before and become a little monotonous and repetitive.In terms of structure and story it's very reminiscent of lots of crime biopics, particularly Scorsese's Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street; there are so many similarities – fans of these films are bound to enjoy elements of American Made, rife with innumerable montages and voice-overs. The problem is, once you take a step back and really look at it, there are just so many. A couple of scenes, then a montage with a voice-over, then another scene, followed by another montage accompanied by a montage; rinse repeat (and repeat). This is the structure the film follows for the majority of its run-time and it does start to wear a little thin, feeling repetitive.Still, the plot itself is fairly light and simple while also being fun and entertaining, charting the progression of Barry's journey from rags to riches (and inevitably rags again), yet within these montages they cram so much in, it feels like an epic journey with a huge story. So much enjoyable detail is packed into these montages while still keeping the story flowing at an excellent pace that we never really get tired of the constant montages. They're fun, often amusing, and bring so much for us to enjoy. The film just doesn't slow down for you to think, evoking its protagonist's adrenaline- seeking nature – this is where so much of the fun and personality in the story come from.More than this though, the montages are a perfect showcase of the style and personality the director injects into the film. The voice-overs are perfect accompaniments to the fun montages (full credit given to both Tom Cruise for his delivery and Gary Spinelli for his excellent screenplay), but it's the director's style that makes this film a fun affair, constantly laughing and poking fun at the danger Barry frequently finds himself in. It's light and comedic, with animated maps that are like a cross between Indiana Jones and Dad's Army. The music choices too aren't only authentic to the era, plunging us headfirst into the 1970s and 1980s, but really put us in the giddily excitable mood we should be in as we enjoy watching Barry get away with everything. It's a fun, cocky style that suits the main character and drives the film.While Cruise's performance is spot-on, his portrayal of Barry Seal is similar to many other characters he's played; lovable, but cocky guys who always have a smart way out, laughing in the face of danger all the while. In many ways really he carries this film, showing his real talent as an actor since we never get fed up of nearly 2 hours of nigh on constant Tom Cruise. Still this is largely due to the fact that the script rarely gives anyone else a chance. The character we see the next most of would be Domhnall Gleeson's CIA man Schafer, who is wonderfully ambiguous as we never know whether he's good or bad, whether Barry should trust him or not. He keeps this going for the whole film and plays well opposite Cruise; it's just a shame he doesn't get a chance for his character to develop to the extent it could have done. The Medellín cartel too are excellent, a careful balance of welcoming charm with a sinister undercurrent of cruel menace and violence.Sadly many other characters are unfairly marginalised, not having the screen time they really deserve. While Caleb Landry Jones has a nice brief turn as Lucy's annoying, trouble-making brother (a very similar role to his one in Get Out just a few months earlier), it's all too brief. This extends to the four pilots Barry recruits to join his little gang. Each of these characters could have been unique and quirky, befitting of the film's style and really enriching the roster of characters. Instead they're left by the wayside, occasionally appearing for plot-points or small laughs. It felt as if they were only included for the sake of accuracy to real life, whereas they could have been developed into wonderful little characters. Sarah Wright's Lucy however is the biggest missed opportunity. Continuing the comparison to The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese really did something excellent with Margot Robbie's character, Naomi, that part alone making the huge star she is today. If only the script had allowed for more to be made of Lucy in American Made. Beautiful, effortlessly sexy and loyal even when the going gets rough, Wright's portrayal is excellent and it's a joy to watch her. However, it feels like with a bit more she could have been more than just eye candy and the 'wife-left-back-home', the family scenes seeming less important that the money-grabbing main plot. Her inclusion improves as the film goes on, yet it still feels as though more could have been done with her.Funny, fast-paced and with tons of enjoyable detail in more montages than you can count, this is a fun, stylish biopic which you can't help but enjoy. Though the structure (particularly the montages) can become repetitive, not much is done to make it stand out or refresh the biopic genre and despite the film focusing too much on Cruise when there were some potentially excellent characters left on the side, this is a crime-comedy-biopic that never slows down, giving you all the thrills and excitement Cruise's character is in constant search of.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lighthearted Look at a Serious Subject,"I watched this movie after having watched Kill the Messenger with Jeremy Renner because it dealt with the same subject matter. I was anxious to see the similarities and differences between the two. One thing I have to say right away is that Kill the Messenger was a lot better.American Made deals with the CIA involvement in allowing drugs to flow into the US in order to surreptitiously arm the Nicaraguan Contras. Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) was a principal player in smuggling drugs into the U.S. as he was a pilot who was given the knowledge and resources to smuggle the drugs. He made millions of dollars in the process and was insanely successful at smuggling.The movie had a light tone and atmosphere. Maybe it was to match the attitude and demeanor of the main character or maybe not, but that was one thing I appreciated about Kill the Messenger. Kill the Messenger gave the issue the proper respect. It was treated seriously and there were even pertinent video clips showing the outrage from those who'd suffered due to drugs. American Made was the iterations of a loosey goosey adventurer type who was making more money than he knew what to do with. It was very lighthearted and humorous even though the topic was anything but.I liked the movie for the historical information it presented but nothing more than that. It's based upon a true story but we can only imagine how closely to the truth it adhered.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Tom Cruise headlines one of the most fun, but problematic films of the year","We as Americans love to hear about the self-made man. Someone who saw an opportunity and made something for himself. American Made is the story of how Barry Seal, half CIA flyboy, half Colombian drug runner, made his fortunes by seizing a golden opportunity.Barry Seal is a Trans World Airlines pilot stuck in a boring life of taxying from destination to destination. He's a thrill seeker that gets his rush from smuggling in Cuban cigars. This attracts the attention of CIA agent Monty Schaffer who recruits Seal to take flyover pictures of suspected communist countries in Central America. After a few runs to through Colombia, Seal is roped into doing cocaine runs for drug lords, one of which happens to be Pablo Escobar. Barry is now making a fortune running drugs into America while also working for the government. Conflicts of interest start to arise and his loyalty is tested by both sides.The film flies at a breakneck pace, going from year to year in mere minutes. We see Barry with CIA in '77, then it quickly changes to '79 and the drug lords are introduced. The speed fits Barry's life since he was constantly flying for somebody, but it doesn't allow for situations to fully develop and breathe. Once something is explained, something else pops up. This causes confusion to build up around halfway through that never gets sorted out.Another problem with the story is how it inadequately juggles all the different parties involved in the plot. The CIA is introduced early but goes missing multiple times before popping up again for a short time. The plot involving the drug dealers take up most of the middle third but also go missing near the end.The message of American Made is explained right in the title. Barry Seal was a real man that made a fortune off of America's ineptness at foreign policy and fighting the war on drugs. He is the essence of what every American dream to be. We condemn him for cheating the government and delivering illegal drugs, but also wish we were him because of the luxury and thrill that comes from that kind of life.People who enjoy Cruise-led action films such as will enjoy this because of the similar charm and fun intertwined with action scenes. The peril never feels that immediate and we always get the feeling that Cruise will talk his way out. I also expect the older generation to turn out for this because of the many plot points that circle around American politics during the 1970's. Younger viewers might not be that interested, but the people who lived during that time will get a kick out of it. Director Doug Liman sells the usual anti-American message that comes from films taking place in the turbulent 70's and 80's. We witness Reagan politics and the underbelly of the CIA working in Central America.The filming is done in the 70's style. Some images are out of focus and in many instances, you can see heavy grain. This works to the films benefit by making it feel more authentic and like the story is being told through a television screen from back then.Tom Cruise is exceptional as Barry Seal. He plays off his best features; good looks and ability to charm everyone in the room. The entire film is revolved around him and we never lose sight of him, which is a good thing here. Domhnall Gleeson is pretty good as the enigmatic and troublesome CIA agent Schaffer. Sarah Wright is another highlight as Barry's wife who gets pushed around because of his crazy adventures. Jesse Plemons barely supports as Sheriff Downing, which is good because his character really has no use in the film and should've been cut.American Made is one of those films that you know has problems, but you like it anyway because it's fun to watch.

Cruise is Back!!,"After seeing American Made , the only question that lingered in my mind was why Cruise even thinks of doing movies like The Mummy when he can be this entertaining. In this era, when the Home Entertainment options are very convenient and luxurious, Cruise is still the star one should exclusively see on the big screen. Story: Barry (Tom Cruise) is earning his crust as a TWA pilot when he's approached by a clean-cut smiling, young man called Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), who makes him an intriguing offer. Barry, who's clearly an adrenaline junkie, jumps at the offer, despite the fact he's married and a father. Surveillance work soon turns to gun-running to the Contra militias in Nicaragua, where a chance meeting with two gents called Ochoa and Escobar leads to even riskier work. Direction: Doug Liman who has worked with Cruise before in the superb ' Edge of Tomorrow' does great work here.His now-signature camera moves - the quick pull-zooms and shaky hand-held shots add to the realism of the movie. He also keeps the pace fast so it never feels boring. Acting: Domnhall Gleeson plays a convincing second hand to Cruise. He stands on his own. Sarah wright does a convincing job in playing Barry Seal's Wife. Final Words: So, All in all American Made is a superb crime - thriller that is made more special by Cruise whose star power is in full display here.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
How to do major crimes and get away with it,"I never heared of Barry Seal before, but now that I saw the movie/biography I won't forget about him. The least you can say about his story is that it is quite incredible. Incredible because of the things he got away with, big major crimes. But then again nothing surprises me anymore as you know that politicians, judges and all the so-called high elite are all corrupted. There is a law for the rich and a law for the poor and this movie is the perfect example of it. The fact that the movie is based on a true story makes it even better because you can better relate to it and understand more about how everything worked at that time. The only bad thing I could say about this movie/biography is that they should just stick to the facts like they happened and not embellish anything. At one point all major law enforcements like the FBI, CIA, ATF, DEA and the State Police all try to bust somebody at the same time without knowing about eachother's plans. That I am sure never happened. It's the only minor point that bugged me a bit. For the rest the filming was good, there was the right amount of suspense, the cast was good, aspecially Tom Cruise as the major character. It's an incredible story, that sometimes makes you wonder how the hell this all could have happened.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a must see,I put this thriller on my watchlist. Then I had the chance to see it on the flight to New York by seat screen. It is an akay movie and Tom Cruise delivered an entertaining performance. It shows only the story of pilot Barry Seal.

There are certain things that should stay in the 80's.,"And Tom Cruise is one of them.Let's be honest here. Tom Cruise has never been a good actor, he just got where he is now due to contacts, his agency and especially physical aspect, to attract women and girls. He is a real drip. Whose only good performances is the good-looking hero who said good one-liners (Mission Impossible - a franchise that Hollywood created on purpose only to increase his ego, in which he is the only relevant character there), or the patriarch service, scenes of Tropic Thunder, are the perfect example what he does well, a guy who likes to be the boss and abuse women and employees.Now with this pathetic movie, someone wants to convince me that Cruise can play Barry Seal, a guy who gets out in front of the government, a Latino drug cartel, drug barons, CIA, FBI or more than a thousand and one things yet to be made or discovered by man. Hell no. If someone at Hollywood want to make a convincing Barry Seal, bring someone with the caliber of Josh Brolin. That would give this project even more credit. And who had the sad idea to make Cruise the narrator of this film. I hate this one-liner, I'm the only guy, who always delivers. I do not even remember half the movie. The way the film is so bad structurally.But Tom Cruise is not the only flaw in this project (this project was born crooked at birth). The movie itself was never taken seriously. What do you expect from a movie coming out after the summer season? A serious film about a serious subject, with a good script and a good acting? No way.The movie is full of useless sex jokes typical of larger-budget films from Hollywodd, the Tom Cruise scene having sex with his wife in the cockpit of the plane is ridiculous or Tom Cruise's character constantly showing the ""butt""- It's deplorable, I know. Or male jokes like Tom Cruise facing 100 or more Hispanics with a baseball bat. Incompetent scene.The direction of the film is flawed, the pace is horrendous, there are some scenes too long, or some too short. The acting is too fake, especially on the part of Jayma Mays (the most unbelievable justice solicitor, I have ever seen) and Sarah Wright (the windy head, annoying, generic woman of Barry Seal).Holes in the script (no one has remembered the corpse of the useless brother of the wife of Barry Seal, the police in this film is really useless and unprepared, by the way).Not to forget how this film treats the people of Latin America, whose only humans that appear in the film, are drug dealers, murderers or pornography lovers. Or the people of Mena, that this film represents as useless morons from the countryside.What a useless and terrible movie we have here. Someone burns this movie as fast as possible. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom Cruise crushes it again,"Let me start out by acknowledging that ""American Made"" was not a true story. People, the Millenium Falcon never actually made the Kessel Run either. I'd rather they hadn't mucked the movie up with their anti-Reagan/anti-Oliver North trope, but it's Hollywood. What can you expect?Still, the movie was great. Cruise WAS that guy. He sweated when he should have sweated. He smiled that impish smile. He made the ""how am I going to deal with all this cash"" scenes seem believable. How could you not like that guy and sympathyze with his fate?In addition to Tom, the movie was beautifully cast. The CIA guy, though the character was not believable, was played to the hilt. Even the non-speaking 15 year-old girl who the exquisitely weaselly brother-in-law picked up was perfect. I can still see her posture.This film was was different from ""Knight and Day,"" but every bit as entertaining. You should watch both of them (twice).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom adds another fitting role to his Filmography.,"American Made a 2017 crime drama staring Tom cruise as a pilot (Barry Seal) that is working for the CIA and the Medellin Cartel during the 70s and 80s. This story is ""based"" on true events. The director Doug Liman which is best known for the Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow and Swingers(maybe not the last one).The over tone of this film feels very similar to the Bourne films with its faster paced scenes and is rather enjoyable to watch. The film is the type you watch when you're sick at home and can't find something to watch. I'm a Tom Cruise fan and regardless if you like him or not, he has great energy and genuinely adds another fitting role to his Filmography. I never enjoy spoiling the film for people so i won't talk about the plot, i will say that it's surprising on where the story ends. I wanted more. There were some fantastic aerial shots throughout the film. I enjoyed that being set in the 80s you felt that is was shot then too. Now and then it would cut to Barry recording himself though a old video recorder which added greatly to the overall feel of the film. For the most part i enjoyed this movie, it could have been cut down by 20 mins. Certain parts seemed a bit unnecessary but other than that i was pleasantly pleased by it and would recommend to anyone that wants to see something new.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The Wolf of Mena, Arkansas","A story about a con artist having the time of his life, tons of money, hot wife and all, till the payback time came. Oh yeah? That's too innovative to be true!But even if Martin Scorsese haven't made his masterpiece four years ago, American Made would still not feel great. This typical story of a smug guy getting his hands dirty, just a bit at first, and, little by little, he's shoulder deep in some complex mess and has a hard time hiding cash in suitcases - it feels so overused that even the custom set of plot zigzags or the quirky little scenes don't transform it into anything you'd really wanna pay attention to.It's hardly Tom Cruise's fault - after all, he's doing what he's always been doing, that is, smiling wide, talking smooth and emanating confidence. Neither it's the fault of any other cast member. Especially Caleb Landry Jones: this guy seems to be everywhere hot this season. And even if this movie will definitely not become the peak of his thespian career, the likes of Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are an alibi enough.Maybe we should simply admit that this film was never supposed to be anything great. Just a generic crime adventure with an already infamous ""based on real events"" stamp. To be great wasn't even the goal - to avoid being a failure was (mostly a box office one). But fear not: the sufficient amount of properties of a consumable product is here. Will it taste good? Probably not really. But who cares about taste as long as you don't make a scene and don't ask for a refund. Nothing personal, just business.

American made is a typical Liman film,Doug Liman has become adept at making spy movies and American made is a typical Liman film which reunites him with his Edge of Tomorrow lead Tom Cruise. Loosely based on real events American Made is quirky and funny enough to appeal to mainstream audiences but also retains an offbeat charm. Cruise is in top form and reminds us why he's been a top dog in this business for over a quarter of a century now. American Made isn't a must watch but it is good enough to spend 12 dollars in the theater. (Great collaboration between Liman and Cruise),,Anonymous,Biography
"Good Movie, but could have been better","I entered the movie theatre expecting movie similar to the Wolf of Wall Street, American Gangster, Lord Of War etc. These are landmark films, which have developed a cult following over time. It did help that the movie starred international Superstar Tom Cruise - a star renowned for his action flicks. We were expecting a high dose of action & drama. Biopics have a good chance of succeeding if a lot of time has been devoted to researching the principal character & having a tight script in place.The makers have devoted good amount of time researching the life of Barry Seal - the CIA agent, who also ferried cocaine for the Medellin cartel of Pablo Escobar & it shows. But they falter in scripting the life journey of Barry Seal. Although a lot of exciting things may have happened during the life & times of Barry Seal, it is not shown in a manner which excites the audience. It feels more like a plain jane reportage of the events that happened in Barry Seal's life. The director has to be blamed for not building up the excitement like Martin Scorcese did in Wolf Of Wall Street or the way Lord Of War starring Nicholas Cage was made. The film does show a lot of improvement in the second half. It is one of the movies which has a better second half. The second half feels a tad bit similar to Lord Of War, but it still does keep you engrossed till the end. Tom Cruise is convincing in his role. We were a bit let down by the character playing Pablo Escobar. Netflix has set the benchmark for how the legendary Medellin drug cartel boss has to be portrayed. You expect Pablo Escobar to be a menacing character who very mention makes people shudder. But the guy playing Pablo in this movie seems like a caricature of the Netflix version. The makers probably did not want the attention to shift away from Tom Cruise! We weren't bored while watching the movie, but the movie lacked the adrenaline inducing, end of the seat ride that other aforementioned movies in the genre offer. A lot of people will probably will watch the movie, but what could have been an Oscar winning performance by Cruise is reduced to just another caper.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

All the performances are good but Cruise is just outstanding. The first act and third act are very good but some parts of the second act drag quite a bit.Overall American Made is a very good movie with a great direction and great colors.

American Made is An Exciting Trip Piloted Expertly by Liman and Cruise,"This is one of those stories that is so crazy that you can't believe it could be true (I'm not sure what is and isn't 100% factual). The fact that this guy could be recruited and get swept up in so many different cons is unbelievable. Compounding that, the fact that he didn't get how dangerous this was is remarkable. The people behind this movie could spin straw to gold but I think the movie benefits immensely from having a compelling story to draw from. You also get some understanding about politics during the Cold War. The film is smart enough not to get too bogged down in what could be dry/heavy material and they wrap it up with some style to make it easier to wrap your head around it.I think Barry Seal as a character will divide audiences. The movie tries to portray him as a thrill seeker who had exceptional skill but couldn't see past the end of his nose. Other people might view him as an opportunist that made a fortune playing one government agency against another and he personally helped further the drug trade in the U.S.A. I came down in the middle on him. I think the movie probably glosses over some of his darker aspects but he was ultimately a pilot whose greed and attitude both helped and hurt him. I tend to enjoy characters like this as protagonists, it's not always fun to follow the boy scout. Seal ends up being the sum of his decisions for better or worse and despite his missteps, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when they reached the epilogue.I think this was an excellent role for Tom Cruise to take. It can be hard to separate him from Ethan Hunt (his Mission Impossible character) and I like seeing him play more morally grey characters. He's charming as Barry Seal but he never portrays him as a hero. He's not a villain either but Cruise elevates his game to sell how Seal got caught up in this success and struggled getting out. His Cajun accent is decent and he did a good job. I was surprised how much I liked Sarah Wright as Lucy Seal. She's a pretty face for sure but her character has a little more depth than I anticipated. Her performance reminded me of Margot Robbie's performance as Naomi in The Wolf of Wall Street (if you pitted them head to head, I'd still pick Robbie but Wright more than held her own). I like Domhnall Gleeson in other things but I didn't think he was as good in this. His character couldn't seem to pick a lane between being very straight-laced or being a slick double-talker and I don't think he was charismatic enough to make me remember Schafer. Jesse Plemons and Caleb Landry Jones are good as Sheriff Downing and JB but they're not in the movie for very long. I'd also credit Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejia and Jayma Mays for being solid in their respective supporting parts.I was surprised at how American Made had a go-with-the-flow tone. It isn't hard to draw parallels between Seal's carefree attitude and how they decide to tell his story. The movie moves fast and it was pretty funny. They don't skate around how ridiculous Seal's situation is and they have no problem laughing along with you at his lack of common sense. His choices are taking him and his family down a path that almost everyone can see coming except him. They make the right call in keeping things light for the majority of it and I was laughing through most of the movie. But when the movie needs to show the consequences for his actions, the tone shifts appropriately. This can be jarring but I think they handled it about as well as they could have. Whether you like Seal or don't, his end is shocking but more or less expected.Most of my problems with American Made are small and easy enough to toss aside. It took me a little time to get invested in Barry's story, the movie wasn't as strong at the very beginning. There isn't much exposition and you have to float for a bit to grasp Barry's ongoing dilemma. But after a while, I caught up with the pace of the movie and I couldn't help but enjoy the ride. The other thing is that while the ending is properly dramatic and is a punch to the gut, the overall arc of the story is easy to plot. Stepping back from the story, it follows the same major beats as many other movies in this genre. We rise and we fall with Barry and while I thought the story carried me through most of those quibbles, for the more discerning viewer, it might be hard to look past.Doug Liman and Tom Cruise seem to be a good match for each other and they deliver an exceptional rise and fall caper movie. I love Edge of Tomorrow and they didn't disappoint in their follow-up. This is an interesting story that manages to be entertaining while sneakily teaching the audience about some of the inner-workings of the U.S. government and how they handled foreign conflicts in South America in the 1980s. I don't think this will make my 2017 top ten but I would be happy to see this again. I would encourage Liman and Cruise to continue making movies together and I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a fun crime story that happens to be a period piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Partially accurate tale of the drug smuggler from Baton Rouge. More like ""inspired by.""","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We have loose connections in that my wife worked in Baton Rouge when she first graduated from LSU, and Mena Arkansas was a favorite motorcycle destination for us back in the 1990s.Tom Cruise is excellent as Barry Seal, Baton Rouge native, who learned to fly very young and in his 20s became the youngest pilot for TWA, flying a route to/from Europe. But when he was tempted to get involved in a clandestine drug smuggling operation to/from central America he couldn't resist the big salary. He became involved with some of the biggest drug operations of the 1980s amd in the process moved his operation to Mena, Arkansas.This is a good movie of a core of a true story. But director Liman said that the film is ""a fun lie based on a true story"". Many liberties were taken with some characters, some timelines, and some events. In the movie, for example, he quit his airline pilot job. In real life Barry Seal was fired from TWA in 1974 for falsely citing medical leave when he was actually off trafficking weapons. However the core of the story in the movie is faithful to the overall Barry Seal story, just with lots of liberties taken to make it more theatrically interesting. Plus a lot is not really known about what really happened in certain events and activities.Worthwhile entertainment with a good performance from Cruise who did all his own flying during filming.Edit August 2023: Just watched it again, nicely entertaining. But all those bags and suitcases of money hidden all over the place sort of drove me half crazy. No doubt that involved a lot of exaggeration. Plus the Blu Ray has interesting extras, one is an interview with Seal's now adult son.",,Anonymous,Biography
Anything with Cruise is good but this was only made for one reason,"Doug Liman had to atone for the Jason Bourne film which was too right wing with this: a completely made up left wing distortion to trash Reagan. WAPO, NYT and others spent months on the real story and concluded Reagan and the CIA never knew about a drug connection. The Sandinista regime was not only installed by the Soviets, the president Daniel Ortega promised if you like your plan and total health care for no money you can keep it along with dozens of obama style pipe dreams. You can read about them. It was a very long list. But alas, corruption and infighting brought zero promises kept and then what a surprise, the communists took away every civil right and ruled with an iron fist, meaning rape, torture and murder. Reagan tried to stop it with the opponents who were called contras. The commies were eventually booted out but guess what? Good old George Bush put Ortega back in 2006. He was a fully converted supporter of the USA by then. We have been supporting the country ever since with a lot of money and plenty of programs. In other words, everything in the film is a lie but as a film it is pretty well made and enjoyable to watch. Liman admitted it was all lies and too bad few will ever read that.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Made was American made well!,"American Made was a perfect blend of comedy and thrills that always had me entertained. All the performances were great, with Tom Cruise standing out as the best. It has been said that most of the budget went to Tom Cruise, but I don't think that's the case. Because Tom Cruise has worked with Doug Liman before, and I think that this movie was made to look low budget. It makes this almost fictional story somewhat realistic. This movies is insane by the way. The only real problem I had was that the during first 20 minutes, I had a hard time getting into the movie. It was because I wasn't quite connecting with Tom Cruises character, but as the movie went on I was into it, and I think with a re-watch this won't be a problem. Overall, American Made was a blast and I highly recommend you see it.9/10 - Amazing Movie",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Cruise Redemption,"Good film. No masterpiece but a well written biopic and definitely a career saving project for Tom Cruise, who finally gives an interesting performance again. He was not Award-Great or anything, in fact there were some mannerisms about his performance that were not quite fitting or sometimes a bit annoying or unbelievable BUT it was still a fine performance in its whole essence and if he keeps doing those projects he might redeem himself. Domhnall Gleason gave the best performance in the film as CIA Agent who recruites Cruise and makes one mistake after the other hence to his adorable naivety. Gleason is perfect for that role. Sarah Wright was miscast. First of all she was far too sexy and beautiful for that role second of all far too young to play Cruise's wife. Was not believable. Always good to see Jesse Plemons although he was a bit wasted in a short and not so important role. The screenplay was clever, funny, had some nice twists and room for entertaining action sequences, that were not over the top but smoothly fit into the whole thing.

garishly top class colour grading,"Whenever there is any kind of historical, political or cartel speak in a film; my brain turns to soft cheese, and so I cannot rely in great depth the full plot of American Made. I think however this fact makes it even more significant that I LOVED this film. I have watched so many dull and uninventive films recently so I may find myself a bit overzealous in my review but I did have fun! Right from the first moment; the shots where visually interesting and snappy. Barry seals' restless cot pit antics comically establishes the job apathy and dangerous gusto that leads to the characters illicit journey. Tom cruises skilled but naive character becomes swept up in seemingly impossible missions (sorry I just had to) to ship illegal goods over seas with the constant threat of death and incarceration. The film however doesn't take itself too seriously and at some moments becomes a bit ridiculous, which only added to my levels of enjoyment. There where many creative, teetering on surreal, features of this film. The highly saturated shots in the first half made everything look stylised and vibrant and even in a very functional shot there is plenty of lurid feasts. The garish early on shots I think where to mimic the hyper-real grading of 80s video cameras. As the film progressed the colour quality got progressively more modern and I thought this was a very innovative way of presenting the time frame of the film. My favourite section was the over the top montage with a spectacularly excessive classical music remix playing as Barry and his wife are dining out on their wealth in the most ostentatious ways possible. Another very mention-able part of the film was Domhnal Gleeson and his charming, weaselly performance as the CIA agent trying to entangle Seal in the films daring operations. To be fair to Seal if Gleeson had approached me with those levels of biting Charisma I probably would have been shipping Crack and Weaponry to Miami myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Patriotism is Glorified Servitude,"America has laid claim to determination, grit, and all those other flattering, stubborn character traits. Barry breathes American air, drunk off of patriotic lies plastered in the board approved history books. The almighty United States has a particular skill set for obtaining what it wants.A nation of opportunity only recycles wealth and power. International bartering becomes an universal language at the start of the eighties. Enemies are housed closer than ever, and meals are served upon the same table. Everyone has to eat, but the cutlery must be handled with immense care.Barry is a glorified fork. He is the dignified manner by which US intelligence spears up subsistence. Once piloting domestic fares, now cutting through exotic airspace, Barry is escaping the mundane and chasing the fanciful. The thrill of bullets in the cockpit, and radar dodging intoxicates Barry. And a new drug is around the corner.He re-brands himself as a knife to another allegiance, and begins to sustain opposite foes. The operation benefits him most, his country's enemy second, and his homeland the least. He owes his ingenuity to an American upbringing, and by remaining loyal to this gringo attitude he succeeds by subversive means.A country manipulates in order to maintain order. A man buries problems with more problems. Both parties are stranded on the same boat, it is just that the former commissioned the later to this suicidal tango. The consequences for the nation state are laughable, but the individual has more vulnerabilities than the government has employees.Greed is an obvious evil that swallows the rich and the common equally.

Thoroughly entertaining story of drug smuggler of the 1980's,"After many years of business some of it risky along comes Mr Cruise in a sleeper.This is a must see as it really informs the audience well about the underworld dealings of the drug trade the CIA government and how one man can be so critical to it all . Anyone who remembers the 1980's can recall the Regan years and this is a great inside look into this aspect of those years. Great editing ,directing, pace and performances by Cruise and Gleeson and Sarah Wright kept one riveted to this picture.This will grow at box office through word of mouth as well .Highly recommend",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Made (2017) in one word: Cruise-control,"American Made begins with the familiar text, ""Based on a true story."" Movies based on true stories, which are not vetted by any type of historical regulatory agency to my knowledge, often end with a prologue containing additional historical information about the subjects. Photographs of the real-life individuals are sometimes shown on screen at this point in the film. There are no such photographs in this film. I took this as a sign that the real Barry Seal, a DEA informant and drug smuggler, didn't bear much resemblance to the actor portraying him, Tom Cruise. A post-credits image search confirmed this suspicion. Doug Liman, director, addressed this, saying, ""Tom Cruise doesn't look like Barry Seal. His character is inspired by the stories we learned about Barry. "" He added, ""You know, we're not making a biopic."" Unfettered by history, writer Gary Spinelli was free to tailor the story for Cruise, and in this he was successful.In Top Gun, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented pilot. In American Made, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented, drug and arms trafficking pilot. It feels familiar, but it's a good ""seeing an old friend"" familiar. Cruise is at his best when he is somewhat frantic, and there is a lot of frantic in this film. In fact, frantic is likely the best word to describe the camera-work here. Cinematographer César Charlone (City of God) zooms in and out with the speed and erraticism of an octogenarian photographing a grandchild at graduation. Seal is always moving, and the camera rushes to keep up with him. As cash continues to roll in, Barry Seal frenetically searches for an empty closet, a fresh piece of ground, but to no avail. There is plentiful comedy in the ineptitude of Seal, because he isn't entirely inept. At times he is shrewd and scheming, adept at evading his enemies. But, the true comedy and tragedy are in the excess, the scale of Seal's operation. The mere existence of such a ""business"" and the associated connections, if not only tenuous, to the U.S. government is laughably inconceivable.Seal's recorded confessions serve as plot perpetuators, interspersed among the action. This is an effective plot device, and the achieved feel of the home videos is authentic and somewhat endearing. Sarah Wright, as Seal's wife Lucy, provides a lukewarm contrast to her husband's mostly unwarranted confidence. She repeatedly declares her distrust for Seal, but brushes aside all concerns once sufficient funds have been brought home. Her patience could exist only in the imagination of Seal, who, in reality, married three times. But again, this is not a film about reality. Suspending history, it is a thoroughly entertaining, energetic romp that capitalizes on the strong points of its male lead.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top class entertainment,"The plot is loosely based on the real story of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who worked for the CIA and also as a drug and weapons smuggler.Cruise is in top form as Barry, the reckless pilot who abandons the safe but boring job of airline pilot to embark on a little spying. The aerial photographing of Central America soon turns into more dangerous assignments, reaching the point of no return when Barry starts working for the Medellin cartel.Weapons smuggling is added into the mix, together with training Nicaraguan Contras. It's a major political mess, during which Barry manages to earn huge amounts of cash, for which he must find creative hiding places (think Breaking Bad, but funnier).The film is brilliantly edited, with an authentic feeling for the period (it takes place between the end of the 70s and 1986). The main narrative is interspersed with Barry recording events chronologically and his effort will make sense at the end.Even if the story is not about funny events, the ride is most agreeable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful and interesting,"American Made was a good watch - the story keeps a good steady momentum, the direction and editing are vibrant and dynamic. It has the vibes of something like Wolf of Wall St or a Guy Ritchie film, where despite the nature of the events you find yourself rooting for a criminal and laughing at the black comedy of how things unfold.I had watched Narcos so I had a bit of information on the background and would have been cool to have those actors reprise their roles, but it stays firmly in the mode of fast-paced 'zany' without ever really digging into emotions, desperation, or any human reflection. Barry Seal as a character remains a breezy, zany blur. Its just that kind of film. I think Cruise has a lot to do with that - his vanity as an actor, having to be seen as either confused- smiley or cool-intense in any given moment limits his courage to do anything else (Born on the Fourth of July was a real anomaly for him in terms of range).Its as entertaining as any two episodes of Narcos - but without Narcos' complexity and variance. Good but not great, definitely worthy of a viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too much Tom Cruise selfie to be able to appreciate the movie ...,"Cruise did not try to look like the real Barry Seal as actors before him did like Robert De Niro when in Raging Bull he gained weight to look like Jack LaMotta or Johnny Depp looking horrible in Blow (which this movie steals so much from) ... Tom Cruise does not act but POSES to look the coolest in every shot and be the sexy hero he needs to be in order to keep getting other jobs ... He even flashes his butt on us ... When almost shot, it is his companion who pees in his pants but not our cool hero (he only sweats a little) ... The movie may look promising but seemed like it borrowed too much from Goodfellas, Blow and other similar movies ... And, again, it is hard to see past Tom Cruise again trying so hard to re-create his role in Risky Business or Days of Thunder ... The movie is one long Tom Cruise SELFIE !!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cruise is a hot shot pilot and actor. Be entertained!,"Tom Cruise does the breezy hero better than most other actors working today. In a wholly entertaining American Made, he jauntily plays Bobby Seal, the hotshot TWA pilot who ran drugs for South American cartels and the CIA, became wealthy, and lost it all. Yet, he can be historically associated to the operation known as the Iran-Contra Affair, and in that his legacy can be certain.American Made is Seal's story, a frenetic film about a mercurial pilot, whose love of his family competes with his love of fast planes and money. Although the film may make the uncertain life playing between the government and the cartels seem romantic, the guns both running and shooting are all too real to be seductive for your normal theatergoer.Director Doug Lyman, having directed The Bourne Identity and Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, knows a thing or two about fast pace, intrigue, and the limits of idealism. Here he takes a slower pace to allow Cruise to smile and play the almost clueless jockey who is seduced into high stakes because of money, but more importantly, flying. Offered a new, spiffy, fast plane to carrying around the drugs, and this seemingly good boy goes bad.Music from the late 70's and early 80's such as Hooked on Classics and A Fifth of Beethoven keep American Made rooted in the past as we try to forget Cruise is a man of our times. Intercutting with notables like President and Mrs. Reagan brings home how near Seal was to the heart of things politic.As he explains in voice over associated with tapes he made recounting his adventures, ""I'm the gringo that always delivers."" The same could be said of Cruise, whose youthful swashbuckling has taken him from Top Gun fame to present day success.To add to the crazy heroic treatment of this character, Cruise himself flies the planes, and in one sequence puts the plane on auto to drop bags from a trap door. He's listed as in charge of the plane stunts. His fine acting in this robust film is no stunt. It's real entertainment.",,Anonymous,Biography
Movie based on Narcos,"A complete treat for the fans of documentaries and more importantly for the fans of NarcosBased on real story, movie revolves around former TWA pilot Barry seal played by Tom Cruise

Just Watch Blow,"If you're an average person, who wants to watch a movie about this subject, during this time of America - just watch 'Blow', with Depp.A far superior film, in every way.This movie doesn't scratch the surface of any of the characters, even the lead.One reviewer called it a ""movie long montage"", or a ""film length trailer"" - and that is right on target.With that said, it does somehow entertain for a 1 time viewing, so I'm giving it a 5; though rewatch value is so slow, I wouldn't recommend buying it; unless you're someone who is into the drug scene, and enjoy anything about it.I really wish they would have made the story more about him and the other guys he was flying with.Even if it added another 45 minutes to give them all genuine stories - it might have made this a movie unto its own.The JB character was HORRIBLE casting, and even if true to the story, should have been cut out.

So. Darn. Watchable.,"When I suggested to my wife that we watch this film, she was skeptical. Tom Cruise in a ""based on a true story"" movie about the 1980s CIA and drug trade? Really? But here's the thing: Liman has such a great sense of how to use Cruise and how to tell a story like this. The plot starts quickly and keeps rolling. The tone/approach was just light and nostalgic enough to maintain balance between dark and entertaining. The protagonist seems both morally questionable and highly likable from moment one because - well - it is Cruise. There's a fair amount of fluff here, but it is hard not to enjoy the fluff. And even harder to resist Googling afterwards to confirm that this bizarre story had more truth than we might want to admit.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than I had expected,"I have just watched ""American MADE"" at the local movie house this afternoon, and I was very impressed with two aspects: Doug Liman's direction and Tom Cruise's performance.Liman I did not, and do not, know (yet, but in this form I'll be very happy to see a great deal more of his work). His direction is steady, intelligent, sensitive in extracting Cruise's greatest performance to date, and also very effective in action sequences, and in finding humor in all manner of situations that are usually not any reason to laugh. He even manages to get hardboiled drug smugglers like Pablo Escobar to sound jocund, and that's no mean achievement!Liman also makes extremely intelligent use of speeches by Presidents Carter and Reagan, giving the movie a firm time capsule.Cruise I had never, until today, rated a serious actor. Today, I saw real quality, experience, and even spontaneity in his acting. It is a wonderful performance that does much to keep the film firmly anchored in reality in spite of all the unusual goings-on involving state, police, drug barons, and all manner of criminals - plus his ever enlarging family.American MADE is superbly photographed and its soundtrack is, in turns, inspired, appropriate, and unobtrusive, allowing the viewer to stay tuned into the action.It is also a cautionary tale, which even carries a Nancy Reagan snippet about not smoking, drinking alcohol or consumming drugs -- and, of course, not getting involved with anything that breaks the law and leaves you exposed to recruitment by state institutions that will exploit you to the marrow, among other perils.Barry Seal made the wrong choice to begin with, and once he did he was, willingly and otherwise, pulled further and further into the quicksands of state and criminal opportunism. Hopefully, this will resonate with the youth, in particular: avoid that first step that breaks the law.In light of all the positives above, I give this movie 9 stars out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of 2017's most underrated films is a great entertainment,"Doug Liman's entertaining ""American Made"" tells the somewhat true story of Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot, who, during the 1980's, was 'coerced' into flying spy missions for the CIA before becoming a drug smuggler for a Colombian drug cartel. Then, to avoid prison, he becomes an informant for the DEA, and winds up slipping further and further into a complex web of nefarious enterprises that makes it virtually impossible for him to get out of.Playing Seal with a flippant sarcasm, Tom Cruise displays the multi-leveled range of a superior character actor, but what really makes this film work is Liman's tightrope-balancing act between outrageous humor and the serious, even dangerous, reality of Seal's situation. In fact, the film brings to mind the best of Martin Scorsese's work, e.g., ""Goodfellas"", or, more precisely, Scorsese's less accomplished ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Particularly notable is the film's digital photography that employs an exaggerated sun-drenched color saturation to the point of comic-book surrealism.Although taking liberty with the facts (Seal did not crash-land into a suburban neighborhood), this is a cinematic ride that ranks with the best action thrillers of recent years. And how it eventually leads into the Iran-Contra criminal escapades of the Reagan Administration in 1986 should provide an eye-opening history lesson to viewers who may not know much about that shady era in American history. (Interesting trivia: Cruise actually does his own flying in the film.) A first-rate entertainment, and Liman's career best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A strong yet unmemorable film,"I was very pleased to see that 'American Made' had an R rating. Even though it certainly doesn't utilise it to the full extent that some other films would've, it's just nice to know that anything can happen and anything can be said. It really is becoming a necessity for a film to be watchable. 'American Made' is a slightly above average film that I enjoyed slightly more than I anticipated I would.Tom Cruise is in good (perhaps not great) form here. He's his usual charming self in a movie that relies very heavily on his ability to be entertaining. He's given some pretty decent dialogue to work with for the most part which helps. The film was actually a lot funnier that I expected it to be. It almost borders on being a comedy at times.The structuring is bit messy at times. It also runs 10-15 minutes longer than I feel it needed to. Some good pacing does help cover that up however. Clearly this a true story that takes some liberties to make for a more entertaining version of the events that actually transpired. At least they were up front about that fact. I wouldn't describe 'American Made' as a must-watch film, but if you do find yourself watching it I'd suggest you're likely to have an enjoyable enough time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
fun Cruise,"In 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is a TWA pilot smuggling cigars into the country. He is recruited by CIA operative ""Schafer"" (Domhnall Gleeson).

As he and his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) grow their family, he supplements his income by smuggling drugs for Pablo Escobar. Later, he is pulled into the Contra affair as he diverts guns intended for the Contra to Escobar.This is directed by Doug Liman. Initially, I didn't realize it watching this movie. I was very impressed with the quality of the movie until the credits started to roll. Of course, Liman is no slouch. Honestly, I was expecting a crappy Cruise misfire. In reality, this is quite the opposite. I love Cruise in this roguish role. Knocking out his tooth struck me as extremely hilarious. I love this character better than his need to be loved in many of his leading man roles. The other main part of this movie is the Based on a true story.

American Made is a slyly comedic drug fuelled escapade about the career of Barry Seal.,"I used slyly due to the themes involved, it involves the Iran-Contra affair that gripped Central America in the 80's. It's a well documented scandal, we had The Infiltrator last year which tackled the same subject. What started off as simply taking photos in Colombia, turned into smuggling cocaine. Then smuggling guns. Oh, don't forget smuggling Contra fighters. Then hiding all the laundered money. Outwitting the DEA, ATF, CIA, FBI, State Police and Pablo Escobar. I mean a lot happened to Seal over the course of 7 years, which is what made this film enjoyable. It's pacing is very brisk, something is always happening and the inclusion of Seal's narration helps to outline the plot without making the audience seem unintelligent. It's not just Seal's ""career"" that the plot revolves around, it's also his personal life. His family are suddenly brought into a lavish lifestyle of riches, and surprisingly his wife's greed actually makes her an asset to him as she starts to hide the laundered money. An interesting dynamic between the two but a clear statement that money corrupts everyone...including the innocent. Tom Cruise gives a hundred percent as always, I found him to be charismatic and charming which made Barry a likeable character. Supporting cast were decent, particularly Domhnall Gleeson. The editing and direction felt fresh, with plenty of stop frames and embedded animation to enhance the subtle comedic undertone. The story felt very light hearted. It wasn't heavy to a point where it felt depressingly dull, it was a fun creative vision on a formulaic film that has been portrayed many times. There just was not enough substance to substantiate a longish runtime. The plot is constantly going back and forth much like with Barry and his smuggling, it took too long to actually progress and therefore was not always engaging. The ending was slightly rushed and anti-climatic in comparison to the finely developed second act. Well crafted, just too empty.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watchable 'true' story,"'American Made' is one of those films where I can't really think of anything particularly negative to say about it, but then I also can't really think of any major positives. On paper, it all works - it's one of Hollywood's 'true' stories, which basically means it's loosely based on people and events that actually happened. It has star-power, drama, high-tension moments and a good supporting cast. And yet only a day after watching it, I'm struggling to remember anything really to say about it.Back in the late seventies and early eighties an American pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) started smuggling drugs for the South American cartels, but was subsequently 'recruited' by a CIA man Monty 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson) to start double-crossing the drug dealers and gathering evidence for the White House.Tom Cruise is no stranger to headlining films and therefore is the perfect leading man to root for. There's no shortage of budget for the production and all the sets look like they're set in the appropriate time period, plus there are some dramatic moments which utilise the dramatic elements of danger associated with trying to doublecross organised crime. Plus the story is - relatively - true, therefore it adds an element of interest knowing that this actually happened. Yet I still felt a little unsatisfied.I've checked other reviews online and it seems that I'm in the minority. Most people seemed to really love it and think it was great. I guess it was watchable enough, but not memorable. Perhaps because I'm part of that 'older' generation, I've seen plenty of films such as this that are based on trues stories where one man is recruited by some law enforcement agency and has to infiltrate the mob. It's like I've seen all this before and 'American Made' didn't offer enough that was new in order to make me remember it too well or even want to see it again.If this is your thing, or you don't know that much about 'true' crime then you should enjoy it. I did. I just don't really think I'll ever bother watching it again. For me, it was certainly one of those films where I'm happy to watch on an online streaming service, but would never bother buying on DVD. At least it proved that Domhnall Gleeson can do more than just shriek and be the 'comedy bad guy' in those depressing new 'Star Wars' movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cruise the Gringo,"I don't know if Doug Liman only needs to make Tom Cruise movies from now one, but the reverse is probably true: Edge of Tomorrow and now American Made are the two stand-out Cruise movies since he last paired with Spielberg in 2005 (I mean to say that movies that aren't franchises not named Mission Impossible, those 4 and 5 sequels are a lot of fun, but not much beyond the surface entertainment). Barry Seale offers Cruise a thing that feels almost fresh for him in this day and age like... An arc to his chsrzcter (how about that! Development even if its in smaller doses) But it's also impressive how Seals is a genuinely nice and cool-but-not-completely cool films; if this was done 30 years ago, I could picture Burt Reynolds in this kind of character: the wholly charismatic, polite, sometimes befuddled but confident southern gent who is also a criminal bastard.Will it win awards? Eh no, but it doesn't need to be that either. Maybe its from coming off of the worst Cruise movie in recent memory, The Mummy, but that's not it, or just it. Liman finds an extremely loose shooting style, maybe *too* loose, where his camera is off kilter at many times, but at the same time it isn't incoherent in the mis en scene of it. It has a purpose; we are in the period of late 70s and early 80s chaos but its a chaos that is... Well, sort of half sanctioned by the united states government. We shouldn't be able to believe the story Seale leaves for us - in a typical but fine fashion that does work into the final act of the film in a clever way, or clever-er than usual as far as what Seale is needing to do - but we do, and there's an underlying satire to it all that cant help but make it feel less like another Blow or Infiltrator (though some carry over of DNA is here from that) than a more Southern-baked, less hedonistic Wolf of Wall Street. In other words, it's often wildly funny and twisted, but it is about something very real at the core: American imperialism and exceptionalism.It tickles me to think of all those people in the American heartland who love Tom Cruise coming to what they think is another fun mindless thriller, and it indicts a hero to many in America, Ronald Reagan, who they either forget or choose to ignore was involved directly snd indirectly in a lot of criminal s***. Its almost like you cant help but like or even love Seale and by extention Cruise: hes not fully a drug trafficker and hes not personally training the Contras. He's the guy that gets your stuff from point A to B. Thank goodness Cruise took this movie on!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

While American Made isn't a film that's going to appeal to a mass audience, I believe that the addition of Cruise's charm will sell a few more tickets than if someone else had been cast in this role. This is a movie that unravels the harsh realities of a story line that's definitely too good to be true, and it's based on a true story. You've definitely seen this style of filmmaking many times throughout the years, but director Doug Liman brings a fun, as well as visceral accompaniment to this crazy premise. I can't say that I loved it, but here is why it's still a great film that's worth seeing in theatres.Not knowing the conclusion of the events that actually happened definitely helps when watching a film that's based on a true story, but I have to admit, this is a story that has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, even if you already know how the story ends. As Barry Seal leaves his day job as a pilot, he's recruited to work for the CIA, where he must deliver drugs and guns to cartels in the south. If that notion alone doesn't peak your interest, I'll just say that he's given opportunities that will have you either shaking your head and smiling about how things work out for him, or being scared and along for the ride due to his choices. There are surprises around every corner, which is why this movie works so well.When being a smuggler, no matter how hard or often you must travel, a family life is always going to be a struggle when you're dealing with the drug cartel, there's no way around that. What worked out for this film was the fact that the clichés of kidnapping family members never happened throughout the true story, so you won't find yourself rolling your eyes, thinking the film is coming up with a way to manipulate the story. Sure, there are other surprises that I won't spoil for you, but if there's one thing I can compliment this film on, it's the fact that it's original. That being said, hardly any film is perfect, and where I feel American Made may annoy some people, is its happy- go-lucky feel throughout 80% of its duration.I'm all for a film trying to have fun and lighten the mood, but when a film that should be taking itself seriously, fails to hardly ever do that, I found myself wondering if the consequences even mattered. Yes, Cruise delivers a noteworthy performance once again, and the secondary cast all play off him wonderfully, but I found myself wondering where the stakes were at times, due to the fact that Barry always seemed to make the best out of a bad situation. This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film itself, but it distracted me more than enough to slightly harm my experience with the movie as a whole.In the end, there isn't much to complain about here if I'm being honest, but like I mentioned, it's filmmaking that you've seen many times before, with some questionable editing choices in its quick cuts or fast zoom-ins, and the fact that the tone is a little too happy for the story at hand. Still, the premise is interesting throughout, the surprises are worth the price of admission alone, and Doug Liman directs this film as well as any other that he's put his touch on in the past. American Made won't be winning any awards this year, but it's a really enjoyable time at the movies and I highly recommend checking it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I've Seen This Before,"Something is so very familiar about this movie. It seems director Doug Liman is doing his best Oliver Stone impression. Fueled with a little big of mania, Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, the former TWA pilot turned drug and gun smuggler turned family man. I put that last because, let's be honest, we saw so little of the family in context with his life.And let's address that right now. For someone who had a wife and three kids...there is a logistical flaw in his puttering around with famous drug kingpins. Speaking of which, Barry was the Forrest Gump of the drug world. Stumbling amongst the famous characters in life that we remember from this era. He's a simpleton from the south too. Well, kinda. He gets in WAY over his head and spirals into working for everyone as a complete innocent. But he's not. The most aggravating thing about this movie IS that he doesn't seem to have a moral compass. He's muling in so much cocaine and getting so much money for it, it's hard not to hate the guy for ruining lives. But we don't see that part. We see a great scam. Or at least that's what it seems like. Crazy characters who bounce through the buoyant cocaine 80's. The end doesn't justify the means. AND, to make matters worse, a key character who is close to the family meets a tragic end, and is forgotten by the last reel. That is ridiculously lazy. Maybe honest, but confusing. I applaud the cojones for Cruise to step out of a little comfort zone, but there is something less endearing when he really gets despicable. Also, why does this movie feel familiar??? That nagging thought may eat at other viewers. Speaking of which, was this thing shot on VHS. It's looks video-terrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Very ""Amaericanized"" Tale of a Fool that Helped Kill people North and South","Every since movies like Carlitos way, Scar Face, and especially Blow, Hollywood has tried to get the fire burning again for a big drug/cartel type film. One that could generate millions with its awe inducing illusion that its about anything more than greedy minded, drug running bull mess. Sure there have been other movies in the same sub genre, but far too often the protagonists, just like in American Made, were just run of the mill people that didnt have to take part in such activities, they chose to, despite already living fairly easy going, normal, drama free lives.But then you look at films like Empire, where the main characters are mostly people that grew up poor and had little other recourse than to get involved in drugs, as there was virtually zero upward mobility in their urban communities and lives all around.Not to excuse what they did, but perspective is key in this life to really see the full picture of the ""whys"" and the ""hows"" of things.The main character, Barry Seal(s), in American Made, was already living a very comfy, well paying career as a commercial airline pilot, with a family that was easily able to liveo n the good amount of money he brought in since they dwelt in the southern states in the 1970s ( ITs still affordable even to this day tbh). The man didnt need to get into al lthe mess he did, and there were times he could have pulled out. BUt he got greedy, and bored, and like many apathetic westerners that want it easy, they dont care whom they screw over in the process of ""getting their own"". And no doubt that predeliction for self centered devil may care pursuits of happiness are not wholly unique to us in the west, we cant lie to ourselves either. Our government and much of our society from top to bottom has either taken par in or been complacent in the sheer subjegation and torment of those not like ourselves, especially in Latin America over the last 200 years.Suffice to say, this film does nothing to show the detrimental effects of what the drugs and arms, and overall amrican nosey busy body minded shenanigangs of our government have dont to people south of the border. Especially in central America, and ESPECIALLY in Nicaragua the scorched earth policies, and near genocidal attitudes used against those people was in many ways as bad if not at times worse than what the USA did in Vietnam.Sure this was a somwhat entertaining movie, but it also told a story abotu the truth , much of it was in fact very true; the Sandinistas were not commies, were not involved with drugs and terrorism, the Contras and American soliers that were always invading were.It almost felt like American Made was just trying to muddy the issue, while at other itmes desperately trying to show people the truth of what happened, without thedirectors and writers having men in black show up at their front doors at 2 in the morning as a result of this movies existence. Hollywood is as rife with lies and agendas most foul and dark as government and religion and banking etc.If nothing else, have a good time watching a movie about nothing but drugs and nonsense. Its a Tome Cruise movie so thats most of what hes been involved in throughout his career. But take to heart the fact that the character of Barry Seal(s) was but one of countless money men, drug traffickers, gun smugglers, spies, liars, murderers, thugs, thieves, blood thirsty politicians and soldiers, and all around racist, jerky people to put it mildly, in America and certain central american countries that hated Nicaraguans, and tried to kill as many as possible while attempting to take over the country for ""uncle sam"" throughout most of the 20th century. All this crap didnt just begin in the 1970s or 80. It all goes back to when Taft was US PRez a few years before the first world war, and continued on and off almost every decade. And still the poor country of NIcaragua is has been messed with by America in the 21st century. So have a laugh, zone out at this Hollywood fable. And try to research the truth if your able.

Cruises Best Performance In Years,"Finishing off my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to American Made (2017)Plot In A Paragraph: The story of Barry Seal, an American pilot who became a drug-runner for the CIA in the 1980s in a clandestine operation that would be exposed as the Iran- Contra Affair.Easily Tom Cruises best non Mission Impossible movie since Collateral, and his best performance since the same movie, some 13 years ago.Very similar to Blow with Johnny Depp, back when he made good movies. I can not believe this movie did not find an audience. I think if it had maybe a more famous supporting cast, it may have helped bring the fans in, but truthfully I don't think anybody could have done better than those cast. Great performances all round, a fun soundtrack and a well told story. Since I didn't know it, it was a tad better to me.American Made grossed $50 million at the domestic Box Office (recouping its budget) and is currently the 39th highest grossing movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A deeply entertaining picture about the downfall of an American dreamer.,"""American made"" is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most charming pictures I have ever watched, it adds an incredible one man cast to a flawless direction and an extremely moving story. It stars the one and only Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who finds himself in a turmoil of drug and weapon smuggling, compelled by an opportunist CIA operative who, once pressured by the geopolitical repercussions of their operation, leaves Barry stranded in a violence ravaged central America accused of drug dealing and money laundering. This picture is, in my humble opinion , one of the best depictions of ""the war on drugs"" campaign that was led by the former USA presidency ,a time when central America became the promised land for ones who lack moral qualities and would do whatever it takes to grow as rich as possible before the cocaine fuelled mayhem there could settle down. Amid this human madness was caught Barry seal, a southern family man, whose sole interest was to provide more for him and his family and truly achieve the American dream. But, to the surprise of many, success in that period of global hysteria can only be achieved through illegal activities, something that was more than simple under the inter-continental crisis. as a matter of fact, Barry seal's involvement in these activities is undoubtedly an immoral act for which a legal prosecution is more than merited, selfish and stubborn as seal's actions may seem you can only root for him and support his unlucky adventure, even though we fully comprehend his unforgivable trespass of the law . Is it the charismatic personality of tom Cruise? Or is it just the genuine everyday working class man Doug Liman made him? To be fair, ""American made"" wouldn't be such a good picture without the visionary direction of Mr. Iiman , he is by all means one of Hollywood's finest , with a directorial career that includes among many Mr. and Ms. smith and the Bourne identity , a personal favourite : this picture was so well crafted that it makes you abandon your ethical righteousness in favour of another victim of the injustice system , maybe many are right to think that Barry Seal was a insensible low life criminal , an immoral drug dealer , but according to Doug Liman he was nothing more than a simple man with a big hope , a southern naïve man who was used by an uncaring society , he is an American hero who had his share of mistakes and bad deeds , but he doesn't have to go down in the American history as a dishonest fraud nor as an iconic patriot , he is simply an example of both greed and faith , Barry seal is the American dream made of flesh and blood , a common and calm life that was disturbed by the shallow flashings of wealth , and whose demise was certain the moment he took on the burden of achieving his dream , in the American way.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Pilot Working for Both the CIA and the Medellin Cartel,"This film essentially begins with a young pilot named ""Barry Seal"" (Tom Cruise) abruptly leaving his job for Trans World Airlines (TWA) to work for the CIA taking aerial photos of communist insurgents in Nicaragua. One thing eventually leads to another, and he soon finds himself working simultaneously for the Medellin Cartel smuggling cocaine into the United States. Although he is eventually arrested, his knowledge and experience working in Central and South America becomes invaluable to the American government which then results in him being recruited for even more hazardous assignments. The problem, however, is that the more involved he becomes in these clandestine operations, the more difficult it becomes for him to evade serious accountability. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, even though this film is supposedly based on a true story, the fact is that Hollywood has taken its usual liberties and embellished much of these events completely out of proportion. But that's Hollywood for you. Even so, this still turned out to be an entertaining film with Tom Cruise putting in an especially good performance.

Later, he's tasked with flying those same guerillas into the US for military training to help them oust their country's socialist government.A darkly comedic adaptation of the actual underhanded events that transpired during America's anticommunist efforts to destabilize Central America, Cruise's charm, director Doug Liman's stylish direction and the unbelievable script help deliver this enjoyable freight intact.Moreover, the best method for smuggling in drugs is inside of a detection dog.

Tom Cruise is back in the Sky,"""American Made"" is a black comedy that tells the true story of CIA operative and Colombia drug-runner Barry Seal. The film overstimulates viewers by emphasizing Barry's charm, exotic South American trade routes, and the rapid escalation of events leading to his downfall. The film fails to provide psychological insight into Barry's character or explain his determination to make more money than he could spend, despite conflicting pressures from Pablo Escobar's drug cartel and the American government. The film fails to provide a satisfying answer to the question of why a movie is being told instead of a book. ""American Made"" is a sensational true crime story that attempts to seduce viewers with its alarming pace and charismatic lead character, Barry Cruise. The film is based on the true story of Barry, who agrees to fly over South American countries and take photos of suspected communist groups using a spy plane provided by CIA pencil-pusher Schafer. Barry's impulsive nature is evident in his actions, such as sending a commercial airliner into a nosedive and revealing his plans to pay out of pocket for his family's health insurance when he opens an independent shipping company called ""IAC."" The film's premise is based on caricature-broad assumptions about Barry's character, making it difficult to understand his motives beyond caricature-broad assumptions about his character. Barry's impetuousness doesn't explain his low-flying photography, lack of contact with Schafer, kidnapping, and drug delivery. He also has a low regard for his wife and kids, packing their Louisiana house and moving them to a safe house in Arkansas. His character is characterized by both character-defining insanity and ""this barely makes sense in the moment"" crazy. Barry often appears to be the latter kind of nutbar. In ""American Made,"" there are two types of people: those who work and those who get worked over. These characters are defined by their actions and the screen time they spend on them. For instance, Schafer, a cubicle drone, is defined by his taunts and over-promise. Escobar and his dealers are treated as lawless salesmen of an unsavory product. Lucy, a lazy, underage girl-dating, and Confederate flag-waving brother, is portrayed as a lazy, Gremlin-driving, under-age girl-dating, and Confederate flag-waving brother. Lucy's feelings are often taken for granted, even when she calls Barry out for abandoning her. Barry responds by throwing bundles of cash at his wife's feet, ending the scene with a smug joke. ""American Made"" is a shallow and anti-American Dream movie that promotes exceptionalism without considering the conditions that enable it. The film's characters, Spinelli and Liman, are too devoted to Barry to be thoughtfully critical of him. The movie's focus on broad jokes teases Barry's team and puts down everyone else is unsettling. Barry ultimately meets a just end, which has been prescribed to thousands of other movie gangsters. However, the movie's two hours of Tom Cruise charming representatives of various US institutions is enough to make it a movie, as it is impossible to be seduced by the star of ""Top Gun"" in a book.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The gringo that always delivers! [+64%],"'American Made' is a semi-biographical account of certain events in the life of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot turned CIA-informant who doubled as a drug-smuggler. Liman- Cruise combo had previously made the excellent 'The Edge of Tomorrow', and Cruise badly needed to bounce back from the fiasco that was 'The Mummy' earlier this year. Well, 'American Made' delivers, for most part!Liman knows hows to capitalize on Cruise's charm (even at the age of 55), and make an entertaining movie around him. Liman has already said openly that this movie won't follow the pattern of a docu-drama and would not adhere purely to what transpired in Seal's life - i.e. historical accuracy will remain questionable (for instance, Seal was a plump, half-bald dude unlike the flawless-looking Cruise; Seal had married thrice unlike what's shown in the movie; even the timelines differ from actuality). It's strictly a commercial vehicle (come on, the tagline says 'Based on a TRUE LIE' - what more do you need?), with neat production values (the 80s setting is wonderfully rendered), first-rate cinematography and an assemblage of taut, breezy performances. Cruise is definitely in his zone here, juggling largely between the emotions of elation and discomfort. A tough job indeed, to condense someone's life into a 115 minute movie, but 'American Made' trots along like a little pony that seems to relish taking us on a fun-ride.There are umpteen number of cackle-worthy occasions integrated adeptly into the screenplay (written by Gary Spinelli, with some obvious improvisation from Liman & Cruise) that at times, make the viewer exclaim ""What the hell! Seriously?"" but in a pleasurable way. Seal tries to poke fun at the characters around him - As a TWA pilot, he deliberately quivers the plane he's flying just to disturb the co-pilot's and passengers' slumber, while letting out a sly smile directed at the audience; he offers a pack of cash to the person whose property he crash-lands his plane (carrying large amounts of cocaine) on, and borrows his bicycle to escape from the cops; he is shown happily partying with the Medellin Cartel, even when he works for the CIA; at one point he has so much currency with him that he's stacked some of it along with the garbage pile..plenty of such larger-than- life yet funny instances that make the viewer dissolve into laughter. I laughed out loud when the local PD, the DEA, the FBI and the ATF all arrive at Seal's hangar at the same time to arrest him - what could be the odds of such a thing happening (for real)? But does it work as a scene in a film? Hell yeah, it does!Bold move to subvert the obvious sobriety which is usually associated with movies/TV shows that deal with the National Agencies or the notorious drug mafia of South America (and loaded with heaps of life-and-death situations) - the crew is never seen trying to inject an aura of despair - even when Lucy Seal (played by Sarah Wright, who's at least 20 years younger to Cruise) laments on how she cannot trust what her husband says or does, they still hold onto each other.But..but..but the movie does feel a little stretched than required, especially towards the climax portions - we sense imminent danger when Seal chooses to rat out the cartel and when his brother-in-law does some pretty-indiscreet stuff (like carrying a money-bag in public with notes sticking out through the zipper, naturally garnering attention of the local PD, amongst others). We know there's a twist coming - one that offers closure. Domhnall Gleeson surely seems to having a ball playing Seal's CIA contact Monty Schafer. Cruise apparently did all(or most) of the flying himself - an amazing feat, as these scenes looked spectacular. We need Cruise in smaller-budget films (and less in franchise flicks, except maybe for the M.I series) where he can perform without worrying about the box-office outcome. After all, Cruise is still ""the gringo that always delivers"".Verdict: Refreshingly breezy action-comedy!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie,"Fast paced, cracking story and great locations, Cruise is back on form in one of the best movies you will see this year. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive story and stunning acting from Tom Cruise,"Tom Cruise continues to prove his worth as an A-List actor in this film based on the true story of Barry Seal, an American Pilot turned DEA agent and drug smuggler in the 70s-80s. The film can be praised for the brilliant acting from Tom Cruise, as well as the telling of the story in an organic yet simple manner, taking the viewers across a decade of Seal's life seamlessly.Having watched many Tom Cruise films, such as the Mission: Impossible movies and Edge Of Tomorrow, I had high expectations watching American Made. The film definitely did not disappoint. Even though the film is not so action-heavy like most Tom Cruise films, Tom Cruise plays his character of Barry Seal, a smug man way in over his head who, on more than one occasion, bites of more than he can chew. It's a little jarring to hear Tom with a southern twang, and at times he has a bit of difficulty maintaining it, reverting to whatever his natural accent is (I'm not American so the difference is probably more obvious to Americans). Still, other than the twang there's really nothing to fault about Tom's acting.Doug Liman, who has previously worked with Tom Cruise, directs the film very well, giving it an almost indie, homely feel at times. Shaky cameras and quick transitions between scenes help to evoke this. His choice to have Barry Seal narrating at times does seem a little strange at times, mainly since it's not nearly frequent or consistent enough. Still, the choice to give the film this more indie look is quite clever, especially given that the film's material is based around a simple man.Personally I thought the film's pacing could have been a little better. Sometimes the film does go a little fast, especially at the start, which holds it back from a 9 or 10 star rating in my opinion. Still, the film is a very quality watch, and I definitely recommend it for action-fans looking for a gripping true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fast-paced fun,"'American Made' is not one of Tom Cruise's best efforts, but nor is it his worst - it's based on a true story of a pilot that ends up working for the CIA and drug smuggling for the Colombians in the early 80s.There's plenty of guns, double-crosses and fast flying, with easy-to-follow graphics to explain who's doing what, & where. Some funny moments and it's easy to see Cruise was enjoying himself.Nothing too new, in terms of the Medellín cartel, but it's all handled well, with time flying by, a few flash-forwards, and a good ending.

Dumb, overblown story not even near factual, done for the sake of making money, not telling an important story about a real person. The drug war at the time was not a comedy, but Cruise did his best to make it a comedy. The entire film was laughable in its lack of credibility and overblown Hollywood stupidity.

Forgotten History,"I let my prejudices about Tom Cruise affect my viewing of his films for many years.

I remember the names of the different factions and the world leaders and such from the time, but I had no idea until viewing this film the true story behind many of the events.Cruise brings his usual charisma and swagger to the role and the film told a very interesting, engaging story.Some of the moments were genuinely funny as well.

The Charismatic Drug Smuggler,"Tom Cruise is the non-hidden chameleon. He always looks like Tom Cruise yet somehow has a knack for getting into his character; in visual contrast to the masterful true chameleon Gary Oldman. Perhaps the characters he plays don't vary much. Anyway, this time Cruise is an experienced pilot with wife and kids who has become bored with his regular life routine. He gets poached by a CIA agent to run reconnaissance flights taking for photography over other countries. The Columbian drug cartel subsequently poach him after catching him taking his stealth photography and strong arm him into smuggling cocaine into the US. While the cash comes flowing in, so does the risk. This is set up to be one of those rise and fall stories. How will his life play out with the risks he has taken. This feels a lot like ""Blow"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" in terms of story flow and editing and pacing with similar story lines.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Surprisingly fun, relaxed attitude for a crime biopic pays off","Next up in the lengthy cinematic lineage of based-on-true-stories centered on quirky characters that rise to fortune through shady means and then come crashing down is ""American Made."" The latest collaboration between Doug Liman and Tom Cruise (who previously made ""The Edge of Tomorrow"") has a similar fun, energetic pace and goes down smooth — the Budweiser of historical biopics, or perhaps something with a notch more flavor.Cruise stars as Barry Seal, an airline pilot recruited by the CIA to gather intel and fly contraband to Central and South American countries rebelling against communist regimes. It doesn't take long, however, for Seal to realize he can use their cover and protections to smuggle cocaine for his new acquaintances atop the Columbian drug cartel. Between the CIA's paycheck and his drug money, Seal begins to make more cash than he and his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright) know what to do with.Cruise's performance contains his signature fervor, but even though he plays a pilot, his default action hero affect is well-disguised as Seal, a thrill-seeking southerner who isn't smart but who's definitely not stupid. It's a fun role, and Cruise channels his underrated comedy instincts to create a likable character. He only gets a couple different notes to work with in the film, but he hits them.The film shakes out as about 80 percent entertainment, 20 percent drama (and that's being generous to drama), but either way it's clear why Gary Spinelli's script made the Blacklist of top undeveloped screenplays, especially given the story is steeped in political context but isn't adapted from a singular source. Rather than deliver a two-and-a-half-hour biopic, Spinelli keeps things moving with a lot of pithy dialogue and brief snippets/windows into Seal's experiences (smartly conducted by Liman). We're familiar with this rise-and-fall narrative, so Spinelli opts to give us the highlights and moments that illustrate how over the top and around the law the whole scenario was.Liman's action instincts (he also directed the first ""Bourne"" film) serve him well here as he brings a degree of style and excitement, as if at any moment something big could happen. At the least, he provides a great filmmaking lesson in how to effectively make a montage. The film's swift pacing necessitates that skill, but there's also a lot of good stuff being communicated in these scenes as opposed to the typical montage, which usually is little more than a stylized transition from point A to point B.One central montage occurs once the Seals move to Mena, Arkansas and Barry's operation really takes off. We get bits and pieces of the whole process and one of the film's challenges is to show the accumulation of wealth. There are only so many ways to show this, but Barry's wife getting frustrated when she can't find a pair of heels because every other shoebox is stuffed with money provides a unique detail that really conveys the ridiculousness of their financial situation.""American Made"" strings together these clever moments and that's what makes it such an easy watch. Cruise's non-serious performance also gives us permission to relax, enjoy and appreciate the story's likely exaggerations of the truth because of the perspective they put on the United States' unwise meddling in these countries during the '70s and '80s. It could have easily gone the heavyweight route and still been a great film, but the lightweight approach will give it a longer shelf life with a wider audience.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Very Solid Little FIlm,"It's not particularily high budget or (on release) well publicised, but this is another good film starring Tom Cruise. A little bit different to the usual shooting and car chases. Following the life of an airline pilot that pitfalls his way into the deep state. First taking spy photos and then as a drug smuggler. This is a neat little film and there is not much time to feel bored. Everything happens pretty fast and at times the story suffers from a few parts where you have to fill in the blanks yourself. But I really enjoyed this film overall and it has a few funny scenes too. It is not a hugely political (propaganda) film and actually a fairly honest portrayal of South American drug smugglers and the immoral American facilitators. It is not a left wing film that is basically blaming Americans for everything, which is nice because if it had been it would have been terrible. These are all criminals and immoral people and the film isn't too worried about showing these characters as dangerous. No doubt the real life counterparts were extremely dangerous. This is portrayed brilliantly by Cruise's character having guns pointed at him every time he touches down in a cartel jungle hideout.The CIA handler in this film is also quite funny. He is very well versed in 'thief' speak and does not give anything away. Not even his real name as the movie ends! Also the guy who plays Escobar looks so like the real Escobar I was wondering at times if the real Escobar had never actually gone to jail and played his own part! The ending is a little bit predictable but is also a very emotional one for the viewer. I don't want to give too much away there. All in all a good watch",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

An entertaining story loosely inspired by real events,"This film is centred on real life former TWA pilot Barry Seal who later spied for the CIA and smuggled drugs for the Medellin Cartel. Seal is somewhat disenchanted with his work with the airline so readily accepts when Monty Schafer, a CIA case officer offers him another job; he is to fly at low level over suspected communist camps in Central America. This is a success and he is later asked to act as a courier collecting information from Colonel, later General, Manuel Noriega in Panama. On one such trip he is approached by members of the Medellin Cartel... they have an even better offer; they will pay him handsomely to smuggle drugs into the United States. As the situation in Central America, in particular Nicaragua, hots up Seal's life becomes more complicated and dangerous... but also far more profitable.Like most films 'inspired by real events' this takes many liberties with the actual truth; that doesn't matter too much though as it never takes itself too seriously. Tom Cruise is great as Barry Seal; he has the natural charm that makes the character believable even when the situation looks about to overwhelm him. The supporting cast are solid too; notably Domhnall Gleeson as Schafer and Sarah Wright as Seal's wife Lucy. There is plenty of entertaining action, some tense moments a fair amount of humour. The story plays out nicely; it probably helps if you have some awareness of certain major events of the time and know who the likes of General Noriega and Colonel Oliver North were.

"Fast-paced, Funny, and Entertaining","American Made feels like something we've all seen before, but it plays out with so much style and charm that it remains wildly entertaining the whole way. Cruise is well-suited for the role, and he turns in arguably his best performance of the decade. The rest of the decently large cast ranges from competent to very good, but it's really only Cruise that gets the proper screen time and character depth to carry the movie, and he does very well.Doug Liman directs the movie in his usual fast-paced style, but with dealings (drug, arms, and otherwise) taking place of the prototypical action/fight scenes. The intensity of this film comes from Cruise's Barry Seal, and the situations he manages to find himself in, rather than your standard action fare. The movie mixes comedy with intensity, as Seal finds himself in increasingly richer as he takes on more dangerous scenarios. Liman does very well with this style, and it gives the movie an interesting aesthetic - almost like The Wolf of Wall Street if directed by Kathryn Bigelow.For me, this is one of the biggest surprises of the year. I personally thought the trailers made this film look incredibly generic, like a typical action rehash.

Truth is Often Stranger Than Fiction,"I will admit, I don't know as much about this time in history as I feel like I should. Plus, with many ""Based on a True Story"" movies, it can be hard to tell sometimes what actually happened or what was compressed or exaggerated for a movie moment.But if even half of what happened in American Made is true, then it would still be a fantastic story, and Doug Liman did an excellent job bringing it to life.Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, a pilot for TWA who is recruited by the CIA to take reconnaissance photos of Central American militants during the late 1970s to early 1980s. However, his life gets more interesting/dangerous/lucrative when he gets roped into working for Pablo Escobar smuggling drugs, and eventually transporting weapons to the Contras of Iran-Contra infamy.These events play mainly as a stage setting for the story of Seal as he juggles all of these things while trying to provide a good life for his wife Lucy, played by Sarah Wright, and their children. It presents an interesting dilemma: does Lucy trust Barry, even if it means building a fantastical rich life only to have it potentially crumble away?Indeed, Doug Liman does a great job showing the chemistry between Cruise and Wright, and in that is the film's strength.It also has fun with the narrative structure, with Seal essentially narrating his exploits through recorded tapes after the fact.Where the film sometimes slides is when it has to stop dead and explain just who all the players are and what the significance of these events is. Sure, at first they can be funny in their presentation, and as someone who doesn't know a lot about these events it can be helpful, but it tends to interrupt a fun scene at a critical time, killing the mood a bit, and it breezes on to the the next scene without a chance to bring that mood back.Overall, I would say that this film is a fun historical drama with plenty of good-natured humor to keep it afloat, and even if some things may not have actually happened, you don't care because everyone involved is having fun as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just a hell of a lot of fun!,"'AMERICAN MADE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the life of a former TWA pilot, named Barry Seal, who became a contract pilot working for the CIA, as well as a drug smuggler for the Medellin Cartel (in the 1980s), and later served as a DEA informant. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, and it costars Domhnall Gleeson and Sarah Wright. It was directed by Doug Liman (who also directed Cruise in 2014's 'EDGE OF TOMORROW'), and it was written by Gary Spinelli. The film is a modest hit at the Box Office so far, and it's also garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a highly entertaining, and pretty educational crime biopic.In the late 1970s, Barry Seal (Cruise) was a bored pilot working for TWA, and also smuggling illegal cigars into America. He's approached by a CIA operative, going by the name Monty Schaefer (Gleeson), and offered a job flying clandestine reconnaissance missions over South America. Seal is later asked to be a courier between the CIA and General Noriega, and during this time he's also asked to fly cocaine into the US (on return flights), by the Medellin Cartel. The CIA pretends not to be aware of this, and continues to employ Barry; while moving him and his family to Mena for safety. Seal continues working for the cartel, and the CIA (making tons of money), while also trying to keep his wife (Wright) and daughter happy.The movie is surprisingly entertaining, from the opening scene till the very last (and that's a pretty high compliment in my opinion). It's just a hell of a lot of fun! Cruise is amazing (like usual) in the lead, and he pretty much makes the whole movie work (on his own almost). Liman is a decent enough director too, but this movie is all about Tom Cruise (and he totally sells it). It's also amazing how he can make a character that should be pretty unlikable, in any other film, totally lovable (despite all of the immoral things he does). The movie is just a blast to watch, and that's saying a lot for a biopic (in my opinion). I usually think they're boring.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very Entertaining --Cruise & Crew talent at its best,"Very entertaining. This movie was made with every one of its fibers to entertain. -- instead of just focusing on action shots alone to carry it like so many other lousy action movies do, this one has all the other qualities a ""real"" movie has: Very well written, acted, camera work, the pace of it is perfect ---exciting through and through. Except for the jabs at my side of the political aisle--that was hard to see. Every administration (Dem or Rep) is guilty of so much behind-the-scenes poor decision making in our history. So I hope it doesn't turn anyone an opposite aisle. But this movie is truly a success because of it's main actor, Tom Cruise, What can I say?... At the same time I have no over-the-top stumbling over myself fondness to go see all his movies, those that I do go to it's so noticeable-- he just succeeds time after time in making fun to watch movies. His on screen presence (true talent) is tops in the industry. Every time you see Cruise in a movie it's not Oh there's Tom Cruise in this movie or that movie playing this/that person, but instead you lose yourself in the actual character he plays and you just sit back and enjoy the show. This is a sign of true talent, and Mr. Cruise has talent on screen and never fails. He is what a lifetime achievement award is made for --and will be handed to one day -- hopefully many, many years away. Hats off to him yet again, he works hard to entertain and he delivers every time. (although I haven't seen all of his movies -- those I don't care for the genre: i.e. mummies or vampires.. so I have no idea how he does in those.)

"Cruisin at 10,000 feet","Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman take a page out of Martin Scorsese's book with a broad biographical take on prolific 80's drugs and guns smuggler Barry Seal.The Good: Like Scorsese's Goodfellas, Casino or Wolf of Wall Street, American Made takes an overall breezy just the highlights flashback approach to a tale of a never do well who hits well above his weight class. Tom Cruise is excellent in the lead role and while the rest of the cast is a bit forgettable (There is no Joe Pesci here) they certainly do a fine job. The movie is also beautifully shot and the period details of the late seventies early eighties seem spot on.It is also nice to see a major motion picture that doesn't look like a video game or tries to pass off various parts of Canada as the United States and Columbia.The Bad: Fans of historical accuracy are in for a rough ride. For starters, the main character Barry Seal's nickname was El Gordo and he weighed over three hundred pounds. Not an exact match for Mr. Cruise. Many of the actual events shown are simply made out of the whole cloth. The movie also has an annoying habit of name dropping (Like a protagonist in an Assassin Creed video game everyone Barry meets or interacts with becomes or is famous.) They even manage to get five presidents in a movie that takes place over only seven years (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and W all cameo in the movie through TV shots, phone calls and W in person.Also, speaking of El Gordo, good lord has Benito Martinez (David Aceveda from The Shield) put on some weight.In Conclusion: I love this style of movie that Scorsese perfected years ago (A shout out to Brian De Palma's Scarface as well of course.) Director Liman never quite reaches those heights. The lack of memorable secondary characters doesn't help but it is the fact that our main character gets all this money but seems to have no idea what to do with it outside of burying it in the yard and putting it in the bank that puts a damper on the ride. Liman never really shows any Gomorrean excess that can make these films a guilty pleasure.American Made is a very solid, handsome outing. Cruise continues to show himself as rising above his material and who always seem to give a 110%. He really is only better with age.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

What A Watch!,"American Made was fantastic! I loved every minute of it, the story itself is superb, we start off with the story of Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) an ordinary American pilot who became a drug-runner for the CIA in the 1980s in a clandestine operation that would be exposed as the Iran-Contra Affair. That alone was enough to make me want to watch the film and I'm so glad that I did. This film excels in every area you could ask for in a movie, let's be real has Mr Cruise ever made a bad film? I have yet to discover.What I like about this entertaining masterpiece is that it's all based on a true story, all of this actually happened and that's what makes it so incredible, a man who worked for the CIA and the Medellín Cartel, Escobar was sure a story that Is a fascinating one.All in all this was an incredible film that you should not pass the opportunity on, great setting for an epic adventure from the start to finish, the character development is crazy, highly recommend.

'I'm the gringo who always delivers.',"'I'm the gringo who always delivers.'
Based on a true story as written by screenwriter Gary Spinelli and directed with skill by Doug Liman, the facts are fascinating (the back story of the Iran-Contra affair), the multileveled changes to the story line pointing out the corruption and misdirection of the US in Central American affairs - all is brought to credible levels by the superb performance of Tom Cruise.The film is cleverly related in video flashback segments made by the lead character Barry Seal. Opening in the year 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) works as a pilot for Trans World Airlines. He is married to Lucy (Sarah Wright) and has two children with her, with a third on the way. Barry was recruited by the CIA (via agent Monty Schaefer played well by Domhnall Gleeson) who offers Barry better money by taking on reconnaissance missions for the CIA in a smaller plane with cameras just south of the border. Schafer convinces Barry that he would be working for the good guys, but it would have to be kept completely secret, even from his own family. He then lets Barry take the plane out for a ride. Through a series of odd circumstances Barry becomes a drug-runner, catches the attention of the Medellín Cartel associated with Pablo Escobar (Mauricio Mejia) who needs a man with his skill set. Barry becomes a drug trafficker, gun smuggler and money launderer. Schafer asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua. Barry invites pilots that are his friends and plots routes to smuggle drugs for the cartel. The CIA closes eyes to the scheme and Barry becomes richer and richer. He uses the Arkansas town Mena to laundry his money. But the DEA and the FBI are tracking him down. When the CIA shuts down the scheme, Barry is left alone and arrested by the agencies. Barry's wife's brother JB (Caleb Landry Jones) is a freeloader who adds to the mounting problems and tragedies.To add to the sense of reality the film includes snippets of President Reagan's speeches and brig sin Oliver North (Robert Farrior), offers extended shots of flying the planes of the mission, and keeps the dialog in Central America in Spanish. The cast is strong, but the film goes on too long - the saving grace is the performance of tom Cruise who is wholly convincing as the now infamous Barry Seal> A bit of history that now somehow seems more credible than when it was first reported!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Infectious,"The one thing I always ask of biopics is entertainment. You don't have to make a completely faithful adaption of true events, we have Wikipedia for that. All I ask is for a film to provide entertainment while maintaining the spirit of the true events. I'm not entirely sure how close American Made stayed to the life of Barry Seal, but it's damn well one of the most entertaining films of the year. With a refreshingly great performance from Tom Cruise and a pace that rivals the best of Scorsese's based-on-true-story films, American Made is another gem collaboration from star Cruise and director Doug Liman.American Made centers around the life of Barry Seal, a pilot who gets hired by the CIA to ship weapons to Central America and also gets caught up with drug cartels during his trips. The best way to describe this film is wild. But I think what I appreciated the most about it was it never felt like Liman was glorifying this irreverent lifestyle. Unlike say, Wolf of Wall Street, American Made never explicitly shows drug use, overtly sexualized scenes, or extreme violence. Instead, you get the full effect by just watching Seal go through ridiculous experience after ridiculous experience, and the smile never leaves Cruise's face.You can tell Cruise is having a blast making this, and his performance certainly echoes that. I mean, it doesn't hurt that I still had the taste of that Mummy movie before watching American Made. Luckily, Cruise is surrounded by a talented cast who follow along with the energetic tone Liman brings. And the energy this movie brings is second to none this year. I absolutely loved the way Liman told this story, never allowing the political side of this story to get in the way of a fast-paced drama.This isn't Goodfellas, Casino, or even Wolf of Wall Street, but American Made is a fascinating story that needed to be told and I'm glad Liman and Cruise were the ones who got the chance to tell it. Perfectly paced and infectiously performed, American Made is one of the best films of the year.8.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well then you've seen this one mostly or can guess enough of the story and how it will all pan out.Not that that makes it a bad movie. Strange vehicle for Cruise, especially as he is playing a man who even just physically was nothing similar (real man was very fat). Anyhow, Tom Cruise is an everyday man who ends up claiming to end up way over his head with drug dealers, government dark arts and mass government scandals.The said character is a chancer, but knows his market flying his battered planes full of drugs or guns between the US and Latin America, amassing ridiculous amounts of cash with the idealised white fence home and family turning a blind eye. And yes, it all comes crashing down.Tom Cruise strangely plays against type but still as himself! Yet it works, but the charisma is sadly masking that his character is really no hero or friend. Maybe simply Cruise wasn't the right person for the role despite giving an admittedly good performance. Credit though where it's due as he has taken a role that isn't really par for the course of what he's done before. Although he & his wife just seem too perfectly beautiful for the roles as a battle hardened blue collar couple who strike it lucky then all the way down.It's well made and shot and often humorous, but I couldn't empathise and am certain that enough of it masks the truth, with the authors and sources exaggerating what really happened with this character. Possibly the truth was even darker.It's fine to watch but ultimately it won't grab you enough and will remain on the shelves. Fine effort, interesting story but nothing more.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

America Made Me Do It,"From start to finish, director Doug Liman sends us back to the 80's to vicariously live through the high risk high reward lifestyle of Barry Seal in the film American Made. At first, the idea of a cocaine-smuggling pilot who is also employed by the CIA may sound like fiction, but the undeniable Tom Cruise is in the cockpit flying like his life depends on it.
While working as a TWA pilot, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is approached by Montey Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) who works for the CIA and he is looking to recruit a pilot to capture intel on the communists in Central/South America. Not soon after Seal begins working with the CIA, the now infamous Medellin cartel notices Seals frequent visits and the potential to get their new product (cocaine) to the mainland. Soon after, Barry forms strong ties with Pablo Escobar and the Medellin cartel which means lots of cash flow. Meanwhile, the CIA tasks Barry with flying guns to Nicaragua to arm the Contras which leads to flying the Contras back to be trained for battle in a boot camp set up on Barry's land in Mena Arkansas. Barry begins to make so much money from his drug smuggling operation that he doesn't have enough ground to bury it in. This allows his operation to expand by recruiting a team of elite pilots that work for him in his drug smuggling business.
Tom Cruise is not an unfamiliar face in the cockpit of an airplane, as he has appeared in the infamous Top Gun films. But, director Doug Liman seems to cast Cruise for his on screen charisma and his ""catch me if you can"" attitude. Because of Cruises approach to the film, the audience is always vouching for the ""ring that always deliverers"". Combined with the fact that the narration of the film is by Tom Cruise, which occasionally is from the perspective of Barry Seal recording himself on a camcorder reflecting on his journey, is another reason why American Made succeeds in captivating its audience. This style of narration is used as transition cuts as well as foreshadowing in the film. Despite the fact that it's an extremely engaging film, it has to move at a fast pace to be able to captivate the story of Barry Seal in a film setting. This can lead to feeling like you missed something in the plot or just purely that the film jumps around so frequently. It is also prevalent that Seal is a family man and will do whatever it takes to provide for his wife Lucy Seal (Sarah Weight), and their children, which also makes Barry a well-rounded likable character. Doug Liman has directed other action films such as The Bourne Identity films and Edge of Tomorrow which capitalizes on a Sci-fi twist to the action genre that so many adore. The screenwriter Gary Spinelli is able to immediately capture the audience's attention by making it known that this film is based on a true story. As the film progresses further, having the knowledge that these events have truly occurred made me want to continue watching just to see what unfathomable situation Tom Cruise will get himself into next.
It's hard to resist pointing out that Tom Cruise is a big reason why the film is so enjoyable. Whether he is saving the world in the action loaded Mission: Impossible films or traveling cross-country in the drama Rain Man, it is evident that Tom Cruise fully commits to the characters he plays. The photography in American Made such as the warm colored composition when Barry is flying also helps the film convey what the emotional charge of the scene is. This movie was often filmed with a zoom lens, generally on Barry Seal, which enhanced the realistic feeling meant to be portrayed to the audience. Doug Liman was also successful in creating a setting that was essential for that authentic 80's feel to the movie by recreating the style of the architecture and costumes in Arkansas as well as in Southern America. The decision to use real clips of President Regan also provided authenticity because it was able to directly relate to the current situation at that time in the film.
Overall, American Made will keep you on the edge of your seat in disbelief just waiting to see how Barry Seal is able to fly around the never ending dilemmas with seemingly unfavorable odds. Tom Cruise is in his optimal film environment that reinforces the suspense in this ""based on a true story"" film. The portrayal of Barry Seal, his lavish lifestyle, and his personality, is sure to make the audience and to get on a plane and fly back to the 80's.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
The gringo who always delivers,"It's never boring and almost always colorful, but it took me a while to nail down why ""American Made"" is so entertaining. It's because Tom Cruise is playing a cinematic Tommy Vercetti, in bed with the CIA, Escobar, Noriega, even the White House; high on vice and seemingly bulletproof. It's a playful flashback to a lawless time, and Doug Liman has the spirited direction and fast cutting to really make it pop.

Interesting True Story- Not Great Material for a Movie,"""American Made"" is based on the true story of Berry Seal, who becomes a mule for both the CIA running guns to Nicaragua, and for the Narcos running Cocaine to America. This is an interesting part of recent American history, but at the end of the film, I find myself asking: what was the point?The movie does a great job of informing its audience about the underhanded details of the operation. It is told from the point of view of Tom Cruise's Berry Seal. The main problem stems from having Berry as the protagonist of the story. A lot of the story he is just kind of going with the flow. CIA tells him to do this, he says ""sure"". Then the Narcos tell him to do something else, ""fine"". The focus isn't much on the suspense of him being caught in the crime, it is more on the escapism of imagining having all of this money and not knowing what to do with it. This can be entertaining, but after a while, the novelty wears off.All the actors involved put in a good performance. The movie has good pacing, there doesn't feel like any time is wasted. And it has a unique, dark and cynical sense of humor about the whole thing.A lot of people seem to like it, it just isn't for me. It is entertaining and informative.

A great comeback for Tom Cruise after his role in The Mummy.,"American Made stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a pilot who begins working for the CIA and begins a big business as a result, which eventually leads him into some difficulties with the law.After seeing the movie, I have to say that this is an interesting, immersive movie. Within the first 5-10 minutes, I got easily sucked into the movie. Tom Cruise does a great job playing the lead role of the movie. It does have a hint of a Goodfellas vibe with the way the movie's story is told in a fast pace, but it still is told in its own unique way that is hard to get into because it goes into spoiler territory. My main flaw with the movie, however, is the pacing. Often times, the movie feels like it is moving too quickly and it feels hard to sink in what has happened in certain scenes. With that being said, it ks a movie that should be watched a few times over because a lot happens throughout the duration of the movie.

An enjoyable Cruise,"Cruise has a checkered history, with stories of: his bizarre marriage arrangements, his famous Oprah appearance, and, of course, his adherence to Scientology. Originally, Cruise was liked by the public, then fell out of the public's good graces, and now, due to his skill as an actor, is conditionally liked again. It seems only appropriate that Cruise could make you root for someone as dubious as Barry Seal.""American Made"" tells the true story of Seal, a TWA pilot who got an offer to work from Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) for the CIA. He soon starts taking surveillance photos overseas when he stumbles onto a drug cartel. A little talk of money and he becomes a drug smuggler. When CIA learns of this, they decide to enlist him to transport guns to the contras. Pretty soon Seal has a thriving drug smuggling and gun running business.Seal is very much the protagonist, but fails as a good guy. However, the movie doesn't pass any judgment on his actions, but instead tells the story of a man trying to provide for his family while his life spirals out of control. That's where Cruise comes into play. You may not like what Barry is doing. You may find his actions repugnant. But with Cruise in the role, and despite your better judgment, you sympathize with the character.Like many movies based on a true story, facts are certainly jumbled up for effect. The director, Doug Liman, uses the narrative not to be critical of Barry Seal, but to be critical of the the CIA and the Reagan administration, which makes sense, since they were calling the shots. If Seal didn't takes the job, they would have found someone else and we'd have a movie about that guy.This is all background however. Liman adds a lot of flair to the movie to create the time period and to make it less jarring when we cut to the copious amount of stock footage used in this movie. But this is very much a Tom Cruise vehicle. Despite your better judgment, you spend the movie cheering for his character.""American Made"" does drag as Barry gets his business going and things run as expected for a while, but, fortunately, it's short. Overall, the movie was an interesting character study of a man with no real moral compass doing whatever he can to make money.

"Made Okay, About the USA","American politics is a theater that continues to garner more attention than even the biggest award shows. The players in their games can be just as interesting, especially in how far they go to accomplish their tasks. My second review of the weekend focuses on one such person named Barry Seal, a famous American pilot who was a cog in so many aspects. What does this movie have in store for us? Robbie K here to fill in on the latest biography and give you insight into another silver screen story. Let's goLIKES:The Setting: Technology's progression allows us to do many things, and one is recreating the past. American Made is a shining example of Hollywood's ability to recreate the trends of the decades, from what towns/cities looked like to the fashion and cars that filled them. You'll be pulled back in time with this film, and become integrated in the world and fully diving into the world crafted by Seal's actions. In addition, it's also fun to see old news' broadcasts integrated into the mix, further amping up the story. And for all you nostalgia lovers out there, feel free to have fun remembering the adventures you back then.Cruise's Acting: Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal life, but the man can certainly play his roles well. Cruise comes in spades with this film, capturing arrogance, coyness, and that adventurous spirit all in one sitting. His skills will bring out the emotions of the time period, the fear of being that pivotal chess piece that so many depend on. Cruise's chemistry with all his co-actors is favorable, resulting in a performance that feels natural. In addition, his dynamic abilities to transition between sub roles, further brings the character to life, an essential for a key role.Thorough Tale: Biographies are only as fascinating as the story presented, which often requires details. Our directors/screenwriters have got you covered in this movie, sparing no time cost to hit all the deals that Seal was involved in. Their presentation keeps guides you well in this movie, using captioned slide transitions and Cruise's comedic dialogue to set the time and place of the next adventure. It's an easy tale to keep up with and hits so many qualities of Seal's life in tandem to his antics (including family, friends, and even sanity). I felt that of all the books brought to life, this was one that hit the closest to home.DISLIKES:Magic vs Reality: The challenge with these films is determining what is real and what is overdramatized. There are plenty of moments where that question comes up, as the cast of characters appears with grandiose gestures and presentations to corrupt the system. As the story progresses, the whole conspiracy gets even larger and the drama amps up to levels that are hard to believe. The over dramatization gets a little cheesy at times, and made me roll my eyes at the extremes the legal system went to and how untrustworthy they were. Fans of this style though, will easily be hooked into the escapades of the movie.Skimped on other factors: While American Made touches on many aspects of the film, there was an imbalance in how much they would focus on those other aspects. The family aspect was so heavily influenced at the beginning, but then gets diluted down to background noise and occasional shots. Same thing goes for a few business partners he contracts as well, a rather focused opening, but then runs out of gas. While I give them props for keeping things concise, the disjunction between these aspects is a little disappointing to me, especially how one would affect the other. In addition, these rushed elements took the suspense away from me.The wasted sequences: The most annoying thing for me though, were the tangential flashes that occur in this movie. Seal's memories are fascinating to see, but there are a few of them that were pointless to have sequences for. An example is him randomly saying he had kids, only to flash to a scene of her in labor for a brief comedic relief. While a noble attempt, it was nothing a well-placed line could have done as well. There are other examples as well that all could have been left out, thereby further reducing the run length.The VERDICT:American Made is a great biography that has some flare other biographies have lacked for me. Cruise leads the way in terms of strengths for this movie, but the world and tale itself are an entertaining venue to watch. Yet, there are plenty of overdramatic moments and wasted shots that have made this a glorified Netflix/History Channel worthy production. If you are looking for a good biography though, scope this one out, otherwise wait for next week's releases before going to the theater.My scores;Action/Biography/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Performances And Directing But An Excruciatingly Slow Pace And Got Me Bored After Awhile,"""American Made"" is the true story of Barry Seal, played by Tom Cruise, who was a former pilot turned drug smuggler and become an informant for the DEA in the 1980s. I was really looking forward to this movie since it had Tom Cruise in it, but I was ultimately let down by an excruciatingly slow pace and a movie that felt really rushed. I don't agree with the critics on this one.I will say this, the movie is very well directed and most of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, which to me is different for a drama. Director Doug Liman has proved before that he can use hand-held camera the proper way and this is no exception.Tom Cruise also delivers an award worthy performance. This is him unhinged, and probably the best I've ever seen him. You could even say he's on Cruise control.The rest of the movie just fell really flat for me. This film has really poor pacing, as it felt both rushed and a lot longer than it felt. There are a lot of time jumps and it really doesn't give the film a chance to breathe. There is really no intro tot he film as well, which I know there are other movies out there that just jump right into the thick of things, but I felt I needed some more background information as to what the situation was and who the character was. There was no emotional tug at the heartstrings in this film for me.This movie's lack of a musical score also made the film feel a lot longer than it was. Sure there is a soundtrack in the background in some scenes, and I'm not expecting some epic, blockbuster musical score to go with a movie like this, but the films I find slow are the ones with a lack of musical score at most times.I am going to give ""American Made"" a C.Check out my review of ""American Made"" on YouTube for a more in depth analysis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw4ddqed5VE",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Smuggler's Rhapsody,"It's been advertised as another dopey Tom Cruise action movie. In reality, American Made is the true story of Barry Seal given the full GoodFellas treatment.

It's deja-vu for sure, but who the hell cares? Real life is a Scorsese movie. Deal with it.You will sit back and giggle with glee as this is, evidently, the best thing Tom Cruise has been involved with in years. He soars as Barry Seal. He captures the ""aw-shucks"" naiveté of a southern airline pilot way in over his head in a massive CIA conspiracy that at least 4 U.S. Presidents were complicit in. American Made takes no prisoners as it mocks political corruption and hypocrisy. But like GoodFellas and all the biopics after it, it tells the timeless story of just how far man will go to achieve unspeakable riches and the fatal cost of it all. Doug Liman makes the film fast and loose, especially on the cutting room floor. Between shaky, documentary style cinematography are countless archival clips from news reports, presidential speeches, pop-culture and even mock VHS recordings of Barry himself. Everything moves at lightning speed. This is a biopic for the age of the smartphone. You won't be distracted by anything. Fall 2017 has already proved to be a comeback season for moviegoers and American Made has already fallen under the radar in favor of other great films. Don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Tom Cruise jet fueled engine,"""American Made"", a non-stop action film from the same pair of director-actor that delivered on ""Edge of Tomorrow"", Doug Liman and Tom Cruise have proven once again that if they are put on the same set it will only turn out fantastic.The story of this biographic picture talks about real life pilot Barry Seal who gets hired by the CIA to collect intelligence in South America but ends up smuggling drugs for the cartel, and for non other than Pablo Escobar himself.
Tom Cruise plays the titular character and gives out of his best performances of his later career. The energy and fuel of Cruise's persona makes the movie a thrill ride for the viewer.
The fact paced editing and subject matter feel a bit like ""Catch Me If You Can"" or ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", but somehow you end up rooting for character this time.The script has wit, humor and its two hour running time will fly by without you even noticing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ridiculous and funny drugs caper carried by Tom Cruise,"Top Gun Maverick has been a mini-revival of Tom Cruises career - if you can ignore MIs continued success. This film was before that at probably one of his ""less"" successful periods. I watched this because it was on Netflix and had Cruise in it. I can't recall an awful film he's done but didn't expect much. This exceeded my expectations.Tom cruise plays a likeable, lucky and amoral at times drug running pilot who works with the CIA and some big drug names. Although it's a light hearted and fun adventure with little violence, the feeling of danger never being too far away pervades this film which it does very well. It also brings to light one of the most ridiculous stories of the past 50 years and a reminder America has done some damn stupid stuff.America does do these rags to riches, American Dream type stories VERY WELL. And although this film isn't original and sometimes has some weird cutaways and sex scenes it is a great performance and very enjoyable film. Can't do much better. Maybe the one let down was the skipping over of the evil that Barry Seal interacted with, but honestly I wasn't there so maybe that was his experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The story of the crazy Gringo,"""If this isn't the best country in the world!""As the marketing campaign suggests, the story on which this film is based is crazy. The film does a good job of highlighting this aspect. The fast pace and humorous narration confirm this. It is obviously not an accurate story, but it is certainly a lot of fun.Tom Cruise, as always, naturally exudes coolness. His obviously moody nature shines through here in this energetic interpretation of the character.I also loved the editing, which incorporates old footage in a clever way.The only negative aspect I can think of would be the constant, unnecessary zooming. Otherwise, the colorful and saturated cinematography is well done.In short, this film is good and cool. It is an underrated film that is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

However, there are quite a few I let slip by. Shame on me. ""American Made"" is an example of a movie I might have let go. What a mistake that would have been. ""AM"" is a great movie. It's one of those films that never shifts down as it goes on. Just like Cruise's character, this movie is in forth gear the whole time. It keeps on building speed.

Serious fun,"Barry Seal is the youngest pilot at TWA in the 70s. He's recruited by the CIA to do risky low altitude flights over Central America and take pictures of Soviet training camps. He succeeds and that helps his handler and himself. Now he's also tasked with delivering payments to Panamanian strongman Noriega in return for intel on the communists. Seal eventually catches the attention of the Medellin cartel who want him to transport cocaine to Miami. He instead suggests and convinces the cartel that dropping of shipments over Louisiana is better. He continues to do well on both fronts. The CIA buys him a huge piece of land in Arkansas including airport and Seal expands the drug transport operation. Once a leftist government is elected in Nicaragua, the CIA in its usual harebrained thinking process decides to repeat its mistakes and arm some guys claiming to be rebels. It's Seal's job to transport the weapons to the Contras. But of course these guys aren't interested in fighting someone else's war. The CIA then decides to train the rebels in the US and again Seal is tasked with the human trafficking. But the Nicaraguans would rather run away in the US than get trained. The cartel wants in on the action so it gets Seal to fly the weapons to Colombia instead.In the process Seal amasses a huge fortune that he buries in his backyard, fills up his mansion, deposits in banks all over Arkansas. Presumably the rest of his crew also does well so much so that suddenly Mena, the small town in Arkansas, becomes filled with banks. This eventually catches the attention of the FBI, ATF, DEA who arrest him. But the judge, after getting a call from governor Clinton lets him go in exchange for services he can provide to the government. It wants him to produce pictures tying the Central American communists to Colombian drug lords. Again, Seal delivers, but one of the pictures is leaked by someone to the press, a picture that shows him too. Now that Colombians, who have proven that they able to get to people in the US, know that they've been deceived by Seal and will try to get him.American Made is a strong action light comedy of the rise-and-fall of corrupt guy. Direction, editing, and music follow the Scorsese pattern to some extent. For the most part we are spared the family drama though but still, we get too much Cruise and not enough anyone else, especially the lovely Sarah Wright. Cruise overdoes his usual light-hearted approach; no matter the situation, he's nothing but smiles throughout the entire movie keeping things lighter than they need to be given the serious issues involved. But it's the story (and Wright) that shines, which is based to some extent on reality and the strange turns that Seals life take. Overall, a highly entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Comedy?????,"""American Made"" has the category ""Comedy"" along side it's billing. Not too sure about the comedy aspects, but is is a good action movie. It is based on real events, which, if true, shows the USA security measures as ultra poor. How these events portrayed in this movie where actually able to occur is ming boggling. Does this show how corrupt the USA is; perhaps it does? Getting away from the ""based on real events"", ""American Made"" is not too bad as a movie, entertains and a good storyline and leaves the viewer wondering what is fact and what ism fiction.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining and amoral,"This film is ""inspired"" by real event around the life of Barry Seal, an ex TWA pilot who flew various questionable missions to deliver drugs, weapons and other similar merchandise between the US, Colombia and Central America in the 70s and 80s.Tom Cruise is excellent in this role, playing a daredevil pilot who is quickly in over his head, being pulled between the drug cartels, the CIA, the DEA and his family. It does not really end well but it sure is entertaining.Some reviews here underscore the historical inaccuracies, but the fact remains that USA's various three-letter agencies tries to meddle in Central America in this period with very questionable results. It is fun to see the Old Gipper (Ronald Reagan) appear in this film with his real-life comments in context. None of the other presidents appear to their advantage, to be honest.The main comments about this film is that it is realistic *enough* and mostly, what in the world were they thinking?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

boring....,"Another typical narco movie shot in the same way with the same predictable outcome. Absolutely nothing new was brought to the table and felt like a complete waste of time watching it because the story has been told a thousand times already and the story they are trying to tell is bloated out with so much fictitious crap it sabotages itself.The movie is based of a real guy called barry seal who became a drug smuggler for the medellin cartel back in the day and eventually became a super grass for the DEA to avoid jail time. The problem with This film its one of them that claim its based on true events but then they bulk it out with so much fabricated crap and twist the facts for entertainment purposes it may as well have been classed as a work of fiction.That aside the movie would have had the same impact weather it had been based on real life events or not, there's nothing special or insightful about it. The plot is your typical criminal rise and fall storyline with the ""we are living it large"" montage in the middle to the deep regretful ""what did i do"" ending. With a drizzle of corrupt government espionage thrown in.The character development in this was terrible and the whole time i was aware i was watching tom cruise and not the character he was portraying. His wife in the film added nothing and was only there to moan abit or be behind him 100%, no inbetween. His kids in the film seemed to multiply in every family scene but brought nothing to the story (i swear by the end we thought it was gonna turn out they had like 50 kids)...the cartel were stereotypical cartel members who enjoy scaring americans by telling them they are going to die and then telling them it was a joke and for some reason they added an annoying brother in law into the film who added absolutely nothing to the story apart from being a pain in the butt for 5 mins and then being completely forgotten about after his exit. Another pointless character was jesse plemons who seemed like he was gonna be a big part of the plot but spent most of his screen time sitting down eating looking bored.This movie is one of the worst of the cartel era movies i've seen and it honestly felt like tom cruise was in it so he could have fun flying about in planes and doing stunts rather than take the role seriously.A Pure cash grab during the height of the cartel movie craze and not worth watching. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Has its Imperfections, but Generally Enjoyable,","American Made is a great movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a solid cast. It's an enjoyable film with a very intriguing story that I was never aware of. Barry Seal certainly lived a fascinating life that was chronicled very well here, we feel for him as a character, but also detest him as a human at points, which made for a varied, well rounded character.I was really not fond of the way in which this film was made, I get that they were going for something different but it felt unnecessary. It is shot in a sort of documentary style, where the camera is never completely still and it zooms in at weird points, but it is not blatantly pretending to be a documentary, so it simply comes out in a way that's puzzling to look at.The cast is generally well casted, a lot of the characters are underdeveloped, but the people with meaty roles do a stellar job. Tom Cruise is the star, of course, and really throws himself in to the role of Seal, more so than I have seen from him in a while. Domhnall Gleeson is also terrific as Schafer, stealing every scene he is in, his character is a complete enigma that we are always left wanting to see more of.Certainly worth the ride. It definitely has its flaws, but American Made is an enjoyable two hours that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film.Follows the story of Barry Seal, an airline pilot who becomes a drug runner for the CIA in the 1980s.Best Performance: Tom Cruise",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

What a fun Tom Cruise Movie,"Here we go with yet another first time watch for me and this movie is by far one of the most fun Tom Cruise Movies that I've watched in a long time.Positives for American Made (2017):
First of all, the movie's cinematography is phenomenal from start to finish. This is by far the most colorful looking Doug Liman Movie that I've seen and that made me happy. I enjoyed the premise where this group of guys smuggles guns and drugs to another group of people just so they can get rich. The movie also features colorful and lively performances from Tom Cruise, Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Jesse Plemons and Caleb Landry Jones. Tom Cruise in particular, is just oozing with charisma from start to finish. Domhall Gleeson is really enjoyabke the comedic sidekick to Tom Cruise. And finally, the comedy is amazing and this is one of those movies where you need to watch it just to experience it.Mixed for American Made (2017):
This movie is somewhat based on a true stor and while you get movies like this, you will become suspicious on how much are they going to show that did actually happened. But on the plus side, Doug Liman stated that this movie is ""a fun lie based on a true story!"" and honestly that actually makes for what this movie is going for.Overall, American Made (2017) is one of the most energetically entertaining movies that I've watched in a while and you definitely need to watch it now!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood's Hyped Version of True Events,"This was a very well done production but as with almost all Hollywood biopics, it does not follow reality but rather takes significant liberties to sell its film.For example, one legitimate reviewer puts it this way,
Like many a Hollywood biopic, American Made takes its fair share of creative liberties. For instance, one legitimate reviewer gives this example:
""Domhall Gleeson's character Monty Schafer is a fictional CIA agent"". To get the real story go the Screenrant web site.Still, this is an enjoyable movie once you keep in mind that it's juiced up. Tom Cruise 's performance is excellent and the supporting roles are as well.One big disappointment though is the inclusion of the characteristic single blasphemy which signals the industry's pledge to evil.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I'm sure you will like this movie,"An entertaining plot based on a true story, decent acting, authentic sets/objects/costumes, and good camerawork and visual effects make the film worth watching. However, the story of the drug trade has been described before and seems a bit chaotic, there should have been more character development besides everyone wanting to get rich, the pacing is drawn out in places as events are a bit repetitive, the movie should have been more serious, and movies like this that idolize drug dealers should not be made because these people are criminals, not heroes. It would have been nice to understand why (besides money) the main character makes certain decisions. Almost nothing was said about him, his wife, his wife's brother, not to mention the side characters. Finally, the soundtrack was appropriate but forgettable because it was just a collection of existing songs.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fun And Thrilling Flight Through History,"Watching ""American Made"" felt like embarking on a time-travel adventure. Immersed in the colorful and dangerous world of the 1980s alongside Tom Cruise's portrayal of Barry Seal, I found myself captivated. Cruise, as always, delivers a standout performance; his boundless energy and natural charisma dominate the screen. The film narrates Barry Seal's life story in such a fluid and entertaining manner that the perfect dance between fact and fiction deeply impressed me. Director Doug Liman masterfully blends suspense and comedy, offering a work that both entertains and provokes thought. However, the film occasionally treats historical events and character depth superficially, which prevents some of the story's real aspects from being fully illuminated. Despite this, ""American Made"" offers a pleasurable viewing experience without taking itself too seriously, pulling me completely into Seal's wild world. While shedding light on this dark and complex period of history, the film promises an adventure-filled story. The flow of the narrative and the development of the characters kept me glued to the screen until the end, leaving me wanting more. ""American Made"" is definitely a must-watch for those interested in history and seeking adventure. Despite its flaws, it provides an entertaining and memorable experience. My rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tom Cruise flies high as a fictional Barry Seal reaching heights he hasn't in years!,"Well, after Fargo turned out to be a totally made up story, I'm sure that most people have doubts on this movie. The back story of Pablo Escobar flying in coke to the US is true, the Oliver North selling the weapons via the Contra and the Iranians is true, the drug corruption of Col. Noreiga is all true, many elements are true as far as the back story, which makes for a great story. Actually, there was a Barry Seal, who did smuggle drugs, so that's why this story works well. Plus they really nailed the period dress, cars and boats that made for a great atmosphere. Plus there are funny tie-ins like George Bush, Ronald Reagan and even Bill Clinton. There was even some debate whether George Bush, ex head of the CIA had Barry killed or was it Escobar in a book by Shaun Attwood.So was this better than Mummy?Definitely, better. It shows the difference a well developed plot and characters can make in a movie. Plus I think this role really is a good fit for Tom Cruise, since we all know him as Top Gun. We all naturally assume he's a good pilot, so it always helps to have that background. The pilot Barry Seal is this bored TWA pilot approached by the CIA to start photographing all the USSR/Cuba communist supported troops in Central America. Of course he jumps at the opportunity having grown bored in a job similar to what we all have in life.How well does Sarah Wright play his wife Lucy? She helps to build up the common man wife of a pilot for the movie. She is actually from Kentucky, so that really helps give the Old South feel to the movie. Barry has to convince her of his nefarious dealings with the CIA despite losing their vaunted health care. Not sure if that's a jab at private health care, but she makes the sauce of the marriage work in the movie and is a great partner in crime for Barry.One of the best contrasts that really shows both of their original country roots is her cousin JB, who goes on to create endless trouble for the two. He really defines country stupid all around, but especially fits in Mene, Arkansas for the most part.How was the Pablo Escobar introduction handled? I think for the small part he plays in the movie, the actors playing his gang are impressive. They are the ultimate downfall of Barry, since he can't untangle himself as one of the key suppliers for Pablo in the movie. Barry looks aside the danger in the first bust, where he ends up losing a whole tooth in a Colombian jail. Luckily, his CIA pal Monty Schafer shows up and bails him out.The real Seal made daily deposits of $50,000 to his Honduran account through the early '80s. The filmmakers show him frantically burying duffle bags of cash in his backyard until he runs out of room because, well, that's funnier. Liman and Cruise want the audience to have a good time watching Seal play one side against the other. So comic scenarios are concocted out of whole cloth. In the film, for example, Seal pays regular visits to Manuel Noriega to pick up intel and deliver government payoffs. In real life, he may have used one of Noriega's runways.Nonetheless, American Made is an undeniably good time. It's briskly paced and amusingly absurdist. Cruise has rarely been as magnetic, perhaps because he's portraying a human being and not the kind of bulletproof action figure he's played for most of the past two decades. One thing the film isn't, though, is thoughtful.Even when Seal finds himself at the center of what would become the Iran-Contra scandal or is saved from jail by a last-minute call from president Bill Clinton, Liman and co. never pause to give events time to take on meaning. While that's a legitimate artistic choice, it's also a missed opportunity.It's fine to make a screwball comedy with government agencies running in circles like bureaucratic Marx Brothers. But I can't help imagining what this movie might have been if Liman had cut the engine occasionally, allowing viewers a moment to reflect on its ominous mix of Hollywood and history.With all the talk of making the country great again these days, we could use a wake-up call. Liman's film almost offers an unsettling reminder of the nightmare ""Morning in America"" often was.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Please no more Escobar movies !,"Sadly this is one of the worst Tom Cruise movies ever made. To me it felt more like a documentary than an actual movie. Just another attempt to cash in on the very ""trendy"" Escobar persona. The acting was OK because the actors are good, but they lucked the material that would allow them to ""shine"". Overall there was a huge shortage of emotion and suspense. I found some common ""cool"" elements with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" regarding direction and pace, but even these failed to save the movie miserably. Why? Because this movie was not directed by Martin. So: This movie is like watching a documentary on the ""Life of Barry Seal"". Watch it on DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Fun Lie Based On A True Story That's Casual, Cavalier & Carefree","From the director of The Bourne Identity & Edge of Tomorrow comes a breezy & lighthearted biopic that's not only aware of the limitations it imposes on itself but is more than happy to work within those confinements. Definitely not aiming for much, it is a fun-filled delight that does what it set out to do.The story of American Made follows the life & exploits of Barry Seal, a former airline pilot who flew missions for the CIA before becoming a drug runner for the Medellín cartel during the 1980s. But playing for both sides has its consequences, and it all eventually comes crashing down for ""the gringo who always delivers.""Directed by Doug Liman, the film creates its own version of Barry Seal, using only snippets of his real-life exploits while imagining other events in a way that serves well to its entertainment purposes. The narrative unfolds at a swift pace, is always on the move, and Liman does well to keep the interest alive with its amusing tone & fun vibe.Its varying set pieces evoke the required timeline while its groovy camerawork & warm colour palette help add a tinge of warmth to its images. Editing makes sure the film remains an engaging ride, despite its weak plot & poor characterisation, and paces the plot brilliantly. And its score & incorporated songs add flavours of their own into the finished material.Coming to the performances, American Made rides heavily on Tom Cruise's flair, on-screen charisma & magnetic presence, and the actor does all in his power to steer the film past the finish line. His input has an energetic, jovial quality to it that makes us root for his shady character at times, and he's finely supported by the remaining cast, especially Domnhall Gleeson who plays a CIA officer.On an overall scale, American Made is a fun lie based on a true story that's casual & carefree, and works mainly due to Doug Liman's kinetic direction & Tom Cruise's dynamic poise. Better than what I expected even though I didn't expect much, it's a sunny, sparkling & serviceable ride that promises an enjoyable time and delivers it. Although not a memorable entry by any means, American Made is nonetheless worthy of a shot.",,Anonymous,Biography
