Speaking Eyes,"""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Extraordinary Film,"Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The secret of Juan José,"In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.""El secreto de sus ojos"" tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. ""You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love"", Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in ""El mismo amor, la misma lluvia""; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in ""El mismo amor..."" it was a magazine staff, in ""Luna de Avellaneda"" the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances.That's about everything we can expect. The fact is ""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with ""La señal"". Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It's quoting it somehow, at least.It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it's enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in ""El mismo amor...""), but at the same time moving, simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
as good as anything out there,"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.I prefer not to get specific about what happens -- I mostly want to try to get across the quality of this bugger.

A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love. It has one of best chase scenes I've ever seen, involving what seems to be real complex camera work, something that could've been part of a Lord of the Rings movie maybe (at least that is what it looked like from my seat). Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect.

A Story of Passion and Commitment,"I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Absolutely impeccable, great film!","I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones).

Intriguing but Sloppy,"A retired Argentinian federal agent writes a book based on his recollections of a 25-year old unsolved murder case. Darin and Villamil give good performances as government co-workers whose relationship is fraught with unconsummated sexual tension. It is an intriguing story, but the execution is sloppy. There are too many loose ends and the plot elements pertaining to the murder suspect are so ludicrously contrived in terms of how he is targeted, caught, and convicted that it's hard to take this film seriously. Furthermore, after all the buildup, the conclusion is rather underwhelming. It's not a bad film by any means, but it falls far short of its lofty reputation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't call this a mystery,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT A MYSTERY OR A SUSPENSE THRILLER. This movie is more of a drama. I was expecting the movie to be a thriller/mystery. It was a bit boring after an hour or so. I didn't like the movie that much. Actors did a good job. I was expecting a huge twist towards the end, but the twist was not at all thrilling. Surprisingly, the ratings were very high, but the movie is dull. There is only one thrilling moment in the entire movie. The beginning of the movie was great, but after first half hour, the movie goes at snail pace. It was kinda predictable too. I would give the movie a maximum rating of 4/10.

Thus with such thoughts I proceeded to watch the movie.Initially, the plot and the character build up seemed nothing out of the ordinary but then gradually as the movie progressed it held me in rapt attention.Then it was simply impossible to let go, I was entirely swathed in this marvelous and sublime creation.

"In 21st century, eyes still speak","OK, frankly, I didn't expect much of this.I'm not familiar with Argentinian cinema, so this was my first acquaintance with director, writer and actors.Boy, what a surprise this movie made. It's beautifully filmed, it has lovely slow parts where director and actors narrate emotions through silence, this feature is almost vanquished from modern cinema where any frame that doesn't contain action is considered boring.I thoroughly enjoyed directing, but acting left me pining for Spanish classes. Impressive portrayal of characters if self-evident, with Soledad Villamil's performance shining out as an example of true actress. Unfortunately, we Spanish-impaired people can only sense the beauty lying within spoken lines and rhythm of the language that subtitles just cannot convey.As for violence and nudity they are used in glimpses, not more than necessary and in meaningful places, I spent good part of the movie fearing that it must eventually get ruined with some trendy shocker effect. But it doesn't, it flows it's own way beautifully to the end.If one can use small court office and a rape case to tell a love story in such subtle and profound manner it leaves me wandering what Argentinian cinema has for us for the future. I'll jump on digging through it's past right away, and I hope anyone wondering if this movie is worth their time can be swayed to yes side by my humble recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The movie is staggering in its ability to engage and while engaging to constantly fiddle with the expectations of the viewer. It is the rarest of movies, a slow movie that is never boring and one you never want it to end.I want to ask aloud why Hollywood feels the psychotic compulsion to remake every decent foreign film whether it needs remaking or not? I remember that one of the best horror films I have ever seen was about an undead girl in a climate so cold that the thought of living there was scarier than the story (LET ME IN.) It was a foreign film and the Hollywood remake took place in ... Mexico.Some people will never get it.Highly recommended. But you already knew that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How to Live an Empty Life?,"The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" is a film awarded with the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year with a dramatic story that perfectly entwines crime, thriller and a subtle romance in an adequate pace. The direction of Juan José Campanella is tight and the screenplay is wonderful, unfolding two lead stories – the brutal murder of a young woman and the repressed love of a subaltern for his chief – with many subplots. The acting is top-notch, with excellent dialogs and many funny lines but never vulgar. The cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and there is one specific scene very impressive with the camera approaching to the stadium in the middle of a soccer game between Huracán and Racing.

Deserves the Acclaim It Has Received,"When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Smells like a masterpiece!,"Wow what a great movie really! It began like a simple crime story but the wonderful use of subjects, symbols and strong references turned it in to a masterpiece.

By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks.

From the very beginning I forgot that I can't understand a single word they speaking. The movie glued me into it so that I can't get my eyes out of it. At first, I thought its a same old story a person looking for his wife's murderer 30 years later. Sooner the movie turned in to a masterpiece by attaching romance, humour and mystery/thriller into it.The plot is well executed, casting was excellent, camera angles were directed 100% accurately to express the sadness, humor, fear and romance of different situations of characters. Every single frame constructed towards the final decision of the movie, as in missing a frame would result in a loss of information, and I think that final result beats the endings of Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects which I liked most.

The trouble Esposito and Irene have communicating with each other is something most people overcome by junior high school, even given that class distinctions in Argentina in that period are probably stricter than here. The reaction of the husband, Morales, from beginning to end is close to fantasy, and as for the way Esposito and Sandoval track down the suspected perp -- preposterous.So this won an Academy Award and an 8.3 rating at IMDb?

Great movie to watch when all other movies tick you off,"Here's me going through my movie collection: ""No. Nope. Too stupid. Too intelligent. Too juvenile. Too pretentious. Too predictable. Too unbelievable.""You'd think I would learn my lesson and stop shopping for movies at Blockbuster close out sales.And then my finger hit ""The Secret in their Eyes"" and I thought ""Hm, Academy Award winner, Best Foreign Language Film 2009... doubtlessly too political."" But I popped it in anyway, figuring out of all my options I'd hate it the least.Right from the first scene I knew this film had something important to say. And I'm not just talking about some canned socio-political cliché that wins many Best Foreign Film Academy Awards. This movie has an important personal message to tell, and it's woven into the story in a very careful way.The trailer, as well as a lot of exuberant film critics, make this sound like a tense action packed thrill ride, but it's not. Even better, it's a quiet, human, often comedic tale that happens to have some great elements of ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" and ""romance"" without falling squarely into any of those predictable categories. In a sentence, the plot is about a retired court employee who, unable to forget a murder case from 25 years earlier, decides to write a book about it and thus dig up some old ghosts.Yes, if handled like a John Grisham thriller, it could have fallen into a standard Hollywood formula, but in the expert hands of director Juan José Campanella (quite respected in his home country of Argentina but not yet as famous in the USA), the film balances itself as a thoughtful yet very engaging statement about human nature. I am reminded of another excellent award winner from the same year 2009, ""Five Minutes of Heaven"", a UK film that similarly focuses on a crime decades past and how different characters have been affected by the passing of time.But what made ""The Secret in their Eyes"" even more interesting to me is the way it's not necessarily about a past crime, but it's also applied to past love, past opportunities and past (and present) obsessions. As a great line in the film goes: ""A man can change his appearance, his job, his god. But he can't change his passion."" Thus the theme is stated: this is about letting go, or not letting go. And whether we're talking about crime, justice, love or dreams, we can all relate.I have to mention one thing with regard to the cinematography & visual presentation. This is the sort of movie that cinema geeks will love, and so will average people just looking for entertainment. Certain scenes are so expertly handled, yet not obnoxiously artsy, that you can't help but get swept up in them. For example, perhaps the crowning achievement is the ""stadium scene"" which is a 5-minute, uninterrupted shot that begins a mile in the air above a stadium before gliding over the field, into the stands, to a dialogue between two characters, then following behind them on a tense scene running through the stadium floors, into a bathroom, over a ledge(!), through some more twists, then back to the field ALL IN ONE CAMERA SHOT. Certainly it was edited to appear like one shot but it's seamless. Fans of Orson Welles' famous ""Touch of Evil"" opening scene (which itself takes us through the streets of a Mexican city in a brilliantly orchestrated 5-minute single shot) will love this sort of stuff.If you have the opportunity to see this movie, whether or not you find yourself in a cranky mood like I was, don't pass it up. Last note about content warnings: there's a disturbing rape scene right near the beginning with some nudity and blood, one or two bloody but tasteful scenes, then there's a somewhat eyebrow raising (yet necessary) scene of frontal man parts. But if you, your kids and/or your puritanical parents can handle those, the film is OK for everyone. Since this is a non-USA film where animal cruelty laws don't necessarily apply, I thought I'd mention there is no animal cruelty, whether simulated or real. This is a great film which, I believe, demonstrates the finest of modern Argentinian cinema.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Senor Campabella, take a well-deserved bow","It's a thriller. It's a love story. It's a puzzle movie. It's It's an acting tour de force. It's spectacular cinematography.It's a masterpiece.Going in, all I knew is that it was a highly regarded film from Argentina that won an Oscar. I know zip about Argentine cinema, but it's hard to believe a better movie has ever been made there.One thing Americans should know is that this ""foreign film with subtitles"" is in no way, shape or form an ""art movie"" loaded with ambiguity and other hoity toity stuff like that. This movie is the work of a master craftsman director working off a brilliant and intricate thriller script.The narrative unfolds in interspersed scenes involving the same people, but 25 years apart. It's the same actors and characters, but youthful in some scenes and with wrinkles and gray hair in others.The plot turns on the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young wife. Front and center throughout the movie are Benjamin, the passionate young investigator for whom this particular case is one he cannot set aside, and Irene, his colleague (it was a little unclear to an American what their professional relationship was) who clearly is drawn to his passion and has feelings for him, even though she is engaged to someone else (offscreen).Two shots must be discussed. First, there's THE shot. Anyone who has seen it will know exactly what I mean. It's a one-take (seemingly, but not really — it would be impossible without CGI) tracking shot involving a chase in a packed soccer stadium. The second much-discussed shot is only about a minute long and happens in an elevator, but you will not breathe during that incredibly tense minute.Lots of credit goes to the secondary actors, who portray a law clerk with a drinking problem, the perpetrator of the crime, a hapless intern, a weaselly judge and the devastated husband of the victim.The ending is an elegantly shown series of reveals. The next-to-last sequence totally screws with your mind. I kid you not, it's a shocker and it comes out of nowhere.

Absolutely chilling and worthy of every moment spent seeing it.,"Just like others here there's little left to add to these fine reviews except to mention a particularly terrifying scene -well more an image - that I found absolutely chilling and haven't seen it mentioned yet, one that 1st revealed the monster who committed a truly brutal crime.

You'll know it when you see it and I've given nothing away ...not a spoiler in sight. I'm merely pointing out what stayed with me that I hadn't seen noted by others. See, this is a movie that grabs you right from the start and keeps you through all sorts of tones that change and are just too touching to break down into categories. But I think that only actors of this caliber could pull it off and drag me around through beauty through ugliness back to beauty and my affection or repulsion never wains.

Competent crime film,"A retired Argentinian federal agent is trying to write a book about a past case of his and in doing so hoping to finally come to terms with it. The case concerns a murdered young woman and all the legal hoops they had to jump through in pursuing a conviction and all the corruption that stood in their way.Ricardo Darín plays the lead role here. He was also my favourite in another Argentinian film, Wild Tales, which I really enjoyed, and he's also my favourite in this film. Something about his whole being is just perfect to convey the frustration and sadness his character has to go through in fighting the windmills that are the Argentinian government and its legal system.As for the story, it was competent and very much enjoyable, but I also felt that it lacked that certain something. The end twist I could see coming miles away and the rest of the events, while competently filmed and certainly professionally made all around, were not what I'd call original.Not to say that originality is the end and all of film making - although it usually doesn't hurt. You can tell a classic tale and your film will be a classic as well, if you just tell it well enough. But here I didn't find that personal touch that I'm looking for.Still, the film is very good.

Secrets revealed,"I guess you might see some things coming. But this is not that much about the secrets (at least for me), but the journey of our main protagonist.

But because it is expected of you (of what your appearance is in other peoples eyes), you keep on walking. Maybe regretting the decision while you are walking, but walking that path nevertheless.That is of course the way I read the movie. You might come up with something completely different. Or some might wait until the inevitable US-Remake hits a cinema near them (in 2012 as IMDb reveals). That this would be remade after winning the academy award for best foreign language picture, does not come as a big surprise to me.

There are slow parts, and the constant dialog makes it hard for me to keep up with the subtitles.

Perfectly fine and perfectly rounded little thriller with more grandeur-a aspirations to be what isn't quite; The Secret in Their Eyes makes the grade more often than not.,"There can't be many actors working within Argentina, indeed the world, with a presence-come-expression, or 'tone' about his being there as there is with Ricardo Darín. The man's solemn appearance twinned with the general low-key immediacy to his being on screen is in no way an insult; on the contrary, for most of his work in terms of the characters he has played, a downcast and lonely-cut figure of an individual with some crucial decisions on his mind has seen him close to being always perfectly cast. His expression just seems sad, as if the weight of the world rests on his shoulders and there is nary a person within a hundred miles whom can help him deal with it – if we were in the film with him, we might see ourselves wanting to lend a hand. Here, that man is dropped into a film whose narrative is a weaving, twisting plot kicked off by a pretty harrowing catalyst and left to those primarily involved to stew in juices that do not involve a whole lot of justifiable help from the authorities whom operate distastefully. Here, Darín plays one of those protagonists placed on the front-line; a character who, at one point, has to literally kick away at a yapping, puppy-dog sized mutt in what you might categorise as self-defence but is an action born out of Darín's being in a place he initially should not have been. Not many protagonists in movies can kick a dog belonging to a somewhat elderly woman and still have the audience on their sides after a breaking and entering offense, even enforce a guffaw out of the whole situation: Darín can because we're on his side the moment we see him.His character here is Benjamín Esposito, a man we first encounter in a place of dwelling all to himself as the thoughts; memories and his own envisages of what might have happened during past events he was not present at, haunt him. Now, he attempts to turn what it is he has experienced into material worthy of selling as the written word; the lack of a word processor or even a typewriter suggesting a man of a particular age, the crumpling up of several sheets of paper despite some fairly competent renditions of his work wryly hinting at a man obsessed with detail and figuring things out to their perfect denouement. The film, Argentinian set, will flick between the present day and the latter-half of the 1970s; those of whom knowledgeable of contemporary Argentinian history (or have at least caught Christopher Hampton's 2003 film Imagining Argentina on the off chance) will know that the said era was one of a distasteful nature. An ongoing case to do with the rape and murder of a young woman across the street from some construction workers that were eventually blamed plagues the past, the reunions between those predominantly involved with investigating such a case doing so for the present.The film kicks into gear when Esposito, in the present day, visits a long-time companion from that case named Irene Hastings, played by Soledad Villamil; a woman he can still remember first laying eyes on and for whom a fair while has passed during which time he has harboured certain affections. She is a judge at the law firm at which he worked, pleasantries and niceties giving way to solemn silences when the Morales case, long-since closed from decades ago, is mentioned inducing now somewhat glum faces. Like Esposito displayed during the opening, she can be eloquent in her dictation and has a similarly high level of skill with words; the film exploring their relationship in the present day as much as it does the link they had when they worked tirelessly back in the day. The Morales case is indeed the crime revolving around the deceased young woman whose perpetrator, its seems, got away with what he did and the film flashbacks to the time and place it all unravelled so as to follow Esposito team up with an alcoholic co-worker named Pablo Sandoval (Francella) in the attempt to try and tackle the state-led enemies in order to dig out the truth.The film is an interesting and brooding piece without ever being overtly involving; it painfully, and granted the accolades it has won, even confusingly did not necessarily strike me with quite clearly the same verve it did to many-a other. The film is a competent but plodding piece, somewhat televisual but rather plump and rounded in its neat, free-flowing causality as one thing moves onto the next and a power struggle erupts between two sides. I spent large portions of the film wandering to myself precisely what it was Darín's character did; eventually pluming for a sort of hybridised role encompassing journalism, archivist and police work. There are moments that the film leaps off of the screen and enraptures you, but do so more out of the sheer jump in aesthetical quality than anything else; take, for instance, the sweeping shot from high above a football stadium but ends in the rafters of an end behind the goal, a sequence which strikes us as the cinematic bolt-from-the-blue because it probably belongs in a better film.Make no mistake, The Secret in Their Eyes is an able-bodied enough little investigative thriller but it is so without being overly confrontative nor particularly daring; its cat-and-mouse elements leading up to and beyond the apprehension of whom it is they assume to have committed the murder are engaging enough, but are counterbalanced by instances such as a key scene in a central relationship whose chief moment of emotional release is relegated to the status of a self-aware cliché, which still doesn't stop it being what it is. You could do a lot worse than The Secret in Their Eyes; the film is a fairly decently executed, well-meaning character study but which, frustratingly, did not strike me as much as I would have liked.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There is a message in what the spectator sees at the end. If you think this movie is a thriller or a love story is because you did not understand it.

The secret in their eyes : A Juan José Campanella film with tremendous mass appeal as well as numerous loopholes.,"It is due to films made by veteran directors Fernando Solanas, Eliseo Subiela, Hector Alterio, Adolfo Aristarian, Maria Luis Bamberg etc that Argentine cinema continues to enjoy considerable fame among specialized film festival audiences and knowledgeable general public. In many ways, that tradition of success is being carried on by a group of young directors including Juan José Campanella whose films are quite popular in USA. However, 'The secret in their eyes' is a major disappointment as it ends up being a weak work of cinema with numerous plot related shortcomings. One glaring error is that Campanella's film does not concentrate on one particular theme. It flits amblingly from novel writing by a retired legal counselor to his desire to find love from his former lady boss and his willingness to learn more about a highly intelligent criminal who is believed to have perpetrated a heinous rape as well as murder. Apart from showcasing an important 'entertainment' content for viewers, director Campanella's film succeeds in depicting a certain equitable idea of justice with ""ethical implications"". This idea leads this film's protagonists to pursue 'justice' till the very end. Finally, things happen at such a frantic pace that viewers are left with no choice but to think highly about sixth Babylonian king Hammurabi and his famous adage ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

from a place touched by creative grace,"This film is simply extraordinary, it has the building blocks of the great classical works: passion and sensitivity.

Finally one has the sensation of floating in a world that is neither our daily reality nor the story one has seen. Such is the creativity that the insight revealed feels natural and unpretentious. It connects us to a mysterious part of ourselves . Someone described it as poetic thriller is more than that, is a huge breath of life, told from a place touched by creative grace.

"Splendid film full of emotion , love ,   intrigue  and feeling of joy and sorrow","Perceptible drama with suspense filmed with sensitivity and feeling. The story, set in 1999, is told in flashback way : in June 1974 a Justice Officer , Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), becomes entangled in the investigation of the crime of an ill-fated wife named Liliana , cruelly raped and killed inside her home in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. Her widowed husband named Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago), is shocked by the crime ; Espósito promises to find the murderous and bring him to justice. Benjamin is helped by his drunk assistant Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class Secretary of Court named Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) who is hired at the Criminal Court . Despite the department already having two other suspects Benjamin seeks tips off . Espósito's rivaling partner Romano pins the killing on two immigrant employees so as to get rid of the case , an issue that infuriates Espósito, hitting Romano in a fury. He finds a track while seeing some photos provided by Morales: he comes across a strange young man identified as Isidoro Gomez(Javier Godino) who watch the victim in a rare manner in various pictures. Espósito investigates the whereabouts of Gómez, and learns that he is residing in Buenos Aires, but fails to chase him. Espósito and Sandoval break into Gómez' household in an illegal entrance and take some letters that lead a clue about his liking to Racing Club . The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, and they set out in pursuit . Meanwhile Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel, using the matter as the source material. Benjamin was personally affected by the case as he tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him.This sensitive tale contains intrigue , tension , drama, and an enjoyable love story . It's a brilliant and touching film though sometimes is slow moving and tiring but is developed with intelligence and sensibility. In the picture are treated ethic and moral themes narrated with great sense of fairness and ductility . Marvelous relationship between two main starring , they are frankly wonderful . Very good interpretation from Ricardo Darin as impulsive Justice Federal Agent who embittered by unsatisfactory ending to the case will have to face the traumatic truth and special mention an awesome Soledad Villamil as intelligent and wise chief department . It's impossible to escape to spell of the Argentinian movie star Ricardo Darín. Not only is he continually employed but whichever body chooses Argentina's Oscar submission each year has a huge crush. Darin's the star of their 2001 nominee Son of the Bride and this 2009 winner The Secret in Their Eyes and he's also principle cast in their submission titles that weren't nominated from 2002 (Kamchatka), 2005 (El Aura) and 2007 (Xxy) . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Juan Jose Campanela and deservedly prized with Oscar winner for the best foreigner film . He's a good Argentinian writer and director as Television as ¨Law and Order¨, ¨ Winds of water ¨,as cinema as ¨The Avellaneda's moon ¨, ¨Same love same rain¨, ¨Son of the bride¨ again with his fetish actor Ricardo Darin .

"It's classic retro mystery film-making, made with an incredible eye for atmospheric detail","El secreto de sus ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes), director Juan José Campanella's pot-boiling mystery romance, comes to North America loaded with the freight-load of expectation. Earlier this year the picture picked up the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, to some surprise, as it beat out two films everyone assumed were duking it amongst themselves: Michael Haneke's Das Weisse Band and Jaques Audiard's Un prophète, two absolutely astonishingly good films.The bad news is that Campanella's film is not as good as Haneke's and Audiards are, but the good news is that it's a close-run thing. While Haneke and Audiard work at the outer limits of biggish-budget narrative film-making - coldly documenting the roots of fascism in the pettiness and cruelty of village life in 1910's Germany in the case of the former and grittily, violently exploring the tension between Arab and Corsican inmates in a Parisan prison in the latter - Campanella's film is old fashioned. Charmingly so, in fact.Argentinian superstar Ricardo Darín plays federal justice agent Benjamín Espósito. Set partly in 1999 and partly in 1974, the film follows Espósito as he tries to complete a novel about a case that he had undertaken 25 years earlier, with the help of his alcoholic assistant Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and ivy-league educated boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil). As the three investigate the case - the brutal rape and murder of a young woman - they must not only piece together enough evidence to find the killer, but also deal with Argentina's slide into political violence under Isabel Perón, a widow with his own agenda and a budding, impossible romance.It's classic retro mystery film-making, made with an incredible eye for atmospheric detail, made by people talented enough to create suspense and old-fashioned thrills without having to resort to cheap action-movie shootouts. It's occasionally corny and often melodramatic, but it is stacked top to bottom with great performances - comedian Francella as the heroically dissolute Sandoval chief among them - and a script that takes us and the trio from authentic-seeming 1974 Buenos Aires dive bars to a riotous football match, from the paper-jammed offices of a well-meaning judge to the gleaming polished wood of a fascist, scheming operative. It succeeds because of its occasional corniness, because packaged along with everything else that the film does so well it doesn't offend, it just seems pleasant, and old fashioned and warm, an entertaining reminder of how un-glitzy, un-rock and roll mystery film-making used - and still can - be. 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I don't speak or understand Spanish and I don't watch many foreign language films, but I somehow managed to get myself in a mood to watch this and I am so glad I did. This movie as mentioned here, had two underlying themes, one is about the obvious rape and murder mystery, and the other more effective theme is the unspoken love between the main character and his supervisor. As for the story itself, its about the rape and murder of a young woman, and revolves around the police team (a detective, his supervisor and his drunk assistant) who try to solve it, her husband and the killer. It is not so much about trying to find out who the killer is, rather about the emotions involved with the people concerned. The untold love story between the detective and his supervisor captures as much attention as the murder mystery and is beautifully told. I really didn't find any negative points with the whole film, the acting was brilliant, the screenplay was superb, the editing was also neatly done.

"Definitely NOT a waste of time, but there was potential for more","I must confess I was slightly disappointed. This film starts off great: a good premise, well-rounded characters and more than decent directing, all wrapped up in a wonderful mixed atmosphere of the ""drama"" and ""crime"" genres -- to sum it up, it strikes up your interest immediately, and is both friendly and captivatingly serious from the start. However, for most of its runtime from then on, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" feels both cheesy and pointless, presenting the murder case as (presumably) solved and focusing way too much on the seemingly eternal (yet never consummated) romantic attraction between the male and female protagonist. It's not that it gets boring; it just loses its focus for a little too long, and, not being a fan of the ""romance"" genre, I'll admit this bothered me.Still, this film has a respectable amount of both hilarious and shocking scenes, and considerably redeems itself with its unexpected, twisted ending (I mean the part relating to the murder case, not the, once again, horribly cheesy romantic part), which will definitely have you curious for a while and then leave you thinking. Overall, I'd describe this picture as having great potential to be extraordinary, but ultimately failing to completely live up to it, not meeting certain expectations and becoming, for too big a part of it, ordinary. With that said, and while I was, all in all, disappointed, I still urge people to go see this movie -- it's much better than most of the girly vampires/dancing crap out there these days, anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Modern Classic of the Genre,"Only the second Argentinian film to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Secret in Their Eyes is equal parts a slow-burning crime thriller and a forbidden love story that affects everyone involved for over a quarter of a century, following two separate timelines. In 1974, Judiciary employee Benjamín Espósito begins investigating the rape and murder of a young woman named Liliana Coloto. Assisting him in the investigation are his assistant Pablo Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings. Twenty-five years later, Espósito decides to use the case as the basis for his first novel, leading to a reunion with Hastings and the revelations that arise from discovering events that were set in motion twenty-five years prior. Although the majority of the film's runtime is devoted to the 1970s timeline, director Juan José Campanella, who also served as the film's co-writer and editor, finds a masterful balance between the two, crafting a non-linear narrative that provides a satisfying resolution to both threads.Admittedly, the film takes a while to get going, with the initial back- and-forth between the two timelines feeling a bit jarring. However, as the story begins to unfold and we delve deeper into the investigation, the film simply captivates, as Campanella delivers an engrossing crime drama with an ending that left me breathless. I will say, however, that I found it difficult at times to keep up with the film's rapid-fire dialogue. Even though I speak Spanish myself, some of the film's dialogue-heavy scenes demand the full attention of the viewer. While I don't know how this problem might play out for someone watching the film with the English subtitles as they might be simplified, but it is a problem that I found worth noting.The film's engrossing nature rests on the strengths of its performers, which include Ricardo Darín as Espósito, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, and Soledad Villamil as Hastings. Darín does magnificent work in the lead role, expertly capturing Espósito's growing obsession in regards to the case. Francella, in his after first dramatic film role after an established career as a comedic performer, turns the alcoholic Sandoval into a fascinating character. Sandoval, whose relationship problems and drinking habits often conflict with his occupation, could have easily been a one-note stereotype, but Francella (who bears an uncanny similarity to Steve Carrell) manages to make him a likable character. Sandoval's friendship with Espósito leads to one of the film's most emotionally charged scenes. Villamil also delivers a mesmerizing performance. Much like the film's title implies, the eyes of these characters play an important role, serving as a method of non- verbal communication. And none of the other performers use their eyes to their advantage as much as Villamil does. Through her beautiful gaze, we see the complex relationship she forms with Espósito, whose eyes convey a buried, unspoken love for her.The film also benefits from more than just Campanella's storytelling abilities. This is a marvelously well-composed film, one that takes full advantage of the cinematic medium. Each frame feels tightly constructed, with Campanella sometimes telling two different stories in the same frame or obfuscating characters behind chairs or piles of documents and folders. In regards to the latter, by framing his characters in such a way, Campanella subtly communicates the growing obsession that they feel as the investigation begins to unravel. The film's technical prowess doesn't end there though. The film contains an enthralling five-minute long take set in a soccer stadium that ends with Espósito and Sandoval chasing their primary suspect, one Isidoro Gómez (acted to chilling perfection by Javier Godino), on foot. Campanella isn't just concerned with ideas of obsession, however. The film's conclusion allows for it become a meditation on justice and to what ends someone will go to punish a guilty individual. And Pablo Rago, who plays the deceased's husband, shines in these scenes as he delivers a haunting performance.Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoroughly compelling film that benefits from a well-executed screenplay, skillful direction, and a host of strong performances. It's a shame that Hollywood couldn't resist the urge to remake the film years later with Billy Ray's Secret in Their Eyes, which ended up being a decidedly inferior production. Campanella's original, however, stands on its own as a modern classic.Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Superb,"I don't typically write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to do so with this one. Note: I speak Spanish fluently so I watched without subtitles. I don't know what could be lost in translation. But being able to fully understand the dialogue surely makes a difference. I've seen this movie many, many, many times in the years since it first released in the USA. I saw it twice in the theater, I've never done that before this movie and since then. It is by far the best movie I've seen. The acting is outstanding. Ricardo Darin always delivers, but this one was just amazing. Even though the storyline moves back and forth in time, it's so that the viewer understands exactly why things happen. You laugh, you cry, you cringe. It's a roller coaster of emotions. The dialogue is amusing and spot on. The closeup of the different characters eyes at peak moments is subtle but so telling. The one camera take of the climatic scene really takes your breath away; you feel like you're there. I recommend this movie all the time. Perfection!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Poignant ,Powerful and Great film making","An Argentinian movie that won the best foreign language Oscar this year. It had me going for this same reason. It in many ways reminded me of memories of murder.However the movies are entirely different from each other. It is about a sheriff writing a novel about a closed rape and homicide case he was involved in 25 years ago. A case that changed his life in drastic ways.As he recounts the past , new revelations are drawn upon him. He starts viewing the case from a fresh perspective and realizes that there is more to it then what meets the eye. The movie is slow and gradually the plot evolves itself .If you are looking for some nice thrilling moments of action, then this is surely going to disappoint you. It is more of a drama thriller . The pacing is deliberately slow but effective. There is also a touching romantic element in the movie.The performances of all the actors in highly commendable and of top notch quality.. It is indeed flawless film making . The story is concrete and never digresses from the main point.Your patience will be highly rewarded by the excellent and poignant ending.

You get a real feel for the characters, city and underlying corruption that permeates the film and makes you feel uneasy throughout. There is also a real insight into the smarter side of Buenos Aires life with stylish bars, restaurants and a culture of humour not unlike the British. I am told by my Venezuelan fiancée that the Argentinians are renown for their sense of humour in Latin America.

"Not a total waste, just not worth the accolades","I watched The Secret In Their Eyes yesterday with a friend. I have not seen The White Ribbon or A Prophet, but if TSITE won an Oscar for best foreign language film, maybe I don't need to see the others.This film is so flawed it's hard to know where to begin. As another reviewer pointed out, it was difficult to keep the time period straight because the characters looked nearly the same in present and past scenes. That made it difficult to keep track of the storyline.*** spoiler alert ***The ""clues"" that led them to identify the murderer were so thin it was impossible to take any of that seriously. I also had problems trying to figure out what happened in the stadium; and the aerial shot was gratuitous and superfluous--just for show. The ending was interesting, but I found more story holes there, too. Another thing that bothered me was the female lead character's ending up in an empty, passionless marriage. It's hard to imagine such a fierce, self-possessed, successful woman would have settled for that.All that said, the acting was pretty good--especially actor who played Sandoval. He was engaging and pretty funny. It isn't a complete waste of time and money, just not worthy of all the accolades.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An example for movie makers everywhere,"It took me three years to finally watch this movie. It was in Spanish, and it was always easier to watch a silly blockbuster or some series when coming back from work, so I always waited it out. I am glad I did not wait any longer. As other reviewers noticed, it is hard to find flaws in the movie, from the beautiful story, nice camera work and great acting to the painfully emotional feel and the depiction of Argentinian corrupt justice system.The film is slow paced, but building strength with every scene. The characters are complex, the situation is complicated and real. There are no useless plot devices, gratuitous violence or nudity, no ridiculously moral or powerful or lucky or beautiful people. No pointless Spanish cursing and over-dramatic scenes. It's painfully real for its whole length and, even if the ending is pretty intense, you get there in a smooth curve.Bottom line: if this is the film, I really wonder how good the book was. The movie was perfect for me and I can't recommend enough watching it.

"Quiet, dramatic, beautiful, touching, well acted, gorgeously filmed...what else do you want?","El secreto des sus ojos (2009)A quietly building up of suspense and romance , a terrific movie. It has some of the slow pace punctuated by violence of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and it shares the steadfast leading man (Ricardo Darin), willing to plod along until the crime is solved. And it's filmed with a contemporary edgy but warm eye, the camera often moving between things so the subject is half seen, or not seen at all, and yet it is so natural you just get sucked in further.The plot may seem ordinary at a glance, with a pair of investigators, one a very funny alcoholic (Guillermo Francella), going after a man who raped and killed a woman, but it isn't really this main idea that matters at first. In the classic fashion of some great detective movies, it's the characters and how they proceed that matters. We come to know the two men (as well as actress Soledad Villamil, a tangential love interest) and wander through less common edges of Argentina, where this was made.The storytelling is given depth by moving back and forth over a 25 year period, and this laying out of ideas slowly makes you pay attention. It's very smart this way, grabbing the viewer. By the end, the tragedies begin to really move you, the final large twist (or two) to the story is utterly believable and sensational, and the love story becomes as archetypal as ""Dr. Zhivago"" and as beautiful.

Blending all forms of elements really well!,"I have commended on films that seem flawless and remarkable before. Never have I imagine a film that would actually bring these achievements into a whole new level, until El Secreto de Sus Ojos came along.From the aspect of its cinematography, every single detail was being paid upon intrinsic attention to the utmost; fitting camera angles and timing, maximizing the whole emotional and environmental expression.The acting performances, particularly Irene's, are another wonder to behold. Not to mention, it accomplished some of the most original yet beautifully memorable shots, i.e. the chase scene, the court scene (one of the best crime-solving feat i have seen in a while). The ending: one of the best I have seen in a long long while; a blend of the ultimate plot twist and a happy moment.From romance, comedy, crime, noir, thriller, reminiscence, suspense, plot twists and development, sentimentalism, cinematography, retribution, etc....This film is a powerful blend of each said elements. If some of most amazing films can be compared to drugs, this film is the ultimate blend of all drugs. And my first sincere salutation to the Oscars for choosing the right winner this time.

Weaker than Oscar's competitor 'A prophet',"'The Secret in Their Eyes' is a decent movie. But nothing, except maybe the dialogs during the first half-hour of the movie, where Esposito acts hectic and where the friendship between him and Sandoval is nicely conveyed, nothing really stands out here - be it the plot, which might appear complex at times - simply because the scenario itself should have been tighter and, at the same time, more profound; be it the music, which is fairly cheesy and annoying; be it the acting, which is on shaky grounds (the best actor may well be supporting cast Guillermo Francella).So if you have the choice between watching this movie and 'A Prophet', which also was a 'Best Foreign Language Film' nominee for the 2010 Oscars, I can only recommend you choose the later movie.'The Secret in Their Eyes': 6/10 // 'A Prophet': 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
True Love?,"Oh, there are questions all right? Plenty of questions about what really happened? There will be answers, too, and they will be satisfying and maybe, even huge revelations to fit this epic drama, where people express themselves openly, and yet their own emotions take backstage to the drama of others, just like we forget we're watching a film and surrender ourselves to its hypnotic and bewitching power.Set in a bureaucratic world where who you know will open doors and determine the safety of your future, a couple is in the middle of a drama which originates when a young and beautiful woman is brutally murdered. As the investigation proceeds, emotions grow, and in a perfect, isolated world, things would turn out easier. What develops is a messy situation where everyone becomes more and more frustrated because this world after all, is not forgiving or perfect, and sometimes justice is nothing else but a name or a word with not really weight.As the onion layers are peeled, and we know more and more about what really happened in the drama that spans for 25 years, we discover that love is such a powerful force that it refuses to die, but it's not infallible and it's pretty confusing. There are after all, social classes, political mazes, and personal vendettas to block the road for our hero and heroine. There are also many fantastic pieces of dialog, and some very realistic recreations of what working in a government entity is like. As one of the main characters states: ""It's my life, live yours."" It's easy to be overwhelmed by the drama of others, especially if we get too close to the source of the mess.This film deservedly won many accolades, and in one of those rare moments, was fairly recognized with the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Its two closest contenders would have made the Top 10 Best Picture list a better indicator of films with better craftsmanship, storytelling, and the true magic of a great film. I had a tough time choosing between ""The White Ribbon"" and ""The Prophet"". They're great films; yet there is something powerful and very touching at the heart of this movie, something that connects with our human needs, and that elevates the film a bit higher than the other films. One will gasp at the end of the final scene, one that summarizes the message of ""The Secret of Their Eyes"", an appropriate title if I ever saw one.This film is not perfect; its length is a bit of a problem, but it's got epic feelings, classic moments, and a very satisfying conclusion, a moment that cinephiles around the world will recognize and embrace. Maybe because they don't make them like these anymore, certainly American studios don't put them out as much anymore...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Solid filmmaking, but not amazing","THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES is a solid crime film and the first feature I've watched from Argentina. The recipient of an Oscar for best foreign language film at the 2010 ceremony, this turns out to be a solid if unremarkable crime film in which a detective attempts to solve unanswered questions over an old case from the 1970s.This is a solid and watchable film, but to be fair it's the kind of story that I've seen dozens of times previously. The script is literate and the characters well-drawn, but it lacks the spark required to make it truly engrossing. The plot is quite spaced out and limited given the length of the movie, leading to long sequences where not a great deal happens. In comparison to electrifying, action-packed thrillers like the French POINT BLANK or more plot-focused detective stories like the Swedish GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO trilogy, I have to say this is nothing special.That's not that it's not worth watching - the acting is strong from the whole of the cast, particularly the leads playing the two prosecutors whose subtle romance is the emphasis of much of the running time.

Soledad Villamil gives a convincing, moving and at the same time classy performance as Irene Hastings.The most memorable scene is of course the five-minute-long shot of the suspect being chased inside the football stadium. It takes no expert to observe the technical expertise shown here.The political context of the movie is easily comprehensible even for people not familiar with contemporary Argentinian history.

True romance is about  suffering,"I was curious and intrigued, but mostly skeptical when I first read the brief description of ""The Secret in their Eyes"" in a TV- magazine. It stated: ""a romantic thriller about the unresolved rape and murder case of a beautiful girl 25 years ago"". Huh? How can a thriller, especially one dealing with such painful topics like rape and murder, be romantic? And yet, the description is 100% accurate and truthful. This harsh thriller is simultaneously one of the most emotional stories that I ever witnessed and it's romantic at no less than three different levels! There's the obvious but oppressed romance between lead character Benjamin Esposito and his court superior Irene Hastings, and then there's also the more convoluted but undeniably romantic devotion that widower Ricardo Morales shows for his murdered wife and the perverted (but yet somehow romantic) motive of culprit Isidoro Gómez for committing the inhuman crime. One things for sure, ""The Secret in their Eyes"" is one of the most absorbing, beautiful and unforgettable films of the new millennium. I was wondering how on earth it could be possible that Michael Haneke's masterful ""The White Ribbon"" didn't win the Oscar for best foreign film for 2009, but now it makes perfect sense. Those people at the Academy were more than right to award this film instead! ""The Secret in their Eyes"" deserves every price that it won and it also deserves to be seen by as many people as humanly possible!In 1974, the beautiful and lovable Liliana Coloto is found brutally raped and murdered by someone that she obviously must have known and trusted. The crime is so vile and shocking that it even silences the experienced court room counselor Benjamin Esposito. With the help of his alcoholic but brilliant colleague Sandoval and his new supervisor Irene, whom he's desperately in love with, Esposito identifies the unmistakable culprit and promises Liliana's grieving widower Ricardo that he will spend the rest of his life in jail. But the assumed killer is released shortly after due to internal courtroom corruption and personal vendettas and Esposito narrowly survives an assassination attempt. 25 years later, the retired Esposito travels back to Buenos Aires with the intention of writing a novel about this case that altered his life. He goes to see Irene Hastings, who built out an impressive career over the years, and notices that his old feelings are still as strong and irresistible as before. In all honesty, the more you contemplate about the plot and analyze the events afterwards, the less plausible and realistic ""The Secret in their Eyes"" becomes. And yet, for once this doesn't matter because you are so moved by the story and feel so much sympathy for the main characters that you'll gladly overlook any flaws that only come to the surface later. Apart from the story and the unique mixture of styles and genres, there are two other aspects that make this film a genuine masterpiece, namely the acting performances and the cinematography. Regarding the acting, being a European I don't know any of the actors and actresses in this film, but they surely all made a big impression on me. The camera work by Félix Monti is stupendous, with various great sequences in which he achieved beautiful effects through reflection (in mirrors or windows) and extended pan-images.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You can't do much better than 'El secreto de sus ojos' (released in English speaking countries as 'The Secret In Their Eyes'),a film that was Argentina's entry for the Academy Awards for best film from that country. It tells the story of a retired defense attorney (Benjamin Esposito,played by the fine Argentine actor,Ricardo Darin,of 'XXY',and 'Nine Queens'fame) who is writing his memoirs,in hopes of turning them into a book. When he becomes interested in trying to re-open the case of a brutal rape/murder,he goes to his former employer for leads (Irene Menendez-Hastings,played by Soledad Villamil). What Benjamin discovers is lost feelings he felt for Irene). Cutting back & forth in time,we see stories of the young Benjamin & Irene working for the same government law firm,and the ups & downs of the law profession in 1970's Argentina,during their dirty war,which is never mentioned. This is a smart,well written screenplay (by the film's director,Juan Jose Campanella,mostly known for his work in both Argentinian,as well as American television,and Eduardo Sacheri,from the novel by Sacheri).

A long time in the unravelling,"The Secret in their Eyes is a tale of undeclared love, laced in a complex murder mystery that spans 25 years. The details are so densely packed that I almost would have nodded off had its beauty and skill in the telling not kept me shocked in wakefulness. It is a story of remembering. And how that act of remembering can change the present. What is that timeless quality that we sometimes see in a person's eyes? A look that can hold maybe more than anything, and how it can arrest our thought as they travel a sea of faces; a torrent of years. If they 'express the inexpressible,' is there a reason that stops the lips from forming the words? And if that barrier could be removed?Beating such notable competition as Haneke's White Ribbon for the coveted Foreign Language Film Oscar was no small task. That the Secret in Their Eyes fathoms profound emotions (for want of a better word!) perhaps goes some way to explain its appeal.Benjamín Espósito has been employed by the criminal court all working his life. Now entering retirement, he begins writing a novel. The story will be that of a tragic case he once investigated, the brutal rape and murder of a beautiful woman. The legal system in Argentina is not free of corruption but still a highly developed one. The court secretary, Irene Menéndez Hastings, is Benjamin's immediate superior. He is secretly in love with her, but she is far above his social station and he has no hope of being together with her. As he writes the novel, he goes back over events. Including his unfulfilled relationship with the woman he is still in love with after all this time. A love of justice propels the movie forward but at a pace that accepts some things can take a lifetime. Or a single moment.The murder case is far from simple, even with Benjamin and Irene's pooled determination. Benjamin looks back on his life seeking meaning. Both in his own relationships and lack of them, and in the small successes (but greater failures) that accompanied the investigation. As he replays his memories will he be able to re-write his future? Or are there things to which his eyes will forever remain closed? Juan José Campanella's two hour film can occasionally seem affected. But as anyone who has visited can confess, that is true of life in Buenos Aires today anyway. It is still the bastion of European manners from a bygone age and The Secret in Their Eyes sometimes feels like a period piece (even though the film is set in 1974 to 2000). The subtleties of gentlemanly flirtation, the delicacies of social interaction, they present a careful, often unhurried formality through which we must finesse our way with perseverance and appreciation of good taste. We delicately unpick the knotted past so that it does not reap problems for our futures. Does the real life we have lead reflect our inner life and turmoils? The other way round? Or are they not connected? Memory is a powerful thing and can knit together more than just our imagination, our hopes, dreams, and insights. There are clues we have maybe failed to acknowledge. Through stupidity or 'blindness.' And what are the secrets? How do we see them as they really are; spot the clues before our eyes? One secret it's cracked is box-office success. The Secrets of Their Eyes is already a blockbuster in Argentina and enjoying huge triumphs at international festivals. It will probably be one of those 'timeless classics,' as they say.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""masterpiece"" has never fitted a piece of art so well !!","I have no idea where to start.The plot: The movie follows the rules of screenplay writing so well that it makes the plot flawless and our attention on the run during the entire movie (That's how a movie should be but after watching ""The Black Swan"" or ""Somewhere"" by S.Coppola all awards nominated or winning, I was wondering what was going on in the Film Industry). Some scenes may be mentally harsh but it is done in such a subtle and artistic way that they are almost necessary!The cast: The actors make any Hollywood actor look like a miserable joke. The actors look physically real, some pretty, some not, nothing plastic, nothing fake, it is simply not needed! All the actors were technically so right! Each and every one of them was full of natural, feelings and life. The chemistry between them all was sparkling and real. This is art!

Works on every level,"This is a film that makes movies cinema and makes cinema literature: simply put, it works on every level. The character development is engaging and developed within an excellent narrative structure as well as being buttressed by fine performances from each cast member, even the minor ones. The viewer is engrossed, and much like ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""The Lives of Others,"" I felt like I was eavesdropping on people's lives rather than watching a collection of actors portray people. Then there was the directing, which features one scene (I won't say but you'll know it when you see it) that is as good as anything that Hitchcock ever did in building tension. The only complaint I've heard is that the middle moves too slowly, but I reject that: even if one concedes that, the information provided was essential to the final outcome, a close that puts this story on the same level as ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""

Weak with an Argentinian flavour,"Having enjoyed many Argentinian and South American films I saw the ratings and was very excited. My husband who has a great nose for rubbish saw through it in about 6 minutes, I kept going, travelling hopefully as they say...I do wonder whether all the rave reviews were written by homesick Argentinians but that is really no excuse for an Academy award. That is just patronising foreigners cos they tried hard.Nice photography is about it, although I always enjoy looking at the sets of bars, houses and workplaces in another part of the world.It goes too fast where it should slow down and is painfully dull where it should speed up. It can't decide if it is slapstick, CSI, police procedural, political history or a heartwarming tale of old buddies solving cold cases together.You always know things are going badly when a lead character starts speechifying and you lose any involvement and start wondering when this bit - which seems to be written by the director's daughter in her creative writing class so can't be cut - will end.I found myself disliking even the main character's motivation for getting so emotionally involved with the case and I don't think it will give anything away to say that its just so terrible because she really is a beautiful woman.....aaahhh....Despite what it says on the box there are no twists. No suspense, no nail biting and no thrills.I can only assume that compared with Argentinian daytime TV this is brilliant stuff.

A Modern Classic That's Absolutely Deserving Of All The Accolades It Has Garnered!,"Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Secret in Their Eyes (also known as El secreto de sus ojos) is an ingeniously crafted mystery thriller from Argentina that grabs the viewers attention from the beginning, keeps their gaze firmly transfixed on the screen with its gripping plot, quality direction & compelling characters, and is one of the finest offerings in world cinema today that deserves a much broader audience.The Secret in Their Eyes tells the story of a retired legal counsellor who is planning to write his first novel and chooses a quarter century old case he worked on as his source material. The plot then interweaves two story lines, first covering the case itself which was about the brutal rape & murder of a young girl while the second follows the buried romance between him & his superior, both of whom worked on the case together and are still haunted by it.Co-written, produced, directed & edited by Juan José Campanella, The Secret in Their Eyes is intelligently crafted from start to finish for it brims with multiple layers which unravel itself steadily as the plot progresses and also manages to throw a few surprising twists along the road. Campanella excels in both writing & direction for the plot is highly engrossing, the arc of the characters inhabiting this story is brilliantly handled, and the tense political ambiance in Argentina during the mid-1970s is finely illustrated.The technical aspects are no slouch and is carried out in an effective manner. The splendid use of camera, clever placements & controlled movements, in addition to the warm colour palette provide its narrative a rich, refined look which also fits the timeline its story is set in. The pacing is consistent throughout its 129 minutes of runtime. VFX is rarely noticeable yet its seamless fusion with the film's thoughtful camera-work & clever editing is responsible for a jaw-dropping sequence that would easily go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed.Coming to the performances, The Secret in Their Eyes features a committed cast in Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Guillermo Francella, Pablo Rago & others, and all of them are terrific in their given roles. What further helps their performance is that the characters they're given to play aren't weightless and their arcs are wonderfully fleshed out. Darín delivers the finest performance of them all, his chemistry with both Villamil & Francella is spot-on who provide amazing supporting work in their respective roles of his superior & assistant, while Rago is able to leave his mark as the film nears its conclusion.On an overall scale, The Secret in Their Eyes is a masterwork of sophisticated filmmaking that triumphs in nearly all departments to work as an entertaining & enthralling example of its genre(s) and beautifully portrays the fear, vulnerability & flaws of its scripted characters on the film canvas. Covering the themes of love, loss, vengeance & corruption and further uplifted by its assured direction, impeccable script & honest performances, The Secret in Their Eyes is a remarkable film that effortlessly lives up to its reputation and is absolutely deserving of all the accolades it has garnered. A modern classic, this Argentine masterpiece comes strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Eyes inspire a masterpiece,"Not entering in opinions or specific details about the movie itself, I believe the surprise has a key role (as happened to me) and very probably there will be enough comments about that. This movie deserves all the credit and will be so flattering to have received an Oscar (talking about the current state of things, of course )? I doubt it. The truth is that it has everything you want, either for fun (with a certain humor that often sprinkle here and there , and the inherent suspense as the events will ocurre, never dropping from beginning to end) or to approach a seriously theme and truthful to some extent (and here play two things: the real drama of the matter of the main story and the passionate romance involving it in parallel), and more than expected also. Plus the fact that it contains excellent works on all levels, from the cast and speech to backstage and makeup, from the script and adaptation to audio and beautiful classical soundtrack, from photography to camera work.. Honestly, I can not point out anything negative. It's so catchy and touching in a way that 2h will seem like half, even less. If perfection exists in modern crime/drama filmaking then El Secreto De Sus Ojos is certainly at the top or very close to it and has all the features to become a timeless film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Multi-Layered Oscar Winner,"I never would have even heard of this movie, if not for its unexpected Oscar win in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.This is a Foreign Language film which could have been set anywhere in the world. There was nothing really uniquely Argentinean about its characters and situation. A retired investigator wants to write a novel about a 25-year old unresolved brutal rape-murder case that affected him the most. He reconnects with the people associated with the case to get insights about his writings. In the process, he discovers more about this cold case, as well as about his own self and his relationships.The film works as a crime mystery-thriller. It also works as a romance drama. There are also scenes of fine comedy. These multiple layers were well-combined and well-executed into one fine film. The camera work is very good with its focus on the eyes of the characters, as the title would suggest. There were also very exciting action shots during the soccer stadium scenes.Unfortunately, there were some flaws in the plot development, with incredible jumps of deduction and coincidences which may strain credulity and logic. Something totally trivial and incidental turned out to be the most revelatory clue, more than once in the story. The ending is something which may impress some, and disappoint others. I personally liked the eerie way it was done despite the melodramatic manner.Overall, there is nothing so spectacular about this film that makes it truly outstanding. Of the nominated Foreign Language films this year, I definitely liked ""The Secret of Their Eyes"" more than ""The White Ribbon"" and ""A Prophet."" However, when you compare this to the nominees of last year's Oscar for Foreign Language Film, I liked ""Departures,"" ""The Class,"" ""Waltz With Bashir"" and ""Revenge"" more than this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I don't understand,"I've heard a lot about this film over the years but had never seen it. Last night I finally decided to watch it and I was genuinely excited going in. I had this kind of pleasant, relieved feeling like ""hey this is gonna be smooth sailing, I get to watch a classic movie that's supposed to be engaging, most likely going to have a good experience""I realize at the 30 minute mark that watching this movie is beginning to feel like a chore, and that never went away. I tried to not be overly critical and give it an honest shot, but the rest of the movie just never went anywhere for me. Some of the scenes wracked my brain with why that would be included at all (the whole weird face to face scene + the train scene did a number on me), and at the hour and 45 minute mark I felt legitimately that I had been tricked.I guess I don't understand what's so great about this. I didn't find the story all that interesting, and the way that it's shot isn't particularly engaging. The pacing didn't do anything to help the movie, the characters themselves seem just kind of flat and uninteresting, I definitely didn't get any emotional acting, there wasn't a whole lot of style, it all just felt very bland. At the hour mark, or maybe somewhere around the train scene, I just felt like I was watching some generic made for TV movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like you're there - shouting - ""here he is!! Catch him !!""Or the one where the captured convict looks at the female lead's unbuttoned garment and you instantly know the meaning of the ""look in their eyes"".Or how a failure in the workplace becomes the reason for a lost workplace romance!

To Fear and To Love,"A train departs a station in 1974 and two lovers, Irene and Benjamin, part before they come together. ""Te mo"" is to fear and ""te amo"" is to love. Love and fear at the same moment. This multi-layered, rich, brutal and beautiful film revolves around this dichotomy in many ways.Decades after the train left the station, Benjamin is unhappily retired from a prosecutor's office. He does not like what he sees in the mirror. An unsolved case, a savage rape and murder, weighs heavily on his mind, as does Irene. Benjamin and Irene worked on the case together and as it unraveled, so did they. So with more purposes than one, Benjamin resumes investigating the murder. New discoveries and different perspectives instill hope in Benjamin for solving the mysteries and memories that haunt him. People may change but their passions don't.The justice system is not clean or simple in any country, and this brilliant film reveals how complex and ugly it can be. The Secret in Their Eyes seamlessly combines multiple genres including crime thriller, romance and drama. There is appealing depth to the story, characters, themes, acting and photography. The characters, for example, are not one dimensional. They are vulnerable, make mistakes, regret choices and, in sum, are fully human. Themes revolve around memories, justice, love, vengeance and more. Soledad Villamil (Irene) and Ricardo Darín (Benjamin) perform amazingly well together. The chemistry is palpable.

Good Movie,"The film ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" focused on an unsolved murder case that's 25 years old, and that all this time it has still been on an investigator named Ben Esposito's interest. The movie takes place in the 1970's with the brutal rape and murder of a 23 year old wife, and the extraordinary love of her husband. Even though years have passed, Esposito wants to find answers to all the unanswered questions. As Esposito is working on this case and the past clarifies in flashbacks, he finds his lost love, Irene. Irene is now married and is a well known judge. Esposito on the other hand is alone. The movie doesn't focus a lot on Irene and Ben's love. This film has some graphic scenes. The director, Juan Jose Campanella, is one of Argentina's best-known filmmaker. He is famous for directing episodes like ""House"", ""Law & Order Special Victims Unit"" and ""30 Rock."" The director was smart enough to focus on a cold case theme because it contributed to a variety of emotional themes that range from love and obsession to justice and retribution. Throughout the film, the cinematography used combines with the feelings the characters are portraying. The cameras focus more on the character's faces and their eyes. By focusing on their faces and eyes, it gives the feeling of tension and mystery which contribute to his theme. This helps the characters connect with the audience. By connecting with the audience the movie leaves a unique mark in their lives.",,Anonymous,Mystery

It tells the story of complicated characters that shocks the viewers at the movie's ending. The technicalities really work great in supporting the story. The heavy dose of close up shots really help to get the viewers to know the characters better. The stadium sequence is just a great sequence of scenes with the illusion of being 'uncut'.

Throughout the movie it is easy to focus on the crime thriller storyline and think that it is the only thing going on. However, through subtle looks in the eyes of the main characters we are able to see that there is love brewing up in them and that this will become a main theme in no time.

I was getting impatient (my wife had already bailed) when the film took a suspenseful, political turn, briefly evoking classics like ""Z"" and ""Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion."" Then it went off the rails again, with an ending that can only be described as preposterous. Despite the foreign-language Oscar, the expert performances and cinematography and whatnot, not to mention the glowing reviews on various websites (the Onion AV Club got it right with a B-, en mi humilde opinión), if you're the slightest bit tough-minded about plotting and plausibility (not to mention police procedures), I'd approach this one with caution.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The lack of consistency brings it down.,"This movie is like Marmite, you're going to love it or hate it, period, there is no in-between. The major problem of IMDb these days is the reviews are pretentious. This site has become the refuge of wannabe film critics who give 10s to anything 'not Marvel's, thinking they look smart doing so. But what's the deal with this movie? Well, for starters, the first hour feels very much like your standard modern Spanish / South American production. With fairly static shots, stiff acting and generic delivery.BUT for some reason that is absolutely beyond me, its second half kicks off with a shot I had to rewind to believe and even looked up on YouTube to understand how it was done, then it merges into some homage to Casablanca, then to the French classics, and finally it desaturates its color palette to the point where trees become gray. No explanation is given. It's either going to be seen as pure genius or absolutely demented. And that's what bothers me. It's an homage to the French classics, it nails the 80s feel, probably in a way that no other movie has ever done. But at the same time, we're treated to amateurish make-ups, and the aforementioned first hour which felt more like law and order than watching a real movie. Did the director of photography get fired mid shot? Is this all purpose? We will never know.If the symbolism had been better handled, (it is not exactly subtle) and the movie far more consistent visually,this could have been an absolute masterpiece.

The Missing 'A',"So many details to enjoy from this movie that multiple viewings give reward. There is a deliberate disjointed time continuity narrative with foreshadowing that at first seems like it is happening in real time but one later realizes it is a flashback to a point in time that one of the narrative timelines has not yet reached. So one must pay attention. What I loved most is the directorial and editing approach that does not bounce around. The elevator scene, for example, is a single, agonizing, suspenseful cut. There are many single, long scenes where there are no arbitrary close ups or nonsense editing to relieve the actors of the job of acting for more than 4 seconds. The actors are acting even when they don't have a line and the director knows this so includes them in the scene. Hollywood has cursed our attention span so, that's the part I appreciate most, the ability to watch a scene unfold for minutes on end with quality script and the characters always acting their character. It's a tight script with what might seem like frivolous details all wrap around and become important in one way or another...many facets, a crime story with romantic intrigue and political complications. Even futbol is given a nod! Very good performances from everyone, even the out-of-focus court aides/interns who are treated like dirt as a rule and casually go about their business. The missing 'A' motif is brilliant. Watch again and again, like Silence of The Lambs. Even though I know the climax the dialogue is so enjoyable and the approach is so mature that I will always enjoy this movie. Bravisimo!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An excellent film... One of the best I've ever seen,"A mesmerizing plot... With a lot of love,care and intensity on it... Hats off to the director.. I haven't even heard of this film but its one among the top 250...A cool style and acting by the whole cast... Though the best part undoubtedly is pulled off by Pablo Rago as Ricardo Morales.Excellent adapted screenplay by Eduardo Sacheri and a beautiful mix of the past and the present.I love the film for its screenplay, direction and the amount of intensity shown in two very good feelings: Friendship and love. The way in which the film is portrayed is so beautiful that it keeps us in the edge of our seats.. A little bit of nakedness could have been avoided but still the film will go the distance of the hearts of a lot of people.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Thrilling acting, cinematography and editing.","The story is incredibly told with great editing, directing, cinematography and acting. Starting out like a normal crime film, the movie juxtaposes the present with those of the past, and along with Benjamin, the audience recounts the past through his memories. It gets more and more complex, as when a suspect is found, what seems to be the end turns out to be the beginning of a mystery. The film also displays the corruption within the legal system, and the battle between evil and good, with Benjamin being the embodiment of morality.The acting as well is great. The connection and chemistry between both Darin and Villamil, and Darin and Francella is sweet. The film aggravates the audience by showing that both Benjamin and Irene love each other, but nothing is done about it. Similarly, there is a bromance between Benjamin and Sandoval that is touching, but heartbreaking when the relationship is broken. Rago and Godino both do a great job at showcasing their characters emotions and expressions.What really stood out for me is the cinematography and editing. The camera moves with such fluidity across spaces that it often makes me wonder how they did it. For instance, there is a scene in a football stadium and in one continuous shot, the camera goes from a birds eye view to a close up of the characters in the stadium. I am thinking that perhaps they used a drone which is pretty impressive. Similarly, the camera work in chase scenes are just incredible, everything form the shot placement to the composition and movement. Additionally, the editing is on par with the cinematography. There are multiple scenes that do not depict what actually took place but is more of a 'preview' into other possibilities of the story. I found this to be very impactful as it disorients you and makes you think about the story more closely. It could be confusing at times though, so it is both a positive and a negative for me.Overall a phenomenal film that tells an incredible story with great acting, cinematography and editing. Only thing is that it is a bit slow at times, but the ending is just chilling.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Brilliant, edge of the seat thriller","This Argentinian film start slowly for me and felt a little formulaic in it's story. Yet it progresses well and becomes more and more engaging. This is helped by some fine performances, the fact it looks beautiful and there is some nice orchestration throughout.Just as the character if Benjamin becomes consumed by the murder of a young woman and him and his colleague try in vain to find the culprit, we the audience are suddenly drawn into this world inextricably. We too long for answers, we too see the love the grieving husband has, hoping only to know who did this to his wife. His love and the strength of it shocks both us and Benjamin.The was a point in the film where I was utterly consumed by the story; as the camera soars over the soccer stadium, i was stunned by the brilliance of the scene as the cameras then becomes part of the soccer crowd. Following that we are thrown into chaos as they search and find the suspect only for a fast and thrilling, yet brief chase ensues. I think it is one of the finest scenes in a film I've witnessed, so brilliantly executed. From this point on the film doesn't let go: The scene of interrogation, as the suspect is broken down or many years later when he enters the lift and removes a gun, the camera holds still as we see the fear and tears across the faces of Benjamin and Irene, the scene is so amazing, my body tensed up until the very last moment. The film is at times tense, sometimes funny and often very moving, I thought that it encaptures so many emotions so well, all that one would expect, for instance when Morales is informed of his wife's death, the control of the director settles on Morales as he mumbles away, stifling back tears as the news sinks in.The film is perhaps let down by the desire or love between Benjamin and Irene, one that plays out throughout the story and is eventually resolved by the end, although the use of the motif of her running after the train at he start and then at the end of the film is nicely done. Despite this there is little to fault the the film, which is a near masterpiece and deservedly won Best Foreign film at the 2010 Oscars.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The eyes have it.,"""Justice is an island. We work out in the real world."" Dateline: Buenos Aires 1974 -2000. Oscar-winning The Secret in Their Eyes trips between an Argentinean murder in 1974 and the involved justice Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) retired now and writing about the gruesome rape- homicide. Unlike in other thrillers, even Silence of the Lambs, director/ writer Juan Jose Campanella weaves a credible love story between protagonist Benjamin (and his boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil), with the love of a husband for his young murdered wife highlighting the somber effect of time, or its lack thereof, on those whose eyes may or may not hold the secret.This intriguing and typically-slow exposition by a not-American director is a thriller of the first order—accumulation of facts and revelation of emotions while methodically nailing down the murderer, perhaps a bit like Lady with the Dragon Tattoo with a dash of Silence of the Lambs. As is to be expected of non-CGI dominated international films, character is everything, from a sidekick with a drinking problem and sacrificing heart to a murderer complex as the best cinematic murderers like Jackie Earle Haley's. The figurative importance of the eyes, burnished by multiple close-ups, is a motif that emphasizes the literate approach of the entire artwork.In Eyes, the jumping across time is handled with a rare fluidity, helped by a graying beard on the protagonist but not helped by Ms. Villamil, who may never be able to play old because of her Sophia-Loren indestructible looks. The time mix influences the attachment we feel for characters fighting time but trying to live for the present. Especially when it comes to expressing affection, so easy to fob off on time or think like Eliot's Prufrock that ""indeed there will be time,"" when there will be little to none.The Secret in Their Eyes is a somewhat languid eye-opener, the cinematic equivalent of seeing Casablanca after Letters to Juliet, a variation of the sublime to the ridiculous. No matter, now and then Oscar gets it right—best foreign language film of the year. The eyes have it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A rather conventional crime story (for an Oscar winner),"""El secreto de sus ojos"" was the winner of the 2010 award for best foreign language film, ahead of among others ""Das weisse band"" (Haneke, 2009). The film is good but does not live up to the expectations you might have given the other nominees. Let's just say that the committee that granted the award wanted to make a safe choice""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a crime film with (indirect) some political comments on the junta period in the history of Argentina. It is about an unresolved rape / murder case. After his retirement the detective in charge once again delves into the case. The film alternates between 2000 (the detective is retired) and 1974 (the time of the actual crime) but the storyline is never confusing.Central theme is the tension between the detective which relies on his intuition and his superior who wants the procedures to be followed. A very conventional theme in the crime genre indeed, with the added complication that between the detective and his (female) superior there is some erotic tension in the air.As I already said, in general the film is good. There are however some notable scenes, for the better and the worse. Good is the hunt in the crowded soccer station. The intuition of the detective tells him that the suspect will not forsake his favourite soccer team while the suspect believes he is save in such a crowd. Bad is the interrogation scene in which the superior of the detective tries to provoke the suspect by telling him that he could not have commited the crime because the perpetrator was well-endowed and he is not. Is this her idea of following the procedures? Does she really think that someone will confess a horrible crime because of his male pride being hurt?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truly brooding,"The splendid Ricardo Darin, star of the late great Fabien Bielinski's two movies, is back on fine form in this film. Superficially it's more conventional than Bielinski's films, being a straightforward story of a veteran (ex-) policeman who can't let his most interesting unsolved case lie. For sure, the plot is tricksy and there's evidence of corruption in high places; but this is all run-of-the-mill for this genre. What's unusual about this film is it's focus on character: the brooding hero is another stereotype, but Darin's character's relationship to his case is complex; the supporting cast are also great, and the sense of a life wasted, in part, because the hero's boldness in his job is not matched by a similar confidence in matters of the heart is well conveyed. The film is also superbly shot, there's a sequence filmed in a football stadium where the use of the camera to exploit the venue is frankly brilliant. Overall, I think that Bielinski's films with Darin were even better, but they also set a high bar; but 'The Secret in Their Eyes' certainly confirms his uncanny ability to shamble onto the screen and steal it completely.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Top class Argentinian mystery,"Well this Argentinian mystery film was a very good experience. Going in to it, I had absolutely no idea that this movie had won the best foreign film Oscar at the Academy Awards. When I discovered this immediately afterwards I had to admit that the Academy for once may have got things spot on. This is a terrific film. It's a murder mystery with romantic subplot underpinning it. The acting is excellent and the cinematography is brilliant, on one occasion quite extraordinarily so (but I'll come to that later).The basic plot-line has Esposito (Ricardo Darín) a retired detective trying to write a novel about an old case that still haunts him. The crime was the vicious rape and murder of a young woman. In his memoir Esposito uses the memories of others to build the story, and his objectivity is clouded too because he is in love with his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil). The old case from 1974 is then told in a series of flashbacks, while in the present Esposito tries to make sense of it all.Darín and Villamil are especially great in the two lead roles. While he is a man with much vulnerability, she is very strong; the chemistry between both actors is wonderful and as a central pair they are never short of convincing as three-dimensional characters. Also very convincing is the period setting. The year 1974 is captured perfectly in terms of look and uneasy feeling (this was just before the military junta took control); the latter is alluded to in scenes where the state is clearly seen to be acting in highly corrupt and immoral ways. One of the beauties of this film is that it touches on so many different themes without being trite or aimless; as well as the aforementioned political situation, the film works seamlessly as a mystery and a drama about people living in limbo.Of course it's all very well and good being thematically interesting. But this is cinema and does it deliver on that front? Well I did mention earlier the presence of a sequence of unbelievable technique. All I will say is, the sequence in question starts with a night time view of a football stadium from up in the air, from here we rapidly approach and then dip into the bowl of the arena while hovering above the game in action and then seamlessly arrive in the midst of the crowd; from here we continue to play the scene where the crowd erupts for a goal and a chase ensues around the inner workings of the stadium, ending up on the pitch. This scene lasts for the best part of ten minutes and it is one glorious unbroken shot. Although there must clearly be some trickery involved as it would be frankly impossible to physically achieve this shot, I for one saw not one obvious break. It's a breathtaking piece of cinematic art and worth the price of admission alone.There are certain other short scenes of striking power, such as the sequence where the killer shares a lift with Esposito and Menéndez, and initially pretends that he has not seen them. He then takes his gun out and loads it. After exiting the lift we then see him briefly stare menacingly back in at his two principle antagonists. The sinister mind games at play are brilliantly presented in this short slightly off-kilter scene. But the film as a whole is full of little moments of unexpected excellence like this, including the final denouement, which I was not expecting; I won't give it away but it is a satisfying conclusion to the mystery.If you haven't already guessed, I loved The Secret in Their Eyes and I highly recommend it to everyone. It's great to see a film every so often that is capable of surprising you. It makes you realise that cinema is still alive.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbing and gripping tale of crime,"This film shows a skilled sense of direction from Campanella, leading the viewer through an obsessive tale of crime. The cinematography is top-notch, dousing everything in secretive shadows and dark earthy tones that suggest the past has more secrets than it is letting on. The acting depicts a strained anguish that expresses itself as a simmering rage against all the injustice around them. The storyline is fractured to let the viewer in on tiny bits of information at a time, much like the characters who have no clear grip on the circumstances controlling them. The football stadium scene is commendable for its masterful cinematography and narrative intensity, bringing closure to some of the plot but also opening Pandora's Box and opening up far more complications.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Secret in Their Eyes,"For many years since his retirement ""Espósito"" (Ricardo Darín) has been haunted by a brutal case of rape and murder that he was unable to solve. He decides that maybe the best way to formulate his thoughts and re-order the investigation is to write a novel, so with the help of an antiquated old Olivetti from his friend, and the new departmental boss ""Irene"" (Soledad Villamil) he starts to reconstruct the investigation. Using transcripts and photographs, he alights on the woman's schoolfriend ""Gómez"" (Javier Godino) who has long since disappeared from the scene. Increasingly, he becomes convinced in this man's complicity and now consulting with the dead woman's widower ""Morales"" (Pablo Rago) we all start to learn a little about the backstory, and it's complex, violent and tragic in equal measure. Can his deductions find the truth? This is a great example of a methodological and forensic drama that looks at the crime, sure, but it takes almost the same amount of time and effort to examine the strongly built characterisations. The nature of obsession, the desire for closure and completion - all addictive aspects of human nature that Darín and the almost perfect pacing from Juan José Campanella deliver here. It's a mystery that works on several levels evaluating the effectiveness of legal process and modern policing whilst reminding us that those exposed to crime are also affected, sometimes profoundly, by what they encounter. This works really well in a cinema, if you can. The frequently intimate style of the photography and the sparing use of light at times makes this an eerily effective watch that is rarely straightforward.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant and intense,"Is justice only a legal term or a spiritual ideal? Many seek justice but confuse it with revenge or being right and live their lives in turmoil as both victim and victimizer. Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), a retired Buenos Aires state criminal investigator, knows that even though a case that has been haunting him for the last twenty years is closed, it is still incomplete for him and justice in his mind has not been served. Based on the novel by Eduardo Sacheri and written by the director, Juan Jose Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes (El Secreto in sus Ojos), Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film, is a noir'ish thriller that is the most popular film in Argentina today, having broken every box office record in that country.Like multi-faceted films of the fifties and sixties, The Secret in Their Eyes is a murder mystery and psychological thriller, a lighthearted love story, a meditation on memory, and a look at justice in Argentina in the 1970s that does not hesitate to show the indignities people suffered during the military junta, though not in a heavy handed way. As the film opens, the retired Esposito decides to write a novel about the 1974 rape and murder of an attractive 23-year old woman, young newlywed Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a case that was closed by the authorities but never solved to his satisfaction. To obtain access to the file on the unsolved rape-murder case he spent so much time on, Esposito pays a visit to Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil), his former supervisor and chief supporter who is now a judge.It is clear from their meeting that they have rekindled an attraction from years past that faltered on class and social differences (she got a law degree from Cornell) and remained strictly professional. Supported by the cinematography of Felix Monti and the engaging score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, the film moves back and forth between the present and the past. As the camera picks up the case in 1974, Campanella chooses to graphically display young Liliana's bloody and battered body (a very poor choice) laying half on the bed and half on the floor. Benjamin interviews the victim's husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Raga), but he is not a suspect. In fact, the investigator is impressed by the depth of the love that Morales had for his deceased wife and the impact his loss has had on him.Although two workmen of dark skin color from a nearby building are arrested and charged with the crime, Esposito knows they are innocent and were coerced to confess in an example of the Junta's racist justice and they are soon released. When he goes through old photographs of Morales' wife, however, he notices a strange young man, Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino), gazing intently at her in every photo. The ""secret in his eyes"" suggests that he may be a prime suspect and Esposito and his clownish partner Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) try to track him down against the direct orders of their judicial boss. Sandoval, a penetrating student of human nature though an alcoholic, goes through Gomez' letters to his mother trying to find out what his ""passion"" is and finds that he is a devoted soccer fan.In one of the film's highlights, Esposito and Sandoval locate him (among 90,000 screaming fans) and a seven-minute chase scene takes place in one unbroken shot through the stadium as the camera sweeps through the crowds, follows a few false leads, then goes into overdrive when Gomez is spotted. Under interrogation by Ms. Hastings, the suspect cracks when, using every inch of her power as a woman, his physical stature is ridiculed by the Supervisor to try and provoke him. When Esposito tells Morales of Gomez' confession, both men agree that justice will be served only if Gomez is given life in prison but corruption gets the upper hand, at least temporarily. Performances by both leads are brilliant and intense and many twists and turns await the viewer as The Secret in their Eyes ratchets up the tension in the last half hour to arrive at a surprising and Hitchcock-like conclusion. It is one of the best films of 2010 so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Brilliant, Simply Brilliant: A Gold Standard for Filmmaking","EL SECRETO DE SUS OJOS, based on the novel 'LA PREGUNTA DE SUS OJOS' by Eduardo Sacheri who with director Juan José Campanella adapted it for the screen, is a work of great subtlety and artistic taste. It is also a fine love story, detective story, and moral tale that makes every aspect of the total experience of watching the film unfold as a kaleidoscope of just how fine the art of cinema can be.25 years ago in Argentina the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) drew the focus of detective Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), his feisty assistant Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil). The murderer, Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is captured, but because of the corrupt government, he is not kept in prison: the disgusting governmental police release him to work as an undercover agent for the government as part of the desaperacidos situation in the 1970s. The case is closed, leaving behind Ben, Irene, and Pablo completely disenchanted by the legal system, and the grieving husband of the victim Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) to sit at the train station watching for answers. Now, in the present, Ben returns and is convinced he wants to write a novel about the murder he still finds suspicious. Together with Irene (who remains a love interest for the shy Ben) and Pablo, the three research every aspect of the case. In attempting to discover the truth of the murder each of their lives is changed: the communication on the part of every character is through the looks in their eyes until the story ends in a very surprising manner. Justice is served, love prevails, and the novel is written.This may seem too fragile an outline of a plot about a film as important as this, but the true beauty of the film is the unraveling of events and the development of the characters: sharing too much information would destroy the complete pleasure the film provides. Every member of the cast is brilliant, the chemistry between Darin and Villamil is so subtle and credible, and the acts of violence we are asked to witness are delivered in a way that make the story line progress to a breathtaking end. Campanella's direction (and editing) is of the finest cinematic achievement and the cinematography by Félix Mont and the haunting musical score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer heighten all facets of the action - love, terror, violence, and character of each of the actors. This is a film to own, as repeated viewings of it will be like repeated visits to an art museum. Highly Recommended.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Secret in Their Eyes (2009),"Fantastic crime drama. It begins with Darin attempting to write a novel based on a case from long ago. It's been 25 years since the rape and brutal murder of a young woman. It was a case that just fizzled out after getting too hot. This film is filled with love, revenge and obsession. It plays out in a rich tapestry of events over time. The film prevails against most others due to Rago. He plays the loving husband of the victim. He becomes obsessed with catching the killer, not to kill him, but to make him serve his time. With so many violent revenge fantasies, it's great to finally see a character we can relate to.The films wonderful story unravels, but does so with unique and satisfying scenes. The football stadium sees action and intrigue take center stage, whilst an elevator scene is sure to send chills through the viewer. The climax was so expertly handled I was giddy to see it all come together. It was an ending that you do see coming, but not so early on that it ruins the film.

Deserved more than an Oscar,"I watched this movie three times and do not get tired. Whatever be said about the plot, the film is about the Argentinian soul, which is present in the fashion, in the serious furniture, in the limestone and wooden paneling of the buildings, in the pomp of the institutions, in the spicy dialogs, the flat and dry and cold landscape. No matter the background of poverty, corruption, abuse and economic decadence, one sees how the characters do not give up being elegant, vainly , proud, sarcastic, sexy, a little arrogant (sometimes trying to be European in South America) but very human. So far, it has a similar effect to ""el hijo de la novia"" by Juan Jose Campanella with Ricardo Darin and Hector Alterio, which includes the cuisine. And behind the Argentinian soul, with consistent roles played by excellent actors, Campanella makes up a great story of idealism, friendship, grief, wrath, love.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The film is profoundly captivating throughout, with a scattering of one or two truly comedic moments punctuating a piece of intense and shocking drama, which ultimately proves to be a tale of both extreme love and engulfing tradegy.The ending is typical of the entire film, highly subtle yet full of emotion, leaving the viewer to endlessly ponder the nature of true justice, if such a thing exists.

What really stands out here is the multitude of story lines and character development, none of which are cheated ... yet each which could have stood on their own as a film. This is terrific film-making with rare balance between comedic dialogue, a full fledged crime drama, unrequited love and nasty politics.The excellent script is helped along with fine acting by the key players: Ricardo Darin as Esposito, Soledad Villamil as Irene, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, Pablo Rago as Morales, and Javier Godino as Gomez. Each actor has physical features that play well with the film's title.I certainly don't wish to give away much of the substance of the film, but it mostly revolves around the investigation by Esposito and Sandoval into the brutal rape and murder of Morales' young, beautiful wife. Esposito works for Irene and they have ""eyes"" for each other, and Gomez is the key suspect despite all the political maneuvering designed to throw the investigators off track.There are a few outstanding scenes and my two favorite were an incredibly intense elevator ride, and a fascinating crowd scene at a soccer/futbol game. As you might guess, there are innumerable close-ups for a clear eye-level shot and the film bounces back and forth between 1974 and 2000, so we must adjust to the weak make-up.For anyone who enjoys fine film-making and isn't afraid of 2 plus hours of subtitles, you will surely be satisfied and impressed at the quality of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film of the year,"With the previous two Best Foreign Film Oscars going to films that I thought were good rather than great, I was beginning to fear that the Academy Awards were losing their discernment. No worries though, for they got this one spot on – easily the best film of the dozen or so that I saw during this years' Edinburgh Film Festival, and probably the best film I will see this year. This is truly outstanding film-making that, like its' title, keeps you guessing, and works on a number of different levels - whose eyes contain the secret; the victim, the killer or the lovers? Content-wise, it broadly covers the nature of justice, in a plot that is slightly reminiscent of 'A Very Long Engagement' – a convoluted whodunit, played out over a long time period. But it's also about the nature of memory, and how effective or not it is, with a number of sequences that play on this uncertainty – did it really happen, or is it just in the imagination of the character? Whilst the mystery element of the film is rich and engrossing in itself, it shines even brighter in the love story. The Director manages to create a brilliant chemistry between the two leads, with their age-ing captured to perfection and providing an immediate reference point for the viewer to help make sense as the narratives moves seamlessly back and forth, sweeping through time.Yet another level involves the injection of a quite deliberate and playful humour, most obvious in the wry banter between the main character and his assistant. On each level, a certain amount is left unsaid and unexplained, and is all the more satisfying for it, leaving you thinking about it for long afterwards. There's even the inclusion of some ambitious cinematography (the football match sequence particularly stands out), and the classical score is beautifully-judged, simultaneously wistful and melancholic, fitting the piece like the proverbial glove.This is highly accomplished film-making in a class of its' own, and I am very much looking forward to seeing it again in a couple of years time once my own recollection of it has started to fade. A modern day classic. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
'The Secret in Their Eyes' shows why the Left fears people like me,"The theater manager where I just saw this movie addressed the audience to admit he had hoped The White Ribbon had won the Oscar for best picture this year, but that he understood why this movie won instead. For me there is no question as to this movie having the more current relevance. Bravo to the Academy voters for voting bravely and well.By its end you will have seen an act of seeming inhumanity that I could ascribe to, but I am sure most of my fellow Lefties would find unthinkable. I think my 'comrades' sense me capable of such acts and it scares them. But when the mere joy of decent, ethical behavior isn't enough to entice some to live within acceptable limits, then negative reinforcement is justifiably employed, in my opinion. The problem is, of course, being sure of having the ethical high ground and admittedly, that's no small thing.In this movie there's little doubt the protagonist is a decent man. Benjamín Esposito is unable to let an old murder be forgot. And for good reason: the case's outcome was politically tampered with. In one of the most brilliant scenes I've ever seen, the antagonist's motivation is made crystal clear, so succinctly and efficiently, that I was taken aback for a moment. But the director and I are totally in accord in his opinion of what happened. What I worry about is that most of the audience won't get it.In the theater I saw it, slides preceded the movie explaining that the murder took place before the government's going far to the Right in Argentina. If you don't have a clear understanding of what happened in the '70s in Argentina, you need to do some preparation. That's not going to be necessary for most Lefties who are quite aware of the Dirty War in which the US, never mentioned here, aided the government in committing atrocities.This is a wonderful film carried elegantly along by its main leads, Soledad Villamil as Irene and Ricardo Darín as Benjamin, with the truly brilliant support of its many supporting actors. But in the end its a triumph of film-making for the director, Juan José Campanella, especially, who brings the story to life with consummate skill. He's created a truly pleasurable and memorable experience for people like me.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A story to remember,"Haven't seen such a complete movie for a long time. The story is simply magnificent. It is not just any story of vengeance but the underlying love fulfilled the story with such colorful romance and joy.It wouldn't be improper to say it a love story. Love of the husband for his dead wife, love of Esposito for his superior Irene touches the viewers deeply. Espanito's silence, thinking his love is inappropriate moved me a lot.The performances of the actors and actresses are excellent. Specially Irene and Espanito's characters were beautifully played. The part of the film which makes me really mesmerized is the end. The revenge was so appropriate and shocking and it even makes Espanito to shake his fear and live a fulfilling life.""The secret in their eyes"" is really the kind of the secret I would watch for.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good quality movie,"It is a very good quality movie, since it was made in Argentina with some spanish investment, I was very impressed with acting, editing and camera managing. Thus, I am glad to offer 7 stars out of 10.You can imagine some aspects of the story right from the begining (love, frienship, rivality, etc), but you cannot tell what the end is going to be. And that is most precious thing about the movie: it's a twist that you cannot expect.

Top Drawer Cinema,"This really is an absolutely marvellous film. It really blew me away. A retired legal counsellor Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) wants to write a book about a case he investigated 25 years ago. The case was a brutal rape and murder of a young girl and it still plays on his mind after all that time. He struggles to get it started so visits his former boss Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) to discuss it as she was also his superior at the time and the two have a close relationship. The film then moves back and forward from the case at the time to the present day as the story, along with each of the personal journeys of Esposito, Hastings and the grieving husband Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) are slowly revealed. The two main characters have superb chemistry, the film has some amazing shots and scenes, particularly one at a football match which is really exciting and there are some great characters including the quite hilarious assistant of Esposito, Pablo, played by Argentinian comic actor Guillermo Francella, who has a great way of answering his phone. It's a great story, well written, no scenes are wasted, and there's a quirky side tale of the missing letter 'A' which is really cool. Do not miss this one whatever you do.

"A wonderful, richly layered mystery.","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is directed by Juan José Campanella--it is a splendid multifaceted film which skillfully alternates between the present and past, as it seamlessly intertwines a murder mystery, love story, and judicial injustice. All of these elements of the story are flushed-out--creating depth, and all play a crucial part in Juan José Campanella's adaptation of Eduardo Sacheri's novel. A film that effectively juggles both affection and misery, using Benjamin's conflicted heart as a way to humanize the chilling details, while observing a man not only starved for justice, but after a woman he abandoned decades earlier. Benjamín (Ricardo Darín), a retired court investigator, is trying to write a novel about an old case of his that was never resolved to his satisfaction. More than two decades ago, a woman was brutally raped and murdered, and although suspects were found, the case against them was thrown out on technical grounds. However, Benjamín always suspected someone else entirely. Benjamín and his assistant Pablo Rago (Ricardo Morles), ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez was the real killer. For help, he returns to his old office and bounces his thoughts off Irene (Soledad Villamil), whom he has always loved despite never acting on those feelings. The past and the present begin to merge as pieces of the case are re-investigated, forcing Benjamín to reflect on his past, and what could have been. But Benjamín's search for the truth will put him at the center of a judicial nightmare, as the mystery of the heinous crime committed 25 years ago continues to haunt him in the present. Interweaving past and present, we see how the investigation affects Benjamín, as well as Irene, over the period of decades. Stealthily weaving Esposito's relationship with Irene into the on-going murder mystery, it takes on a life of it's own--a compulsive narrative that manages to be genuinely surprising. Haunting and gracefully, the film reveals its secrets slowly. Lengthly, but engaging, wonderful storytelling, and extremely well-done. The entire cast is uniformly superb, enhancing this foreign thriller--with its intelligent, layered screenplay. Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film (2010). **This was a unpredicted and surprising winner of the Oscar. It beat out two great films also in contention that year. Respectively-- ""A Prophet"" and ""The White Ribbon.""",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A secret unveiled bore your eyes,"I think it 's so great to see that talented filmmaking is an international thing. I've seen Argentinian movies earlier on , but none that I really remember. This on the other hand, is a film impossible to forget. It plays out like a symphony, like a story of a lifetime and of life in general.It's flawlessly filmed, great acted, amazingly done cosmetically, relieving different and with a depth that you'll rarely find, even in the best movies.This is not a thriller, and not a crime story. It's a love story on several levels, made with a touch that amazes. You'll know right from the start that it us artful filming, but since it got an 18 years certificate rating, I expected it to be violent. But it isn't.This beat my own countries favorite for the Oscar's, Kon-Tiki in the final five nominees, but it's well deserved. I'll be sure to check out more from this director, based in Hollywood. This goes out to show how important it is for Hollywood to get fresh blood into their filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best foreign language movies I've seen...,"I'm not a big fan of Argentinian cinema but there are quite a few of their films which I enjoyed and this is on the top.Through the first one-and-half hour into the movie, it seems like a direction-less journey with too many sub-stories and neither seems to end. But the next half hour clarifies all the doubts stupendously and you are left with a life-long memory of a great climax and a feeling of great satisfaction.A retired federal agent, Benjamín Esposito, is deeply haunted by memory of a case he has worked on in past. It is 1999 and he wants to write a novel, his first, on that case, named Coloto case. But he is having troubles getting started. He decides to visit his friend Irene Menendez- Hastings who also worked on the same case with him. She tells him to start at the starting. He does so. It is June, 1974 when he gets information of a girl raped and murdered. Liliana Coloto was attacked when she was alone at her home. Esposito assures her widower that the murdered will get a life-sentence for this crime. Esposito starts working on the case with Hastings and one more of their friend. When they are searching Coloto's house in her hometown, they find some photos and a suspicious young man, Isidoro Gomez, is in almost every picture, eyes always on Coloto. Esposito believes that Gomez is the real murderer. But Hastings denies his claims and tells him that it is impossible to identify a murderer just by his eyes.Anyways, they keep searching for more clues about Mr. Gomez but find disappointment only.They give up the case after sometime. A year after that, Esposito runs into Ricardo Morales, the widower of Liliana Coloto, and sees that he sits at the railway station on daily surveillance hoping that someday Gomez will pass from there. Banjamin Esposito is deeply impressed and inspired. He asks Hastings to reopen the case. And after that, the story takes turns, from mindless to mind-blowing. Who is the real murderer? Will Esposito finish his novel? Will Morales ever will be able to live a 'life'? Watch the movie to know. And again, watch out for the climax!There was probably something between Esposito and Hastings during those old days but that something got buried as the case was ceased. The romance is unearthed when Esposito pays regular visits to Hastings for his novel. She seems to understand him more as a person. There is a twisting touch to this romance towards the end. I'm sure Ricardo Darin, who plays Benjamin Esposito, must have had gone through a tough process preparing for this role, especially mentally. The character he plays in this film is haunted by the memory of that case and wants to get rid of them and thus has decided to write his experiences and memories of the case in his novel. Also, through the case, Esposito had to face some difficulties especially when he wanted to reopen the case but everyone refused him. Towards the end, Esposito seems more of a concerning parent than a federal agent. Getting into mind of such a complex character is definitely not an easy task. But Ricardo performs exceedingly well here. Not for a single time you can complain about the characterization and some credit goes to the writer also who provided so much history and sense to the character.Soledad Villamil as Judge Hastings provides much needed depth to the character. Hastings is beautiful and smart. She knows what is to be done and how. When Esposito comes troubled to her, she can well understand his concerns and helps him in every way possible. She has a working process of her own and helps in the case a lot with her brains and her beauty. As Ricardo Morales, Pablo Rago shines all the way. This is the character who will bring tears in your eyes in the climax. Juan Jose Campanella is writer-director of the film. To be honest, I love this 'writer-director' thing. I feel when the writer of the film becomes the director, he can do a lot more than he has imagined while writing. Juan does a brilliant job here. He knows the characters and provides them enough time to develop. Also, there is some back-story to every character which helps the audience understand them better. The story of this film is very engaging but sometimes we might feel that this is going in no direction and I think that is the beauty of the story. I'm not going to put much light on the brilliance of the story as it will lessen the fun.In most of the scenes, there is no requirement of a background music and neither there is. But towards the end, a melodious and a dark music helps rising the mood of the film. An emotional touch in the climax brought tears in my eyes. Felix Monti's music is a treat and you ought not miss it. The music is placed at perfect places with perfect melodies. Superb job! This film won the Academy Award in 2010 beating the favorite, The White Ribbon. I haven't watched that one yet so can't compare the two. All I can say is that The Secret In Their Eyes was well deserving for the Oscar nod and I'm very happy that it got it. Also, this film bagged almost every award at Argentina Film Awards.The Secret in Their Eyes is full of emotions and thrills. The first one- and-half hour of the film takes its time to develop and is a bit slow but the beauty of these 90 minutes resides in the next 30 minutes. This one is one of my favorite foreign movies. And definitely my favorite Argentinian movie. I will end this review with this question: How does one live a life full of nothing?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A mind-blowing crime thriller in a nutshell.,"The plot is about a retired criminal court employee(Benjamin Esposito) planning to write a novel based on an investigation of a rape and murder that has an enduring, decades-long effect on the people closest to it: the investigators, the victim's husband, and the killer. The film has a unique sense of humor at the beginning which drags us into the movie. Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays an alcoholic with a lot of respect for friendship. Brilliantly scripted and directed by Juan José Campanella who has placed the twists perfectly and comes out of nowhere. And the cinematography by Felix Monti is scintillating particularly a sequence when investigators chase a suspect amidst a football match leaves us perplexed with ideas and creates the required tension. Ricardo Darin who plays the role of Benjamin Esposito has given a performance of his lifetime and is equally supported by Soledad Villamil who plays the role of Irene Menéndez Hastings. A must watch thriller of a crime which binds through love and nostalgia.Follow Us here:https://www.facebook.com/theworldmoviejournal",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In one film Argentina obsoletes every cliched American revenge movie.,"So it's a revenge movie. America seems to make about 400 of these every year. Bad kills/takes good guys' wife/daughter/dog (hello, John Wick), so good guy decides, with good/some/no justification, that calling the police is not an option and the only way to get justice is to abandon the rule of law, get his (it's always his) medieval berserker bloodlust on and go on a homicidal killing spree murdering as many people as possible (apparently the more killed the more true was his love) who are in any way even tangentially linked to the bad guy. About the only way anyone in America ever innovates in this category of movie is the vary the choreography and find novel ways of murdering someone. Oh and there's always the traditional American gun worship, you can't forget the gun worship.There's a whole argument to be had over whether these films relieve pent up anger at injustice, or just restlessness, and so prevent outbursts of violence, or whether they basically glorify homicidal killing sprees and promote violence and a vengeful approach to conflict. FWIW, I can never get away from a certain amount of feeling dirty having watched one of these things.Enter Juan Jose Campanella from Argentina with an actually original and innovative revenge flick. He goes the complete opposite direction from Hollywood's ever more divorced from reality comic book killing sprees with a film about a few ordinary police, and a grieving husband, struggling to bring a killer to justice. The background, very sparingly alluded to, is the fascist Peron dictatorship, thousands of political activists and opposition members who became ""the disappeared"", and generally a time when a great many people in Argentina found justice very hard to come by.Unlike Hollywood's short attention span, where new revenge films pretty much have to have killed 100 footsoldiers and the head bad guy within 24 hours of the good guys' dog being buried, Campanella's story of revenge spans decades. And not just a then-and-now structure, the original investigation spans years and the present day story spans a good deal of time too. All of this piles on the dramatic tension - ""will this monster ever see justice?"" - and builds our appreciation of the heroes, they're not just risking being killed, they're risking spending decades of their lives on a futile hunt. And while guns are present, they're about as useful as they are in real life. No one's going around blowing away their problems with merry abandon.And then there's the finale, which of course I won't spoil. I'll just say it makes every American revenge movie hero look childish and narcissistic. This is a revenge story for grown ups. The hero isn't just throwing a bloody and homicidal tantrum until he makes himself feel better; he's making a steep sacrifice to see justice done and to honour the person he lost.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as great as I remembered it to be,"Just like the notorious typewriter in this film, nearly all the major characters have a vital missing button and that missing button is to move on and let go of their obsession. Benjamin Esposito (the lead actor) is obsessed with the Liliana Morales homicide case, as her husband Ricardo is feverishly obsessed with finiding the culprit and ensuring his own version of proper justice. Likewise, Irene Hastings (the lead actress) can't make herself free from her unfulfilled love for Esposito, while Pablo Sandoval is unable to break the chains of heavy drinking.Quite interestingly and ironically, director Juan Jose Campanella is also somewhat unreasonably obsessed with showcasing his technical prowess as we are being shown one breathtaking scene right after another. The sole stadium sequence is more than adequate to roll any viewers eyes, but these technical marvels are overdone in this film, almost to the point that they lose some of their powers.Another issue that caught my attention is that these characters are rather paper-thin and underdevelopped. For instance, there is one particular scene when Esposito claims he wouldn't leave his town because his old father is there and he needs to care for him, but we don't get to see him do that, we don't get to see these people have their daily life, engage in their routine day in day out activities, all we see are them dealing, hecticly, with their main obsession and this is a flaw in my opinion. I think this one-dimensional characterization of our figures, combined with the overuse of intricate shots, gives an unrealistic, fabricated impression which is both unnecessary and unfit to a story of crime, corruption and obsession.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Recipe to please Hollywood,"A good melodrama with nice characters who, for some reason, cannot communicate directly. Add a touch of suspense, with a plot taking its time to unfold, and more -contained- pathos. Let it cook for over 2 hours, then you have it.I am not being unjust here. Yes, 'El Secreto de sus Ojos' is a perfectly crafted movie, with fine performances. Now is it an excellent movie that does resonate and will continue to resonate with audiences a couple of years from now? Certainly not.So what? I am quite sure we can find a better 2009 'foreign language' movie. So this one has one special thing, a special thing which resonates with the very audience voting for the Award it got. And that's the problem with critics, they love movies on the basis of the limited set of values of their little worlds. So the wider world should never take them into account.A more personal note: I found it difficult to watch Ricardo Darin act as an almost introverted character. He is really good, but something in the movie doesn't fit. He is buoyant, he is easy-going, yet he behaves as a wimp (most critics must be wimps). Mixing present (old character with hindsight) with flashbacks (wimp) doesn't help to see eye to eye with the main character. And as far as I understand, to some this weakness must be a tremendously valuable asset for the whole movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"very good, but demands some patience and concentration from it's audience","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was one of a small number of films that I was willing to take a chance on buying without seeing. I bought this DVD for 2 dollars from my local video shop which is closing(a whole different story, and a shame). The DVD looked like it had never been viewed.I love foreign film. I think it's a real escape from the Hollywood trash that's coming out of late, and a truly great way to find some more obscure/under-viewed releases of the highest quality.This is not a film for kids. The themes and the pacing are geared towards an adult audience. Not only that, but the films subtitles move at a break-neck pace. I sure wish I spoke the language so that I might be able to enjoy more of the visual style of this film. Maybe I'll watch it again dubbed. That's something I don't usually prefer, but this film might actually open-up to some viewers like myself if you/I do so.The film really demands the audiences attention. It jumps back in forth in time, and the characters are rather candid and restrained. The story isn't all that confusing, but it's played out like backdrop, or something that's there, but not always the center of attention. I'm still not sure if I would classify this as more of a thriller, or a romance. It's rather uncomfortable to finally return to dialog-driven cinema. Let's face it - America has turned into a bunch of action-junkies.I have the feeling that I'll raise this rating after a second viewing. This is definitely the type of film that divulges new and fascinating secrets with repeat viewings. Some people will watch this and never want to watch it again(many won't even make it to the halfway point), and then some will watch it five times to 'take it all in'.This is a ""heavy"" film.I wouldn't rent this(or buy it) unless you really have the time to sit down and concentrate on the film. The film is long and hard to follow for the first time viewer. If you take your attention away for one minute you'll feel lost in that weight. You probably won't have missed anything, but you'll want to rewind it and make sure.I kind of feel like this film beat the crap out of me. The last time I got that feeling was after P.T. Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"". I think that is actually a really good comparison.

Masterclass,"Wow, what a director. Instead of upping the pace, he lets scenes breathe and develop, leading to unexpected details that make the characters so much more lovable. He lets the leads shine, he doesn't overdose on the violin quartets, his camera angles genuinely surprise, he manages to run a tight art direction without making it a ""design movie"". Usually, a great script makes or breaks a movie for me. This script was good, but not brilliant. Campanella just goes to work.The past 20 years, filmmakers have slowly increased the pace and editing. Pace excites us and has the additional advantage of hiding weak parts in the script by bombarding the audience with sheer visceral impact. Now, I always prefer a superficially exciting movie over a dreadful, semi-profound sleeper. But nothing is better than this: a movie that finds its own pace and just pulls the audience along, with their full consent.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Meditation,I rushed out to see this movie because there is one theater in my city that shows indy/foreign films and they usually stay for two seconds. I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed. This movie is really a kind of poetry for people who don't like artsy stuff. Quite easy to follow but also beautiful and compelling. I figured out most of the big twists before they happened but it still works as a crime movie but manages to hit a number of big themes: class/longing/loss/politics/despair/humor. Filmed beautifully others have mentioned the awesome pan of the soccer stadium and I liked the dreamy opening sequences as well and the lovely wide open shots of the the court house. Adult dialog that is witty and multi layered relationships that are built and explored.I was the only person in the theater because it was during the day mid week and about a 150 degrees outside.

A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Masterpiece,"""A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion, his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion.""'The Secret In Their Eyes' builds upon the very essence of life: a sequence of key moments that can completely change our destinies if we recognize them for what they are, held together by the long ordinary days in between where we don't feel remarkable enough to act. Yet its ultimate message is one of hope, while also challenging us to decide whether or not in certain situations revenge is justified. I am not normally a big fan of crime fiction, let alone romance, yet if 'The Secret In Their Eyes' was indicative of the way in which crime-romance cinema normally entertains, I'd have to jump the tracks and nail my colours to the mast. However, 'The Secret In Their Eyes' is simply a very good film, written and directed with confident maturity, populated with engaging characters expertly realized, and one that really makes you think long after the credits have rolled up into the screen.As the 20th Century draws to a close, retired federal justice agent Benjamin Esposito decides to fictionalise an especially memorable case from his younger days - one that changed his life forever. However, as the memories come flooding back, the unsolved 1974 crime refuses to fade away, and Esposito finds himself compelled to solve it once and for all, in the process rediscovering his undying love for a woman he once let slip through his fingers. Along the way, he learns what truly makes humans tick and that true passion may be the strongest force in existence, although it may manifest itself in ways too hard to accept.It will therefore hardly be surprising that I consider one of the film's prime strengths to be its study of the human condition. On one level, the commentary is nothing new: love, longing, missed opportunities, regret, fallibility, weakness, malice; yet this is humanity in a nutshell, with every generation enacting the same drama as before.'Secret' is not intended to turn this all-encompassing portrait on its side and offer a new interpretation. Its characters are straightforward, easily-identifiable and found all around us - they may even be us. The aim is to show them in all their glory and misery and break them down into the raw emotions that make us all tick. If you've never truly loved and lost, much of the film simply won't resonate as anything more than a tired cliché. Likewise, if you don't care for a study on the mechanics of human behaviour, this isn't for you. It's not a new paradigm of the genre, rather a very open and honest one that relies very much on the viewer's own life experience for it to make impact. Others may be put off by the analysis of revenge, especially as it invites introspection on one's own character by film's end. Yet this is surely the point.Another of 'Secret's key strengths is the choice of actors and the characters themselves. Ricardo Darin's Esposito is at turns very subdued, worn down by the realities of life, yet elsewhere a fiery champion of justice - perhaps not unsurprising given his vocation, but Darin has the feel of the character just right. In opposition, Soledad Villamil's Irene is a woman in conflict: career-driven, struggling to walk the right path, and torn by her feelings. If anyone embodied the film's title, it would have to be Pablo Rago's portrayal of Ricardo Morales, the husband of a rape victim. Rago's wide eyes says so much, yet hide even more. Perhaps especially memorable however is Esposito's friend, Pablo Sandoval, played by Guillermo Francella. It may again be unoriginal that the film's comic relief turns out to have the greatest insight (and espouse the film's central message), but the oft-ignored yet wise fool is a long-enduring character simply for what he offers the viewer. There is also something earthy and endearing about Francella's performance that keeps your eyes trained upon him. The humour also provides a welcome release amidst the darker themes of the film.This is helped further by the touching, at times hauntingly-beautiful score provided by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, proving an excellent match for the often sombre mood director Juan Campanella aims to create. Although 'sepia' would be too strong a word, there is a definite yellowish tint awash over the flashback sequences that give the film its art-house feel and atmosphere. Running at just over two hours, Campanella has managed to set the pace just right - anything slower would lose the audience, yet to speed things up would be to destroy the important character moments, often carried by lingering expressions that say more than dialogue ever would. Yet dialogue is very much the centrepiece of the film - none of the themes are left unexplored and Campanella isn't interested in letting the visuals do all the talking. Again, I felt the balance between the visual discourse and the verbal was just right.As my first entry into Argentinian film, I was very impressed with 'The Secret In Their Eyes'. However, to dwell on its country of its origin would be to do it a disservice, for it is simply good cinema. While its commentary on its universal themes may not work for everyone, I think many will enjoy the very touching and human tale that unfolds. If it ultimately leaves you a little unsettled and undecided as to the choices taken within the narrative, it has achieved its goal. Actual rating: 8 1/2 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Eyes speak.,"Benjamin Esposito is a retired counsellor who is writing a novel about his life, and the Morales case in particular. As he writes, he reflects on moments in his life that still haunts him.We go back to the time he started investigating the rape and murder of 23-year old Liliana Colot de Morales. Her husband, Ricardo, believes the death penalty would be too easy for the killer, and he wants him to be locked up for life when found.The film constantly jumps between past and present, but thanks to good make-up it is easy to distinguish between the different time periods. Together with Benjamin's friend Pablo Sandoval - who was drunk most of the times - they tried to solve the mystery.Although I didn't find it entirely believable for them to track down the killer the way they did, it was nevertheless exciting. I also really enjoyed the subtle love story, which in time I found beautiful. 'The Secret in their eyes' is not really a whodunit murder mystery, as there never really is more than one suspect, but the film offers so much more than just a murder thriller. There's also a good surprise ending.'The Secret in their eyes' is a very well made film with good performances from the entire cast. With the film running 129 minutes long, I did find it a bit slow moving, but the interesting parts more than compensated for that and in general this was an enjoyable watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What secret?,"12 years later I finally watched this movie, I'm argentinian and very suspicious about our cinema, I'm not going to mess with the ""murky"" state funding, but it's quality. Too arty, too pretentious, too criptic, too sui generis, too cinema school; this one although not suffering for much of that (maybe a little cinemtography pretention) has other issues that made me take six stars out.
Even as an argentinian and a porteño (citizen of Buenos Aires) I had to go back several times to understand what the characters said, bad sound is a trademark in argentine movies, I'm sorry, but it is (one star less).
Darín, Villarreal and Drago diction is another trouble, even though Darín´s here is better than in other films, sometimes it's really tiresome to try to understand what he's saying (2 stars less).
The yellowish shade through the whole movie, this may be a cinema school thing, it seems that they think common people need to see a film turned to some color (yellow, blue, sepia) to understad it's a movie (three stars less).
The lack of chemistry between Darín and Villarreal and the shallowness of their story was, though very present, very unrelatable (four stars less).
Drago´s acting was simply poor or misdirected, I couldn't feel his commitment to the role (five stars less).
And last, the entire plot is full of weaknesses; the twists in the main story are predictable to say the least (six stars less).It´s not unwatchable, but certainly it's not a 10 stars film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Woooow,"So, Diana, was it amazing? Um...yes. This movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film over The White Ribbon which I loved, and it was totally well deserved. The basic premise of this film is revolved around the life of a retired federal justice agent who wants to write a novel about the case that changed his life...that's all I'll say.Best Lines: ""How do you live a life full of nothing"" ""If you keep going over the past, you're going to end up with a thousand pasts and no future""Just cuz I want to talk about it more...

Why didn't I see that before?!!,"Ironically enough, the problem with non-Hollywoodian movies is that you never get to know them unless they win some kind of a top-notch 'Hollywoodian' award. I wonder how many other good non-American movies I've missed due to this monopolizing propaganda. The Secret in Their Eyes deservingly grabbed an Oscar for a Best Foreign Film in 2010.The story of the movie is a quite simple, yet deep, one that touches upon the fine line connecting a love story with a homicide. Both being unfinished, they linger about Counselor Benjamin Esposito's (Darin) life and haunt his memories keeping him stuck in the past. What is really peculiar about this movie is that it delves deep into the most private human emotions: love, passion, loyalty, faithfulness, vengeance.. etc. It is also about the unflinching power of unreconciled memories that can take hold of our lives and control our future.However, the film was not without shortcomings; the tempo was a little bit slow-paced and the events sometimes took some far-fetched turns. The cinematography and direction were outstanding, leaving you with some unforgettable scenes. Moreover, the screenplay was one of the wittiest I've ever seen. Without any exceptions whatsoever, and I totally mean it, the performance was epic! The cast did a great job bringing this heart-piercing story to life. A special kudos should go to Esposito's friend, Pablo Sandoval (Francella), for his smart, funny and witty Woody Allen-like performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film...,"First off I had better warn you that this film is in Spanish, with subtitles, so if you are put off by either of these, read no further. For those that are left, in 2010 it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, so I hoped it would have some potential I was right! It is set in Argentina in 1999 but mostly told in flashback to 1974. A story involving the investigation into a rape and murder and also an unreciprocated love story make up the plot of this very interesting drama. I enjoyed it very much and even when I thought it was dragging a bit towards the end there were still more revelations to come. Here's a very brief summary.Benjamín Esposito is a retired legal counsellor, with time on his hands he has decided to write a novel based on one of his former cases. The case, from 1974, involves the rape and murder of schoolteacher, Liliana Coloto. She had recently married Ricardo Morales, a bank clerk. In flashback we are told about the initial investigation which was not successful in bringing about a prosecution. Back in the present, we meet Esposito's former boss, now district attorney, Irene Menéndez Hastings. The pair has some history which Esposito wants to include in his novel. Back to flashback and Esposito and his colleague, Pablo Sandoval, discover another suspect who they don't seem able to locate. That is until Sandoval, who is a bit of a drunk, has a revelation and figures out a way to find him. This they do, but will justice be served? There is a lot more, but I won't tell you that here for fear of the spoiler police getting hold of me.This film has a very deliberate pace about it, nothing is rushed but still it keeps the audience interested. There is some really great dialogue which I found added a great deal of substance to the piece. Great performances all round; Ricardo Darín did a tremendous job as Benjamín Esposito, he has that look of a man weary of his work about him that I liked very much. Soledad Villamil was great as his former boss Irene Menéndez Hastings and Pablo Rago was equally good as the grieving Ricardo Morales. Finally, a special mention for Guillermo Francella who put in a great turn as the unassuming drunk, Pablo Sandoval.I really enjoyed this film, I found the flipping between the flashbacks and 1999 was very well done and didn't disturb the flow of the story too much. As I've already said, some of the dialogue is truly excellent (take note any budding screenwriters out there). It is all very well made, but I found the plot and the quality of the writing stand up very well. I should finally mention a beautiful haunting score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, a wonderful piece of work. So, if you're not put off by subtitles I can highly recommend this Argentinean/Spanish co-production.My Score: 8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good crime drama,"A good crime drama exploring themes of revenge, justice, and regret in old age, making it a compelling watch. The movie's portrayal of these themes is thought-provoking and engaging, and the cold and calculated nature of the revenge plot adds to the film's intrigue. However, the love story in the movie is underdeveloped and feels like an afterthought, detracting from the overall quality of the film. Additionally, the unnecessary obscenity in the movie does not add to its merit and may be off-putting to some viewers. Overall, the film is well made and the weaknesses can be overlooked. It is worth watching for fans of the crime drama genre, but it may not be for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but I think it's a bit overrated.","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a very good film--I don't in any way deny this. However, given that the film is in IMDb's Top 250 List, that it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and is currently rated much higher than ""The official Story"" (the other Argentinian film that has won the Oscar), I really expected more. Now you cannot blame the film but sometimes such high expectations set the viewer up to be disappointed...and I was to a certain extent. But, I still recommend you see it.The story begins with a retired investigator struggling with a story he's been working on for years. He's been trying to write the story of his most perplexing and haunting cases--the senseless murder and rape of a young lady. What follows is a film where the story bounces back and forth over a 25 year period--from the present to the days when the case first began. Interestingly, the story (like the film ""The Official Story"") also is an indictment of the corruption of the Argentinian government of the 70s, as the identity of the perpetrator actually is eventually determined--but justice, it seems, is never to be.The best things about the film are the acting as well as the wonderful ending. While I did guess the ending, it still was very, very satisfying to see. My only reservation is that this is a VERY adult film. Not only does it show a rape occurring (though it was done tastefully and respectfully), but you see a very nude corpse as well as a man dropping his pants to reveal his penis. It's certainly not the sort of thing you'd normally show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins when he stops by for a friendly visit. Additionally, while the film is quite interesting, it never seemed great--like a must-see film and you certainly would expect that with its 8.2 rating on IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is cinema,"Recently retired law-enforcer Esposito goes to see his old boss Irene to talk about a novel he wants to write, based on a disturbing rape-homicide case they worked together 25 years previously. His jottings stir memories and passions long neglected but never eradicated.Campanella's genre-mix, part period piece set in the Dirty War years of Argentina's late 20th-century police state, is a joyous emotional odyssey. The opening comedic tone is almost screwball comedy, giving way to the tragedy of youth and beauty mutilated in its prime, in a simple p.o.v shot timed to perfection that simply takes your breath away. The pacing of the film is exquisite, moving from sequence to sequence and shifting tonality in a manner both daring and effortless.There are incredible performances from the leads. Ricardo Darín as Esposito carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, despite the flirtatious and foul-mouthed quips. He is an essentially good man in a corrupt universe. Like James Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder, he has a drunk for a side-kick, irascible Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), a man whose aversion to phone conversations is matched by his penchant for self-annihilation. For him, redemption can only come in the form of sacrifice. Irene (Soledad Villamil) has her own regrets, centering on a parting at a train station, a sequence that book-ends the first two-thirds of the film, before the narrative moves on to explore if there truly is anything beyond the deceptive succor of memory.Despite the overtly political setting of the story, the film stays resolutely with the individual characters and their personal dilemmas. That is not to say it shirks the big questions. What is the sum total of a life? What does it mean to do the right thing in an amoral world? How do we go on knowing all we live for has been taken from us? Is there a punishment crueler than death? The film not only poses the questions, but dares to answer them, flooding the audience with catharsis in waves.I haven't seen a film this moving, so satisfyingly complex, so rooted in human frailty, since The Lives of Others. Watch The Secret in Their Eyes, watch it again, take your friends, talk about it, celebrate it, love it. Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie is from Argentina and enlightened me in ways that I never knew possible, chiefly that Argentina has a film industry. Once I got past this shocking revelation I was ready to watch the movie. So this movie won awards all over the globe including the Oscar for best foreign film, and literally every award offered by the Argentinian film awards (which suggests to me maybe Argentina doesn't have a film industry so much as makes a movie a year). This movie was one of the best I have seen in years. It has flash backs that are actually purposeful and not confusing. It has humor. It has suspense. It has mystery. It has not one but two great love stories. It has violence. And it brought me into the world of Argentina, a world I am not that familiar with other than the rumors that Hitler is secret living there. I loved this movie, from the first shot to the ending, that I thought would be all typical Hollywood bull crap, but surprised me completely and made me go ""hmmmmm.. I did not see that coming,"" which is something I wish I could say more often with thrillers. This movie is a must see unless you hate subtitles.

Law & Ojos,"Argentinian director Juan José Campanella impressively directed this sprawling political/legal/romance tale in between episodes of SVU and House. It has a terse and complex procedural at its heart which is wrapped around Argentina's political upheaval in the 1970's, but it's also about love, longing and denial of truth. At 129 mins it can get a little melodramatic and flabby at points, especially in the chaste romance between the legal beagles, but the setting and story outside of this is so engaging it hardly matters.

"An outstanding, unique movie","The Spanish/Argentinean movie El secreto de sus ojos (2009) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title The Secret in Their Eyes. The film was co-written and directed by Juan José Campanella.Soledad Villamil portrays judicial lawyer Irene Menéndez Hastings, and she is superb in the role. Ricardo Darín plays Benjamín Esposito, an investigator, and he's equally good. I would watch this movie if for no other reason than to see the interaction of these two talented actors.On its surface, the film is a police procedural. However, when you look beneath the surface, you see that's it really a movie about unrequited love. It's almost as if Romeo and Juliette didn't die, but didn't get married, either. The movie spans 25 years. So we see what's happening in the present, with many flashbacks to the earlier era.Yes--the secret is in their eyes. (It can't hurt that Soledad Villamil probably has the most beautiful eyes of any woman in Argentina.)A few warnings: the movie begins with a truly horrifying rape/murder scene. It only lasts about 10 seconds, but that sets the tone for the rest of the film. That scene is followed by gruesome views of the murdered woman. Normally, I would suggest that you just start the movie at a point past these scenes, but they occur again, in flashback, at the end. No way around it. Director Campanella wants to tell us that this was a truly horrific crime, and he succeeds.Also, naturally, the Argentinean judicial system is different from our system, so sometimes it's hard to know which person has authority over which other person.The Secret in their Eyes won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (2009).

I give him credit because I wouldn't know an Argentinian movie if the movie reel hit me in the face. I wish I were that discerning.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is indeed an Argentinian movie, and an intriguing and dramatic one.In 1999, a retired federal justice, Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel. Over the years, he has never forgotten the horrific rape and murder of Liliana Coloto, and the complete devastation of her husband Ricardo Morales. He does a rough draft and brings it to an ex-coworker, Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) for her opinion. She, along with Benjamin and his assistant Pablo Sandoval were all affected by the case.Back then, some 25 years earlier, Benjamin sees a photograph of Liliana with some schoolmates, and zeroes in on one man, Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino) whom he sees looking at Liliana in the picture. ""Something in his eyes,"" he says -- and it's something he recognizes, having been in love with Irene all these years. Gomez was ultimately caught, released, and vanished. The case was closed.Benjamin revisits the case now, reminiscing with Irene, who has continued with the Justice Department. The end of the case has always bothered him, but he can't put his finger on WHY. Though he can fictionalize his novel, he won't be happy until he really closes this case.Dark, mysterious, violent, with a shocking ending, ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a marvelous, absorbing film, filled with atmosphere as Benjamin attempts to resolve his life and Liliana's tragic murder. Beautifully directed by Juan Jose Campanella, this in many ways is a difficult story -- difficult because it's not filled with special effects and excitement, but flashbacks and characters. Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito is terrific - warm, likable, and emotional as a man seeking the truth of the case and the truth of himself. All of the acting is strong.Passion matters in this film; you can change many things about a man, Pablo Sandoval says, but you cannot change his passion. Passion, no matter how many years pass, is the key.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wow...,"This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. An emotional rollercoaster. Insane how such a simple story, on surface, can convey so much.Incredible on every level. Top class dialogue, the characters feel so pure, so alive, you are easily immersed into everything the movie shows you. Love the interactions between the main character and his partner. I think its really hard to create a relationship like this, where you feel the people know each other for a long time, and they went through everything. The case they are working on is harrowing, disgusting, but somehow manages to be inspiring, as insane as that sounds. It defines the lives of everyone involved, for better and worse.I do not want to say more about the plot or anything else. Please watch this, this movie is a masterpiece. You might be discouraged because it is not in English, maybe it sounds too gritty for you. I promise, that means nothing. You have NO excuse.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated,"This film is a nice art try to make a thrilling mystery. Beautiful colors, costumes, nice recreation of the 70s and not bad acting. These are the things that most of the movies coming from Hollywood are missing and should learn something from here. What I also love about this film is sophisticated development of emotional relations between the characters along with the main movie plot. What this movie misses pretty much are serious corrections regarding scenario. Most of dialogs are too long and confusing and completely unnecessary making pretty easy plot very complicated to follow. Some scenes look very amateurish therefore. That makes whole movie too long without any necessity and the movie pace too slow making some of the scenes look like Telenovelas. All in all, we may call this film a cute work of art but pretty overrated. I mean, this film gets the same IMDb rate as 2001 Space Odyssey ... Common!!",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""The Secret in Their Eyes"": A Haunting Look Back","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is not just a murder mystery; it's a poignant exploration of memory, loss, and the elusiveness of justice. Directed by Juan José Campanella, the film weaves a compelling narrative set against the backdrop of Argentina's tumultuous political climate in the 1970s.The story centers on Benjamín Espósito, a retired legal counselor haunted by an unsolved case: the brutal rape and murder of a young woman, Liliana. Years later, while revisiting old files, Benjamín becomes fixated on bringing closure to both himself and Ricardo Morales, Liliana's grieving husband. Their unlikely bond forms the core of the film, each grappling with a past that continues to torment them.Campanella masterfully utilizes a non-linear narrative, jumping between the past and present. This structure allows us to experience the initial investigation through Benjamín's eyes, brimming with youthful idealism and a yearning for justice. In stark contrast, the present-day scenes portray a weary and disillusioned Benjamín, burdened by the weight of unresolved cases and a nation fractured by political violence.The political context is more than just a backdrop; it's a character in itself. The film subtly hints at the growing unrest under the military dictatorship, where the pursuit of justice becomes a perilous endeavor. This reality casts a shadow over the investigation, highlighting the limitations of the legal system and the impunity enjoyed by those in power.The performances in the film are nothing short of stellar. Ricardo Darín embodies Benjamín's transformation, shifting from a tenacious investigator to a man haunted by his past. Soledad Villamil delivers a captivating portrayal of Liliana, injecting warmth and humanity into the victim narrative. The chemistry between Darín and Villamil is palpable, making their on-screen relationship all the more heartbreaking.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" doesn't offer easy answers. The ending remains deliberately ambiguous, leaving the audience to grapple with the characters' choices and the true meaning of justice. Did Ricardo truly kill Liliana's tormentor, or was it a desperate attempt to achieve a sense of closure? The film compels us to consider the lasting impact of violence, the power of memory, and the sacrifices we make in the name of vengeance.This haunting film is more than just a detective story; it's a testament to the enduring power of cinema to delve into the complexities of human nature and the scars left by a troubled past. ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a must-watch for anyone seeking a film that lingers long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even better than I expected,"A compelling Argentine thriller that masterfully weaves together themes of love, justice, and the lingering scars of the past. The film follows retired legal counselor Benjamín Esposito, played by Ricardo Darín, as he revisits an unsolved case involving the brutal rape and murder of a young woman decades earlier. The narrative structure, oscillating between the past and present, allows viewers to experience the emotional weight of Esposito's memories. The chemistry between Darín and Soledad Villamil adds depth and nuance to the story. Campanella's direction is both gripping and sensitive, balancing moments of tension with poignant reflections on regret and redemption.I never expected to enjoy this movie as much as I did - a near perfect blend of thrilling storytelling and deep character exploration.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Twenty Five Years Of Solitude,"I actually came across this film in my Spanish language text-book as a translation exercise and was intrigued by the title and synopsis which accompanied it. Although I had to watch it with English subtitles, I'm glad I did as I found it an intriguing and enigmatic feature, part quasi-detective story, part love story, both these elements spanning a 25 year time-frame.It's also a study of obsession as one man's inability to cope with the rape and murder of his adored young wife drives him to a ""Handful of Dust""-type retribution, while the main character, retiring criminal court officer Ricardo Darin's Benjamin Esposito likewise can't forget the case and not just because the perpetrator he helped catch and bring to trial was freed by an act of vindictive revenge aimed at him by an incompetent rival judge he's offended. It's also down to the 25 year-old torch he's been carrying for the woman who's obviously the love of his life, his senior fellow court officer Irene, played by Soledad Villamil, who he first met at the same time. After some initial reluctance on her part to become involved in the case, it's she who then plays a key part in pretty much entrapping the murderer into making an unconventionally graphic confession of guilt.His actual sidekick in his cold-case pursuit of justice for the slain woman's husband is his colleague and best friend Guillermo Francella's Sandoval, who in between wasting his life and exasperating his long-suffering wife with his habitual drinking, does much of Esposito's thinking and indeed legwork in trying to track down the killer, where his love of football plays a crucial part in the detection.Director Campanella gives us a film within a film as we are regularly flashbacked 25 years to not only the time of the young woman's killing but also as it's when Benjamin first met Irene. From these twin timelines the strange fate of the young woman's murderer is eventually revealed but not before an act of sacrifice by Sandoval at last forces Esposito into taking decisive action with a clearly same-thinking Irene.I enjoyed both of the very different plot strands and how they were intertwined throughout the movie, making me as interested in the fate of the killer as the outcome of Esposito and Irene's relationship. The direction was imaginative and contained some jarring images such as Esposito's initial visit to the crime scene, to the shocking way that Irene later forces the killer to literally expose his guilt.There's one fantastic tracking shot which takes us all the way from the sky above down into a crowded football stadium where Esposito and Sandoval are hoping to catch the killer and then another amazing sequence when they locate and chase him onto the actual field of play while the match is in progress. There's also humour, often earthy and occasionally dark in nature. I especially liked the nod to David Lean with the reverse-""Brief Encounter"" train station farewell between Esposito and Irene and there are entertaining running gags too with open and closing doors and nosey interns. Finally there's the clever reveal of Esposito's true feelings about Irene where a little knowledge of the Hispanic language and the addition of just one letter finally settles his resolve.I loved the acting, not just the intuitive connection between the two leads but also the casting of the hapless Sandoval, the grieving widower, the chilling killer and in a minor role, the coarse, caustic judge who is Esposito and Irene's boss.All's well that ends well, in a way, in this deservedly Oscar-winning feature, Carefully written, skilfully directed and beautifully acted, it's proof I guess that sometimes it's best not to let sleeping dogs lie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You have said Lifelong,"Quite impressive cinema from Argentina that surely deserves its Oscar.The strength of the movie is that it works on various levels. It is telling a murder and two love stories at the same time. On top, it is also a movie about the existing corruption and injustice in Argentina. This is narrated along the way by means of the crime story. Maybe this unobtrusiveness makes it seep in even deeper. Welcome to South America.The performance of the actors is generally good, but the most striking one comes from Guillermo Francella who is giving the side character of court investigator Pablo Sandeval, an alcoholic who loves his drinking and calls it his passion. Nonetheless, his contribution to solving the criminal case is quite essential.I also like the fact that this is an all-Argentinian movie, which gives an inside view to a country, which is not only corrupt but also crazy for soccer. This can be seen in the chasing scene in the stadium of Racing Club. The whole atmosphere comes across quite realistic including the shabby conditions of the stadium's sanitary facilities.For what it's worth, it is also interesting to see that apparently French cars dominated the Argentinian car market in the last decades of the 20th century as Benjamin uses a Peugeot in the flashbacks to the 1970's and uses a Renault in the year 2000. This may be unimportant but as a European, I was surprised to see these familiar cars in the Americas.Of higher relevance may be the fact that the film is not finished with catching the murderer but still holds its biggest surprise in store. No spoilers in this matter but let me reveal here that Soledad Villamil who is giving the judge Irene is really a beautiful lady ...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Competent and engaging,"I was surprised to see that 'Un Prophète didn't win the 2010 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Not because I'd seen all the others, but because it is such a good film. So it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch what, in principle, is an even better film. I wasn't totally disappointed.It's Beunos Aires, Argentina in 1999, but the story opens 25 years earlier, with the murder of the beloved young wife of bank clerk Ricardo Morales. A murder in the first ten minutes usually means we're in for a whodunit, and El Secreto is no exception. Enter our young hero Benjamín Espósito and his lovable, if alcoholic assistant Pablo Sandova who have been assigned by the Beunos Aires Justice Department to investigate. Also enter their even younger boss, the lovely Irene. And now we're all here, what next?Flash forward to 1999 where our hero Benjamín, now retired, drops in on the 25 years older, now senior lawyer, Irene, to tell her he has decided to write a book about the case. And so, flashing back and forth, the two ends of the story get to meet.It's pretty good stuff. From the unremarkable beginning, the plot moves along at a nice, if leisurely pace. The murder case gets solved quite early on, although whodunit isn't obvious, and it takes a while to track him down. There are some fantastic football (soccer) stadium shots (sorry, pet love of mine), then some other unexpected stuff happens, followed by a satisfying twisty end. Sandwiched into this are the developing relationships between the various participants. There's the almost Laurel and Hardy partnership of our hero Espósito and his drunken comrade Sandova. The unspoken respect of Espósito for the bereaved Morales. But most especially the unexpressed passion between Espósito and the unattainable Irene.In El Secreto, where character arcs are as important as the plot, nobody lets the side down. Acting - from a cast unknown to me (Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago in the three major roles) is competent, believable and engaging. The sub-plot reaches a satisfying conclusion (albeit with echoes of 'Love in the Time of Cholera'). All in all, an engaging and competent piece of work.So how it won the Oscar over 'Un Prophète', whose subtlety, depth and complexity of both plot and character make it a vastly superior piece of work, is a mystery to me. They're not even in the same league.And I have to add a postscript. Our hero, Benjamín Espósito is played by Ricardo Darín (born 1957). And not, imagine this, by Javier Bardem (born 1969, No Country for Old Men, Love in the Time of Cholera, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Penelope Cruz's latest squeeze). Who, I remember in particular from the superb 'El Mar Adentro' (The Sea Inside, 2004). Check out their pix, they could be brothers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Image is More Important Than Words,"Juan Jose Campanella's ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was hailed as masterful piece of work instantly after it's release and many who saw the movie was mesmerized by it and i am one of those who able to see the movie rather late and it is really disappointing to see what i miss in that space of time between i heard about the movie and not watching it. first of all campanella's journey is a true one both the director and the screenwriter(Eduardo sancheri) have this sentimental understanding about the nature of the human kind so the emphasis on the ""eye"" subject that we see in the title of the movie is not just some coincidence it is actually a little hint about the core of the movie the filmmaker is not interested in the words or big statements what he's interested in is in fact the power of the image campanella shows us his intentions throughout the movie with wonderful camera use, little but effective dialog, magnificent pacing and editing and of course the performance he squeeze out from his actors and actresses... the movie starts with some truly memorable image actually the scene where the espotiso just starting to write his memoirs about the morales case and he recalls this beautiful, innocent and young girl, this is the mark of something that ends, seems to follow him, a cup of lemon tea and a sun beam that washes her cheek and campelena cut to esposito ripping of the page he just writes, with anger, and he starts over again but this sweet memory now turns into some sadistic rape scene and instantly he cuts back to esposito who ""now gently"" ripping off this page too... now this is maybe the best and simple example about the magnificent editing and directing about this film. there are lots of memorable scenes which audience feels time slips under his/her feets by simply playing with time forward and backward director creates uneasy yet acceptable atmosphere and leaves the audience to himself/herself, he/her has to understand the characters all by himself/herself and while we talking about the atmosphere of the film there are some important subjects that need to be told first the camera work is just amazing especially the stadium scene stands as a singular proof of that just how masterful that scene is... just remarkable... single plan shot from start to finish lasts about six minutes and it is really something any cinema fan should see some other director who tries do that would probably ruin it but campanella just handles it magnificently, i wasn't believe this to be true while i watch it i still find it hard to believe this to be done with so powerfully and of course another great effect on this atmosphere is no other than political background of the 70's Argentina the coup De et-at was taking place at the same time leftist movements were actively trying to overthrow the military government and this situation holds some key points in the development of the story but the director want to keep this at the background what he wants is to tell more humane story he don't want to preach politics but he criticize the military government and what it takes away from people of Argentina, as a strong political thriller enthusiast and as a person who lived in a country that resembles in many ways to the South American examples i wish campanella bring the political sub-plot to more attention which is an very important issue for all repressed countries but what he already does is really generous as what it is... the acting is another very solid department of the movie. the all three leads are really very fine delivering the goods. but the real winner is Guillermo Francella his playing is different, mature and yet childish portrayal of the Sandoval adds so many to film expends it's boundaries and also lets other characters to breathe as well really important figure in the script and rancella really understands even adds something more to his character. also Ricardo Darin, sole dad villa-mil, Pablo rago and Javier godino all play their parts successfully... and there is the script, at the beginning of the review i said it is a movie of the (haunting)images not the words or big talks and the script(delivered by sancheri and campanella) does exactly that and tones down the dialog it gives space both to actors and directors to really play out their roles. i am actually not against the ""full of words"" cinema of 60's(remember Lumet's theater adaptations in America, kitchen-sink influence in england) but as some important guys(like Hitchcock) said sometime ago a movie should not be about some talking images it has to move, ""go some place(literally)"" and this movie does that and this is important images stuck in your face just like vertigo's dreaming sequence now i have another images that haunts my mind and this is the real wonderful side of this film it stuck with you never let you go this is what cinema should do image should conquer yes there are many other films who could do that but this one takes it's subject with such a heartfelt passion it is something that came from inside i believe this movie is not just made for sake of a movie it wanted to tell us something that we don't want to see and do this with feeling just for that it deserves 10 points...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Passion never dies,"¨There is a lot of things that a man can change his mind about, but never his passion¨ El Secreto de Sus Ojos, which translated means The Secret in Their Eyes, is an Argentinean film that has recently been nominated for an Oscar in the best foreign movie category. Juan Jose Campanella (who also directed Luna de Avellaneda and El Hijo de la Novia, along with many Law and Order and House MD television episodes) directs this thriller which has been a box office hit in Argentina. It has also received a lot of critical acclaim because of the way the story is told in non-linear form and it also has some great performances from the entire cast; but what makes this movie so much better is the clever ending because in order for a thriller to work you need to have a decent ending and this movie has a great one. The entire build up to the finale is just sensational and the movie doesn't drag for one minute during the entire two hours the movie lasts. It mixes romance with action and drama with suspense and balances them all very well. There is one specific action scene in a soccer stadium where a chase takes place that is just breathtaking. I haven't seen an Argentinean movie so good since Nueve Reinas (Nine Queens). This movie is very clever and I recommend you seeing it in its original language (Spanish) because the performances are so good and the dialogues are so real (If you've been to Argentina you know most of the conversations take place in the exact same manner, it just has a very authentic feel to it).The movie takes place in 1999 and we are introduced to Benjamin Esposito, played by the very famous Argentinean actor Ricardo Darin (Nueve Reinas, El Hijo de La Novia, and El Aura). He is a retired federal justice agent who is trying to write a novel during his free time about a case that happened 25 years ago and that dramatically changed his life. He decides to visit his ex coworker Irene Menendez-Hastings, played by Soledad Villamil (No Sos Vos, Soy Yo) and tells her about his plans. Both of them get together and discuss about the Morales case which occurred in 1974. The movie is non linear because while Benjamin writes the story we are transported to the past and we experience it while it is actually happening. He is working at the federal agency and Irene has just been introduced to them as the new chief of the department. His co worker and best friend is Pablo Sandoval, played by the extremely funny Guillermo Francella (Rudo y Cursi). One of the first cases they have to take with Irene as their boss is a difficult one in which a young woman has been brutally raped and murdered at her home. They inform the newly widowed husband, Ricardo Morales played by Pablo Rago, about the terrible news. He is devastated and Benjamin is so stunned about the way that this man loved his wife (he later tells Irene that he has never seen so much love through the eyes of someone) that he promises to help him catch the killer. After viewing some photographs of the victim's past he finds a suspect, a childhood friend of hers named Isidro Gomez, played by Javier Godino (Deception and Kisses For Everyone). The chase begins and the movie develops from this point on jumping from 1974 to 1999 as Benjamin is writing the novel and trying to close a case that has been left open for more than 25 years.El Secreto de Sus Ojos is a great movie which will have you at the edge of your seat at some moments and laughing your heart out at others. It also has some romance due to the interrupted love between Benjamin and Irene, so it is a movie that everyone can enjoy. It is a great story and Juan Jose Campanella does a great job of jumping back and forth during the movie in order to keep the audience's attention. The tension grows as the minutes pass and the mystery isn't entirely solved until the very end. I found the ending to be very clever and quite original because without a good ending this movie could have been easily forgotten. The true heart of this film is the story which has been adapted from the novel La Pregunta de Sus Ojos by Eduardo Sacheri, and the way in which the director is able to put all the pieces together in the movie. The acting in this movie is also superb. Ricardo Darin is great and Soledad Villamil also gives a good performance, but it is Guillermo Francella who really steals every single scene he is in. He is extremely funny and I think his performance is one of the best I've seen this year, his character just fit him perfectly. This is a great film and well deserving of an Oscar although I haven't seen the other movies that are competing in this category. Whether it wins or not, this is a movie you won't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Can One Forsake a Passion?,"This psychophysiological thriller begins with the meeting, after many years, of Benjamin and Irene. She's a judge. He's a retired criminal investigator. They're a little too happy to see each other. Twenty-five years ago, when she was assistant to a judge and he was an investigator under her, they were caught up in a vicious case of rape and murder. Benjamin visited the crime scene, and the dead woman's body powerfully told of the crime's cruelty. Two workers were arrested and convicted. Benjamin was never positive of their guilt. Now he tells Irene that on his own time he wants to write about the case.There's a revelation that comes that I felt caused the film to be overcooked, but regardless, slowly the emotional grandeur and tragedy of that aim become plainer after this begins an interesting backward-and-forward excursion through time, between Buenos Aires in the 1970s and the turn of the new millennium, which reintroduces both the crime and the unrequited sentiment that's lingered all these years between Irene and Benjamin. That's where their individual allure emerges. Actress Soledad Villamil is mature, strong, rational and probably cast for her eyes, as the film has masses of close-ups, and they're essential to hiding secrets. Playing Irene at ages 25 years apart, she's never too young or too old, but standing right there.Ricardo Darin makes her admirable cohort as Benjamin. His rank was too low, his salary too little, her presence too self-possessed for him to believe the hints he must have known she was giving. He's one of those men on whom a beard seems preordained. There's a melancholy about him. He has never stopped thinking about the murder case, and we get the feeling---although the movie is oblique about this---that the investigation was mismanaged at the time owing to Argentina's contaminated right-wing politics.Without being too open-faced about it, the film reconstructs the threads of two stories, the murder case and the fragmentary feelings between Benjamin and Irene. It's packed with lucid characters. There's fully drawn and effective comic relief Sandoval, played with a fine balance between gravity and lightheartedness by Guillermo Francella, is Benjamin's alcoholic assistant, rather sidekick, in the investigation, one of those drunks who may be bungling but is not hopeless. He and Benjamin, and all the legal-side workers, participate in the amusing ritual of referring to each other by fancy monikers. Morales is the husband of the dead woman, even now fanatically preoccupied with her death. Gomez has at all times been Benjamin's true suspect, and there is an astonishing scene featuring him in a soccer stadium that I have no clue how it could've been filmed, FX or not.The camera is like an omniscient character. There are many wonderful shots in the film, like that which opens the film and is later repeated. Various scenes take place that'll be retold later, using the retelling as part of Benjamin's evidence in the solution of the crime. The shots that are repeated somehow take on a greater dramatic force.Juan Jose Campanella is the writer-director, a gentleman who weaves a thorough (perhaps overly so), enthralling, adoringly constructed film, an epiphanic story where blinders are removed, suppressed desires are realized, self-limitations are accepted, the protagonist takes unusual actions, behaves oddly, anxious about the future. We get to fully know the characters, and the story details their complications and desires with fitting admiration. There is the continual feeling that they exist in the moment and not at some position along a predestined gamut. And though the film is a little bit overdone as I say, the cast doesn't act as much as it lives life candidly under invented circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very good, but...","""The secret in their eyes"" is the story about a man (Ricardo Darín) who tries to have a closure for an unresolved case of murder he dealt with 25 years ago, as a prosecutor. The need of a closure is also for the hidden love for his former boss (soledad Villamil). With no doubt Campanella executes an interesting story with an accurate direction and cinematography. Performances are satisfying; nevertheless, the only one that greatly shines is Guillermo Francella - his character, Sandoval, is the only one that is lovable and touching in his pathetic.The film achieves a coherent pathos through the first half, yet, at the end, the story is ""dilated"" and loses part of its charm: the suspense is resolved in a very easy way. Camapnella shows his knowledge of the Academy's taste, 'cause his movie has a major inspiration in ""the life of the others"" (Florian Henckel, 2006), a minor tittle that won an Oscar due to the unpredictable taste of a still polemic institution.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Argentinian drama/mystery,Even though I almost don't understand any Spanish and I had to read the English subtitles that are not really my language either it was a remarkable good movie. I had to adapt a little bit in the beginning because it all goes so fast but once you are in the story you get sucked into it. It's a long movie but it doesn't matter because the story stays good until the end. The end is even better then the beginning. The whole mystery about the murderer/rapist keeps you alert and the side love-story between Irene Menéndez Hastings (played by Soledad Villamil) and Benjamín Esposito (played by Ricardo Darín) gives the movie even more drama. Beautifully played by both of them by the way. Very nice filming and acting. I will certainly watch it again in the future.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a diamond in the rough,"With A Prophet and The White Ribbon going head to head in the Best Foreign Language category, it was hard to predict the winner at 2010's Oscars, but, surprisingly for many, The Secret In Their Eyes came through to trump these much hyped frontrunners.Of particular note, the cinematography is gorgeous in its lighting, and the deep browns and yellows manage to add an almost antique effect to what the viewer witnesses throughout.The Secret In Their Eyes is a diamond in the rough - a beautiful film that rose to prominence at a time of cash-ins and sequels.

"a solid page turner of a mystery movie, with a few truly great scenes","One of Howard Hawks' axioms was ""A film should have three good scenes and no bad ones,"" meaning, basically, wow them a few times, and just make sure you don't suck too much. The Secret in Their Eyes is one of those kinds of movies, and while I wasn't impressed quite enough to agree with the Academy (awarding it Best Foreign film at the Oscars over truly magnificent films like The White Ribbon and Un Prophete), it gives an audience what it wants: believable and unpredictable characters, and a story that flips around through time but doesn't get too confusing. Certainly this is the kind of mystery movie, like a recent Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, that could potentially play to mass audiences (say, a small theater at a cineplex at a mall) and do pretty decently. That it's sometimes dark and a little crazy, with a couple of terrific performances, helps greatly.In the film, we follow a rape/murder case that starts in 1974 for Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), who is called Counselor but is basically a detective. He and his partner, Sandoval (excellent drunk side-character played by Francella), are trying to solve this case, where a woman was brutally raped and murdered, but the killer is elusive, seemingly disappeared. But then there are some clues that arise, the ""Passion"" element, and (spoiler) the killer is discovered. But this is barely even through the halfway point, and the twists keep coming after this, with constant inter-cutting from 1974 to 1999 when Esposito, having finished a book, still has his memories of what happened in the case, how something about it ended, be it what happened with the killer, and Sandoval, and the widower himself, Morales (Pablo Rago), doesn't sit well with him.It makes some sense looking up the director Juan Camponella, that he's directed far more episodes of Law & Order SVU and House than he has films since it really does work best as a kind of conventional murder- mystery (or just straight up 'what happened') story. And, like on those shows, when twists happen the audience is meant to go ""Wow"" or ""Oh my God"". This is all well and good, but what about the artistry of it? Well, aside from the stellar acting, mostly by Francella and in his few minutes on screen Javier Godino as the perp (plus some sexy-without- trying acting by Villamil), it's those three scenes that stick out best.One of these is when Espositio and Sandoval, having tracked the ""passion"" element to soccer, go to a soccer match, after a whole month of going to games and trying to see if the killer will show up. He finally is spotted, somehow, and runs. The camera-work in this scene is very much of the intense hand-held sometimes-shaky variety, but it's never false in its intentions, and the length of the shots are impressive as well. The standard shooting of a lot of the rest of the movie- save for some impressive and intentionally exceptional close-ups on some things- is broken up by this. Another scene is an interrogation, and this involves Esposito's boss, played by Villamil. This is the kind of interrogation scene that one wishes were this smart and harrowing as on Law & Order; you really don't know how far the characters will take the scene, but you know the actors are game and it makes it exciting.The last really great scene comes near the end, and while I can't reveal it- not as a spoiler but just as to not spoil the fun- its a combination of horrifying cinematography (or 'dark' kind), and the subtlety of the acting. When Camponella is able to strike the iron hot, The Secret in Their Eyes works amazing. The rest of the film is good too, just not as extraordinary as it thinks it might be, or could be. It's an interesting testament to mourning and memory, the loss or lack of love and what justice really means.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome","The Secret In Their Eyes is an Argentinian entry in this year's best foreign picture race at Oscars. Juan Jose Campanella may be an acclaimed director in his country, but his combination of murder mystery, romance and drama just wears thin being nothing more than ordinary. Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome. Besides, the narrative is far from gripping that is the result of subpar writing and unmemorable performances by actors. I was never particularly enthralled with the exception of two subsequent scenes. The first involves a superbly directed chase after a presumed murderer at the stadium, while the second showcases his hilarious interrogation in which his manhood is being questioned by a female investigator. These are the only sequences that really stand out in this overall boring movie that struggles to make any impression on you throughout its running time. Even somewhat surprising ending doesn't help. 5/10 (C)",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that defies genre,"Murder mystery, love story, comedy, action, thriller, political drama. This Oscar winner for best foreign language film seamlessly combines all of these elements without disjointing the grim narrative.Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Bob Dylan), is a retired criminal investigator, who battles inertia by writing about the Morales case, a ghastly unresolved case of rape and murder of a young bride he was assigned to 25 years ago.Set against the backdrop of a corrupt 1970s Argentina, Esposito decides whilst writing his book to revisit the case – and in the process, Irene (Soledad Villamil), his superior from the period, whom he has always harboured feelings for. Told sporadically in flash back, Esposito is aided on his quest to uncover the truth by Pablo (real life comedian Guillermo Francella).The 'their' in the film's title could refer to just about any of the main characters. Whether it's Esposito and Irene who cravenly conceal their love for each other, or the suspect whose eyes implicate him, or even the widower who is suspiciously unperturbed by his wife's death. Writer-director Juan Jose Campanella guards all the secrets and doesn't reveal anything until the denouement.I remember seeing Darin many years ago in a superb film about con artists called 'Nine Queens'. In that film he was a tour de force. Here his performance is reserved to the point of indifference. Plus he's much too groomed – particularly in old age – to be the wizened investigator he should be.However, the badinage between him and Pablo more than makes up for any splinters in his performance. It's as witty as any Woody Allen screenplay. There's a chase scene which takes place in a football stadium which, put simply, is one of the most fascinating scenes cinema has offered in my lifetime.A word of caution. There's a reason why this film is certified for persons aged 18 and above. Expect full-frontal nudity (male and female), an explicit rape scene and perennial profanity.As I took my seat in the refurbished Midlands Art Centre (MAC) in Birmingham to watch this film, a jovial usher whispered, 'You'll love this film'. He was right. Trust me. Trust that usher. Trust the MAC audience. This is one you won't want to miss.www.scottishreview.net",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How all this plays out while the crime solving is going on is nothing short of mesmerizing.

A secret masterpiece!,"You are just too good to be true, can't keep my eyes off of you! And boy is that true in viewing the mastery of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language motion picture ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". The Argentinean flick is directed by Juan Jose Campanella. If Campanella's name does ring a bell, it is because he is not only an acclaimed Argentinean auteur but also has directed numerous episodes of the critically-acclaimed television series ""House M.D."". Campanella also co-wrote ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" with Eduardo Sacheri. This movie is unlike any you have laid your eyes on before! Campanella masters the craft of developing unpredictable journeys on where the narrative of this film takes you to. ""The Secret in their Eyes"" stars Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito, a retired lawyer who decides to write a novel on a murder case he was assigned to many years ago that still haunts him in his present life. In returning to the undiscovered aftermath scenarios of the case, Benjamin's buttons are pushed in so many variations. I will not divulge too much on the case because that will be a bit of plot snitching on the secret of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". I will state that in rediscovering the case, he reunites with a past female attorney colleague Irene Menendez Hastings. Benjamin always held a secret love for Irene but was not hasty enough to express his love for her, due to the nature of the infamous case. During the time Benjamin and Irene were working on the case, they had the assistance of a wisecracking, inebriated attorney colleague Ricardo Morales. He provides the film's comic relief of an emotionally-wrenched narrative. Campanella and Sacheri's screenplay is as intense and compelling as they come! And Campanella's directorial vision of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was 20/20 perfect! His skilled orchestration of interchanging between past and present was one of the movie's finest assets. The cast of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was phenomenal! Darin's daring starring performance as Esposito was undeniably outstanding. But he was not alone, because Soledad Villamil's work as the captivating Irene was up to par with Darin's effort. And not to be left undone, Pablo Rago was exactly no rag doll with his scene-stealing performance as Morales. ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was most worthy of its Best Foreign Film Academy Award, and that is no secret. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awesome.,"This film is a classic example of why films not aimed towards an English speaking audience revive what is important about films.There is no egos being flung around and every single character integrates with the others to make this film great.The cinematography is fantastic without being in your face and the closeups of the actors favours and expressions reveal the quality of the actors and actresses and show how much they enjoyed making the film and understood the emotions to portray.Keep going for the last quarter. There are a couple of places where you think it could have been ended and the director is taking it too far. But actually the ending is poignant and not predictable, although maybe with a touch of the Hollywood at the end to keep as all leaving with faith that all will end well in the world.I thoroughly recommend this film to all.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Regret,"""The Secret in their Eyes"" is a sad and precious story about wasted lives and regrets.Its plot travels between 1974 and 1999, from the time of dictatorship to the time of democracy. Argentina , like the most of South America went through turbulent upheaval in the 60's and 70's. The Cold War and its protagonists were spreading their macabre influence all over the world. If you weren't with them, you were against them. The simple tragic murder and rape of a young schoolteacher took a back seat to military junta's fight for survival. That act of criminal injustice affected three lives.This is a powerful, touching movie colored with pastel colors of regret and loss.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The question is why make it obvious? The movie also looks very out of date as in terms of the cinematography. THe movie looks like it was made in the early and mid 90's although the story takes place in the 70's. The movie is also too long, they could have easily cut some of the scenes out and should have shorten them.

A well-made and involving mystery flick.,"""If that's what happened...why didn't you take me with you?""The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoughtful, layered mystery/drama from Argentina. The story is split between two time periods: the investigation by the three main characters of the rape and murder of a young woman in 1974, and the reunion of two of those characters in 1999. Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) is writing a novel about the 25 year-old case that ended with an unfavorable outcome , and in the course of recounting what happened, we learn about the past events and the rather complicated past that Benjamin had with his superior, Irena (Soledad Villamil).What makes the movie so interesting is the relationships between the characters. Ricardo Darin, Guillermo Francella, and Soledad Villamil are all wonderful in their roles, and the camaraderie the two men and the chemistry between Darin and Francella makes what happens to the characters feel very involving and real.This really is a movie that has a little something for everyone. The unfolding mystery of what happened 25 years ago and the events that are revealed in 1999 are interesting and ultimately satisfying, and so is the understated relationship between the male and female leads. It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this, unless they just have a negative opinion of subtitles.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He wants to solve the first one and craves, silently, for a solution to the latter. In this battle of his own, he needs to braver and smarter.

Some thoughts,"El Secreto De Sus Ojos has an artistic element not seen in many movies. This drama-thriller about a murder case also involving unspoken love is visually and emotionally appealing to national and international audiences. The themes throughout are time, love, closure, regret, corruption, and injustice.Visually, the film contains interesting camera angles such as the incredible crane shot for the soccer scene. There are many close ups to emphasize the actors emotion during this scene. There are also point of view shots where the viewer can see what the character is discovering or looking at along with them. These shots create anxiety and anticipation for the audience. Throughout this movie the lighting is very intentional and often focuses on the actors faces. The lighting changes from being dark and focused during serious scenes to being overhead and bright during happy scenes.Emotionally this film tugs at the heart strings of the audience. The viewers are drawn in to Benjamin Esposito's story of not being able to get over this murder case and proclaim his love for Irene. Ricardo Darin does an incredible job at portraying a passionate character. Soledad Villamil has the ability to act as an authoritative, strong, yet emotional woman.Something many international audiences would not know about this time period was about the ongoing Dirty War. This is important to note because it provides historical relevance and a deeper understanding of this murder case as it pertains to this specific era in Argentina. The Dirty War was a government campaign in Argentina between 1976-1983, that would ""disappear"" Argentineans who were against the military-run government, called the junta. The war relates to one of the underlying themes in the movie – corruption of the justice system.All together the various components of this film make it an easy watch. It has emotional appeal inspired by superb acting. National and international audiences alike can enjoy the storyline and come away not just having watched a mindless entertainment film, but instead having watched a movie that provokes a deeper, heart-felt and reflective reaction.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Involving and intriguing crime mystery!,"'THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES': Four Stars (Out of Five)Another film that's made a lot of year end critic's top ten lists and was last year's Academy Awards winner for Best Foreign Language Film. This film is an Argentine mystery / crime drama based on the book 'The Question In Their Eyes' by Eduardo Sacheri. The script is adapted by Sacheri and the film's director, Juan Jose Campanella. Campanella surprisingly has a lot of experience directing American TV series (like several episodes of 'HOUSE M.D.', 'LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT', 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' and others) and his directing here is very impressive and memorable, including a breathtaking chase scene that appears to be all one single camera (although it was edited together using multiple cameras with CGI). The film has impressive acting turns as well from Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil in the two leads.Darin stars as a retired federal agent who tries to lay old memories to rest by writing a novel about them. He turns to an old friend, Judge Irene Menendez-Hastings (Villamil), for help. She was his superior, whom he also had strong feeling for, on a disturbing rape case several years earlier. The case was closed but it's outcome still haunts him to this day and leaves him with many unanswered questions. He tries to piece together the past with the help of Irene in order to finish his book and conquer his nightmares as we watch through flashbacks.The film is a very involving and intriguing crime mystery with a lot of emotion and interesting complex characters. It is very grisly at times though, including a torturous rape scene which is one of the most disturbing visuals I've seen in cinema. There is a lot of graphic violence as well as nudity and the movie is very hard to watch at times but if you can stick it out it's worth it. It's very beautiful in a lot of ways at times and leaves the viewer with as many positive emotions as negative.

Do not be discouraged by the subtitles, they do not affect the kinetic energy that this movie creates and maintains throughout. Even if you are not a Spanish speaker, like myself, you will not loose anything from the potency of the movie, so do not be discouraged by subtitles!Besides I would say that the most important and touching moments in the movie are when there is no dialogue at all!

The knot in their hearts that they cannot let go of stems from a rape and murder that lacked justice in the dark ages. The past is a scar that cannot be covered by the Tao, it constructs ideas and influences choices.I don't agree with the death penalty. The death penalty is not enough to relieve hatred. We need to let the murderer slowly grow old and live a meaningless life! But in fact, the correct approach should be to forget the painful past, forget hatred, and start living again in a different environment. Perhaps you will find happiness. The pain of your enemy, which you do not know, is also your pain, so why bother with pain!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Haunting,"This fantastic film is one of those that doesn't leave your mind for a long time. You will continue to return to the haunting story over and over. It is beautiful in its conclusion, while complicated and conflicting.The depth of the characters is rich and engrossing. I have found some films with the flash forwards and backwards method to be tedious and convoluted, but the direction is masterful in this. The characters from the past and present blend together in a beautiful way, where time is still made clear while also becoming fleeting. If anything, the absence of anything in between only adds to the reality of the central point of the film: to live an empty life is a terrible thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Compelling detective story plenty of twists and turns. A truly original movie with an unexpected ending.,"""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a slow paced story with plenty of twists and turns that also explore the personal life of the main characters, providing a well balanced storytelling that kept me glued to the screen for the entire length. It has been a while since I watched something so original and inspiring. This movie has everything: mystery, passion and a bit of comedy. All these elements are perfectly mixed together. There are a few moments that feel a bit dragged out, but overall, the plot is dense with details that are revealed gradually and always at the right time, making this movie extremely entertaining. This is why it deserves all the love that it received through the years, and I am happy that I finally gave it a shot.I truly believe that in order to truly appreciate every single gradient of Campanella's job, you should watch it more than once. The characters are very interesting and they feel human and tangible, thanks to competent acting and writing. I cared about them, because we get to know them intimately, we know what motivates them, why they behave in a certain way, what are their troubles and their hopes. The dialogues are engaging and most of all believable. The cinematography with its subtle details and symbolisms is really nice. The director and the screenwriters put a lot of effort into adapting the novel to the big screen and the result is a work of art and love. It is very rare for me to vote for a title with 9 stars out of 10, but this film absolutely deserves this mark.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The eyes are what speak when the mouth doesn't,"This is an Argentinian-Spanish film directed by Juan José Campanella, based on the novel of the same name by Eduardo Sacheri.The film stars retired judiciary agent Benjamín Esposito (Ricardo Darín) reflecting on his past life and a certain cold case involving the rape and murder of a young woman. Esposito wishes to write a novel about the case, a case which brings memories of pain and frustration that have stayed with him years after the fact.This case plays alongside a complicated relationship Esposito shares with his superior, Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) whom he is head over heels over, yet he doesn't always find that same affection returned to him.The acting is fantastic throughout, it may be cliche to say, but the way Ricardo Darín uses his eyes to tell us every feeling he is going through, is masterful. There are also excellent supporting performances from Pablo Rago, Javier Godino and Guillermo Francella too.It has been mentioned by many already, but there is one exquisite sequence which I believe consists of the use of CGI but also with some brilliant camera work. I won't say what scene but you'll know it when you see it. I have no words to describe how good it looked! The general camera work and music blended perfectly as it should, nothing was jarring.The writing was perfect as the intensity and intrigue is maintained, whilst the film tries to juggle story several threads. A film that feels meticulously planned and whilst at times the end result can feel inevitable, there is always something extra given by the writing, that you can't literally take your eyes off of it. A genuine pleasure to watch from start to finish, masterfully directed.""If you keep going over the past, you're going to end up with a thousand pasts and no future.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some men are just filled with non-dilutable passion.,"The secret in their eyes is filled with passion. To commit a crime with passion, to take revenge with passion and to solve a case with passion. To create a story with passion, the characters need to be fed with passion. This film is indeed a passionate film to understand these characters and why they do what they do. However, this film lacks a certain punch. Suspense is to the point and it strikes the target finesse. This would have been a sure hit if it focused more on depth of the story. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fabulous Spanish Classic with exceptional storyline and Mysterious Storytelling,"The Secret In Thier Eyes (2009) :
Brief Review -A fabulous Spanish Classic with exceptional storyline and Mysterious Storytelling. There is nothing more to say about this film being known as 'A Deserving Classic' because it is a CLASSIC with rich content. The plot unfolds the mystery so accurately and smoothly with hidden nuances which we missed and that's where the success lies. If we had spotted out those nuances then it would have became an Ordinary thriller and would have easily faded away from mind soon. The reason it stayed a Classic for a decade (and will stay for long) is uncompromising theory while telling the story. What if we hadn't seen those sensitive images, would it have became such a dignified classic? Of course not. It tells a story of passionate legal counselor who is disturbed for 25 years for the unfair results of one his case. A beautiful and innocent married woman had been brutally raped and killed but her Murderer flies free and eventually works for the Courts. The anger generated by this event was so high that we all start blaming corrupt legal system and then we see a fulfill and thrilling end. The only thing i didn't like about the film is the last scene when the Councelor goes to speak out his Love to his Gorgeous Boss who was always waiting for his confession. I don't see any logic in A Married and Divorced guy proposing a married woman who has two childrens after 25 years, do you? It should have remained a bleak and incomplete love story and it would have made a painful sense. About acting, i would name Top 3- 1st is of course Richard Darin, 2nd Guillermo Francella and 3rd is Pablo Rago, not forgetting to mention Soledad Villamil's gorgeous looks. Screenplay is brilliant, dialogues are little lower than expected and Cinematography is top class. Direction is Intelligent and as good as much it could have been. Overall, A Classic Piece filmmaking from Spanish Cinema.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Intense, different , wish it was not so great","The Secret in Their Eyes is a movie that won Oscar Award. I haven't yet seen other foreign language nominees of that year but i think they cant be much better than this one. It was different, intense in its human behavior and atmosphere.As it started i felt like not another typical movie-geecko movie that got Oscar but it was not so. Other than average carry-on story and normal acting, and it remained average for that during whole length with boring locations and cinematography but it features unusual ending and beautiful human behaviors displayed in various context. It has no strong point of 'look in the eyes' as its title suggest. Its just couldn't go that successfully with the hidden lie in the eye but other then that, it carves out few nice events like hidden liking and expressing it for each other, parting away, friendship, revenge and unusual revenge depicted powerfully by a single line 'tell him to talk to me'. This made it a special movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An emotional journey,"Dicted by Juan José Campanella, this film weaves together crime, romance, and a bit of nostalgia in such a compelling way. The story follows a retired legal counselor, Benjamín Esposito, who revisits a decades-old unsolved murder case that still haunts him. What really grabbed me was the way the film dives into themes of memory and justice. The characters are so well-developed, especially Benjamín and his unrequited love, Irene, played by the amazing Soledad Villamil. Their chemistry is palpable, and you can't help but root for them, even as they navigate the complexities of their past. The picture is stunning, with some breathtaking shots of Buenos Aires that will make you want to book a flight right away! The pacing is spot on, keeping you engaged from start to finish, and the twist at the end? Wow, just wow! I didn't see that coming! It was truly an emotional journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Haunting,"I've watched this movie about ten times, mostly because I enjoy watching it with people who have never watched it just to see their reaction. All these people share my opinion: this is one special movie. It will haunt you and stay with you forever. It may not be the greates movie ever, and I'm not a critic (thank goodness, because if I were I would probably concentrate on things that may damage the experience).It has so many levels and intertwines several genres, but the main theme is the love a man can feel forever for one woman. In this case, two men. However, this movie is so much more than a love story, and this is what makes it so wonderful.Everything is so well accomplished. The acting, the cinematography, the script... it is, undoubtedly, a masterpiece. Your hairs will stand on end during the ending.Just don't, please don't, watch the Hollywood remake (or at least watch this original version first).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"two films in one, and rightfully awarded","A well deserved Oscar. As usual the foreign movie award is granted with less quid pro quo in mind, thus quality prevails. Juan Jose Campanella directed two films in one, as the duration and his own comments on the DVD edition corroborate.A textured love story with very subtle hints and and a powerful mystery story. The acting is theatre quality for almost all cast, especially the protagonists Soledad Villamil (Irene) and Ricardo Darin (Esposito) with special mentions to Guillermo Francella (Sandoval) and Mario Alarcon (Juez Fortuna.) The movie thus falls into romance, mystery, drama category but the audacious enterprise bears fruit.Eminently watchable, it feels like a miniseries with multiple flashbacks in the characters' previous moments. The atmosphere is carefully recreated, and the make-up artist is to be recommended. Remarkable is the love story between Irene and Esposito, always there yet never declared, in their eyes but not on their lips, deliciously postponed to the last frame. The drama has a very powerful ending and it surprises somehow.The suspense is well maintained and the script is full with energizing wit of the subtle kind. It probably filled the Academy judges with a sense of elegant joy -and remorse for their awards for the some helicopter filled local productions.

Better than I could of hoped.,I almost didn't watch this movie simply because of the cover picture but Julia Roberts tends to only act in quality movies and this is a perfect example of just that. Throughout the whole movie I personally was confused about what happened in the past and what was suposidly happening in current time and yet I never lost interest and even put the tablet down so I wouldn't miss a thing. (I play a lot of games while watching tv) but anyway once the movie was over it seemed like everything we saw though out the movie was entirely the past and the end was obviously the present. The way they went back and forth between a young marzan (the bad guy) and an older guy who they suspect is marzan all these years later was hard for me to follow especially since many characters kept referring back to 13 years ago leading me to believe that we were in the present. I would definitely watch this movie again and recommend it to anyone. Usually if I'm not understanding a timeline or not liking how the timeline jumps back and forth I'll just shut the movie off but I don't think I could have shut thus movie off if I tried.

Entertaining Pot Boiler,"A fairly compelling Argentinean pot boiler that weaves past and present into a part mystery thriller/part romantic drama about life's unresolved dilemmas.A former legal counselor is haunted by a brutal rape and murder case that goes unsolved -- or rather, it's solved, but the criminal isn't brought to justice because of corruption within the Argentinean legal system. Meanwhile, he's also filled with regret about a romantic relationship he failed to pursue with his boss, passions which are reignited when she comes back into his life years later as he is gathering research for a novel he plans to write about the rape/murder case.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is at its best when dealing with the criminal investigation at its center. It's on shakier ground with the romance, primarily because the two leads don't have a lot of chemistry. We're just told they're smitten with each other, but we never really feel it. Also, the film's execution at times teeters toward the painfully strained, most notably in a scene where the two protagonists are trying to bully a confession out of the man they suspect of being the rapist/murderer. I always felt the film was trying to be smarter than the material would allow, as if the film makers couldn't be content with letting it be a plot-driven thriller (which is what it's really begging to be). But despite these criticisms, it's a very good and crafty film. I'm not surprised that Hollywood decided it needed an American remake, and I'm even less surprised that the powers that be (by all accounts, as I've not seen it) botched it.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2009.
