Are We There Yet?,A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way.

Ranks #5 on my IMDb Top 25 Best Buddy Films List. A Feel Good Movie at its Core,"Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.,"I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been conditioned to abide to his whole life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
I Was Captivated,"I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them.

"A captivating watch, with sensational acting.","Not often these days so I give ten stars to a film, with Green Book however, I had no other choice, this film had me totally captivated.It's a fascinating story, I had no idea that it was based on true events, temporarily losing his job at a club, Tony Lip Vallelonga gets a job driving for Doctor Don Shirley. Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"""Green Book"" is Gold","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Greatful to have seen this,"I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. 
 Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. 
 Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken.
Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. 
I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives.
I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity,"Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley.
Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses.
This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Not to say it isn't a decent movie...,"... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also
shows how simplistic it really is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner,"Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

A perfect example of Yin & Yang - and black and white has nothing to do with it.,"Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.Great performances from the entire cast, especially Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who were perfectly cast and convincing in their roles.

Respect demands respect,"A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people.
The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious.
While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.The story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.While the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded.
The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A re-awakening journey,"My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

heart's in the right place,"It's 1962 New York City. ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Best example of the power of cinema,"Who could've ever greenlit ""Green Book""? A (mostly) true story of two men of completely different backgrounds overcoming their own prejudices and the stifling racism of the Deep South of the early 1960s. We'll hire a Danish guy to play an Italian guy, and a guy best known for playing a political fixer and a dope dealer (in ""House of Cards"" and ""Moonlight"", respectively) to play a Jamaican-American musical genius. And we'll have one of the Farrelly brothers direct it. How could that possibly become a great movie? Well, it does- primarily through the great performances of Viggo Jorgensen and Mahershala Ali, and the nuanced directing of Peter Farrelly. It confronts the racism prevalent at the time without becoming preachy, and shows its main characters growing through contact with each other, without a complete reversal of their characters (which would've seemed phony). Oh, and the movie looks great, too- the period cars, sets, and costumes really take you back to that time period.

"Predictable, full of clichés and overly simplistic","I had high expectations based on the positive reviews but was quite disappointed.The story had a good potential to explore a relationship between a sophisticated black pianist who employs a white working class driver as they travel through the US south in the sixties. They have seemingly nothing in common, from the way they were brought up, the way they speak and eat, their family backgrounds and financial situations, their way of treating other people. As they spend time together on the road trip, they start to appreciate each other and learn from each other.What bothered me was that the characters ended up being caricatures instead of being believable. The film tries to depict their differences to the point that it did not make sense. For example, we are supposed to believe that a black musical genius pianist never heard of Aretha Franklin or Little Richard? Or that he never tried fried chicken? I also thought that Viggo Mortensen was slightly over-acting.... The racial problems were not depicted in an authentic way.The movie just received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, likely because of the social commentary and not because of great film-making.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

A delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors,"Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.In 1962, New York bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human.

Easy to digest and heartwarming feelgood movie,"While you could argue if the topic raised in the movie is really suited for a feelgood movie such as this, when the credits rolled, I could wholeheartedly say yes.For once it's not dark, gloomy and preachy drama about America's 1960's racism. No, this is an uplifting and hopeful tale of two men, getting closer together and evolve beyond the beliefs they have been brought up with or the semi-hardcoded (mis)conceptions of things that simply are a certain way for them, mostly because of groupthink and indirect group pressure to behave a certain way.The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.You can top it all off with beautiful classical and sixties era music.All in all, a very entertaining and loveable movie. 9/10, well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

The Peruvian Post - Green Book - Film Review,"""Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one.""The year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact.Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.The contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!On the whole, the film ""Green Book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.(88/100)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
An entertaining if too lite Goombah Driving Miss Daisy,"GREEN BOOK. In General ReleaseThe trailers promise a sort of Goombah Driving Miss Daisy. For once, the previews aren't lying. With the races reversed, Peter Farrelly's movie, based on a true tale, tells the story of an Italian restaurant bouncer Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who gets a gig driving black Piano Virtuoso Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour of the deep south. In 1962. A time and place where a little tough guy bouncing may come in handy. Shirley leads a musical trio, with two other (white) musicians.GREEN BOOK is genial enough, and, broadly, entertaining. There are a number of feel-good moments and a few that lead to cheers. But, for every successful bit, there are an equal number of groaners - and Kris Bowers' backing score is one long groaner, with every single emotional highlight signaled, underlined and highlighted in musical yellow markers. Fortunately, most of the music we hear is of Dr. Shirley's trio and Tony's fave car tunes including Little Richard, Chubby Checker, Aretha Franklin etc. (incredulously, Dr. Shirley claims to have never heard them prior!).Mortensen and Ali are fine actors, but, aren't given a shot at much beyond sit-com style hokum. Mortensen comes off at times like he's auditioning for an off-off-Broadway production of Goodfellas. Ali is a bit more effective, but, the script and Farrelly's lite Direction limit him. GREEN BOOK is so genial and it's heart in the right place that it's a difficult movie to outright dislike (although one really does regret that the movie doesn't take the time to fully explain the meaning of the title). Still, it's a movie that would have fit alongside DRIVING MISS DAISY in 1989, but, haven't we moved past it by now?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Plays in the Safe Zone,"Most of the reviewers here state how important the message of the movie is. I will play the advocatus diaboli here: I don't care about the message of a movie without entertainment - in the first place by watching a movie I want to be entertained and not educated. Green Book is that kind of movie that you make in our times if you want the applause of today's Hollywood's crowd (remember Shape of the Water!?) - add some known actors, some production value and you can grab easy some prices and positive reception here and there. 2nd choice: make something about saving nature. Creativity!? Daring!? Uniqueness!? None. Anyway, the message of course is one already told many times before (e.g. The Intouchables, Driving Miss Daisy to name some obvious ones), but I admit the actors and their chemistry work well - and that's the real strong part here: the acting of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. No doubt, Green Book for sure has its strong moments, but in a certain sense it is a little too predictable for my taste, or one could say, to save played. Movies like In the Heat of the Night or 12 Years a Slave made a stronger and more lasting impression on me - both movies I watched a couple of times. Will I put Green Book again one time on my plate - maybe. Verdict: solid to good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Safe and predictable from start to finish,"""Green Book"" (2018 release; 130 min.) is ""inspired by true events"" we are reminded. As the movie opens, it is ""New York City 1962"" and Tony works as a bouncer in the Copacabana club. When club closes for renovations, he needs another job. One day he gets a call: a doctor needs a driver. The given address turns out to be Carnegie Hall, and the ""doctor"" is in fact acclaimed pianist Dr. Don Shirley. After some back and forth, Shirley hires Tony, and off they go... At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you will just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie directed by Peter Farrelly, who along with his brother, has brought us ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", among many others. Here he goes a very different direction, namely on the one hand another take on ""The Odd Couple"", and on the other hand the racial tensions in the deep south in the early 60s. As to the odd couple Tony and Shirley, it provides for some comic relief (much of the theater crowd roared approvingly). As to the racial tensions, they are as predictable as they are mind blowing that this went on just 60 years ago. But truth be told, if you want to see a movie about those issues, there are far better movies than this one. Viggo Mortensen tries way too hard to be a convincing Italian-American from the Bronx, and that is true as well of the family gatherings early in the movie, you can practically hear the director yelling ""..and ACTION"". Mahershala Ali (as Shirley) fares somewhat better. Kudos for the production sets (I never tire of the cars from that era).""Green Book"" expanded wide this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was, much to my surprise, packed to the rafters (mostly seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"", I readily suggest that you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Incredible Film,"This is arguably the best film I have ever seen in my life. It tackles the issues of race and classes in a very sleek and intelligent way.

Personally, I believe that this is the best performance in acting that has ever been. He is brilliant down to the last detail and in my opinion well deserving of the Oscar. I am shocked that he did not win in it considering his incredible performance. This is obviously not an attack on the Oscar winner but merely my opinion.

An instant classic that everyone should see at least once.,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that has the right balance of themes and execution to make it into an instant classic. When I first saw trailers for Green Book (2018), I initially thought it was just going to be an inverse of Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Instead, what I got was so much more than that. Green Book tackles the difficult task of presenting a harsh mirror on our past, with a knowing wink that some of these challenges are still present today. It is more subtle than BlacKkKlansman (2018), but the message still gets across in a heartwarming and wholesome way.What makes Green Book so engaging is the simplicity that it approaches such a nuanced and complex approach to the topic of racism. The irony that rich white people in the south would hold Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in such high regard as a musician but treat him as less-than-human the second he is not performing for them is stunning and appalling. The strength of the story certainly comes with the repartee between Shirley and his Italian driver, Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), in a way that shows all people can change for the better, even if it's in small steps.I have to commend the excellent music in this film, merely as a side-note to the fantastic screenplay. So many moments were laugh-out-loud funny or tears-to-your-eyes touching due to their ability to tie together moments that appeared earlier in the movie. Sure, some may call this film predictable or cliché, but it works in a way that's so engaging that you can't help but lose yourself in its narrative. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography that brings the story to life is top notch as well-utilizing shallow depth of field to masterful effect.An instant classic that everyone should see at least once, I give Green Book 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"Mortensen and Ali make it an entertaining watch, but the whole thing feels very outdated.","There's some enjoyment to be had while watching 'Green Book', but everything from the story to the cinematography feels very early 2000s, and it's ultimately quite shallow in its messages. It focuses more on the core friendship than anything else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Mortensen and Ali have great chemistry which really gives the film its entertainment value. Unfortunately, though, it takes a long while for the main conceit to really get going and this first portion of the flick is almost devoid of any real entertainment value. Luckily though, once things get on the road it becomes a fairly entertaining time and moves along briskly - although the skit-based comedy that makes up for most it (which, again, feels outdated in a picture like this) becomes quite tiresome. Overall, it's sufficiently entertaining throughout - thanks largely to Mortensen and Ali - and moves briskly enough. It's let down by its outdated filmmaking and narrative conceit, though, and by its lack of depth, too. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
misses the mark,"Ernest but flat. Inter-racial friendships have been a topic in American films for over 50 years. The emotions between the two main characters here came across as forced and inauthentic. Why choose the Danish-American Viggo Mortensen to play an Italian-American from the Bronx? His portrait was an amateurish embarrassment. Almost grotesque, but supposed to get laughs. And Ali's character, Don Shirley, does things down South that would most likely get him killed---I doubt the incidents in the movie truthfully matched the real-life happenings. It looked like a movie about Americans that was made by Canadians. Full of false notes, with no real flavor.
This movie wasn't even a crowd-pleaser where I saw it (NYC). Don't expect Tony to beat-up every racist we see, Buford Pusser style. Just lame confrontations that didn't satisfy or really address the racial problems in a believable way. So here's one lone knock on a movie that got a mystifying amount of good reviews.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

The Best Best Picture Winner of the Decade,"Best picture winners of late have tended more towards 'important or significant' movies like The Artist or Birdman and away from crowd-pleasing entries like Braveheart and The Return of the King.

A good old-fashioned feel-good movie,"If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.It's a movie about how two mismatched people, (a chain-smoking, rough speaking Italian-American and an African-American you might even call 'uppity'), who, on a long road trip in the Deep South in the early sixties, bestow on each other the gifts of friendship and humanity. Even if you knew nothing of the 'true' story of the musician Don Shirley and his driver you can predict the outcome from the get-go. Of course, it also helps that it's also very funny despite the seriousness of the material and that leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are so damn good, (Ali's second Oscar in three years looks like it's already in the bag). It is, then, something of a treat and might even convince you to seek out the music of Don Shirley.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar.","This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Inspired by the real 1962 musical tour down South.,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. This movie recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Ali won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The lead role is Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, a New York bouncer of Italian descent. His club is closing for the last two months of 1962 and he is recommended as the driver for a black musician, a pianist, who is going on a tour, a series of performances, in various Deep South locations.Mahershala Ali is in the role of Dr. Donald Shirley, who was a real jazz and concert pianist who over his career played in many high-profile venues. In 1962 he has planned this musical trip to hopefully change some perceptions about black musicians. Having a tough bodyguard as a driver will help insure his safety.The title is a reference to a book which is a guide to where blacks can eat or sleep in southern locations, in 1962 the Deep South was mostly still segregated, blacks could not stay or eat and many locations.As the writer, one of Tony Lip's sons, reveals, the story is only regarding that particular trip and he says the input comes from Ali himself some years earlier, and of course his dad. It is a story of how two men from greatly different backgrounds and world views became friends. Ironically both men died in 2013.Good movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
I give it 👍👍. The negative reviews are full of it,"I honestly don't understand why so many critics don't like this film as much as the audience. Green Book has a great artistic story, a good script, great acting, it has some great humor, some great drama and poigniance. It's well directed. It has both characters learn from one another and need one another despite often not being able to stand one another. It doesn't show such developments in a preachy kind of way. It doesn't seem to present any silly inconceivable blunders. I felt it was well worth spending 2 hours watching in a theater, and I found it one of the best films I've seen this year. If not the very best.The rest of my review is for the purpose of responding to stupid reviews of people who find a way to hate this movie because of what it isn't as opposed to what it is.Does Green Book have everything perfectly documented about life as a black person in Ali's character, or life as a white person for Mortenseon's character? No. Does it perfectly encapsulate every person's time and experience traveling and living in the south or the north of America at that time and in those places? No. Does it property portray all friendships of white and black people? No. Does the film perfectly show how the police treat people in every instance in the north and in the south? No. Does it feature sad people living their sad lives and learning nothing to effectively encapsulate how terrible and hopelessly serious some issues can be? No. Does the movie strike me as having a groundbreaking quality that puts it as the first or definitively best at doing whatever new ambitious thing it's trying to do? NoFrom my standpoint, these kinds of shortcoming could be said about every single good movie. Even if a movie is groundbreaking, it isn't an excellent film because it was groundbreaking or record shattering. Green Book's purpose is to show the experience of two specific characters along with their friends and family as the main two characters get to know each other. The story as it is told is believable, entertaining, interesting and likeable. And that is exactly what it was trying to be and, in my opinion, that angel serves the film very well. I don't know how perfectly the film was at showing exactly what really happened. But If anyone expects to be able to take a film based on true events as the perfect infallible account, they are the with the issue as opposed to the film.As for what the film didn't cover: If you want all the facts or potential ramifications or heartbreaks of other people in this time going about their lives, you're better off reading some books, looking up some facts, or watching some documentaries about the topics. Nothing can tell every avenue of every conceivable story with perfect detail and accuracy. And a 2 hour movie is far from the ideal way of even try such a task.Movies like Green Book are meant to exist as entertaining peices of art. And that is exactly what I thought Green Book was, and what made it good. I highly recommend this film is that's the sort of thing you like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Just okay when all is said and done,"So, let me get up on the soap box here for just a second ::steps up, clears throat::It may be because I have inhaled as much of the non-fiction of James Baldwin the past two years, or that I have simply paid halfway attention to whats going on in this part of this decade, or that I live in the general area that Tony Lips did (the tri-state area in the North-East), but I think Green Book underestimates the racism of the North at the time. It's often been a misconception, usually by white people (and maybe at one time when I was much younger), but just because you live in the North and around liberal areas doesn't mean that things are less racist.Indeed, it's that more subdued racism (what MLK dubbed those ""white moderates"") that make a lot of trouble. From socio-economic segregation of a sort - notice that in the Bronx neighborhood Tony's family and friends live there are no black people, and the ""No Coloreds"" signs are not up but they're just... Not there, and not allowed. Not really, anyway.To the movie's credit, it does touch on the fact that there is this racism that is there with working-class Italians (not that it's any great revelation in American cinema - Do the Right Thing was made decades ago and dealt with Italian caricatures, literally making pizza, being face to face with African American people with much more insight and drama/comedy etc); there is one telling beat where Tony comes home as two black handymen are working on the Lips' family kitchen, and they're given some lemonade in two glasses. When they leave, Lips puts the two glasses in the trash (and later, Linda Cardellini's wife takes them back out). This is good visual storytelling that makes the point clear: once Lips gets tasked with the plot of Green Book, which is to drive the good Doctor (Mahershala Ali) across the mid-west and deep South, there will be problems but not just with those they come across.... But then it's kinda-sorta dropped for a ""feel-good"" movie about race relations.I don't know about you, but in 2018, living in just everything that's going on now (in daily news, a campus in Mississippi got vandalized with numerous nooses hung about for tomorrows Senate vote for example), I'm not sure if that's what we (white people, even more than blacks or other minorities) need to see. All this said, the movie does a good job, at least for the first two thirds, of getting an entertaining buddy story between these two Characters, with a capital ""C.""And to the actors' credit, Ali and Mortensen tap into the cliches of a, well, bouncer at the Coppacabana and classically trained PHD pianist (fluent in multiple languages, which does pay off at a key point by the way, nice writing), and whenever they are on screen I believed the actors in what they had to emote or tried to do. It's even got funny scenes and beats and lines, and while I can count the number of laughs (at least five, at most six), they are genuine laughs. Farrelly knows how to get two guys working together on screen - he's known since Dumb & Dumber - so that part is fine.But then there's that last third in particular when it hunkers down into hammering its message about race relations (if you've seen the trailer, that scene in the rain with ""if I'm not black enough and Im not white enough"" etc is a cringe-tastic as it seems) and the simple attitude that after two months Tony Lips is now way cooler and, more crucially at the end, all the rest of his friends and family there for Christmas Eve are magically okay now with the ::insert Italian slang word for racist epithet here:: coming to dinner. But this is all without any real work outside of a few goopy scenes where the good Doctor helps Tony write letters to Mrs. Lips (sorry I forget his real last name right now) so he must be awesome outside of the brilliant piano playing.The movie does go a ways to make Ali's character flawed too in some basic ways - as a musician on the road he's become a loner, estranged from a brother and divorced - and in one way that I don't think is meant to be seen as a flaw, but comes up as a ""huh"" bit where Tony has to get Doc out of a bind when he is... Caught in a gay moment with another man at the YMCA(?!) Okie dokie! So that also don't be a big deal since hes just Tony's boss and no judgment and we'll just leave his sexuality as something that doesn't get any more screen-time because RACISM needs to get the top shelf over homophobia and that entire grenade which... What was that??As far as the sort of if not feel good then *don't feel bad* kind of movie released by a big studio, it's not as tone deaf and potentially harmful as a Crash; it has more of the feel of a better(ish) thing that Stanley Kramer would have made (down to, if Poitier was around he would be ideal for this part): it doesn't shy from the issues, and on the contrary it tries to show what everybody (even the racists) know, which is segregation-by-law can't be sustainable.But when it comes to depicting more essential details about character, about really digging into Lips past his love for his wife and not being *that* bad because, hey, he turns down offers by the local mobsters for work even when he's down, right(?) it doesn't hold as much water. Should I wholly believe Lips wont throw out again glasses that happened to touch mouths of black working class workers, despite himself being working class, because he got Lessons in Life (and visa-versa he gives the Doctor some ""Street Life"" lessons)? Not sure that I do.Why the six star rating then? When it means to be simply well-acted and more character-driven entertainment, it works - not to mention the greatest product placement for KFC in cinema history - and I enjoyed seeing these two do the absolute best they could with what they had. It's a mild recommendation. But compared to what else you can see from this year - Blindspotting, Blackkklansman, Sorry to Bother You, to an extent The Hate U Give - it's weak tea.Thank you. ::steps off::",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"Won the People's choice award at TIFF, and it will win you over too!","It's frightening to think how far we came (past tense) and how far we've regressed when it comes to something like social equality. Many people would agree that Western, perhaps even Global culture has been regressing when it comes to acceptance and racial relations.To say that Green Book, a story about racial relations and acceptance (or lack thereof) is strangely topical, is also an oversimplification. What might be more strange however, isn't the timing of the film's release, or the fact that a story taking place in early 1960's America is contemporary, is the fact that the latest cinematic voice, the newest artist to reintroduce concepts like love and acceptance (concepts Mortensen said are ""lost track of a lot these days"" in the Q & A session after my TIFF screening of the film) ...is Peter Farrelly. Yes, that Peter Farrelly; the one who countless times teamed up with his brother to bring us trendy comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber, Me Myself & Irene, and There's Something About Mary.Green Book follows the story of a working class Italian-American, Tony Lip (Viggo Moretensen) who, after losing work as a bouncer, finds himself working for Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American classical pianist on tour through the deep South of 1960's America. The two are the archetypal odd-couple, with Dr. Shirley being scholarly, fastidious and composed and Tony being what would seem to be an Italian-American cinematic stereotype; tough, loud, and brash.While we may not associate either of the Farrelly brothers with drama, audiences lately haven't associated them with comedy either. Recent releases such as Dumb & Dumber To, The Three Stooges, Hall Pass, even as far back as Fever Pitch had neither audiences nor critics waiting for the next Farrelly project. That changed for me personally when I discovered Green Book, and discovered that not only is Peter turning to more dramatic subject matter, but that his brother isn't a part of the project at all.""My answer was always 'when it happens'. I never planned what was going to be next, it was just a thing the universe brought you, dropped in your lap, it would be like planning when you're going to fall in love, you never know when it's going to happen"" Farrelly told the audience at TIFF that he didn't actively seek out this project, it came up very organically, and that when he heard co-writer Brian Hayes Currie talk about the film, he knew it was a 'home-run' idea.He might be right. About everything. The fact that this idea came his way and just felt, the timing, his background; this film would not be the same without Farrelly's approach. That may seem self-explanatory, but what I'm addressing is the fact that this film needed the touch of a comedic filmmaker, or at least this specific comedic filmmaker. Within he and his brothers' specific niche of comedy, there was something that was always enjoyable about it, even if the comedy itself, was not. They knew about human connection.The Farrelly brothers always, without fail, had a shmaltzy moment of love, one way or another. Even when dealing with Lloyd and Harry in Dumb & Dumber, when dealing with caricatures of human beings, there is a bond there, there is a love. So imagine if suddenly Peter Farrelly starting taking things seriously? When a filmmaker understands sentiment and human connection, then it's not such a stretch to make the jump to drama.Farrelly's influence on the mood of the film is fairly obvious. He's never been a subtle filmmaker, and the film does lack significant drama. After my viewing of the film I wouldn't even categorize it as a drama, because, while there may be hurdles the characters have to overcome, it seems to be a very light-hearted story. Arguably, the most lighthearted version of an extremely heavy subject matter. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop, dramatically speaking, but nothing too heavy ever came. Every time there is something even remotely dramatic, the two characters get out of it with relative ease. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but some might see this as too lighthearted, and not truly dealing with the reality of racial segregation and prejudice. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, as it's the tone of the film all three writers and Farrelly were going for, but considering the subject matter, this may actually anger audience members. The title Green Book refers to a 'travel guide' of sorts for African-Americans of that time. Realistically though, it was more of a 'survival-guide', as it informed those families where it was safe to travel, what restaurants they were permitted to eat in, and the 'colored only' locations to lodge. For many families, the Green Book has significant personal meaning.What I am suggesting, is that is merely subtext, despite what they chose to be the title. The story is really about our shared humanity despite differences, and while these characters do reinforce some stereotypes, it shatters others. Mahershala and Mortensen create characters that are part caricature, part inspiration, but regardless of how you view them, it works. The two are so well-balanced, it's difficult to say if either of them is truly the lead. That's of the utmost importance, as this unlikely friendship is what inspired the film and drives the story.I never feel like I am watching Mahershala Ali acting, as... to be honest... I don't really know who Mahershala Ali is. (That is a testament to his acting, not a comment on the fact he and I don't hang out in the same social circles). However, his role as Dr. Shirley is drastically different than anything I've seen him do before. His sense of who the character is, his mannerisms, his diction, even his inner thought process become clear through Ali's performance. Since this is a more comedic film in tone, I have to also compliment Ali's sense of timing. The character is reserved for the majority of the film, and being a straight man in a comedic duo is not easy, but Ali finds a brilliant balance of drama and comedy. It's another performance, that while perhaps not award worthy, he will assuredly be remembered for.Green Book will also be remembered. The balance it finds within small sub-genres of cinema is carefully crafted; part road-trip buddy movie, part period piece, part social commentary, but all enjoyable. It may not spark serious conversation between audience members. It certainly won't solve the social inequality and hatred that plagues many parts of the world still to this day. It does, however, serve as a reminder of the core concepts it successfully portrays. Mortensen when addressing the crowd put it best: ""There's something very profound there that we lose track of. These days, we lose track of it a lot. And that is anybody has the right to understand or appreciate other people... you can respect each other ...you can listen to each other.""So if you'll indulge Mortensen's teachings, listen to me... go see Green Book.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

A charming character and social study but its ridden with cliches.,"If I were to sum this film up it would be funny, charming, pretty and unoriginal. Every stereotype about African Americans in the 1960s is reversed and removed from the black character and placed on the white character. It's a rehash of a dark part of American history, shown via the adventure of two people on the opposite ends of the social spectrum.What really disappointed me however was the acting by Viggo Mortensen. His New York City accent was borderline terrible. I'm from NYC and I am Italian American. It was unnatural. People do not force their accents like that here. His performance reminded me of Travolta's accent in Saturday Night Fever. Way over the top and forced.Gripes aside, the two main characters have decent chemistry and their growing bond over the course of the film feels genuine and felt. The cinematography and set designs were spectacular as well. It's not the most dramatic film though. I can't give Green Book more than a 6/10. Worth a watch but very forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"Clichéd, overrated and sentimental","I love Mahershala Ali. I just finished True Detective 3, and he shines in that.

A Little Bit Of Everything,"One of my favorite cinematic experiences is when a film comes absolutely out of nowhere and ends up being incredible. That is pretty much the story of ""Green Book"", a movie that came into the 2018 holiday season with little hype but, when all is said and done, might be the frontrunner for ""best film of the year"" on many personal lists. It sure is on mine, I can tell you that!For a basic plot summary, ""Green Book"" tells the real-life 1962 story of Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a renowned piano player embarking on a tour of the Deep South. His race--African American--might pose some issues, so he hires cocky tough-guy Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) from the Bronx to be his driver. As the two set out on their journey, it at first seems like an Odd Couple type of relationship. But as they experience more of each other's company--as well as the racial injustices of the territory--they come to both rely on and perhaps learn something from the other.This is a movie that really ""sneaks up on you"", so to speak. It starts off relatively straightforward and one could be forgiven for thinking it's maybe even a little slow. But that character development pays off in an enormous way, as by the end you'll be holding back tears (or failing to) after witnessing the bond these men form out on the road and in face of adversity.For a movie like ""Green Book"" to work, the acting has to be spot-on, and it surely is here. You'd never guess this was the same Mortensen that was once the sword-wielding Aragorn in the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. He went all-in for this role, shaping both his voice and body to fit the part. Ali has slowly built up a fantastic career for himself, and there's nothing to stop that process here. The arc of his character provides most of the emotion of the film, and his scenes range from heartbreaking to hilarious.Speaking of ""hilarious"", also consider that this film was directed by Peter Farrelly...yes, he of ""Dumb & Dumber"" fame! While seemingly an odd choice to helm such an emotional project, it proves to be EXACTLY the right decision, as the humor in the film goes a long way towards establishing rapport between the two leads. As deep as the ""emotional stuff"" goes (and it goes deep, to be sure), the comedy is easily just as well-done.I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack yet, which is another integral ""role"" in the film. Whether it be Shirley himself or just the ""on the road"" type tunes, the ""Green Book"" soundtrack is one of the best I've experienced in quite some time. A great mix of jazz, piano, and orchestral sections.As you can see, I think that perhaps the biggest reason why ""Green Book"" gets the full 10-star treatment from me is because it does a little bit of everything, and somewhat remarkably nails all those little areas to produce a masterpiece. The final compliment? The overall message of the film is a great one: that sometimes all it takes for two people to better understand each other (in this case it is black and white, but really it could be anything) is proximity. Had not fate drawn Dr. Shirley and Tony together, they would have spent the rest of their days likely stuck in their own little boxes. As it turned out, however, it took a road trip to cross those bridges and each man to learn a little from the other.Great story, acting, direction, humor, music, and emotion. What more can a movie-goer ask for?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Orphans in the Underworld,"When a grifter with a heart of gold gets hired by a black classical pianist to drive him to his tour dates in the Deep South, their journey takes them to unexpected places.Well, I say unexpected, but this is definitely a feelgood road movie with no other destination than goodwill to all men, using classic techniques of mounting conflict and character arcs to get us there. The outstanding element is the performance in the grifter role, which has all the gestures you'd expect in a character of that background but delivered with total candour and charm.So the time flew, with good pacing, good humour, and nice musical interludes, and as the credits rolled I was very pleased with the whole thing. But then ... Viggo Mortensen's name pops up. I've probably spent a week of my life rewatching the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but not for a second of this movie's 2+ hours did it occur to me this chunky lead actor was the very same guy who played Aragorn.Overall: Hits all the right notes.P.s.

Did the Filmmakers take a Short-Cut in Telling this Story?,"This film has some entertaining moments. It touched upon some important points, and the overall tone is fairly light. The production design and music are both outstanding in this film.Here's what is disappointing: it seems that the Director and writers did not do due dilligence to make sure it would be a fairly accurate representation of Don Shirley. Recently, there have been complaints issued by several members of Shirley's family. They were not contacted for their contribution or their approval. Because Shirley was a private man, there are certain unknowns about his relationships. To go further, there seems to be strikingly different views on the relationship between Don Shirley and Tony ""Lip"" --- was their bond of friendship genuine, as the film presents? Or did this film take measures to pump-up-the-volume, to serve it's own interests? Others viewers might ask: why would a director or writer proceed with a project without making sincere efforts to communicate with surviving members of Shirley's family?Lovely cast, although Mortensen (an outstanding actor) gave a over-the-top (sometimes cartoonish) delivery of a Bronx tough-guy with a soft heart. Mahershala (another very apt actor) was fully committed, but after seeing an online video of the ""REAL Don Shirley"", I have to wonder if Ali researched the persona of Shirley. The actor recently offered an apology to Shirley's family members, but if this project had been vetted out, some of these mishaps could have been avoided.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Rating: A+,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Living in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!With the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.However, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.Nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.Ali doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.Technically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.Finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.Green Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Green Book (2018),"Well its hard to ignore that this looked like Driving Miss Daisy with the races of the characters reversed. It was also hard to ignore that Peter Farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films. While Green Book does have a ton of humor it was definitely a step in a different direction and a true story to adapt at that. I'm amazed at how much I liked this film. Every minute of this film is thoroughly enjoyable and it touches on every emotion.The film is about a loud mouth Italian American named Tony Lip who gets a job driving and being protection for a jazz pianist named Don Shirley. Initially, it is seen that the two come from different worlds and are at odds with each other but as time goes on and the two realize how different race relations are in the south, they begin to bond and become closer than they expected they would. Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in the title roles.The film has a lot of laugh out loud moments. Especially through the eccentric nature of both leads. Whether its Tony's hard headed but uncultured nature or Don's particularities , the chemistry between the two is really off the charts. The film touches on many important concepts that still reverberate today, mainly in race relations and acceptance of sexuality. Farrelly and the real life son of Tony Lip do such a fine job writing a film that knows when to be funny and when to be serious.I think the performances from both leads is also fantastic. We are about done with the year and I don't really care what other people say this should be getting nominations is a few categories at the Academy Awards. Was really surprised at how good this film was, as the trailers don't really show off the true excellence that this film was capable of.

Feature is fim is dead. Long live feature film.,"I sometimes share my take on films and TV shows here when they either give me a bad case of cinematic tourista or send me into deliriums of admiration. Other than film school, I haven't spent so much time during these lockdowns exploring the moviesphere and discovering a glittering gem here and there or something you'd scrape off the bottom of your shoe. I've also revisited favourites and discovered that a Breaking Bad, say, is just as good the 16th time around. Netflix has become my movie feeding trough.A few years ago, when features devolved into an insipid soup of cookiecutter plots featuring two-dimensional superheroes bouncing off skyscrapers and irritating, ugly AF villains, I did my own cancel culture on Hollywood. I refused to go to the cinema. I decided my days as a film fan boy were over. I'd stick to my collection of DVDs and was none the happier. Then HBO happened. Deadwood happened. Six Feet Under happened. And there was The Sopranos. Nothing before or after has satisfied my gluttonous hunger for good stories. I dug a deep hole in the cultural desert and buried feature film. It was dead to me.I will also skip films that give off that woke vibe. These days, one cannot help but dibble-dabble in the political muck, even in a film review. There's a pervasive foul odour in the zeitgeist. An insane head-first dive into societal woes that has put a sharp focus on certain issues, telling us they're systemic. I suppose that's why so many visible minorities want to immigrate here. Of course, there will always be the few dunderheads of this good Earth who think they're superior to certain groups not in their gene pool. These people are human aberrations. They do not represent the vast majority. This obsession with race and identity has become intolerable for me. It divides. Segregates us into tribes and parachutes us back fifty years when these problems were real. It creates an atmosphere of distrust and hate that sometimes (too often) manifests itself in horrible acts of violence.The well-meaning but feeble-minded munchkins of La La Land had made it clear moving forward. You can only qualify for an Oscar nomination if your project includes any of a number of diversity points. D. I. E.: Diversity, Inclusion, Equity. Words that represent everything good in our society and tell me instantly what I should avoid. I refuse to be made to feel guilty for the lack of melanin in my skin and the sins of our fathers. It wouldn't have sparked a single synapse in my brain just a few short years ago and I will not succumb to what is the real contagion among us.As I scrolled through the Netflix thumbnails wondering if I was going to watch Fargo the series for the 30th time, I stopped on a new release. ""Oh, here we go."" Another virtue signalling whack to the back of my head. I was just about to click the next button when I hesitated. ""Wait a sec. Didn't this thing win a bunch of Oscars?"" I pondered the poster of a stuck-up black dude sitting in the back of a '62 limo with a white chauffeur who looked like he fell off the FBI's Most Wanted list. What was it going to be? The Babysitter Redux (purely as an academic study of film structure) or Driving Mister Daisy?What the hell. I love Viggo Mortensen, so Toilet Training Day it was, with my finger strategically on the stop button.Fifteen minutes later, I was laughing and choking up at what I was experiencing. I haven't been this taken by a film from fade-in to fade-out since Silver Linings Playbook. Dare I say, Casablanca?An old film associate of mine sprung one on me when I was struggling with a screenplay. ""Pull the Italian card when it doubt."" Sorry. It never gets old. Penned by Nick Vallelonga, son of the real-life Tony Lip, and directed by Something About Mary's Peter Farrelly, Green Book is the true story of a tough Copacabana bouncer and an accomplished black pianist who set off on a string of performances through the Deep South of the early 1960s. Complications ensue, y'all.And what is a Green Book? You'll find out soon enough. The revelation is one of the strongest thematic elements I've seen in a film. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this little book is worth an entire library.Everything about this movie is deliciously edible. Viggo Mortensen as Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga pulls off a Bronx goomba with his virtuoso grease ball portrayal and a surprising command of Italian dialect. He even scoffed up a Robert De Niro/Raging Bull beer belly for the role.Embodying an African-American NYC society bunny known for his talent on the ivory keys is the transcendent Mahershala Ali. No, he's not a pianist. A few months of practice and a stand-in sold it. Ali won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Green Book, after picking up the award in 2017 for Moonlight. I would have handed a Best Actor to Viggo, but thems the breaks in the fickle marshmallow world of Lotus Land.The story, dialogue and character arcs are perfect storms. And the cast is peppered with actual Vallelonga family members, adding to its realism and appeal.

Green Book was one of the best films of last year!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick.

The Oscars frontrunner that is equally funny and heartwarming. An outstanding biographical drama,"Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and is an Oscar contender for sure. That sentence is one that is still hard to fathom. That is because Peter Farrelly's previous credits as writer and director are for Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me,Myself & Irene, Shallow Hal and the awful Three Stooges and Dumb & Dumber sequel. He's a comedy writer. He has some great movies in that genre no doubt but this is such a huge leap in a biographical drama that is a commercial and critical success that it is a career turn that nobody seen coming. Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments in this movie and Farrelly will have been able to engineer those scenes to be as funny as they were. Nevertheless, this is still a huge achievement for the producer, director and writer and I hope he is acknowledged on the ultimate stage.It is hard to speak of the plot to this film in such a brief description. That is because throughout the entire movie you really get the feel that everything played out on screen did actually happen. There are several reasons for this but mainly it is because of the involvement of Nick Vallelonga as co-writer, the son of the real life Tony Vallelonga in the movie. You get the sense that his involvement really added an authenticity to the story and he was able to project his vision and history of his late father onto screen.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both excellent in this movie. The characters themselves are very entertaining but Mortensen in particular really brings the Italian-American bouncer to life and he adds a charm and humour to the movie. It is amazing how well he pulls off Tony Lip when you compare it to his other roles in The Lord of the Rings, The Road and his 2 previous Oscar nominations Captain Fantastic and Eastern Promises. It really is a brilliant performance and it's a shame that once again he is likely to fall just short this year in the Leading Actor category. Mahershala Ali just goes from strength to strength. With his Oscar win last year for Moonlight still in the rear view mirror he adds another string to his bow here and I am looking forward to his turn in True Detective Series 3 this year. The pair of them have great on screen chemistry together and you really connect with the journey that they go on as a viewer.I can't speak highly enough of this movie. It is a heartwarming tale of companionship and friendship at a time when circumstances prevented it culturally, socially and professionally. I would highly recommend this film and I think it has a real chance of winning Best Picture at the Oscars 2019. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A Charming and Well-Acted Film!,"Based on the lives Don Shirley (A Pianist) and and Tony Vallelonga (A Bouncer), 'Green Book' is a surprisingly pleasant effort by Writer-Director Peter Farrelly, who delivers his most sensitive film to date. Farrelly known for madcap comedies, takes a different route this time, and delivers a road-film, that explores friendship and racism, with heart.'Green Book' Synopsis: A working-class Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen in a showy performance) becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist (Mahershala Ali, mastering in subtlety) on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.'Green Book' works because this is a truly heartening story of diversely different people who formed a bond, despite their differences. And Farrelly, along-with Co-Writers Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son) and Brian Hayes Currie, makes sure the ride is memorable. Though the film does get monotonous at times and also feels about 15-minutes longer than should've been, 'Green Book' is a charming road-film, that is, in equal measure, humorous and serious.Tony and Don's relationship is nicely captured, as it begins from awkwardness to true friendship as the story progresses. The entire ark of its characters is well-done, like Tony's racial attitude towards Don initially and how their friendship forms, to Don realizing the power of being himself, deserves credit. Even the entire backdrop of Racism subjected toward Don, offers some hair-rising moments, that definitely leave you angered. The Writing, though imperfect, is well-aware of the times the story is set in (1960's) and presents a story that appears authentic, rather than frothy and artificial.Farrelly's Direction is competent. It's good to see the otherwise zany director, explore his subtler side here. Sean Porter's Cinematography is excellent. Patrick J. Don Vito's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper.Performance-Wise: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are in fine form, yet again. Viggo, nailing the Italian accent and gulping down food like a true foodie, has a blast playing Tony, and it shows in every frame. Ali, on the other-hand, portrays the subdued Don, with grace and restraint. And the on-screen camaraderie between the two, is infectious. Of the supporting cast, Linda Cardellini as Tony's Wife, is extraordinary.On the whole, 'Green Book' charms. Make time for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this","With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" with much focus on the recent changes.
Times were simpler back in 1989 when ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades' focus became less and less towards the story and more on ""How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?"".
Movie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.
As far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we'd expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for ""Eastern Promises"".
The Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Historical discrepancies,"Good film when you ignore the blinding historical discrepancies and the overarching white saviour trope.
Ali was the strongest actor of the bunch and sometimes you couldn't tell if he was in character or just fed up with the film itself and honestly, mood.
The soundtrack outside of the actual music was generic at best and outright annoying at worst, mainly towards the end of the film.
When their road trip is ending it kinda takes a weird tonal shift and starts to feel like a hallmark Christmas movie, I understand that it is Christmas within the timeline and they wanted a nice heartwarming ending but it felt forced.
The film tries hard to be a feel good movie but ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth, Had potential and would be better if it were in the hands of a black director and writers who actually consulted dr Shirley's family instead of just Tony's son.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

I really don't understand all the criticism 'Green Book' got when it won the Best Picture.,"I understand some got disappointed because they thought other movies were better, but saying that 'Green Book' does not 'deserve' Oscar was way to harsh. All the nominees are well deserved to win the award.This film deals with prejudice of all kinds, not just limited to the race but widened to economic status, ethnicity, last name, and even how one speaks. It raises many personal questions applicable to myself because it broadens the subjects. It's natural for people to judge and evaluate others they interact with, but out of all the factors that compose who they are, which criteria becomes prejudice, injustice, and illegality?The movie approaches 'discrimination' very differently from others. It's not black vs. White; rather, it's Don Shirley vs. World. The film delivers that the race issue is the problem of the whole structure and the society, but how someone deals with it can be individual. It portrays injustice and all-pervading discriminatory culture in the South so explicitly, but Shirley's reaction and solution are calmer, more complex, and more internal. He believes that playing his roles in the society the best he can gradually changes the world. Some people can argue that he does not stand up for what's right more vocally and strongly, but his way of overcoming discrimination is his individual choice. The police who stops the car for car repair is also an individual prejudged and situated in wrong system but making the right choice.Farrelly uses the space design very smart. The film maintains the horizontal image. The car is wide; the road is straight; and the bench and the bar are flat. Images signify that two protagonists stand on the same ground level. No difference in height, no superiority and inferiority based on outer appearances, accents, or academic background. I like the spatial placement in the scene where Shirley drinks at the balcony. He is separated from two colleagues and Tony as well right at the middle as if he does not belong anywhere. The height of his apartment is just right to display his loneliness, above the ground, the crowd, and the people, but not high enough to rule the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Undeniably Flawed Yet Sufficiently Entertaining,"Another example in the long list of films that provide an overly simplistic view of race relations in America, Green Book is a sincerely crafted & aptly narrated cross-country ride that's steered by some fresh bantering between its two leads but it is also outdated in its approach, and brings nothing new to the table.Set in the American South during the 1960s, the story follows an Italian-American bouncer who takes the job of driving & bodyguarding an African-American pianist on a musical tour through Southern states. The title refers to the travel guide that was in circulation for safe travel through the country's racial segregation.Directed by Peter Farrelly, the execution is pretty straightforward and though the film adds nothing to the race discussions, the friendship angle is treated with care & compassion and is allowed to develop gradually. The story is told through Tony Lip's viewpoint and is about the change the journey brings in his personality.Both Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali play their roles convincingly, especially the latter whose suave & sophisticated rendering of Don Shirley turns out to be one definite highlight of this film. But it's their clashing attitudes to life & ideals that gives this film its finest moments while their quips retain its playful quality throughout.On an overall scale, Green Book doesn't delve deep into the still prevalent racial situation in America but as a tale of friendship, growth & understanding, it does what it set out to do. A mostly lighthearted story that's driven home by splendid performances from Mortensen & Ali, Green Book is undeniably flawed but most viewers will still come out entertained & satisfied with what it has to offer.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
All roads head south,"Green Book is really an updated version of Driving Miss Daisy directed by Peter Farrelly.Based on true events and set in 1962. Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) is a mouthy nightclub bounce from the Bronx. He is out of a job as the nightclub is going through renovations.Tony has been recommended to be a driver and bodyguard to erudite black piano player Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali.)Dr Don is going on a pre Christmas tour of the deep south. Tony will drive him to the venues with the help of the Green Book, a guide book for black travellers. That will tell him the roads a black man can take, the motels a black man can stay in.The relationship between the two men is like the odd couple. Dr Don is fastidious. Tony is a slob and easily gets into fights, he is also a racist at first.Both men bond as they hit the road, experiencing constant discrimination.It is a well acted film with a regal turn from Ali. There is comedy and the film gets a little gloomier as it heads deeper to the south.The racism is anesthetized to make it palatable for modern audiences. In reality a black man being chauffeur driven by a white man in the deep south would had been odd and more dangerous.I did feel the film is a little too glib and superficial. It has an ending which is a little too neat.I doubt for a moment that even today, those backwood roads in the deep south are safe for some black travellers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

I almost didn't recognize my beloved Viggo, previously cemented as Aragorn in a classic trilogy. But his depiction of Tony Vallelonga in this movie is really memorable, he slides into the role with the same ease as he digs into a bowl of homemade pasta and meatballs. A worldly wisdom, a straightforward honesty, and a strong moral code of a man who grew up in rough streets. Swift with the blunt fists and the sharp words alike.Mahershala Ali as Shirley was also really well played, a man truly lost between worlds, belonging to none, with a blistering genius that only increases his isolation. One truly feels sorry for his self deprecating analysis as a puppet on strings, an erudite carnival showman, a bizarre exhibit surrounded by racism.The lovely message of this movie is the ability of these two men to learn from each other, to embrace each other's world views, and in the end to valiantly rise in friendship and mutual respect. We could all learn from their journey, especially to never underestimate the knowledge and wisdom we can share to become better people.As with any period piece I adored the authentic reproduction of a bygone 'simpler' age steeped in dark racism and hate. The nostalgia of the past is a dangerous thing when it whitewashes what really happened in sundown towns and plantations, even after the civil war. The Green Book is as insidious a piece of literature as Mein Kampf, born from the same cauldron of hate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Two Unlikeable People,"Viggo Mortenson is a bouncer at the Copacabana. He has made a connection to a mob boss by stealing his hat and returning it. This has also gotten the Copa closed for repairs for a couple of months, so after winning $50 for eating 26 hot dogs and hocking his watch, he takes a job driving Mahershala Ali on his concert tour through the Deep South. In 1962.The Green Book was a publication for anyone who had to travel through the Deep South under the necessity of being Black, issued for 30 years by Victor Green and successors. It's certainly mentioned and it plays its part in the book, but the movie is not about that. It's about a real bouncer, Tony 'Lipp' Vallelonga -- he later became the Copa's maitre d' -- and Don Shirley, the real classically trained pianist who pleased high-brow American audiences with his fusion music for decades. It's a movie about how two proud, isolated men connected and became friends. Two jerks.Given this movie was co-written by Vallelonga's son Nick, one would expect it to be admiring. Given that it was directed by Peter Farrelly, one would expect it to be full of stereotypes -- you know, the sort of people who actually existed back then, only not now, so we're supposed to pretend they never did? Tony is a goomba. Shirley is terrified. They're both jerks.Given that Farrelly is not interested in hiding the fact that his characters are jerks -- I know, we're supposed to say ""flawed"" or ""multi-dimensional"" or something to make us feel better -- this one will be admired, but shut out of actual awards. Because it's not about the Civil Rights movement. It's about how Nick Vallelonga's goomba father connected with a great piano player.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

No rising and falling action. Just captivative excellence all the way thorugh.,"I haven't seen a film like Green Book in quite some time. A film that doesn't have long-winded exposition followed by a dramatic resolution, but that is still satisfying the entire way through. I liken it to Forrest Gump in the sense that the captivation does not come from a place of waiting to see what comes next, but rather, it comes from being in that moment with the characters. Viggo Mortensen's performance was astonishing as a firmly rooted New Yorker. It certainly helped that Director Peter Farrelly pulled me into the 60s about thirty seconds into the opening scene.

Are you the sum total of your parts?,"Finally saw the Green Book and I understand why there are some dissenting opinions about its merits. My take is it is a solidly good picture, but it also doesn't quite hit the brilliant mark for me as well. Still, what tips the scale beyond being just solidly good is not on the artistry of the making but in the new angle of looking at racial inequality. It seems to suggest for some people, their prejudices based on skin color are more innately grounded and thus, creating almost absurd contradictions in social acceptancy. In short, a person is not quite the totality of his sum, but a collection of fragmented personas which are then treated differently and accordingly depending on the context of what he should be. This is what makes the film so uniquely interesting, this point of view. Viggo Mortensen whom I hardly recognized as the same actor who did Lord of the Rings, or The Road, or Captain Fantastic did a fantastic and transformative job with his character. As for Mahershala Ali, well, he was at least a class or two above in his abilities as an actor in True Detective. Based on this, I must hand it to the director of this show, Peter Farrelly.

You only win when you maintain your dignity!,"What a heartwarming movie! Throughout the film's runtime, I had a smile on my face. The quality of the smile changed from goofy to warm, but the smile almost never faded, barring a few scenes.
It's a lovely road movie with two opposite characters thrown into the mix. I must confess that I didn't have very high hopes for the movie. Somehow, the premise didn't feel all that fresh to me. Thankfully, the movie was developed and conceptualized quite well.
Mahershala Ali is phenomenal with his nuanced & sensitive portrayal of a great virtuoso & a sophisticated man of refined tastes. Viggo Mortensen inhabited his role so completely that it's difficult to believe that he's not an Italian!
The dialogue is superb. Here's a great one:

Mortensen and Ali shine in charming ride through the Deep South,"Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.
Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.
There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There's a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America.
It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.
That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.
In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

It takes a lot of courage to change the way people think,"A movie that I didn't expect to be excited about at first. A movie that hides a deep meaning behind its light irony. A movie that you can't stop watching, even though it's far from being the blockbuster you've been waiting for for years. It's all about Peter Farinelli's 'Green Book'.The plot follows the journey through the southern states of a talented black pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his bouncer driver, hired purely for this tour (Viggo Mortenesen). Short-sighted at first sight and a little bullheaded, Mortensen's character becomes a real friend, support and even a treasure trove of useful knowledge about life and society for the aesthete-pianist during this uncomplicated journey, and he himself draws from the 'boss' useful skills in the field of aesthetics, love of art and good upbringing.The plot is very simple, the movie is incredibly easy to watch. Dialogues are written ironically, absolutely not tedious, but at the same time they remain filled with meaning for the viewer. The relationship between the characters is the main motif of the movie. And how could so different people in all respects in a few weeks become each other's friends for life?I would like to point out that the leitmotif of 'racism', which at that time was still extremely prevalent in America, especially in the south, is incredibly subtly written. All these hotels for 'colored people', separate cafes, pools and even restrooms... the nuances of that time are shown perfectly in the film, and in such a way that you yourself become ashamed that such things existed. I literally wanted to stand up and punch the characters in the face myself in several scenes.Surprisingly, director Peter Farinelli has made mostly comedies before ( and mostly with his brother) and this is his first movie in the comedy-drama genre. From my point of view he did a great job and I would love to see what else he makes next, although I can't say I've singled him out as an interesting director before. Perhaps it was the fact that the film was directed by Peter Farenelli alone that contributed a lot to the 'nobility' of the picture in terms of humor.Fun fact that one of the screenwriters of the movie is Nick Vallelonga, his father was the prototype of the main character Frank (Tony Chatterton) Vallelonga. The script was written on the basis of dictaphone recordings, which were made by Nick Vallelonga. Later, Viggo Mortensen will learn to speak Italian from these recordings, as his character is Italian.The movie is shot in the spirit of the 60's, very well shown beautiful cars of that time, the art of costume, receptions in the big houses of the rich public (immediately remember some 'Gone with the Wind').This movie is simple, kind, sincere. Without some kind of a tear, without life horrors, you know, where someone dies, someone is killed or someone is in jail. The atmosphere of the movie is 'soft' and light. You literally find yourself in this time, with stunning cars of all colors of the rainbow, men in impeccable day suits of all colors, gentlemen with whiskey at the bar in hotels, listening to a brilliant pianist.'Green Book' is not a picture about slavery, racism and humiliation, although it does touch on these themes. 'Green Book' is a movie about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual assistance between people. The movie is about the fact that it is very hard to change the hardened thinking of society alone, even if you are brilliant and famous.It is a must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Green Book review,"The friendship between two men from very different backgrounds is the subject of the movie ""Green Book."" Dr. Shirley is a well-known pianist, scholar, and member of high society. The neighborhood club's bouncer, Tony, is an obnoxious, nasty man who also serves as the musician's driver. Each of the men discovers something to learn from the other during their shared stay. A deep friendship is depicted in the movie, and the issue of racism is also taken into consideration. The fact that this Academy Award-winning Hollywood movie is based on a true story adds to its allure.A lot of different emotions are brought up in the movie Green Book. The broadest range of feelings. The storyline explores the 1960s topic of racism, which is still relevant today. Problems with skin color are just one aspect of it; the opinions of society are also affected.The movie seems to have a great plot, but in this case, the focus is on the characters rather than the plot. They are both performed by equally outstanding performers, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, and are immensely endearing and brilliantly written. They make a fantastic team that evolves, is entertaining to watch, has chemistry, and is vivacious.Because of how coolly that era's America is depicted in the movie and how heavily that spirit permeates everything, the atmosphere is likewise incredibly atmospheric. This is also a really high-quality road movie; viewing it makes you feel like you're traveling the country, and there are lots of interesting sights and commonplace details.The image depicts the challenging times for American society when racial inequity came to an end. In the 1960s, the white majority of the American population already had a negative view of African Americans, not necessarily as slaves but also as complete members of society. Even if they were members of the same socioeconomic class, many places, especially in the south, forbade persons of various skin tones from using the same restroom or dining in the same establishment at the same time. When Don Shirley, a black jazz pianist, was organizing a performance tour in the rural south of the United States, Tony Chatterbox, an Italian-American club bouncer, was hired as his driver. The title of the movie is a reference to a special travel guidebook known as the ""Green Book"" that was written just for black people traveling around the nation at the time and listed the locations where they would be content to spend the night.In addition to the flawless performance, the film's abundance of concepts makes it both complex and simple to comprehend. At the same time, the movie has an extremely upbeat attitude about paying attention to different minor elements that are dispersed throughout the duration and occasionally appear in character actions, speech, story developments, and through insignificant items in the frame. The development or modification of the story itself is not significantly impacted by such cogs in the plot structure, but they unquestionably influence its relevance and every nuance in the director's work with the script. As was already noted, they evoke the idea of a lively, extensive, interconnected, and-most importantly-full history.Regarding the visual and aural aspects of the film, it is important to point out that cameraman Sean Porter and composer Chris Bowers worked together to create an incredible atmosphere of the magic of jazz music, flowing melodically not just from radio or taverns with concert halls, but from time itself, directly from the era from which the film works. The tape shares some similarities with legendary comedies and dramas from the late 20th century in terms of tone and presentation.It is safe to say that ""Green Book"" is the pinnacle of Peter Farelli's directorial vision and that it will undoubtedly go down in history as a modern classic that will endure for many, many years, if not forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Most Alright Picture of 2018,"""The Negro Motorist's Green Book"", which took its name from its publisher, one Victor Hugo Green, was guidebook published between the 1930s and 1960s. Its purpose was to help black travellers find hotels and restaurants that would accept them at a time when many such establishments, especially but not exclusively in the South, operated a colour bar. (It will probably come as a surprise to younger viewers to realise that, as recently as the sixties and seventies, the words ""negro"" and ""coloured"" were still regarded as perfectly respectful ways of referring to black people. Indeed, in some contexts they were regarded as more acceptable than the word ""black"" itself).The film tells the true story of a tour of the Midwest and Deep South undertaken by Don Shirley, an African-American musician, in 1962. Although he was classically trained, there was a widespread feeling at the time that classical music was ""white man's music"" and that the public would not accept a black classical pianist. His recording company therefore signed him as part of a jazz trio. The film is told from the perspective of Shirley's driver Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American New Yorker. Tony takes the job because he is temporarily unemployed from his normal work as a nightclub bouncer while the club is being renovated; the concert promoters anticipate that Don is likely to get into trouble with racist elements in the South and that Tony's skills as a bouncer will enable him to double up as Don's bodyguard.The plot of ""Green Book"" is essentially that of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in reverse; a working-class white man acts as chauffeur to an educated, well-to-do African-American employer. The relationship is initially a difficult one, although the differences between Don and Tony are dealt with in a largely comic way, reminiscent if the differences between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's differences in ""The Odd Couple"". The refined, fastidious Don takes exception to Tony's crude manners and to his standards of honesty, whereas Tony sees Don as a conceited snob. As the tour progresses, however, their relationship becomes a closer one. Tony comes to appreciate Don's skills as a pianist and his literacy, which comes in useful when Don assists Tony with his letters home to his wife Dolores.Things take a darker turn when the tour enters the South. Don innocently wanders into a whites-only bar in Kentucky and has to be rescued by Tony when he is threatened by a group of angry locals. Tony, whose views on race were previously not particularly liberal, begins to change his mind when he sees the depth of hostility and prejudice displayed by many Southern whites towards blacks. Things come to a head when Tony and Don arrive at their final venue, a country club in Birmingham, Alabama and the management, although happy to allow Don to perform for their guests, refuse to let him eat in their whites-only restaurant.The film has been praised- in my view rightly- for its acting, with Mahershala Ali, who plays Don Shirley, winning a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar and Viggo Mortensen (Tony) being nominated for Best Actor. Now I have no problem with the quality of Ali's acting, which was certainly deserving of an award, but the fact that Tony was clearly perceived as the main character suggests there was something odd about the focus of the movie. It suggests that this is a film about racism seen through a white man's eyes, even though black people were the main victims of that racism, and that Don has been relegated to the position of a supporting character in what should have been his own story.And Don's, I think, would have been the more interesting story. He is an affluent, educated black man whose lifestyle in the cultural milieu of New York has isolated him from the great majority of black Americans- he admits that he has little idea of how they live or of the problems they have to cope with- and yet who is not accepted as an equal by many white Americans. A complicating factor is that he is either gay or bisexual, thus making him a member of two different minorities at a time when prejudice against homosexuals was even more deeply rooted in American society than racial prejudice and was shared by both white and black Americans. Don's sexuality, however, is only mentioned in one single scene, when Tony has to bail Don out after he has been found in a compromising position with a white man in a YMCA bathhouse. During the rest of the film it is not referred to at all. By not pursuing Don's story further, I think that the film-makers missed an opportunity to make a deeper statement about racism and other types of prejudice than they actually did.This was, of course, the film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2018. I will wait until I have seen more of the possible contenders before I give my opinion as to which film should have won, but my views about this particular award were summed up for me in the words of the BBC's film critic Mark Kermode. He said that there is nothing wrong with ""Green Book"", that it is alright. They just don't hand out Academy Awards for ""Most Alright Picture"". 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Patronizing,"Just.....no.""Green Book"" is the kind of movie my mom likes, and trust me, that's not a compliment. It's for people who are willing to watch a movie about racism as long as the black character who's the victim of it is whiter than any of the white characters. It's for people who want to pat themselves on the back for being open to a ""serious"" movie that doesn't challenge a single belief or make them the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's for people who like music cues that tell them exactly what they're supposed to be feeling at every single moment. It's for people who think the answer to racial problems is for whites and blacks to compromise and find some middle ground where they can agree to overcome their differences, as if black people have any responsibility in the fact that they have been marginalized ever since the very first one set foot on American soil. No one who is the slightest bit tuned in to racial problems in contemporary America could possibly stomach this movie.Personally, I found it to be patronizing and damn near insulting. It consists of scene after scene of our black protagonist getting himself in trouble, only to be saved from the situation by the white guy. By the end, the white guy has taught him how to be more black and embrace his own culture, which in this movie is defined by liking fried chicken, listening to Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, and playing some funky piano. Oh but wait, defenders will say. The white guy learns something too, like how to be less racist and how to write really good love letters to his wife. In fact, the entire guys' racist family learns to not be racist by the end and welcomes the black guy to their Christmas dinner. They're just casually racist, you see, but not racist in ways that really matter. Barf.Seriously, this is the Sesame Street version of racism. In a year that gave us ""BlackkKlansman,"" ""Blindspotting,"" ""The Hate U Give,"" and ""Sorry to Bother You,"" all movies made by minorities about the black experience in America, it's pretty telling of where we are as culture right now that the race movie mainstream America glommed on to was this piece of feel-good hoo-hah. Mainstream America doesn't want to have its beliefs challenged, and it certainly doesn't want to be told it's part of the problem. Instead, it wants a hallmark movie that makes it feel good about itself.One thing saves ""Green Book"" from being an utter waste of time, and that is the performance of Viggo Mortensen.Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Throw in cultural differences, class clashes, homophobia, it's a melting pot of issues. Sometimes played for laughs with the racism matter of fact, sometimes not, with blood drawn. Prejudices take many forms. The balm that eases tensions, teaches respect... music. As Viggo Mortensen's character says ""It's a complicated world"", but watching him and Mahershala Ali, learn from each other as they travel the deep south really is pretty wonderful.

"Is it revolutionary? No. Is it bad? Certainly not. Is it funny? Oh, yes.","Preface to this review before I get to the art itself: This movie is problematic in more ways than one. Not only does it act as though it solves racism by the end (by simply suggesting that people not be racist), it also uses the concept of the white savior (an ideal that everyone should research), which is definitely a move that should be disposed of. If you're willing to ignore that idealism (although you shouldn't), there's more than a few redeeming qualities to this movie.Writing/Direction: Who would've thought that the guy who brought the world Dumb and Dumber could deliver such a deft touch? Peter Farrely (Farelly?) gives us a mushy feeling throughout the whole picture and lets us know he's got it under control. Given the fact that the two leads are in a car the whole time, I'm impressed. The writing, while claimed inaccurate by Don Shirley's family, is definitely impressive in that it uses humor in a well-timed way. I will admit that at the end, I did have a warm feeling inside.Performances: Mahershala Ali has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with so few performances; his performance as Don Shirley truly is the heart of the movie and succeeds as such. Viggo Mortensen is the lead actor and can hold his own as well, from eating an entire pizza uncut to going through an impressive body transformation to showing off his ability to once again master an accent. Viggo and Mahershala's chemistry just makes everything better, so thank you for that. Everyone else in the cast was just fine, they clearly knew the callibur of actors they were working alongside and let them do their thing.Other than that, it's a relatively basic movie. Yeah, there's some fancy music and some period-accurate production design, but it's just nothing special. That combined with the issues it has socially makes this an alright piece of filmmaking.Opinion: This did not deserve best picture.Green book is not revolutionary, nor is it entirely bad, but it certainly is funny through and through.

A Captivating Journey of Friendship and Understanding,"""Green Book"" is a remarkable film that embarks on a journey not only through the deep south of America but also through the complexities of human relationships and societal prejudices. Directed masterfully by Peter Farrelly, the movie is a blend of humor, drama, and a poignant exploration of racial dynamics in the 1960s.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver exceptional performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. Mortensen, as Tony Lip, embodies the rough-around-the-edges bouncer with a heart of gold, while Ali, portraying Dr. Don Shirley, brings an air of elegance and dignity, masking his character's inner struggles with societal constraints and loneliness.The chemistry between the two leads is the heartbeat of the film, evolving from mere employer-employee relationship to a genuine, deep-seated friendship. It's this evolving bond that forms the core of the narrative, making every shared laugh, disagreement, and moment of mutual support something special.The screenplay is another highlight, offering a balanced mix of humor and seriousness without delving into cliches. The film tactfully addresses issues of racism and segregation, without losing its warmth and charm. Its depiction of the era is both eye-opening and thought-provoking, offering a window into a not-so-distant past.What makes ""Green Book"" stand out is its ability to tackle serious issues while maintaining an uplifting tone. It's a story about breaking down barriers, understanding and valuing differences, and the power of human connection. This film doesn't just entertain; it enlightens and inspires.The direction, acting, script, and the incredible soundtrack all contribute to making ""Green Book"" a memorable film. Its message of love, respect, and friendship resonates long after the credits roll. This is a movie that deserves all the accolades it has received and is definitely worth a watch.In summary, ""Green Book"" is a beautifully crafted film that offers more than just entertainment. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in a world divided by differences. A solid 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Well written. Great casting. Extremely well performed. A slight liberal bias (but that's okay).,"Really enjoyed this film. Unfortunately it portrays everyone in the south as mouth-breathing racists and most people in the north as accepting and willing to grow, which is a lie but that is okay. I am from Chicago. I guarantee that I experienced racism in my city. However, I did experience racism more overtly in the deep south to the point of a coward spitting tobacco on my car when I was in a store. I was in the military at the time protecting this country, which speaks volumes.In my view, this film also fails to portray how the average African American would have likely viewed the lead with more disdain as an ""Uncle Tom."" They touch on this aspect very briefly during a scene involving a game of horseshoes. Other than that it appears that he is embraced and admired by other African Americans versus shunned for his mannerism and success. That said, no film will ever satisfy everyone 100 percent. Overall, I give the writers, actors, and directors a huge ""thumbs up"" for this film. Bravo! However, considering the character of the driver and his associates, I sometimes wonder if Italians get tired of seeing themselves portrayed as mobsters and hustlers.I applaud this film. It is a fresh, must needed reminder of reality. Too many people today seem to think this centuries old issue doesn't impact our lives anymore.I personally hold no grudge against anyone simply because of their ethnicity. I don't care what ""color"" you are. If your heart is in the right place that is all that matters. Although there are still many cowardly racists in this country, there are far more people of all ethnicities who oppose their ignorance.This film struck a good balance in broaching a very serious and emotional issue without being divisive. It shows the growth of some of the characters along the way.Last thought. This film included a scene for the sake of pushing a lifestyle agenda that I could have done without. I am simply tired of Hollywood injecting their personal views in virtually every film today. Even so-called news networks are nothing more than political propaganda machines. It would be nice if the industry would keep their personal viewpoints out of their business just like I do when I go to work each day.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Phenomenal tale of hope and empowerment,"Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are the heart and soul of this film. Along with the great cinematography and direction.

Lost in the no man's land between Spielberg/Disney and 'Midnight cowboy',"After seeing a thousand movies ""Green book"" feels a sympathetic road movie, but only comparing it with fantasy and scifi-trash that the film industry today consists of.

Personally the idea of selecting Viggo Mortensen to play italian is controversial choice when his aspect is not full-blooded: the same issue was when he played (jewish) Sigmund Freud a couple years ago.

Worlds/books collide,"It is difficult to make a movie based on a true story, with characters that existed, that has to walk a fine line when it comes to racism, the history of America and not making them too unlikeable, but also finding the middle, so there is still enough tension between the pair we are about to go on a journey with - and overall the movie succeeded.There are certainly things that did not work or might seem like an omission - Viggos character shows a despise, a darker shade to him at the beginning, that does not really seem to come up later. And then there is the meeting - which is cleverly orchastrated but we never really understand why it continues from there. But not everything needs to be explained.

Not only has the output of movies been great, but it also seems that the Academy heads this year have made a sensible selection; this movie having been included in the category for best film of the year. Academy accolades aside, this a truly remarkable film, especially coming from a director, Peter Farelly, who, so far, has specialised in the comedy genre.
This is a huge departure from his previous body of work and it shows that, given the right script and the right assemble of actors, he can be a huge game changer when it comes to telling heartwarming stories about flawed, but ultimately, good-hearted characters. Beautifully shot ( the production design is especially remarkable) , written and acted ( Viggo Mortensen surprises once again in one of his most nuanced performances to date and Marhershala Ali delivers another strong performance, in what it's turning out to be an outstanding acting career), this is truly one of the best movies l've seen this year, and unlike so many others Oscar winning movies, one that is destined to live long in the memory of its audience.

Good,"Putting two polar opposites in a car and sending them on a journey to tell a story of self-discovery and ending up with characters more understanding, less evil and less lonely sounds like a recipe for a decent a film that is undeniably ""Green Book"" by director Peter Farrelly.Tony Villalonga, Viggo Mortensen's character, is the typical New York Italian we know from a bunch of other movies - loud, simple, a bit of a gangster, inexperienced, caring for his family and the noisy community of relatives and friends. Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali's character, is a virtuoso pianist, educated, eccentric and sophisticated, well mannered, vulnerable and lonely inside. The two embark on a tour of the deep, racist American South in the early 1960s. Wealthy Southern planters would admire Shirley's music, but wouldn't let him through their front door. Police sheriffs will try to humiliate the companions, while Tony resorts to brute force and Shirley to a Tolstoyan style of non-resistance to evil with violence (Shirley studied music in Leningrad, hence the supposed familiarity with Russian classics).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

A two dimensional movie on American race relations,"This is a simple movie for simple minds. Its premise is a hackneyed plot device served up in cartoonish bite sized bits. The premise: A sophisticated man and a thug are thrown together by fate, and ultimately both learn from and are enriched by this relationship. And when you make one black and one white, and set it in the racist 1960's, the stage is set for the director to make a grandiose statement regarding race. On a sophomoric level, if only we took the time to know each other better we'd all get along better. But more insidiously - and the message Academy Awards voters responded to - that horrible, racial injustice is a thing of the past, and we can now all pat ourselves on the back with how much better things have become.
The problem is, for 2018 when the film was made, and for 2020 when the film is viewed, this saccharine re-writing of current history doesn't wash. Sorry 2018 Academy Awards voters, racism isn't something relegated to the past, from those bad old 60's, and Americans have no reason to pat themselves on the back with how much racial justice has improved since then. Given current events (2020), the movie's message seems even more unreal - and insipid - than when originally released.
The movie is a cartoon both in character development and in events. In an establishing scene the white character throws away some glasses simply because they were drunk from by black men. Yet moments later he is taking a job to work, drive and eat with a black man for an 8 week gig. In another preposterous scene, the black man is feted in a wealthy man's mansion, in fact he is the guest of honour, yet moments later he is forbidden from using the rest room and directed to an out-house visible from the window. As if.
The movie is a slog to sit through and scenes constructed to be hilarious - like eating fried chicken in the car - are inevitably excruciating to watch. There is little pay off for spending two hours of time watching this whitewash of a movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

I can feel the friendship between the two of them. Green Book has a fairly slow story plot. This is because each scene experiences the development of each character. The two main characters, Tony Lip and Don Shirley, give a sense of friendship and give each other lessons in interpreting their respective lives. Likewise, conflicts are packed with detail and are good. Unhurried in explaining and constructing the conflict. The conflict of problems presented was inseparable from the black social issues at that time. The conflict of such problems can be well described and can give its intended purpose. The dialogue given also does not give a patronizing impression in every problem. The dialogue presented feels that it has a deep meaning.I like the character development and story development that goes really well gradually.

a witty comedy drama of 1960s US race relations,"One of the most cliché-filled movies of 2018 is also one of the most endearing. Loaded with road film tropes and framed as a 'journey of two unmatched souls', Green Book (2018)is a male-centric essay on 1960s American racism that resonates today.Rough-neck Italian bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work at the same time that Black-American virtuoso pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) wants to hire a driver for a deep South tour. Tony's reputation precedes him, and Dr Shirley knows that the trip will encounter the sort of problems that a man like Tony can handle. Their first meeting is a parody of cultural difference: the haughty high-brow coloured man in a flowing African robe seated on a throne, meets an uncouth, uneducated, and racist Italian whose belligerence promises safety.On-screen text provides city and state milestones for the trip, and the deeper south they drive, the more racial hostility they find. Along the way, Tony's lack of culture slowly responds to the sensitive aesthetic of the acclaimed pianist, while Dr Shirley's arrogance is softened by Tony's connection with what matters to ordinary people (like fried chicken and the music of Little Richard). The Green Book in the film's title actually existed and listed safe accommodation for Black American travellers. They are modest rooms compared with those the Carnegie Hall performer wants, but they are sanctuaries from racial vilification. At other times, the predictable scenarios of humiliation include being honoured for his playing while not being allowed to eat with white people or use their toilets.
The narrative arc is tied to the tour and remains low on dramatic tension or plot twists. This is not an action-rich film, rather it's a two-hander character study that unfolds incrementally through the insightful banter between polar opposite personalities. Tony's regular letters to his wife become a recurring motif of mutual support; they start out with monosyllabic banalities and progress into lyrical prose, coached by the literate musician. They begin to care for each other and, when the tour is over, both are unsurprisingly better people for the experience.The entire weight of this film rests on an intelligently humorous script and sensitive delivery by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. With authenticity and emotional nuance, they have synergy that is rare between males from opposites worlds. The meta-message in Green Booklies in the sad necessity that films like this still need to be made to highlight America's tensions with coloured and culturally different people. The echoes are deafening, with films like BlacKkKlansman(2018)and If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) joining the chorus.

Green Book drives along a smooth road with minimal narrative bumps.,"I'm going to start my review a little differently, addressing many criticisms about the racial issues that are ""glossed over"". Not every film has to be a harrowing depiction of segregation where characters are brutally harmed. Much like in Farrelly's case here, a lighter approach can still produce the same intentions and profound awareness without detracting from the main story itself. That is why I believe Green Book is a resounding success. The racial discrimination is an environmental factor that brings these two opposing personalities closer together, focusing on a story about friendship. Inspired by the true story of Don Shirley, an ingeniously talented pianist, hiring an Italian-American bouncer to be his driver and bodyguard as they tour the deep south. They use ""The Negro Motorist Green Book"" to find hospitality establishments that would accommodate African-American travellers.The beauty of this straight-forward plot is these two differing characters coming together during a heightened discriminatory phase within society. A white tough-talking brash bouncer who was born and raised in the family orientated Bronx borough, who's narrow point of view makes him a casual racist much like the rest of white Americans at the time, journeys with a black wealthy uptight lonely pianist for a couple of months. It is as formulaic as one would expect, and you know exactly how the film will conclude. Yet, the earnest friendship that blossoms between these two individuals, is something that unexpectedly enveloped me in pure joy. Shirley's acute diction and dignifying mannerisms allows Vallelonga to adopt these traits and make him a better human being. He starts to show compassion and understanding for Shirley, not just as a black employer but as a friend. Conversely Vallelonga provides company for Shirley who often succumbs to loneliness, and soon finds that he has found someone who understands him. Vallelonga's innocent naivety is the key that unlocks Shirley's door of solitude. It is a near-perfect depiction of professional companionship, a friendship I never knew I wanted until now.What enables these characters to bloom in the Louisiana sun is a surprisingly well-written screenplay that boasts humour and character development. The barrage of witty humour makes up for the lack of dramatic scenes, and actually allows us to connect with these typically closed individuals. Through their banter we instantly start to identify specific characteristics that make them tick, for example Vallelonga has one heck of an appetite and does not stop talking. Meanwhile Shirley's uptight persona means he often lectures Vallelonga on morally correct life choices and attempting to improve his lexicon. The scene where they share a bucket of Kentucky fried chicken is a perfect illustration of two characters breaking each other down and forming a bond. The added attention to Vallelonga's hearty family (wait, was that Velma from 'Scooby-Doo'!?) makes that last scene even more palpable, leaving a profound emotion of pure happiness. However, none of the above could come to fruition if it wasn't for Mortensen and Ali's performances. They were outstanding. Ali in particular gave so much to his character without resorting to melodrama. Subtle touches, like sitting cross legged, asserted Shirley's mannerisms. Mortensen really came into his own here also, and felt a real natural chemistry between himself and Ali. Farrelly's direction, although nothing outstanding, was decent at ensuring the light-hearted tone was consistent throughout.Many have remarked that this is essentially 'Driving Miss Daisy' but with the races switched for its characters, which is a fair comment and a valid reason as to why it is a formulaic story. And sure some additional drama could've been included to, not necessarily enhance the awareness of racial issues, but the initial conflict between these two opposing characters. Still, it's a delicate film about understanding. Two individuals from opposite backgrounds (both in wealth and race) forming a beautiful friendship on the basis of mutual respect for one another. Plenty of smiles, laughs and general entertainment to be had. So sit back, relax and enjoy the long comfortable drive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

A Classic Film for the Ages - The Green Book,"This film is beautifully written and directed, and the performances of the two leading actors is impeccable. The movie richly deserved to be the Best Film of the Year at the Oscars. As far as I am concerned, it is one of the best films of all time with the issues of race relations. The movie does not hit you over the head in the vast majority of scenes, but is subtle and pervasive in its delivery of the agonies suffered by blacks in the early 60s in the United States. Tony Lip is not a stereotype, but a fair representation of a typical working-class Italian in the Bronx in the early 60s. And Dr. Shirley is anything but a stereotype of the black experience for that time period. I found the most profound scene in the film to be when the two had car trouble next to a field of black laborers, who only marveled at the sight of a black man being catered to by a white man. The Green Book was a directory of places to stay in the South for blacks before the Civil Rights Act became an accepted reality. Just the existence of such a book is obviously a travesty of our Constitution and the realities surrounding the South in the early 60s. I remember, quite vividly, hearing stories of my favorite baseball team, the New York Yankees, having to make separate accommodations for Elston Howard, the first black player on the Yankees in the 1950s, and even into the 1960s (Another film perhaps?). I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to get an inkling of the Black Experience in America.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

DRIVING DR. SHIRLEY,"Up against racially charged cinematic explosions at the Oscars, ""The Green Book"" took home the grand prize, and made Spike Lee attempt to flee the premises. The polarizing win makes for healthy debate and curiosity seekers should check this film out.This role reversal, buddy-buddy shtick flows mighty thick, but it actually happened. A good natured Italian thug is hired to drive a prim and proper black musician on a tour of the South. In 1962. Yup. A big-hearted, big-stomached Viggo Mortensen stumbles perfectly through his inevitable transformation from racist simpleton to enlightened simpleton, while Mahershala Ali's hard shell eventually softens enough to join in the Merry Christmassy ending.The cookie cutter script is baked just right, but anyone hoping for an edgier take on America's race relations best look elsewhere. Where ""The Green Book"" shines is in the background details - the sets, the cars, the hotels, Little Richard on the radio. This is 1962 America.It may not have been the game changer folks craved to see groping golden statuettes on Oscar's night, but Mortensen and Ali made it come to life, and that's why the ""The Green Book"" succeeds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A wonderful Film Guarenteed to Build Empathy,"I just enjoyed a preview screening of ""Green Book,"" a heartwarming family film scheduled to release over the Thanksgiving holiday. Green Book is based on a true story about a black concert pianist (played by Mahershala Ali) who tours the American Deep South in the early 1960's, and takes along a rough-and-tumble Italian bar bouncer as his driver/fixer (played by Viggo Mortensen). The driver begins the tour as a northern racist who takes the eight week assignment because he needs quick cash, while the pianist starts the tour as a lonely and pompous prick unable to fully navigate the white world where his music is highly valued, and equally uncomfortable in black-America. Through the film we see the two characters find each other and themselves as they subtly bond, and we feel the connection as a real friendship blossoms. The title of the film comes from a once essential tour book that listed hotels and other businesses willing to serve black customers, in an era when American blacks were legally equal to whites but discrimination remained grossly overt. I was fortunate to see Green Book at Dartmouth College in a packed 237 seat theater with an audience that responded well to the drama and humor, and to the empathy developing on-screen. Green Book is a well-crafted PG-13 film that pulled excellent reviews in festival showings, and tells an important story in a touching way. The film shines a light on an ugly part of American history, and offers hope that by connecting with diverse characters and lives we can overcome our divisions. It's a wonderful story that perfectly fits our present times, and it needs to be shared.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
So overrated it hurts..,"I really can't believe this film won the Oscar for the best picture of the year.. it's almost disappointing.. yes sure it was a decent movie with good acting (Vigo was amazing, the other actor was just ok for me) but.. so many ""buts"", concerning the clichés, the thematology which was pretty much ""old"", the predictable plot and the main message about racism and accepting each other etc, which was presented in a rather shallow and simplified way.. it's a no from me",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
White savior narrative for simpletons,"The reviews are so telling. People watch this film as an excuse to perpetually ignore their own racist bias. White people and their self-absorbed white savior fantasies such as ""Green Book"" are the reason why black people of color feel so misrepresented in film and tv.Not only is the film highly offensive in the way Mr. Shirley is being guided by Mortensen's character, and how he dictates him how to find his roots to his culture back, which is just so wrong on so many levels, but it also makes the racist a literal hero, who is excused in such a rushed and inelegant fashion.He teaches Shirley how to eat chicken wings in what comes across as one of the most misguided and stereotypical colonial views of cultural identity. Of course the old white boomers in this world laugh their ass off when it comes to such badly written trite garbage, because it reinforces their black and white views.Its such a caricatural portrayal of a very one sided story, fabricated by three white writers (!) who didn't even ask Shirleys family for permission and creative direction. As such, the film can barely be considered progressive, faithful or even emotionally intelligent. Its as if three white-frat-dude-bros gave a presentation on how to fight racism. This aint it guys.Green Book is hilariously inadequate oscar bait made for the masses, a film that will go down as one of the most horrendous oscar winners and remind people in the future how award shows were dominated by ignorant white voters who didn't bother looking up the terms ""white savior narrative"", or who simply didn't care.I hope people on IMDb reach out of their cultural bubble and confront these films in a more critical manner, and not just watch films superficially while being fed with problematic narratives. The previous winner ""Moonlight"" made by an actual black director has a lower score than this, and it basically says everything we need to know about racial insensitivity on here.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Warm and human,"Martin Luther King's message that people should be judged not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character came one year too late to reach the folks encountered by black Jamaican jazz pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali, ""Hidden Figures""), in his 1962 concert tour of the segregated Deep South. In Peter Farrelly's (""Dumb and Dumber To"") warm and human comedy/drama Green Book, Shirley undertakes the journey together with Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Moretnsen, ""Captain Fantastic""), a night club bouncer who is known to his Italian mob pals in the Bronx as Tony ""Lip."" While Tony was hired to do the driving, his main job, unacknowledged though it may be, was to provide physical protection for Shirley from any unwanted encounters with the locals south of the Mason-Dixon Line.Inspired by a true story (isn't everything?) and co-written by Nick Vallelonga, the film's title refers to the ""Negro Motorist Green Book,"" a guide used for many years by black travelers looking for hotels and restaurants in the Deep South where they could feel safe from discrimination and physical harm. Needless to say, neither the hotels nor the restaurants have many stars in the latest Michelin guide. We are first introduced to Tony who is working at the legendary Copacabana, a mob-connected New York nightclub known for its ability to attract name entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr. When the Copa closes for renovations, Tony is open to an offer to become a driver for Doctor Shirley whose ostentatious living quarters above Carnegie Hall, to quote former U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, ""staggers the imagination and converts vanity to prayer.""Racism is not foreign to Tony's outlook on life as shown when he throws the glasses used to serve water to black workmen in the garbage. Even though the tour will take him away from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini, ""A Simple Favor"") and his two small children for eight weeks, Tony promises to write often but will need some assistance from his cultured employer. As two Cadillac's make their way along the highway, one containing The Don Shirley Trio's cellist Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov, ""A Picture with Yuki"") and bassist George (Mike Hatton, ""Vigilante Diaries""), and the other the reserved and tightly-wound Shirley in the back seat and the chatty, uninhibited driver in the front.Though the two have little in common, their witty interplay on the road expands Don's horizons as Tony provides samples of Little Richard, Chubby Checker and Aretha Franklin and, after much resistance, introduces him to the gourmet pleasures of Kentucky Fried Chicken (heaving their bones out of the window). Meanwhile, Don offers Tony some assistance with his grammar and teaches him about Orpheus and his demons, neither of which he needs to know to do his job. When they leave Pennsylvania and Ohio and head for Raleigh, Macon, Memphis, Little Rock, Baton Rouge, and Birmingham, however, things are no longer a laughing matter.The pair get their first dose of reality when they hit their first Green Book"" stop, the run-down Carver Courts Motel to which Tony offers the relevant comment that ""it looks like my ass."" While Don maintains his haughty above-the-battle demeanor, it soon becomes obvious that much of his persona hides a gnawing loneliness that becomes more evident as the two make progress on their journey. Encounters with the police and a confrontation with unfriendlies in a bar are just the tip of the iceberg and Don is forced to rely on Tony's considerable skills as a Bronx tough to get him through some physically threatening moments.The irony for Shirley is that he is a much sought-after artist who performs for wealthy white audiences but is prohibited from eating in the same restaurants, using the same bathrooms, or sleeping in the same hotel with those who pay good money to hear him play. Though the film suggests that these abominations are things of the past, we know better. During the performances, however, there is no black and white, no rich and poor, no coons or queers, only the exquisite power of the music which transcends hate and, at least for those few moments, reminds us of our common humanity and the fields of gold we all play in together. They are moments that can help us, as American poet Langston Hughes puts it, ""to shatter this darkness, to smash this night, to break this shadow into a thousand lights of sun, into a thousand whirling dreams of sun!""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"Hollywood 's answer to France's ""The Intouchables""","The first thing that struck me on watching the movie unfold is how much it follows the structure of France's 2011 buddy flick, The Intouchables. It has all the exact beats: two people from different backgrounds bonding with each over the course of a few months as they learn to mutually change each other's perspective for the better. However, the filmmakers were able to add several other touches to make it stand out as its own unique thing.The movie takes place in 1960s America, still a bit rife with racial tensions. However, the film intends primarily to entertain and delight the audience, so while they do touch upon very significantly on the plight of minorities , the message is conveyed in a way so as to not shock the viewers but rather as a gentle reminder of our torrid history. So overall, this movie is pretty safe to watch and enjoy for any demographic and age. Every member of the family will have a hearty time in the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Made for tv film wins oscar based on race in america,"I like to think the Oscar's are based on quality of content, but for many years I feel politics has influenced this award.

So we have had years where gays won, african americans have won, all seeming to follow years where there was a big deal made by the acting community. Me I am a mindset of I don't care if you are black white purple gay or prefer the company of chickens. That being said I haven't seen all the films nominated for the Oscar's in 2019 but did see roma, Roma was an exceptional film made by a master filmmaker in the style of another master filmmaker. This was a made for tv movie made by the man who gave us dumb and dumber. Don't get me wrong kingpin and Mary are exceptional comedies. But this is not a great filmmaker making a great film. This is an ok director making an ok movie.

"Politically correct and stereotypical look at racism. Not worthy of best picture oscar, yet still an enjoyable feel good movie, with good acting and funny jokes.","The good: this movie has got a charm about it that is undeniably very enjoyable and upbeat, which I quite enjoyed watching. It has a soft outlook on racism without any harsh images of violence, therefore it is suited to be watched by young children as well. Great acting performance by Viggo Mortenson, who really stole the show as an Italian-American bouncer, who first used to hate black people, but learns to like them pretty quickly, when his new boss is black and pays him extraordinary well.The bad: I must admit I almost fell asleep midway this movie, because the story was purposely made to be so incredibly politically correct, that I got bored beyond belief. The african-american musician is constantly victorious and superior from the very start. The Italian bouncer is portrayed as being completely stupid and racist and ofcourse he will stay stupid, but he overcomes his racism, when his boss pays him extraoridinary well. Both very one dimensional portraits, which become quite boring after a while.Certainly nothing worthy of a best picture oscar, nor of best supporting actor, but it ofcourse DID win both oscars anyway, because this movie offended nobody and was therefore the perfect example of politically correct thinking, which is what Hollywood really loves, because confirming what everybody else is thinking, (or ought to be thinking), is good for the box office and good for the public image, but it will never produce an intelligent, true to life story about racism.

So where IS the book?,"The premise of Green Book certainly is intriguing, but this film adaptation of an alleged real life story is as bland as can be. While the acting is good overall, the direction is perfunctory at best - Peter Farrelly's approach seems both heavy-handed and simplistic - and the writing is embarrassingly self-conscious. It doesn't help that the screenplay favors the less interesting of the two lead characters, but then of course it was written by that person's son, whose viewpoint would inevitably be skewed. It would really have been nice to learn more about Don Shirley, an impressive and unique individual. AND more about the actual Green Book, which gets barely a mention in the narrative despite the impression the film's title gives that it's an important element of the story.What we get instead feels like a by-the-numbers exercise, designed to make a potentially thorny subject palatable and enjoyable for the - should I say it? Yes I should - white mainstream audience. It's mildly thought-provoking in a few spots and mildly entertaining in a few others, but it contains virtually no surprises of any kind, and it ultimately doesn't illuminate much.

Incredibly well acted comedy/drama that touches on the complexity of institutional and cultural discrimination.,"So I saw Green Book at the theater. Of course I was excited to see the movie based upon the incredible cast. I'm always hesitant around Oscar season because it seems there is normally at least one film that gets far more praise than it deserves. I'm happy to say Green Book was certainly not that film. It all around was a great film that covers a wide variety of complex issues while providing a crowd-pleasing experience for all.The premise of the movie follows the true story of the talented and stoic musician Doc Shirley and his talkative blue-collar driver/ bodyguard Tony Lip as they go on a music tour of the Deep South. Both men are presented to be polar opposites and hold false perceptions towards each other. Of course along the way the two men realize the perceived differences between them are not so wide and a budding friendship blooms. The film covers a wide variety of topics related to social class, cultural norms, segregation, racism, substance abuse, and sexuality. The film manages to fit all these topics nicely into a well rounded and entertaining buddy comedy drama that will leave you smiling.Of course the film also acts as a backdrop to demonstrate the historical setting of the Jim Crow South and race relations as a whole from that era. There are number of times throughout the film where they illustrate the harsh realities of discrimination and prejudice faced against black individuals due to racism. Of course the film also takes it's social commentary a step further by looking at class differences that exist between individuals and just how those also create different life chances and cultural norms.The film did capture a lot of the racial and ethnic tension felt from that era. Racism did not exist only in the south and the film illustrated that racial prejudice exists along many cultural avenues. The film asks questions about an individual's identity and just how much race plays into a person's concept of self. The film also demonstrates the harsh realities of stereotyping and just how all these cultural ideas are harmful particularly in regard to race.Of course what makes this movie really special is its acting. Mahershala Ali sure knows how to pick a role. He brought such a complexity to the character. You really felt for his struggle and pain as he dealt with issues regarding racism and his own identity. His range as an actor allowed him to convincingly play the role of a complex and compelling character.Viggo Mortensen was outstanding as expected. He has a way of transforming himself directly into the character. Not only did he put on quite a bit of weight for the role but he perfectly captured the mannerisms and colloquial manners of speech aswell. A less-talented actor could not have played the role and transformed the character into a likeable protagonist. I would not be surprised at all if both get nominated for Oscars for their performance. The movie it is worth watching entirely for their performances alone.Directing wise there was nothing wrong with the film. The film was very dialogue-driven, but again the performances by the actor's made the film quite entertaining. Despite its length I didn't see any issue with pacing and I really didn't have any issues with unnecessary plot points. The score of the film was also quite impressive.Now as far as negatives of the film there were a few points that could have been improved upon. Viggo Mortensen's character starts the film off with a display of his racial bias, but it never really goes anywhere. The film wants us to like its main character a little bit too much so we don't see the darker side of his prejudice. The film also had an opportunity to make more of a statement regarding the Jim Crow South. While it did have a number of examples of institutional and cultural discrimination, it only really scratched the surface of the racial tension of that era. Ultimately the film wanted to play more into the light-hearted comedy drama angle than a serious commentary on racial prejudice.I thoroughly enjoyed Green Book. It was easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2018. The film had an interesting and compelling story that was grounded in incredible acting and solid directing. There are multiple moments throughout the film that will leave you laughing and cheering at the buddy morality tale about friendship and compassion. The film did lose a few points for playing it safe in regard to racial tensions, but that just wasn't the movie it was trying to make. It's hard to fault a film when it wasn't trying to make a gritty serious drama. A 9.25 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

I loved this film,"This is my first review posted on IMDB however I feel compelled to write a review because I loved this film so much.
Warning to bigots: you may not enjoy this film. Thankfully we don't live in the 60's any more where the vast majority of people (mostly in the South) were staunch bigots, however unfortunately there are still enough bigots out there. That's why films like this are so important to make and watch. Granted, the bigots who should watch it the most won't, but the rest of us can enjoy our evolution as human beings.
My words may seem harsh, however the film confronts racism and bigotry in its ludicrous entirety. No need to get into the plot; that should be covered extensively by the plot synopsis. Suffice it to say the walls of race are broken down unexpectedly and the result is a beautiful display of humanity when things go right (that is to say when race is trumped by dignity).
The acting is superb. This film gets 9 out of 10 because I don't feel it's the best film I've ever seen, which I think should be reserved for a perfect 10, although it is damn close. There's a lot of great movies out there and this may not be the best of all time but is absolutely fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Cliché almost overcome by professionalism,"""Green Book"" is a sure fire crowd pleaser, but you probably knew that already.We've all seen this before: two people from totally different worlds meet, clash at first, learn to like each other, and realise they're not that different after all.

It's a lesson that used to be exclusively sold to preteen kids, but in the world of the new millennium, this stuff is considered acceptable to preach to adults and nobody gets offended at the condescension.But how bad is it, really?

Too much division in this country.,"I knew this would win the awards. People these days seem to want to produce and watch movies that help us to focus on the division in this country. I'm not sure what showing movies like this hopes to accomplish. I feel that everything is trying to get us to hate each other. I think it would be like showing the native Americans movies about the thing we did to them, the atrocities we committed. I know we need to keep from making mistakes again in the future, maybe that's what this is about. I would love to challenge Hollywood to make some movies that try to accomplish a sense of unity in this nation. I would love to see that. Somehow stop trying to divide us by race, religion or sexuality. Maybe stop us from focusing on what we don't have in common, and focus on what we do have in common. Just my thoughts.

A wonderful surprise,"This film starts with a modest story, adequately told in the trailer and plot summary. I went because it sounded interesting, but I wasn't excited about it. The film surpassed my expectations, and I left the theater feeling entertained, better informed about history, and with renewed faith in human nature. The film develops the friendship between the two men as it shows the society of the early 1960s in the North East, the Midwest, and the South. It also exposed me to some modern jazz I hadn't heard, and some traditional jazz from the South that I was familiar with. It reminded me of the richness of American music. The prejudice of their time was depicted in a realistic enough way to bring up anxiety over the fear that minorities faced. In their time racism was ubiquitous; today it is dormant, but the last two years have reminded us that it can rise again if we allow it to. The two men brought their own biases to their meeting and working together, but their humanity and basic good will allowed them to see each other as individuals, overcome their biases, and support one another more over the course of their tour. The issues they faced were at times deathly serious, but their ability to laugh at absurd situations kept the overall tone from becoming dark. In the end, the film seemed like a mixture of comedy, light tragedy, and road trip. I highly recommend the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Everyone Can Learn Something From Everyone,"I'm all for crowd pleasing movies. I'm the guy that loves The Intern, Eddie the Eagle, and this year's Instant Family. Green Book falls into a similar category to an extent, but it attempts to be a little more than it may have earned. The crux of Green Book is the bond and chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), and in this vein, it succeeds immensely. It's their back and forth that proves to be a powerful viewing experience in the theater. However, what the film tries to save about race, sexuality, & class feels very surface level and cliched. It works consistently but not to the point that other films have in recent years about similar subject matters. And perhaps it's not trying to be anything more than a crowd pleasing movie about friendships and criticisms like mine won't seem fair, but if it's going to be considered for best picture, then it should be brought up. In the end, it's about how everyone in the world has something to learn from somebody, no matter race, gender, nationality, or sexual preference.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Mortensen would probably give a better performanse as an amoeba than an Italian tough guy. And by the way, Italians are represented here as a Saturday Night Live version of the Sopranos... but really not funny. For a ""woke"" movie, they'll certainly offend the Italians.

I recommend watching Moonlight (2016) and this one, back to back, to fully appreciate Mahershala Ali's performance. He's truly versatile and has fully established himself as one of the best actors of this generation. Just compare his performance in Moonlight (2016) with this one and you'll see what I mean. The movie has lots of funny moments but also moments where you are moved. All around a great film that touches your heart, stimulates your brain and inspires you.

The Green Book is more then a guy version of Driving Miss Daisy. It's an engaging car ride of class difference and friendship,"Remember the Farrelly brothers? Yeah, that's a name I haven't heard in a little while. They were previously remembered to making a lot of farce comedies like Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and The Three Stooges. That makes it even more fascinating that one of them, Peter Farrelly is now directing a ""dramedy"" about race relations and friendship. The jarring shift in tone relates to the fact that the pair had been having trouble finding that same comedic fire from before. Movies like Hall Pass, The Three Stooges and Dumb and Dumber To were not hit movies with critics or at the box office. It makes sense that at least one of them would want to try something different.The good news is that even with a different kind of movie, it's still possible for a filmmaker to follow similar themes. In the case of Peter Farrelly, the main character is still a blue-collar man who goes on a journey. I think that's why he and his brother's movies before used to appeal to a mainstream audience; it was easier to relate to someone who was on a similar class level. So let's see what happens in Green Book, again a Farrelly production.In the early sixties, rough bouncer Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (played by Viggo Mortensen) is out of work when the nightclub he works at is closed for renovations. His experience leads him to be interviewed by a ""Doctor Don Shirley"". What Tony discovers is that Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali) is a musician who needs a driver to escort him for a concert tour in the Deep South. Though there is clear difference in class and race, Tony is hired based on his recommendation and that he would be a needed help within the segregated area.During the car ride, it's made clear that the two come from different worlds. Tony is unrefined, a slob and is proud of his rough Italian heritage while Don is classy, well educated and is proud of his classical training. Over time, Tony is impressed with Don's piano playing comparing him to Liberace and Don see's the humanity within Tony. The further they go south, the more Tony understands the unfair nature of segregation and Don is forced to see just how different his world is compared to African-Americans in the poorer areas. Though the two become friends, Tony is not only concerned he won't be home for his family on Christmas Eve, but that perhaps he'd been unfair in the past.I guess it shouldn't matter where Green Book came from; it may be one of my favorite movies of 2018. A lot of people might see it as that because it's addressing this issue. Truth to be told, that's not what this movies does well in. In fact, I see this movie as a class separation story that works thanks to its script and actors. The best movie I can connect this to is Driving Miss Daisy. That movie also addressed race relations in the Deep South, but was a story about friendship first. Green Book is also like that.The biggest difference is that along with two men, the plot has to two stuck in the car as they go to each town. Thankfully, the script allows for fun moments without seemingly too comedic. It's likely how the dialogue would have gone down with me if I was thrown into this situation. It's more natural then a lot of stories that probably would have skipped to the race relations' stuff.The winning combination is the two leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They both had challenging roles as they could have fallen into the stereotype trap. But thanks to a good script, both actors embrace their personas and make each of their characters more human by making them both susceptible to each others suggestions. This isn't a story where everything is changed, but that's also the idea. Its about tolerance rather then acceptance. Both are clear about each others differences, but still find ways to become friends. It's never boring and even leads into jokes that I found funnier then a lot of regular comedies. It's just a nice film overall.I'll give this ten pianos out of ten. I still have more award movies to watch, but I can see this playing over well during the holiday season. This is a kind of movie that isn't made too often, but need more of. Just movies that feel like pleasant conversations you'd have with any friend.

It's a beautiful story to begin with, but Viggo and Mahershala give other-worldly performances that elevate it to even greater heights. Visually the film was nice too, there weren't any magnificent set pieces or anything like that but there was an intimacy to the cinematography that I haven't noticed in many other films. I'm sure people will complain that it's a little fluffy, but it took on very sensitive subject matter head-on and did it in a way that forced the viewer to confront their own beliefs in the process.

"""That's how to break a peak"", Peter!","The best work of Peter Farrelly's career as a solo project after 24 years of sharing the director chair with his brother. And a reminder that Viggo Mortensen has never won an Oscar.
I mean... how on earth you people say that Green Book is a feel-good movie?! This is so dark and infuriating!Seriously though, despite its heavy themes, this movie is, surprisingly, supremely delightful to watch. Partly, thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, whose equally phenomenal performances prove that they are two of the most talented actors working today. But largely, thanks to Peter Farrelly's nifty direction. Not only has he shown maturity as a director, but Farrelly also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a dramatic movie, and hence more earnest tone and more serious subject matter, way more serious! If he sticks with this refreshing style of filmmaking, and collaborate with excellent screenwriters, such as the writers of the screenplay of this movie, I bet that he will be one of the most popular directors in the coming years. The way he handles his performers, or shots a comedic scene here were really out of the ordinary.The relatively deliberate pace couldn't have been more challenging for Peter Farrelly to stick with a particular tone, and find balance for this movie, but besides his palpable capability of doing so, the script, which he also co-wrote, offered sincere and genuine smart dialogues, and extremely likable reasonably fleshed-out characters, made this task way much more easier. Let alone the astonishing performances from the entire cast.The screenplay is what to blame, however, for these two points I took away from my rating for this movie.First, there is an action Mortensen's character, Tony Lip, take at the beginning of the movie that didn't add anything to the movie. This action also had some consequences that took some time. Adding insult to injury, this action, along with its consequences, was nothing but a cheap trick to make the viewers make a wrong judgment about the character.Secondly, there was an abrupt change of mind made by the same character that, however understandable it might be, I still found it hard to swallow.Thirdly, and most importantly, the illogically symmetric pattern of the storytelling; the plot keeps moving forward in a very unrealistic by making every phase in the movie seemingly predictable. It's safe to say that a movie with a fairly familiar themes like this one can easily suffer from such problem.That said, Green Book is undoubtedly one of the most 2018 movies that I've enjoyed watching. Peter Farrelly miraculously managed to make a movie that tackles such sore themes, a breezy crowd-pleaser.(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

This film hits me and my family history right at home!,"Green Book told a story that is simple and easy to understand, but in a larger scope it deals with serious issue. You don't always need to have a complicated or complex storyline to enjoy a good movie. While I'm not one that likes to see politics in movies much less talk about politics, however, this film approached the topic of race in a respectful and less obnoxious way. Many have said this remark before about the film, so I will continue it by saying it was well acted, well written, well told, overall great movie! Performances from both Viggo and Mahershala were profoundly enjoyable, envisioning real people that you almost wish you were able to meet in real life. The screenplay or writing for it was told once again with a lot of heart, but also found itself being a good personal, conversational script where you as an audience member can find yourself feeling like you could have a similar conversation with someone you know. One of the biggest aspects of this film that I found impactful was the key ethnic demographic as being an Italian-American myself, this all felt very familiar to me. On one side of my family, they experienced much of the same situations as portrayed in the film being an Italian-American family living in the 50's and 60's America where people were divided. Understanding that we are all the same, which are people trying to live their lives to the fullest regardless of the color of their skin.

The dichotomy of the American South in the 1960s.,"About equal parts comedy & drama that shows the budding friendship of a white man & a black man by seeing the Jim Crow South first hand. It deals with racism & prejudice by exploring a man's attempt to make it in the world when he isn't fully accepted by either community, asking how someone can be black but not ""black enough."" It shows how these two people from vastly different walks of life come to understand & care about the other while highlighting the dichotomy of the American South in the 1960s, where a black man could perform for a group of white people but couldn't eat in the same restaurant with them. The performances are phenomenal here with both Mahershala Ali & Viggo Mortensen completely selling the changing relationship in this situation.

A Whole Lot of Caricatures,"What is perhaps the most telling exchange in this ode to some mystical, post-racial looking back, boy to man story is that of the Kentucky fried chicken dialogue. When Tony consternates that he is ""more black"" than Don Shirley simply because he eats fried chicken and listens to Aretha Franklin, one can only pause at the absurdity of such an utterance from a presumed first generation Italian American to a African American man presumedly steeped in the 1950s Black Liberation movement. One would have expected Mr. Shirley to take a bat to the back of Tony's head with such a disparaged and, most certainly, historically inaccurate, depiction of American society pre-Civil Rights legislation, Pre-Voting Rights legislation, and at the cusp of a radical consciousness of Black identity still forming its sensibilities for the late-20th C. Placed in the context of American Southern apartheid, with a heap of hand waving by their Northern white countrymen, to suggest a white man of any ethnicity would gladly identify as more black than a African American man in the midst of one of the violent and consequential turning points in American history is not only ludicrous but offensive. The very script contradicts itself when later Tony assaults a police man in Alabama who assailed him with an epithet that for Mr. Shirley was par for the course. If this film is allegory of where we were a half century ago and all we have to look forward to now that we have freed ourselves from America's original sin, one can only contemplate how poorly we understand our own history and our inability to reckon with the utter failure of spirit that is American racism.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Simply delightful,"Literally just finished watching this movie and could not be happier.It is an incredible story about how two men from different backgrounds subtly and not-so-subtly effect each other and the men they are.Mortensen is at his best again. He is a phenomenal actor whose body of work is based on strong dramatic performances. This was one of the few times we have had the opportunity to witness him in a truly ""character"" role. His ability to perform captivates and entrances, and you often forget that it is Viggo. While he has steep competition against Malek for the Oscar, I think that Mortensen has the best chance to take it this year among possible nominees, aside from Malek.Ali's performance is nothing short of outstanding.

"Great Film, Goes beyond its period by alluding on continued discrimination around the world","A very strong contender for the Oscars, Green Book is a touching and eye-opening story about two men's unlikely friendship at the very unlikely time. On the surface it may be seen as remarkable struggle by an African-American pianist against racism in the deep South in 1962 as well as his friendship with a working-class white man. Thanks to tour de force performances by the two leads, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, director Farrelly avoids cliches on discrimination and instead provokes some universal hints on polarization, alienation and discrimination under the disguise of tolerance in modern times. As Don Shirley beautifully yet sadly talks about sense of belonging, Green Book makes me think about new versions of green book approach (i.e. adapted forms of discrimination) remains in the minds of people -- the US or elsewhere. By the same token, the world cannot be a better place until we all learn the value of coexistence and understanding as opposed to othering and polarizing. I really hope Ali and Mortensen get Oscar this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"""Genius is not enough; it takes Courage to change people's heart""","I watched this movie without any prior judgment. Though I've seen the ratings and hear the fuss around it. It released in India a week later then the American release but I know like me many could've missed it. I'm Glad, finally I got the time to see it and I want to write about it. So, this movie is inspired by the true story about friendship between Donald Shirley (Ali), an erudite African-American pianist and his white chauffer Tony (Viggo). First of all, I didn't know what ""GREEN BOOK"" is before I saw the movie. It is a book which is ""to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable"" because African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from their town. So, it is a journey between them and how they're able to accept each other throughout. It is a ""MUST SEE"" movie even though you were not sure about what it is like to have an African American in 1960s. I enjoyed many scenes specially when they enter Kentucky and enjoyed KFC though Don was reluctant at first because of hygiene. I can't reveal much and I don't want to because the movie shows the essence of humanity which is above color and discrimination. There're many heart wrenching scenes too and humor top notch.

Its very good film,"The story of the film lives in the sixties, in an era when racism was widespread between black people and white people. In the story, we see that a black person makes a white person a driver for him, while the driver faces a problem with black people. We see their journey together, and we see the types of racism and injustice that black people lived through. And its harm to them at that time. The film was one of the best films of 2018, not only because of the story, but in many aspects, including the acting performance, which was very wonderful and was able to make the feelings reach me. And the journey of our main character and the change that occurred in him after he saw racism and its harm and injustice to which black people are subjected. It was not only a story of struggle, but also an emotional story. The film had a goal and it achieved this goal in all aspects. They are all the same and not different and each person represents himself. The movie was really great. It made me smile at times and made me angry at times. A beautiful and moving story.

"Entertaining and reminiscent of the 1960's that I remember, sadly it was also a time for much bias","A perfect 10 for 10 ratingViggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali were destined to play the characters of the tough and gruff Italian night club bouncer Tony Lip, and the sophisticated African American classic pianist Dr. Donald Shirley respectively. Some road trip movies can drag on and on and leave their audiences minds' wandering as the constant babbling by the main characters over incidentals drags on. But this was not the case with this ""road trip"" film which in my humble opinion was deserving of the five (5) Academy Award nominations that this film received, and definitely deserving of the three (3) wins for Best Picture, Best Supporting actor (Mahershala Ali), and best original screenplay.Mrs. Shullivan and I did see Bohemian Rhapsody and I believe that Viggo Mortensen was robbed of the best actor award over Rami Malek's ho hum performance as Freddy Mercury. Maybe Bohemian Rhapsody should have won for best make up and hairstyling. Malek's fake portruding front teeth were over empha""sized"" and over exaggerated, and maybe the voters were paying more attention to the visuals rather than the content of the performances because Viggo nailed his performance as the tough Bronx chauffeur who loved food as much as he loved talking (thus the monogram Tony Lip) and living life.Green Book refers to today's version of an on line travel log, but back in the 1960's the real Green Book identified which Hotels/Motels would accept African Americans in the deep south for an over night stay and where they could eat their meals. The picture reflects the disparity between whites and blacks in the 1960's and we see how Tony Lip gradually becomes close friends with his black, gay, and sophisticated boss, Dr. Donald Shirley. There are some really sensitive yet touching and emotional scenes that are surely to become film classics. No spoilers, you need to watch the film and suck in all the great acting, music, and cinematography on your own.Mrs. Shullivan and I agreed that this film was definitely worthy of the Best Picture award and I hope to see this duo of Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali star in future films together as their portrayals were so natural that they fit together like the right and left shoes even with each foot having some different characteristics and flaws, they walked and talked as if they were one and the same.We were not bored at all through this road trip film and the only sad part was when the film was prompted with that subtle but effective ""THE END"".

Feel-good Oscar Bait,"So, I had to watch Green Book after it won Best Picture at the Oscars. I was weary of the movie even before I made plans to watch it. Why? The reactions of Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee at the Academy Awards were reason enough. Having seen the movie, I realised that this had ""Oscar Bait"" written all over it. But, I'll admit this. Green Book was a nice one. You get that heartwarming feel as the end credits roll. It's a bit too long though. They could have cut 15 minutes off of it and nothing would have changed.Coming to the performances: Mahershala stole the show. This was his movie all along. At least in Moonlight, there were the other kids and Naomie Harris. However, I wasn't onboard with Viggo Mortensen's Tony Lip. It was as if he prepared for the role by watching Scorsese films. His character seemed like an extra from The Sopranos. Linda Cardellini does a pretty good job as Tony Lip's wife - a role that could have used additional screen time.Overall, Green Book can best be described as a White Man's Wet Dream.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Good But Didn't Deserve The Best Picture Oscar,"Good screenplay, nice story, great performance by Mahershala Ali. But still I would say 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was more deserving to win the Best Picture award at the Oscars this year.

The Green Miles,"So, coming to this one late I have to say it makes me hate the Academy a little more. The fact that this won THE Oscar is nothing but pandering in an effort to make the Oscars seem less racist. Racial equality is tremendously important but by glorifying tripe like this nothing is actually accomplished.This is extra disappointing because our two leads give really great performances. You really feel Ali's passion and conflict as well as Mortensen's growth. The story is so dull though and it's been done, and done better. An unlikely pair are thrown together and through their journey they learn to see from the other's perspective. Yeah, that's great and all but throw something in there to spice it up and in the process be a little less obvious about things.This is all made worse when you realize a central part of this movie involves Mortensen's character teaching Ali's how to be black. ""Come on, you people love this stuff"" should not be such a frequently visited topic. Is this sort of thing that shows that the academy saw a piece about racial cooperation and jumped on it without bothering to actually pay attention to what they're watching. I mean, thank god Ali really becomes part of Mortensen's family in the end.This is a frustrating movie. It didn't deserve the big award because it's not a great movie but it does have very strong performances. I want to recommend it for the leading pair but this really has some skewed messages on things. It's worth the watch if your curious and can find it streaming.

Solid character building,"It is not easy to convince viewers to a newly established friendship in 2 hours. Green book is super entertaining and more than that it is a great character building movie. Character development is right on pace, not rushed or not boring. Every scene works for understanding each character and their relationship to each other. There isn't big speech or sacrificing, but you can feel the bond getting created between these two men. Great plot and very successful narrative.
Cinematography is pretty decent. From New York City and new yorkers to the beauty of the nature of south and southern lifestyle. Everything is needly put together.

Marvelous,"I've heard that many were unhappy with the fact that this film won the Oscars. On the contrary, I truly believe that this film deserve the Oscars. It was wonderfully made, from the script, the directing, and most of all, the acting.At the beginning of the film, I felt like there's nothing much going on in the film. However, as the film progressed, it kept getting better and better. This film is about mistreatments, friendship and learning to understand others from different point of view.At the heart of the film, we have two protagonists with nothing in common, Tony Lip, the crude driver and Dr. Donald Shirley, the African-American pianist, played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, respectively. These two are what moved the film. The two actors played their characters really well, and the chemistry between them is just simply fantastic to watch. I have heard many praises regarding Mahershala Ali's performance, and I was wondering what the fuss is all about. Watching him in this film, I finally understood why people love him. He was truly talented. Every subtle emotions he portrayed in the film are well conveyed, and I somehow felt related to him.Overall, I really enjoyed this film.

Driving Mr Shirley,"For my sins I had never heard of black musician Don Shirley before this film dramatisation of his purposeful 1962 tour of the southern states of America with his two accompanying white musicians. To drive him around the land of Jim Crow, Shirley hires a tough, barely literate but mob-connected Italian bouncer Tony Lip, late of New York's Copacabana Club, who is temporarily out of work when the famous night club closes for repairs and so is looking for work in the run-up to Christmas.What follows is a combination road-trip, buddy-buddy, civil rights revisionist feature which if it too often falls into cliche and sentimentalism, nonetheless delivers an upbeat, feel-good movie, as these two polar opposites, one impeccably spoken and dressed, the other guttural and slobbish unsurprisingly rub off on each other changing their perceptions of their own places in society and basically confirming the old truism that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.To be fair, I was almost counting off the stock situations Shirley would blithely walk into on the road, such as an encounter where he seems bemused at the sight of poor black sharecroppers working in the field, the inevitable injurious run-ins with racist Southern citizens in a bar, redneck Southern cops keen to put him down for being ""uppity"" with them and even the in-bred bigoted attitudes at the very night-spot he's been hired to play. Luckily Big Tony is on hand every time to rescue him with a mixture of brawn and bluff so that by the end, the ice-cool Shirley's reserve and distance duly breaks down and the hot-headed Bronx-bruiser has come to admire the bravery and musicianship of his passenger.Sure some of the situations seemed contrived, like the cultured Shirley letting his hair down with an R 'n' B group at a road-side bar or the Capra-corn-type Christmas scene at the end but there were compensatory scenes elsewhere like when Tony mis-remembers the title of one of his new boss's celebrated. albums or when the erudite Shirley helps Tony to write his letters home.I very much enjoyed the acting of the two leads and the authentic settings depicted of early 60's America and even if this story based on true events (at least according to the film's introductory titles) was a little too sugar-coated, I must admit I enjoyed the ride with these two larger than life characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Great movie: may seem predictable in its destination but it's the journey that matters,"1962. A bigoted Italian-American bouncer, Tony Lip, gets the job of driving Dr Don Shirley, renowned African-American pianist, on his tour across the mid-West and South. The two could not be more different.I did not have high expectations for this movie. I knew it would be good, but figured it wouldn't cover any new ground. Moreover, it seemed like a reverse Driving Miss Daisy (not that DMD is a bad movie - quite the opposite - but that it had been done before).I needn't have worried. The outcome is fairly predictable, but that doesn't matter: the getting there is original, interesting, engaging, thought-provoking and great.Director Peter Farrelly sets the scene well and paces the movie to perfection. The characters of Tony Lip and Don Shirley are well drawn and developed, making for high engagement levels. You can see their views and characters evolve before your eyes, see the events that shape them and how these influence their future actions. There's also a decent smattering of humour to aid the engagement.Some great social commentary too, especially on racial attitudes of the day and on tolerance in general.Mahershala Ali got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Don Shirley, and well deserved the award.

Before watching Green Book, I had no idea that it had won the Best Picture Oscar, but I have to admit that, for a rom-com, this is pretty good. Great story, feel-good ending which is not fake.

Tries to pull off a safe approach to a complicated issue (spoiler-free),"This was a good film and on an EMOTIONAL LEVEL I did enjoy it. The performances were amazing yet I loved Mortensen's one better (hard to believe he's Danish).The big problem about it though is that it tries to be too safe and kid-friendly. At times it really feels like it was written as a cristmas miracle story for kids to enjoy.It kind of wants be a serious story about the morale and the people of the time, but everyone besides the main duo are too cartoonish to be beliveable. It kind of brings up the issues of racial segregation but it's afraid to show real racist white people and the negatives from the other side. It shows hard working African Americans on the field to give contrast to the Doc (and to show later that he doesn't feel like he belongs to anyone, even his own people) but it falls into some sort of social justice commentary, when the whole point of capitalism was to give equal opportunities, so if the Doc was educated, worked hard and was paid well it doesn't mean he has to feel guilty before those hardworking farmers. The YMCA reveal scene was kind of made to show why Frank is called ""Tonly Lip"" but the set up was so unnecessary forced I can't really tell why they went for it in the first place. The ending was cartoonish and family friendly, which is ok, but it really goes on big stretches with some stuff, like the Doc wishing a Merry Christmas to his butler Amit, who's clearly far from being a christian, I mean... You see? It's clearly trying to hard not to offend anyone.I loved that movie, mostly for the duo, the dialogue and overall chemistry between them, great stuff. But the social commentary, the simplification, the idea behind making this a ""based on a true story"" movie... If they were real people - show us what they were, if not - make this a separate story ""inspired"" by real events.I just wish it was so much more grounded, I'd enjoy it much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A different kind of buddy flick,"Based on a true story of a piano virtuoso's concert tour of the deep south in the 60' America, Green Book presents an inspiring story of individuals who manage to soar above the racial tension and ugliness of the time.

A Step Above the Traditional Buddy Comedy,"This movie is a buddy comedy with some serious circumstances thrown in it. It has the typical story where two people from wildly different backgrounds are forced to be together and eventually overcome their differences to become lifelong friends. We've seen it so many times before that we know what is going to happen when we see the movie poster. In that sense, it is nothing new and nothing special. What I think puts this film a step above the rest is the acting. Specifically, Viggo Mortensen. I think he does a very nice job of playing the cliche endearing scumbag. He's funny but competent and that does a lot for the movie. Mahershala Ali also does a decent job but I don't think it's anything special. He does well with the limited range that the script allows. Since the film is centered almost entirely around them, it is entertaining and able to keep your attention. However, not all of the acting was good. The more the Italian family was in the film, the worse it got. It's just so uncomfortable watching such a cliche loud Italian family. Other transgressions that I think the film commits include Mortensen's character having contradictory views on race and the frequent contrived teaching points. These types of things are expected in this kind of movie but that doesn't make them any less diminishing. Overall, it is a decent film that almost overcomes it's genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
The Movie Equivalent to White Noise,"This has to be one of the most driest, stalest scripts I have ever seen put on screen. Saying that this film is underwhelming is an understatement.

All of these elements combing to make the most dullest, watered down films of the 2010s let alone 2018. The fact this won best picture was astounding, but this being an incredibly boring, insignificant film about racism its not too surprising the academy would pick this as the most ""important film of 2018"".I doubt this film will ever be talked about again other than ""what not to do with your script"".

"A brilliant movie, which will stand the test of time","Without a doubt the best film I've watched for a few years. So many themes packed in, which have been done before: discrimination, civil rights, dignity in the face of prejudice, opposites both improving by dint of spending time together, becoming friends in the end. Americana, the glorious 60s language of style, diners and V8 convertibles. However, in Green Book, it all comes together beautifully, with strong leads, humour and depth. At heart it's a buddy movie, but oh my - how it brings us back to a VERY different time. A dark time. A shameful time, even, for the country concerned. And let us take heart from the fact that times have changed, and that people have changed too. This is a gem of a time capsule, a velvety smooth look back to a different time, to characters who feel genuine and beautifully crafted to remind us how things were, but that we're all just people in the end. We look different, we think different, we like different things, and that is OK. It's a lovely film, made my eyes well up a few times, even. There are no false steps here, no loss of pace. It's a 10 out of 10 from me. Keep 'em coming, I say!It's interesting that a TV series I also really enjoyed recently (Loudermilk) is the same director.

A film with heart and 2 wonderful performances,"When the dust is settled on 2018, you can be rest assured that GREEN BOOK will be listed as one of my top films of the year.Yes, it's that good.""Based on a true story"", GREEN BOOK stars Viggo Mortenson (Aragon in the LOTR films) as ""Tony Lip"" a bouncer at the Copacabana in the early 1960's who is tapped by African American concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) to be his driver/escort/security on a tour of a very prejudicial Southern part of the United States in the early 1960's. Both Tony and Dr. Don look down their noses at the other one, but during the course of this film, the two develop mutual respect and a friendship that lasted until the both passed away in 2013.That is, in essence, the entire plot of this film. But it is not the destination, but rather, the journey that is the core of this film - and what a journey it is.We, the audience, probably spend 70% of the film in a car with the 2 stars of this film, so they better be interesting to look at and listen to (for nothing much else happens) and both characters - and both actors- are up to the task.Ali won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brief turn in Barry Jenkins MOONLIGHT - and he is even better here as Dr. Don Shirley, an elitist virtuoso piano player, with strong pride and hidden secrets of his own. Ali brings a humanity and vulnerability to this character that acts as a softening of the hard shell of this character that allows us, the audience, a glimpse into this character's heart. This person could easily have been a one-note caricature, but in Ali's hands, it is much, much more.The biggest surprise to me is two-time Oscar Nominee Mortenson as ""Tony Lip"". While the character starts as a typical early 1960's Italian-mob type, Mortenson brings humor, humanity and (yes) heart to a matter-of-fact character and continues to evolve the rough edges of Tony as Tony, himself, develops throughout the course of the film. I have always ""liked but not loved"" Mortenson, but, I LOVE HIM in this film and will be rooting for him come Oscars time.The other big surprise of this film is the strong, subtle and human way that Director Peter Farrelly brings events to the screen. Prior to this, Farrelly (along with his brother Bobby) Directed such over-the-top comedies as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and KINGPIN, so I was a bit concerned that the Direction would be over-the-top. But...it wasn't...and I wouldn't be surprised if Farelly's name is called when Oscar nominations are announced.I was charmed and moved by these characters - and this story - and was glad to spend 2 hours with them.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

One aloof and isolated, and the other a product of his environment. Both break their prejudices and become all the happier for it. It's a love story. Two very different men' whose conditioning you would think precludes it, develop a very special thing, a lifelong friendship. Yes, this just a movie, and yes, racism is sadly alive and well. But if this movie encourages just one person to look beyond skin colour and see the person, and love them, then it's been money well spent.

Decent. Really Good,I like the main actor here. I forget his name. The racism really shines through in this movie. I don't think the connection between the two men were strong enough.

Works largely because of the solid screenplay and the stellar performances of the leads! [+82%],"'Green Book' definitely plays to the strengths of its two magnificent leads Viggo Mortensen, who plays Tony Lip (a chauffeur who loves his family), and Mahershala Ali, who plays iconic pianist Don Shirley. The film is told majorly from the perspective of Tony, who at the beginning of the film is going through a troubled time after the club he works for, is closed under unforeseen circumstances. This is when he ends up taking a chauffeur-cum-bodyguard job for Shirley who's taking a tour of the South. The pianist makes his entry a good 15-20 minutes in, and by then, we already have an idea what kind of a person Tony is, and what his stand against people from other backgrounds is.The film builds the relationship between Shirley and Tony one scene at a time, and it does so, at an unhurried pace. Tony realizes how big of a talent Shirley really is, yet he observes Shirley subjecting himself to a tonne of atrocities coming his way by his contractors simply because he is a Jamaican-American. That being said, the film does make us ha-ha a fair bit as well when it's not busy trying to create a 'moment'. The scene where Tony introduces Shirley to Kentucky Fried Chicken is a laugh-riot!Shirley is safe in the hands of Mahershala Ali whose realistic shades make the character truly magnetic. Mortensen seems to have had a blast playing Tony and it shows. For a movie that has a legendary pianist at its core, the music (by Kris Bowers, additionally a recording by Shirley himself was used; Robert Plant also played a key role in recommending the kind of upbeat music that keeps the film musically rich) is pretty convincing. Ali does his bit to make us feel the effort put in by Shirley during each of his contractual performances.Linda Cardellini (who plays Tony's wife Dolores) and the rest of the cast provide ample support. Even if one feels that it employs the 'white savior' trope to an extent, the film, on a larger scale, is about how the Tony and Shirley play off each other during their casual conversations and the wonderfully brewing friendship between the two. The title, a reference to the motoring guide for the colored in the Southern part of the States from those trying times, is a subtle shade in itself. The motel-halts made by Tony and Shirley during their journey act as the playground for pivotal incidents that lead to strengthening the bond and levels of compassion between the trash-talking driver and the want-no-trouble pianist.Green Book makes you guffaw, shed a tear, and feel good at the end of it all - certainly worth the viewing! It will surely win you over with its earnest storytelling, outstanding performances, and the unconventional chemistry between its leads. Knowing when to be funny and serious, the film touches upon a number of concepts that require open discussion in the modern era. Peter Farrelly, known so far as the co-creator of several slapstick comedies (with his brother Bobby), strikes gold in his first solo directorial.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"A fine performance by Mortensen, but an underdeveloped script","Viggo Mortensen definitely gives a fine performance in this movie as Tony Vallelonga, a man who shares the racial prejudices of his Italian-American world but then learns to overcome them during the eight weeks that he drives gay Black piano player Don Shirley through the 1960s American South. It's a great role - as it should be, since the script was written by the real-life character's son, Nick Vallelonga. Granted, it's hard to imagine that a man who came from that much prejudice so easily overcomes homophobia - he's even willing to spend the night in the same bedroom with Shirley - but the script was clearly written to make Tony Vallelonga look good.Granted, it's a little hard to accept Mortensen physically at times, since the original Vallelonga ate astounding quantities of food - and was a very big guy as a result - but I guess there was no point in putting him in a fat suit.My problem with the movie, which I enjoyed, is that the script did not do a very good job of developing Don Shirley's character. Anyone who has seen *Midnight* knows that Mahershala Ali, the actor who plays him here, could have handled a complex character, but he isn't given a lot to work with. It's a shame, because it would have made for a more interesting movie.The whole movie is really the relationship between these two characters. The rest is all fine, but peripheral.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Massively enjoyable,"Marhershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are simply amazing in this film. The acting was spot on, Mortensen's ""Tony the Lip"" was wonderfully comedic as the foil to the intelligence of Ali's Don Shirley or the Doc as they called him. The pair worked together wonderfully well together and on screen it did look like a convincing pairing. The story is simple enough to follow, the majority light hearted and funny but also it deals with issues such as the racial injustice of the deep south at the time. The character of Don Shirley is complicated which Ali shows his depth to bring this character to screen. My wife and I were thoroughly entertained throughout the film. I seem some reviews that what to politicalise the film, it's just a film about two guys who form a friendship through difficult times and just enjoy it and learn from it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"music, friendship and prejudice","'Green Book' seems to have been designed according to a recipe for winning Academy Awards. The subject is historic but with reverberations in current politics and the approach is in tune with the mood at Hollywood. It addresses one of the painful topics of recent US history, but it does it in a sufficiently careful manner to get a rating that makes it accessible to audiences of almost any age. It has as a hero a musician and includes a lot of (good) music at a time when musical films are again enjoying great success. The cast includes a couple of well known actors who are given the opportunity to play consistent roles. Finally, the film is based on real life heroes and a true story. And yet, despite all these arguments, I do not think the 'Green Book' will be able to gather too many statuettes.The story of the friendship between the high-class musician and the driver he hired for a two-month tour of the Southeast US of the 1960s is unusual. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) was an exceptional musical personality, one of the virtuoso pianists of his generation, but he could not get recognition into the world of classical music because of his Jamaican origin. He played a brand of sophisticated jazz for rich audiences. Yet, the rich musician, accustomed to first class hotels, when in tournaments in the southern states, as a black singer, he was subjected to racial discrimination in the still partially segregated America. Don 'Lip' (Viggo Mortensen), the driver and bodyguard hired to accompany him on the trip is an Italian from the Bronx, not missing a dose of benign racism. A lot seems to separate them, but the differences in race, culture, social classes and personal tastes will be tested and will melt during this road trip together that allows the two to get to know each other and to learn each some lessons from the experience of the other.What I liked. The music. The authenticity of the details. The acting performances of the two lead actors, but also of many of the ones in supporting roles, including the non-professionals. The way in which the realities of the 1960s are brought to screen.What I liked less. The predictability of the script. I was several times in the situation of anticipating a few minutes in advance what was going to happen on screen. The director and co-screenwriter Peter Farrelly went too far to make of 'Green Book' a feel-good film to be enjoyed by the audiences and especially by the jury of the Academy. The result, even if it has the excuse of being inspired by a true story, is conventional and syrupy. I think this movie could have been much better if it did not try that hard to be a crowd-pleaser.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Driving Miss Daisy 2: In Reverse,"After ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990), ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Crash"" (2004) and, now, ""Green Book,"" I guess Hollywood is just going to continue patting themselves on the back for not being racists because they honor pictures where stupid white protagonists are taught to respect racial others as human beings. As opposed to the infamous failure to nominate a racially more challenging and sophisticated picture such as ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) for Best Picture the year ""Driving Miss Daisy"" won it, this time, they gave Spike Lee an Oscar, too, for ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), a film that I think has its own faults, but, at least, it's not simply a message picture of ""racism is bad, but look how far we've come"" for the dumb and dumber. And, at least, there's some cinematic flair to Lee's film, as opposed to this modest improvement upon a filmed play such as ""Driving Miss Daisy.""In quite a few ways, ""Green Book"" is a modest improvement upon ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in that it largely tells a similar story in a similar way without itself coming off as quite hypocritically racist. It's about the least one should expect after 30 years of cinematic and social changes--or lack thereof. In it, another white person who also faces some prejudices against them (in this case, for being an Italian American; in Miss Daisy's case, for being Jewish), and again from that white person's perspective, travels by car with an African American through the Jim Crow South. (Both movies even privilege their ""home"" turf, as it were, as not as racist as other places. In ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" Atlanta somehow came off as not nearly as segregated as Alabama, and in ""Green Book,"" the two are welcomed home to New York by a friendly police officer in contrast with the backwater cops they meet on the way to Birmingham.) They bond, and through their experiences with their black friend, the white protagonists stop being racist. But, this time, the white person is driving, and the black man sits in the backseat!To be fair, Mahershala Ali's Don Shirley is not entirely, or at least not atrociously as much so, the Magical Negro trope that Morgan Freeman's Hoke is in ""Driving Miss Daisy."" The historically-based character of Shirley has a life outside of helping the white protagonist with their character arc, which the movie addresses, if only almost entirely through the lens of the white protagonist and ultimately how it affects him. In a way, it's a traditional sidelong-glance biopic, where the life of the more interesting figure (Shirley) is seen through the point of view of a more common folk (Viggo Mortensen's Tony), as a surrogate for the spectator, for one assumes because that's how the storytellers see us spectators. Additionally, Shirley is not the white writer's fantasy of a subservient African American that is Hoke. Moreover, Miss Daisy's conversion is rather unconvincing, but ""Green Book"" leaves little doubt that Tony has transformed. Ali and Mortensen are good actors, too, which helps. Clearly, they were dedicated to their characters (most conspicuously by Mortensen gaining 45 pounds for the role).Nevertheless, a movie that's written and directed by and mostly made by white people, through the perspective of a white character, as a surrogate for an intended white audience, to feel good that they, too, have overcome historical racism doesn't really cut it as authentically anti-racist. This comforting, hand-holding seminar from a narrow view of a vast and historical problem, another whitewashed picture about prejudices against racial others won't transform anyone.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Social but personal,"Green Book is a crowd-pleaure and Oscar winner not because it deals with racial tensions in the segregated American recent past, but because it deals with two very human and humane characters who form an unlikely friendship in the midst of a lifechanging and life-affirming road trip. A hallmark of a great film and journey is that the audience or at least myself was left wanting more and deeply care for these characters based on real life people and events. I would have happily hopped on their next road trip to continue to share the intimate details of their endearing bond.The screenplay lead by real life Nick Vallelonga is absolutely absorbing and drips with laugh out loud humour and characterization from the two leads and also some of the supporting cast. Mortenson plays the role of his life and has all the maneurism, talk and conflicted emotions of his flawed and interesting character. Ali assures a stoic and unsympathetic complex personality who excels, perseveres and has is own proclivities. He won the supporting actor Oscar for this while Mortenson was nominated for best lead but was in tough company with Cooper and Malek who won. The screenplay also won best original and deservedly so. Editing was also nominated and the story could not have been really told in a much better way dramatically while hitting all the humour and emotional marks.In the end, although racism, classim, homophobia and other strong and important social subjects are dealt with extremely well, the strength of Green Book lies in its capacity to allow us to discover an average man and his family while changing his preconceived ideas and giving contrasts and thought to an accomplished and inspiring musical genius.

Viggo Mortensen is the ***STAR ***of this movie and the performance of Mahershala Ali is also excellent.

A Really Great Movie,"Wow, this movie had just about everything you could want, incredible story, brilliant acting, amazing cinematography and authentic sets dragging us back to the post war years.The story ran at two levels, the first being the clash of two worlds and the coming together in mutual respect, and dare I say it love, and enduring friendship. The second was allegorical, with Tony Lip representing the American consciousness of the time, fixed, opinionated, racist, white and masculine. Don Shirley represented a whole collection of threats to these societal attitudes and by undertaking a concert tour in the ""deep south"", consciously anticipated trouble. It was clear that Don in his own quiet way was doing his bit for the civil rights movement.Both leads were breathtaking in their attention to their craft, Mr Mortensen depth of characterisation was masterful, we all new Tony, we had all met a Tony and we all respected Tony who new his place and inadequacies but was not frightened of facing his demons. Mr Ali used micro gestures and method to convey a talented, fragile loner who we all just wanted to hug.If I had two Oscars to hand out I would give one to Mr Mortensen and one to Mr Ali.I would draw attention to one scene that was so powerful we writhed in our seats and some weak souls cried openly, not me!

"Uplifting, but an insult to Italian Americans","This movie was uplifting. It was based on the association/friendship between two men, but it is, for the most part, fiction.

It surprises me that Hollywood is so concerned about furthering the cause of the LGBT community, and about paying homage to the plight of African Americans in this country, yet they give the Academy Award to a film that portrays an Italian American man in the worst light. This film plays off a stereotype that insults the intelligence. This movie portrays Frank Anthony Vallelonga as a total idiot. That he wasn't. He was a very intelligent actor.

Simply beautiful.,"This is a story of 2 men from different backgrounds who go on a journey together both literally and metaphorically.
Yes, there is a racial element to it which you would expect from a story set partly in the American deep south at that time but this isn't a story about racism.
The white man is not the eloquent, educated man. Tony is a rough diamond. He is the best artist who ducks and dives to make ends meet. He's a family man who adores his wife and he is a man who stands by his word.
Don is a talented, articulate man who is alone in the world. He has made music his life.
The men form an unlikely friendship that had me laughing, tearful, but mostly smiling.
This movie has heart.
Don could have easily been a white man or Tony a black man. I say this to emphasise that this isn't a movie about black and white. It's about friendship.
Why did Don choose to tour the deep south when he could command more money elsewhere?
Some might say that he wanted to connect with his roots. I don't.
When the black men and women who were working in the field all stopped to stare at the impeccably dressed black man being chauffeured by a white man was the key. For me, it was showing other people of colour that they can achieve anything they want. They are no longer slaves to the white man. That's my take away from it.

"Green Book: Powerful Portrayal Of An Inspirational Journey Promoting Courage, Activism And Always Doing What's Right","Sometimes being alone means not being accepted. A fact that some have attempted to convey in the art of cinema, but only a few reach the precision and emotional strength of Green Book which shows not only the complex and dark social issues of the 1960s but also demonstrates the power and emotion of feeling truly alone.This movie contains a massively wide range of emotions. At times, the story is driven by love, romance and family. At other times, the characters live in racism, homophobia and segregation as it directly addresses and shows the darkness of the 60s in the United States. Yet still, the viewer will be surprised by the amount of humor and wonderfully vibrant moments that are portrayed. They will make you laugh in all the right places, without interrupting truly emotional moments.Taking place in the 1960s, Green Book follows the highly famous and incredibly successful pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who takes great risks as an African American man touring through the highly racial deep south. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) accompanies Shirley going from his driver to savior to eventually, his close friend. As the tour progresses, the audience goes through many parts of the south where not only racism was prevalent against African Americans and Italians, but also acknowledge the severe homophobia that existed so terribly in the 1960s.Perhaps one of the most lovable aspects of this movie can be attributed to the story itself. Every person in the film has a major character arc in which they become completely reshaped and remolded by the end. The entire cast performs with Oscar-worthy emotional portrayals of their characters. Mahershala once again delivers absolutely heart-wrenching scenes as the audience becomes acquainted with the lonesome and depressed life Don Shirley lives in, despite being unarguably talented and highly intelligent. The complexities in the set design, costume design, and overall tone of the entire world never run out of depth as the entire film feels as if it truly belongs in the 1960s, despite being shot nearly half a century later. Director Peter Farrelly may be seasoned in humoristic comedies, but makes sure his background stays separate for this film. With his lead, the audience experiences bitter reality and, with the help of cinematographer Sean Porter, view a vivid and colorful picture of United States in the 1960s, from up north in New York all the way to down south in Alabama.Cinema about musicians would be blasphemy without an impressive soundtrack to follow suit. From music considered modern and pop for that era, to classical pieces hundreds of years old, Green Book promises a highly wide and diverse soundtrack that highlights itself as one of the greatest this year. Furthermore, the music tells the story as it begins with 1960s music, but slowly goes more and more towards classical and orchestral as the story unfolds and the viewer learns more about the conflicts of pianist Don Shirley. Furthermore, despite being over two hours long, the film keeps you captivated for the entire runtime and leaves you satisfied with a natural and beautiful ending.Instead of a favorite scene, I would like to talk about several sequences present in the film. Since they're on tour, of course, Shirley and his fellow musicians in his trio are shown playing music. Yet, this varies in emotion, strength and passion as real-life events impact Don Shirley's craft just as the events impact his actual character. The power of his work never dwindles and always leaves you in awe. During the performance scenes, every aspect of the film shines with absolutely masterful cinematographic compositions that seem to isolate the musicians and truly captures the raw emotions such powerful music creates.Despite the beauty and power that hold true throughout this film, it does have things to concern parents. As previously stated, the film embraces the bitter and blunt reality of the 1960s, from homophobia to racism. This makes it most appropriate for ages 14 to 18, as well as adults. I absolutely give the film 5 out of 5 stars for its powerful portrayal of an inspirational journey that promotes courage, activism and always doing what's right in the world.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

TV Preview Does Not do this movie justice,"First, this is a great Christmas movie, but a little more on that latter.
Second, this is a buddy movie! One that consists of the two people who could not be more different.
Third, this is a VERY funny movie and there in lies its strength.
Sadly, the TV preview makes one think this is a movies of prejudice and discrimination the south in the 1960's. But it's about a white average Joe and a cultured black man. who help each other become more well rounded and better human beings overall.
It reminds us of the segregated south and it's evils (alas too much of which still remains) but it does it almost surreptitiously. It makes it personal, so we can understand it better.
However, without this aspect it would still be a good movie, but with it, it makes it great.
While the acting of the two leads could. not be better don't overlook the performance of Linda Cardellini.

Rocking!,"The Holidays often bring too many quality choices on our screens and all families have a hard time choosing a quality film to enjoy. As a mixed couple now in our 40's we got to check the Green Book and what a beautiful thing that was.The Director, Peter Farrelly, which is most known as one of the Farelly brothers that penned funny, yet on the offensive side of things, movies when I was coming of age, surprised me greatly here because of the engaging rhythm and subtle yet powerful approach he instilled in this particular work.It is a road trip movie, with tropes that we may expect but also with just the right amount of surprises, softness, power and explosive moments all audiences like to experience.In the political context we are living in, revisiting such a disgraceful period of the American history with such poise is actually remarkable. It could be the breath of the original story and characters we explore, it could be that we indeed learned from decades of subtle and not so subtle struggles, but this movie instead of being sanctimonious, dragging your spirit down or simply being boring gives you that elusive but so lovely feeling that the world can be right, can be funny, and certainly can still be surprising.There undoubtedly are recognizable steps found in most road trip movies present here, but the fact that you are limited spatially and morally by the external boundaries shaping the lives of the protagonists, your life, following theirs, expand in such a way that there is a real delicate pleasure found in undertaking this journey with actors portraying these imperfect characters with gusto and inspiration.The laughs are authentic, the music is a pure pleasure and the character development is genuine. It bears to talk for a moment about the beautiful recreations of the 1962 urban landscapes, the approach to costume design and the fabulous sets for the interior design giving depth to the story. It shows you how people lived and worked vividly, including how tight spaces were.It really is the kind of film you can enjoy by yourself, as a couple, with the whole family, and even your whole congregation. You would come out of it eager to take a moment to discover the soundtrack, to share the feelings of kindness and decency it inspires, and even better, to root for this little movie that could...Let's be particularly glad to know that in this day and age there are courageous souls that choose to produce, write, direct and play in movies that are willing to face history rather than discredit, malign or ignore its lessons, as well as its surreal and malicious impact on the lives of those that have no power and means to protect themselves.

"Great Movie for Free-Thinkers, and Others","This is a good story, and nicely told and acted. It's worth watching a few times, because it has a few tiers and points of view for assessment. (From whose point of view, inside-out or outside-in, etc.)For a prejudiced person, it probably will not cause the trauma needed for deep change, but perhaps for someone on the fence, it will teach something. For an inviting free-thinker, it is a pleasure of truth.There is the usual hypocrisy juxtaposition, such as in the Godfather. In the Godfather, assassination scenes were cut into the communion scene. Here, it's acts of prejudice followed by religious symbols and prayer.Starting conflict, the growth of bond, transformation and redemption. Low-key comedy along the way, which was nicely balanced to the message and tone.There is a great discussion in the car, too subtle for some, about the complexity of a human being, but the singularity of how prejudice is formed. That is, how we form opinions based upon one criterion, when a human being is complex. Again, it is subtle, but the movie balances nicely that human beings in similar roles, including roles of power, all do not act the same.Well-done.

Anyone would take a leaf out of Green book,"Green book...Nominated and winning this that and the other...'must be something I should see. So on this very Monday, midday, we went to Hoyts Sydney having a gift card for Hoyts and Green Book not showing near our place in these particular cinemas. Then I read it was a comedy? This did not sound as good as I thought it may be, feeling more interested in a racial conflict I understood it was... We got our tickets and in due time entered a little cinema. Little but so well furnished with spacious and reclining chairs! Our ticket also mentioned 'coarse language'; something not rating high on my wife's taste, how would she cope with this? After some 20 minutes of the 'usual' (allowing for some shut-eye on my part) the movie finally started.
I really hadn't read much about it at all, so did not expect to see a mismatched pair embarking in an unforgettable journey. I was so glad not to have any real idea about it. Yes racial difference it had, but it had also indifference of race and it was so wonderful. Why oh why were they only a handful of people watching with us? Yes it was a Monday and day time; still I would have expected more people.
Both main characters were so likeable in their own make up. You grew with them through the story and fell for them. Although they underwent some changes they remained themselves till the end. I have never heard or seen these actors before, so it was another bonus for me. It was not ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" or ""Intouchable"", but a charming yet thought provoking epic. If you were a little more curious than I am you would have to know it is about a white Italian American Bouncer in need of a job that is channelled to drive for a black 'gentleman' concert pianist who despite his talent and reputation is not immune to racism as we found about it during his epic tour about various ""united states"".
Both actors are so pleasing and I would not want you to fear about the coarse language, I did not resent or even remember hearing it. There were a couple of appropriate violent moments but quite obliterated by the good nature and familial portraying.
As for the comedy...There were a few very funny episodes.
This shows that it is still possible to deal efficiently with gritty topics without indulging in over used vulgarity and profane language.
And it was nice to leave the theatre rewarded with a contented feeling, again from me no rating since I don't believe in rating.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
"Great or Mediocre, Depending on Your Measure","If you don't care about history and you like superficial characters, there is a very good story here. The ending is lovely. The bond that is built between these two men is very well executed.However, I'm not fond of revisionist history. Mahershala Ali was too arrogant and not realistic. I MUCH prefer the real Donald Shirley. Why ""Hollywoodise"" him? By contrast, Mortenson was far more believable as Tony Lip.The problem for me is that if we keep on lying about the past, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes. You can still make an interesting story without putting Mr Shirley on a pedestal. It made me laugh when the movie preached about being polite and not being able to look past skin colour. That scene summed up Hollywood perfectly. This was the ""Oscar"" token movie of 2018.This movie is far better than the Thurgood Marshall movie recently released, however, that's a very low bar to set.Is this worth watching?

Real Good - Feel Good,"Most would never mistake Hollywood marketing executives for softies, but this time they could have fooled us. How else to explain why Universal knew to release Green Book around Thanksgiving, a time of celebrating family and friendship. For, while the movie's true story may not be profound enough to change your life, it certainly altered its characters for the rest of theirs. Watching such endearing kinship play out on screen is enough to melt the heart of even the staunchest scrooge.New York, 1962. A bouncer at the Copacabana nightclub named Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), aka Tony Lip, is temporary laid off after the building suffers fire damage. Seeking work to support his wife (Linda Cardellini) and two sons, he is referred to Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a virtuoso pianist who needs a driver to ferry him on a concert tour through the Deep South. But Dr. Shirley is black. His companion can't just camp out behind the wheel; he has to be able to make problems...go away.Tony, as it happens, is quite good at this. So after some haggling over price, the two embark on a two-month journey from Macon to Memphis, Birmingham to Baton Rouge. The bigotry and violence they find along the way are no surprise; the fact that their relationship almost makes us forget about such hardship is another story.Peter Farrelly directed this movie. Yes, the same Farrelly brother behind such comedies as Dumb and Dumber and Shallow Hall. Green Book is obviously a different bird. But while Farrelly does impress with his handling of the dramatic material, it's the humor that sets this film apart from so many others of its ilk.Race is a tense, heavy subject. We need to be able to laugh, not just at characters on a screen but, perhaps, at ourselves. In comedy, like a universal smile, we find common ground.
Which is a perfect Segway to Tony Lip. I have to believe Mortensen had a ball
playing this character. Vallelonga is a pasta-munching Italian from Brooklyn who isn't just a presence, he's a force. Tony is the truth behind the stereotype. And despite a rough exterior, he loves his family-which, of course, includes aunts, uncles, cousins and the old couple who run the pawn shop down the street. There's more than one shade of Moonstruck lighting these tenement floors.All this describes the character, but that's the heart of Mortensen's performance. He disappears into Tony, making him cringeworthy and loveable all at once.Then there's Doc Shirley-talented, educated, single. Essentially the antithesis of Tony, which is the surface conceit of most 'road' movies. ""They couldn't have been more different..."" But, like the better entries of its genre-Midnight Run, Trains, Planes and Automobiles-Green Book finds the humanity in its headliners. Are Tony and Don really that different? And if so, why not celebrate such variety?Ali, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2016's Moonlight, makes the difficult seem effortless in peeling back the doctor's layers. Shirley is a complex character-austere yet vulnerable, lonely and proud-but by the end of the movie, we know him. We love him.When it comes to overall quality, Green Book is a unique case; there's nothing specifically ""wrong"" with it. That's not, though, the same as saying it's perfect. I've seen more emotional and inspiring movies, and even deeper characters. But the film is still a triumph, a 'real good feel good' experience that's hard to forget.The biggest reason for this is because of how it addresses its racial subject matter. There is no pointing of fingers. The movie pulls no punches when recounting instances of discrimination, but that's not its focus. Instead, the spotlight shines on two men accepting one another as fallen, beautiful human beings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Was this really the best film of 2018?,"It always seems a bit pointless trying to compare and rate films against each other. Quite sure there will be a heated debate going on about whether Green Book deserved to win the Best Film Oscar. According to the group of people voting for the Oscars this was the best film and they have just as much right for that opinion as anyone else. It wasn't my favourite, but hey ho.Green Book tells the unlikely friendship that is built between Tony Lip and Dr Don Shirley. Tony is a bouncer looking for temporary work. Dr Shirley is a black concert pianist about to go on a early 60's tour of the deep south and therefore in need of protection. The movie reminded me very much of Planes, Trains and Automobiles with one key difference. Somehow PTA seemed much more realistic at showing the tensions and empathy between the leads. Personally I didn't find Green Book that realistic at showing the friction and joy between Tony and Don.

Buddy road movie has some extra sparkle,"An Italian-American bouncer takes up the job of driving an African-American pianist on a 2 month tour in the 1960's of America's South.
This is essentially a buddy road movie bringing to mind Midnight Run (1988) and Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987). Two opposites are placed together and we witness conflict and humour and two characters growing together. So the template is set and it largely follows true as you'd expect.
What make this different is the setting. No matter what is going on there is the palpable racial tension and real threat that could dissolve this affable caper into something altogether more heinous.
This makes it more worthy, in an actual sense and that of the Oscars. This would also be my main criticism of the movie. It feels too crowd pleasing when it could have laboured further on the fight for civil rights.
Viggo Morensen and Mahershala Ali are superb and entirely convincing. Their characters evolve and grow credibly. Linda Cardellini, who i feel is underrated provides an anchor to the story and is excellent.
It's beautifully shot, as a road movie in the south should be. The period element isn't laboured beyond the opening scenes of Tony Lip in his bouncer role but is quietly effective. The soundtrack is top drawer combining Aretha Franklin, Chubby Checker etc with the very interesting, classically influenced, jazz stylings of Dr. Donald Shirley's trio.
Tonally it's hard to argue with, shifting gear effortlessly and it really is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud nearly every time they went for the comedic schtick.
For me it hasn't got the heft of an Oscar winning movie or the uniqueness and magic of e.g. its predecessor The Shape of Water (2017) but it will be timeless, pleasing and important enough to be looked upon with fondness. EIGHT",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"A well-rounded, fantastic piece of cinema.","Not only was the acting in Green Book phenomenal, especially when it came to the lead two actors, but the small roles of Tony's family and friends, police and those that were met along the journey really pulled together the overall effect of the film. If a film can transport me to another era in time, another situation in life, I absolutely love it. It was clear that the casting of this film was done to the best ability, and no actors or actresses were un-believable or out of place. The story arc of the characters could be considered stereotypical of similar films, however it nicely fits the story- of which I personally haven't read into the real names or happenings of.

The superficial script. And the great performances,"""Greenbook"", a film that calls attention to the acting and direction, but it sins in the script, the new long one of the experienced director Peter Farrelly arrives with an inexplicable force for the ossuary 2019. Telling the story of a racist Italian driver that arranges a job of a renowned black musician. The drama of the film is inspired by facts and is good, but the solutions of script are weak and end up leaving the average film. Script options, how to expose Tony's racism is silly, has no depth and meaning, is made solely and exclusively to cause empty aversion to the viewer, and opt for a line of script that follows in every movie, we have the discussion, the problem, the resolution and the moral lesson, such a set of events are repeated throughout the film without any news, which ends up leaving the work extremely predictable beyond its last scene, which I like for the good feeling that it cause, but it diverges from the movie message, which is good, but poorly executed.
But not everything is hurt. Viggo Mortessen is very cool in his character, a raw Italian, the actor seems to have fun in making a mega canastrão character, and that suits him a lot, you perfectly buy the character. And Mahershala there is great again, bringing us a dubious and confused character with his ideas, a deep character with troublesome feelings and veiled veils in a layer of coldness, and Ali's performance restrains this to perfection.
Another cool point is Peter's focused direction, with great set compositions, a bluish photograph and good use of the cameras, the director drives his film well, nothing exceptional and the only technical mistakes are associated with script mistakes.

Green Book (2018),"Directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardinelli, Joe Cortese, Dimiter D. Marinov, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tom Virtue, Brian Stepanek, Iqbal Theba, P.J. Byrne, Maggie Nixon. (PG-13)Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen), loving husband and father, wise-guy-adjacent tough guy, and casual racist, is selected to drive acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) on an eight-week road trip through the Deep South; no need for the audience to bring the rose-colored shades since all cameras used to shoot this picture apparently had that filter on preset. Old-fashioned to the point of insult, the majority of the running time is spent in the company of both men, who ""learn"" from each other and ""bond"" as a result (at least they both know how to eat fried chicken by the end), although their camaraderie rarely exceeds the level of a second-rate buddy movie. It's a trial to watch good actors like Mortensen and Ali try to breathe life into one of the hokiest and most obvious screenplays for a major motion picture in several years; granted, it doesn't help that Mortensen chooses to play it too broad (the crass Italian-American stereotyping feels pulled less from reality than from sketch comedy). Ali fares a little better, but his tightly-wound but injured stoicism does not profit from the producers' decision to rarely let Shirley be onscreen without Vallelonga, depriving us of critical reactions and emotions that aren't surface-deep and observed through another character's eyes. (There's even a brief episode where it's revealed that Shirley is gay, but Vallelonga barely seems interested and the movie never brings it up again.) Focusing almost entirely on the white character wouldn't have been so problematic if Vallelonga actually showed growth and regret and changed for the better, but he's pretty much the same person he was at the beginning, just willing to accept this specific black man as slightly-more-friend-than-employer. Designed and packaged as crowd-pleasing fare, and the con seemed to work when it nabbed a Best Picture Oscar, but this is little more than a clumsy reversal of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" another inexplicable populist victor that feels a little embarrassing in retrospect.32/100",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Great screenplay with two great performing artists,"This movie told a story when America and the American whites were so deeply biased to the black Americans. With this movie, some deep wounds would have been healed, some injustice when treating we human beings would be justified. It also showed how two extremely different kinds of people, with different growing up backgrounds, well educated or not, through a long journey, both gradually open up and tried to accommodate each other and finally completely merged as a one great American that should be, although came a bit late.This movie also felt like an educational road trip, both characters were at first so stereotyped biased by their own cultural and ethnic backgrounds, the ways how they each grew up, a complete different kind of day-and-night races, but through endeavor from each side, they have both transformed into a better person, not just relying on each other, but also educated each other, and proved that racial differences was the least thing to be bothered. Loyalty and friendship through the long road trip gradually grew organically.The guy who threw two water glasses just used by two black plumbers in the very beginning, then transformed into a person who'd sacrifice anything to protect the person whose race he used to dislike even hated so much, it was told by the storyline so naturally and subtly, simply allowing us, the viewers, to understand our own morality and emotions with deeper insight, a soul search and recognition to we human beings, and completely change us like those two characters in the movie; more open-minded with a well balanced conservatism and liberalism.A great road trip story was told here.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"Great acting, heartwarming story.","As far as on the road, buddy movies go, I'd say Green Book is my new favourite. This was marvellously directed by Peter Farrelly in his first solo venture, apart from his brother Bobby. The movie, though it has some good laughs in it, is clearly more of a dramatic movie and Peter Farelly's first one in his career. I guess he knows how to do great drama too! The performances were stellar. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are terrific together and have a great chemistry in this. The musical scenes were tremendously performed by Mahershala Ali and on top of that the score was great too. For a movie about race and prejudice in the early 60's south it will undoubtedly win you over with its heartwarming touch. Funny and dramatic.

A feel-good film.,"Green Book tells the true story of Tony Lip(Viggo Mortensen) an Italian-American bouncer/chauffeur, who Dr. Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali) an African-American pianist hires, when he tours several venues in the deep south of America, during the 1960s.Green Book is a brilliant movie. Director Peter Farrelly has given us a film, that effortlessly blends both comedic & dramatic elements. There are scenes where you will be guffawing & there are also scenes that are emotional & leave you teary-eyed. The gorgeous locales have been captured beautifully by cinematographer, Sean Porter. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding as Tony Lip. The physical transformation that Mortensen went through to embody his character, is commendable. Mahershala Ali is spectacular as Dr. Don Shirley. Ali's nuanced yet powerful performance, deserves all the awards coming his way. The effortless chemistry between Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali, is what makes this film flawless. Linda Cardellini is fantastic as Dolores. The supporting cast is superb.

They both form a special bond and deeply connect, even though they at times fight with each other.
The movie deals with racism in the south in a very interesting way.
Dr. Shirley is racially profiled and treated harshly by others, due to the color of his skin, what is beautiful is that Viggo accepts him for who he is, and does not judge him.
The movie isn't sad, heartbreaking, it's beautiful, most movies about subject matters such as racism tend to be sad and hard to watch, however, Green Book avoids that.

"Crowd pleasing thanks to its humor and performances, but ultimately overly predictable, bland, and forgettable","I have few big complaints about Green Book, but just an hour after watching it little of it stayed in my mind. It's a dramedy focused on the relationship between a working class white guy and a black pianist in the 1960s. Mortensen and Ali are both excellent in their roles, with Mortensen bringing some depth to an exaggeratedly written character and Ali bringing a balance of professionalism and emotion. Their relationship certainly has its share of humor, and it is fun to be along for the ride as they banter. I didn't think the racial elements of their relationships and identities were well explored, with the exception of Ali's monologue about how he doesn't fit in with any community. Mortensen was overtly racist early on, and there's no real explanation for why he's quickly so willing to work for a black high class man and put those prejudices aside. The differences in viewpoints and nuance were largely brushed aside in favor of a broader, optimistic arc where both of them are just good friends who save the other from racial/class problems when they need it. The ending does a good job of bringing full circle the themes of courage and integrity, but they still feel quite surface level and manufactured for easy, light satisfaction. The humor is fine and adds to the movie but isn't essential to it. It's a movie that's easy to sit back and go along with, but a hard one to think deeply about and come away with new elements to ponder. It's a crowd pleaser, but felt all to predictable and pandery to be memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Most Likely Oscar 2019 Best Picture Winner,"Green Book Review:Green Book is inspired by the true friendship of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a working class Italian-American bouncer and Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American pianist, as Tony Lip drives Dr. Shirley on his venue tour in the 1960s in the southern states. This is the movie, other than A Star is Born, that has been getting the biggest Oscar buzz this season. It seemed like an interesting plot and looked really good. I've given out 4 A+ scores this year, one being for the miniseries Sharp Objects, and I'm happy to say Green Book joins that group. I loved every minute of this movie! The story by Peter Farrelly was so good. Definitely will get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, though I do think Roma will end up winning it. The dialogue worked. The pacing was good. There was just so much emotion put into this. As the tour gets deeper into the South, Dr. Shirley experiences more racism and you just had no words to describe all of the emotion and feelings put into those scenes. The performances by the two actors are the best of all year. Viggo Mortensen will win Best Actor. His portrayal of Tony Lip was amazing. His best performance yet. He was a lovable character. And it's a character that has flaws and it's acknowledged throughout and Viggo knew how to do that. Mahershala Ali will for sure win his second Oscar, first for playing Juan in Moonlight, playing Dr. Shirley. This is his best role to date. There were scenes that made me laugh and some bringing tears. This is a lock for Best Supporting Actor. I loved Linda Cardellini as Delores but I don't think she'll be recognized for her role. Peter Farrelly's direction was great. He has made some horrendous films in the past, one being Movie 43, but he did very well and could get a nomination for Best Director, probably won't win however. The score by Kris Bowers was very good. It was a mix of classical music that Dr. Shirley played and 60s jazz. I think he'll get a nomination for Best Original Score. Not too many scores have been released for upcoming films so it's hard to tell what he's up against though there are a few from earlier this year that could get nominated. The cinematography was good but not good enough for the nomination. In all honesty, so far this is the film that I think will win Best Picture at the Oscars 2019 (I will put my top 10 Best Picture Predictions below). It had so much to say and I think it's a film everyone should see. It's relevant and I will say my favorite Christmas movie to date. I was disappointed to see that it didn't make too much at the box office yet, only making 14.0 million and only #10 at the the top box office for its second week into its release. It was promoted at theaters but not many theaters got it. I had to go all the way to Appleton to see it and it was in a small theater that was packed. I was happy to see how many people went to see it. Overall you should see the movie when you get the chance. I don't think you could hate it.My Grade: A+My Oscar 2019 Best Picture Predictions so far (they're pretty close to the Gold Derby Predictions):1. Green Book
2. Roma
3. A Star is Born
4. If Beale Street Could Talk
5. The Favourite
6. Vice
7. BlacKkKlansman
8. First Man
9. Black Panther (it's really getting a lot of buzz)

Funny fluffy comedy about a oppressive time in American history.,"Green Book certainly stirred up controversy when it unexpectedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. I personally didn't care as I lost interest in the Oscars completely (these are the people that nominated Black Panther for Best Picture). Certainly is the film in my Top 5 favorites of 2018, not really. That doesn't mean however that Green Book isn't an endearing, enjoyable and above all funny film about friendship and acceptance. The themes of this film have been highlighted around a zillion times in other films such as The Help. However that doesn't mean that the formula is broken. I for one appreciated this films humor, performances and story. A tough Italian brute (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for a new job. He is hired by an African American musician (Mahershala Ali) to drive him through the Southern States in the early 1960s for a tour. The film wisely goes for humor over melodrama which is what sets it apart from all the other films about this topic. Not that the film doesn't have dramatic moments, in fact these are all the more effective because the two main characters were so likeable and funny. Mortensen gave such a heartwarming performance. His character is a brute, he doesn't mind getting physical when someone pisses him off. But his character also expressed such an aura of warmth were the audience simply gravitated towards him. He doesn't understand the racism, he doesn't get the absolute treacherous and human rights violating laws of Jim Crow under which African Americans suffered. However the film wisely never preaches about the privileged white man not knowing the truth, it just shows it, plain and simple. Ali too gave a terrific performance, his character had a sense of sophistication and coolness even in intense situations. It is incredibly heart wrenching to see such a professional guy who lives his passion pushed to his breaking point by his societies' racist rules. Overall there is not much else to say about Green Book. The themes are obvious and the film doesn't attempt to hide it. Mortensen and Ali are terrific and share great chemistry. A heartwarming family film that allows children to have a more sanitized look into America's darkest points of history. No 12 Years A Slave but still a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

"Decent, enjoyable but standard prestige film based on a true story","Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give stellar performances in this true story about a NYC club employee and bodyguard who is hired by a classical pianist from Carnegie Hall to drive him through his performance tour across the South in the early 1960s, during which they develop a solid bond, despite their considerable educational and socioeconomic differences.I would call this film decent, light entertainment. It definitely offers a glimpse into how impressive Mortensen's range is an actor. The same actor who gave compelling performances in films like ""A Dangerous Method"" and ""Captain Fantastic"" is thoroughly riveting to watch here as he disappears into the role of ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga and Ali is impressive as Don Shirley, a Jamaican-American musician who became well-known in his era.This film doesn't break too much ground, in all honesty. It's good diverting cinema but as a film released during Oscar season, it's fairly run-of-the-mill with no real surprises.

One of the most intelligent films I have ever seen with very affecting performances.,"The movie is really fantastic with Viggo and Mahershala giving a very simple excellent performance with me loving Viggo more. The story is superb along with the screenplay of the characters which was very terrific with some awesome quotes that can go on forever.
The best thing I like about the story that it didn't have to be R rated to show racism and give us much violence to describe it. It only showed this with absolutely no loud voice or profanity or anything more than
looks and very simple situation, for me the whole movie is excellent in it's impossible simple way of telling the story with the simple performances that lacked the presence of better music that would have made the scenes a lot more better. Also the whole Green Book matter in the film wasn't clear for me even when it was opened and couldn't understand it's presence that much more than that it's because it's the movie's title!. Also hopped that it didn't get to the sexuality and that kinda stuff which sometimes is not necessary in the movies especially this one and only to attract some audiences which I am totally against. Viggo's character will be me favorite for a long while and for me he was even better than Rami's performance at Bohemian Rhapsody. Mahershala deserve the Oscar that he will win for that strong expressions and emotions although he and Viggo had some entertaining master acting scenes comedy and drama.

This is one of those films you never want to end,"Green Book (2018) is a movie my wife and I watched on Prime shortly after it was released to that streaming service. The storyline follows a New York City Italian that is rough around the edges that has been hired to drive a black pianist as he tours the south in the 1960s. Their very different demeanors, lifestyles and skill sets are a shock to each other but they do their best to learn from each other and meet in the middle so they can both be successful with their responsibilities. This movie is directed by Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) and stars Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage) and Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain). The storyline for this is very intricate and brilliantly written. The subplots on the Italian, the world renowned pianist and how those individuals were perceived through various interactions in the south were fascinating and well presented. The dialogue was well written and the cast delivers fantastic performances. The end is rewarding and this is one of those films you never want to end.

Real good comedy where I appreciated the underlying themes for once,"I love music. Jazz and classical specifucally. And I do love a good subtle comedy, which this was.As a European sometimes the american race problematic however kind of gets over my head and it does feel like lowkey brainwash of their problems on the rest of the world through hollywood cinema.I really enjoyed this movie however. It really works and it doesn't seem to humiliate one side to glorify the other, something you see commonly elsewhere with this sort of themes. Both characters I grew attached to and understood. I would reccommend this to everyone.

Hollywood can still tell a story!,"Wow! In this age of special effects and CGI heavy superhero films, it's a relief to know Hollywood is still capable of producing a heartwarming, heartbreaking film! Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of stereotypically Italian Tony seemed a little cheesey and clichéd to begin with, but he grew on me. Mahershala Ali gave an absolutely mind blowing acting performance!

Great Movie,"This movie details the relationship between pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and a bouncer named Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who is hired to drive him through the Deep South in 1962 for a two month concert tour. He is to make sure he reaches all the concert destinations and to keep him safe if any trouble should arise, and plenty does. The acting is wonderful, especially by Viggo Mortensen, who portrays an Italian from New York who is a bit rough around the edges compared to the dignified Shirley. Plenty of humor is interspersed within the poignant relationship that develops between the two men. This movie is based on a true story when segregation was the ""norm"", and the Green Book was a travel guide for African Americans that listed hotels that were available for them to stay in, which were often subpar if best. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this movie might not be for you, but if you like movies that show a piece of history and true to life heart-warming stories, then this one is for you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Enjoyable movie in spite of its flaws,"Green Book tells the presumably true story of white racist guy hired as the chauffeur for a black musician doing a tour of the deep south. It's predictable, following the well-worn path to racial understanding of similar films, but it's got solid performances and is engaging throughout.There have been various criticisms of this movie. Don Shirley's family says its ridiculous to claim he'd never eaten fried chicken before having it forced on him by a white guy, and that's probably true. But it works as a way to contrast the plebeian white guy with the sophisticated black man, and it's silly to expect any Hollywood movie to not be at least half fiction.(It's hard to know who's telling the truth. Shirley's family has complained a lot, but from what I've read they don't seem to have been that close to him. The movie was written by the chauffeur's son, who says Don Shirley himself approved it, but the guy also echoed Donald Trump's lie that thousands of American Muslims cheered during 9/11, which makes me consider him inherently untrustworthy.)The movie has also been criticized as yet another movie funneling racism through a white lens; this is the chauffeur's story, not Shirley's. But because a movie is part of an unfortunate trend doesn't mean that individual movie isn't good, it just means Hollywood has trouble breaking out of its boxes.The title does, however, bug me. The Green Book was a guide on where to find hotels where black people could stay at a time when many hotels were whites only. It's a good example of what black people had to deal with, it was written for black people by black people, the existence of the book is a condemnation of the white culture that made it necessary, and even though it's a fairly insignificant plot point this is the title they chose. This is a movie about a white guy learning about racism; why make the title something so much a part of a particular black experience? It feels a little like theft.Still, I really enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was super memorable, and it seems like a movie I'll have pretty much forgotten in a year (so maybe I should give it a 7?) yet it's mix of humor and pathos make it a very enjoyable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Nitpicking from an italian over a good movie,"I'm an italian girl from northeast italy, so not part of most of the origins of italoamericans (mostly from south italy, we migrated in the US but more elsewhere) nor black, nor american, so my take has this POV precisely. To me a film is good when it entertains me (and i studied cinema at uni) and this movie does its job in that. It also has beautiful photography, nice dialogues, nice comic parts, nice drama still remaining realistic. So I'll pass all the good things and i'll nitpick extensively the few ones i didn't like. In casual order:
1) viggo mortesen can pass as an italian as i could pass for a chinese. He's clearly scandinavian and a hair painture can't change that. Nice job with the rest of the cast, even if some look like they could be tunisian.2) I don't ask for italian speaking actors since they are italoamericans, but please, at least make them speak actual italian instead of gibberish! It was half danish-american accent mixed with southern italian accented words mixed with stereotype intonations directly copied by family guy.3) Tony's street smart and uncultured. He thinks german is russian. Curiously, that's the cliché i have about americans. The white ones. The white ones with north european heritage who live in the military base where i come from. They probably can't distinguish italian from french. Also tony eats more like an american would than an italian. Jeez, all that fried chicken! Obviously, the black musicians points out his passion about food. Never is mentioned about italians' art or other stuff, aside from a joke about michelangelo which shows the ignorance of tony's folks. Or the word virtuoso. Well, the art is mentioned, but as a thing of italy's past that italo americans don't know. But italy=food, some american once told me that my accent made him hungry haha4) a cultured man like the musician should have known that ofc Orpheus in the underworld is a french opera but that Orpheus comes from the greek myth, and it's not hell, it's the Ade, from the name of the greek god that guards it! In the movie reminiscence, 2021, with hugh jackman, same mistake: devil and hell instead of ade and... ade, speaking of orpheus. Not all teens in italy go to the humanistic high school, but generally we know who orpheus is, i actually thought americans didn't know because they don't have humanistic high school and seem to care less about latin and greek. Apparently italo americans were really ignorant!5) i dislike the american's division between street smart and book smart. Tony and the musician looked like Ross and Joey from Friends. Usually if you are really book smart you may not know how to handle a gun, but you are way less detached from the world than the musician. If you are, it's because you didn't really studied, you are like those guys who are full of notions read on wikipedia. Like redditors who did one year of latin or one year of phylosophy and think they know the subject. Better: like people who want to write songs without having studied music theory (irl experience). Also street smart people are not as uncultured to not even be able to write correctly in their language.That's it. If i come up with some more nitpicking, i'll add. Ah, i didn't like the ""rich and lonely"" cliché. I liked the joke of the cop that an italian is half black haha.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Enjoyable story of an unlikely friendship,"Based on a true story in the US deep south during the 60s, 'Green Book' is an enjoyable and moving film about an unlikely friendship between a black jazz musician and his white bodyguard and driver. It's a nice story and the film does a good job at balancing the humour and drama so that it feels neither too light or heavy.'Green Book' is well-written and looks great. The two main characters, Tony and Don, are brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali respectively. They work well together and share great chemistry, with some very funny moments and individual scenes.If I had one criticism, 'Green Book' does feel quite cliché and somewhat forced in getting its message across. Of course, race relations were always going to be a big part of this film as it is set in a time in American history when racism was rife, but I do often feel films like this try too hard to make a statement rather than simply tell the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Let's you chuckle about a rough subject and time,"I went to the theater thinking this was fiction. Wrong. It's a darn good film with superb acting by Viggo Mortenson (Tony Lip) and Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley). The interplay between the obnxious Italian bouncer (Tony Lip) and the stuffy black vitruoso brought chuckles, was thought provoking, and didn't just demonize the white guy. It showed both men's humanity and obvious flaws, and if it didn't make racism/segregation seem horrid, it didn't make it look nice. After playing to standing ovations, the good doctor still had to use the outhouse and drive to the colored cafe to eat.This movie has been lambasted by the PC crowd as too soft on racism (debatable) and too much from the Italian's viewpoint - true, but why is that a crime?. I suspect their real gripe is that Whitey made this film. Well, they can gripe, but most like the movie, and rightfully so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Highly Interesting Movie,"This movie is interesting in many ways. The one that appeals to me the most is the movie challenges many of our conventional perceptions - A white driver working for a black boss, a white man with limited exposure to cultured language and social skill against a black man with much more exposure, a black man with more exposure to Western music and culture than American black music and culture, etc.
Good plot! Good acting! Good cinematography! What more can one expect from a movie?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
A friendship without borders,"'Green Book' is a film full of feelings and emotions. We start from the classic and widely used base already from a very different couple from which an unexpected friendship arises. In this case, between an African-American pianist and his Italian driver. The atmosphere generated by this relationship results in a film full of sentimentality and extremely funny situations. That is the strongest point of this tape.
However, just as it does the humorous part perfectly, the dramatic part is pretty weak. His representation of racism at that time is weak and very softened, with situations that do not fully frame the segregation that African Americans were forced to live. And when it tries to be dramatic, it exaggerates it, including situations to force the viewer's feeling.
However, outside of that it is a complete film, with a direct narrative and good performances. It tells the story without more or less, it does not risk anything, but it does not lose anything either, making it a film that can certainly please anyone, this being its greatest achievement in what it is offering.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Wonderful,"A wonderful movie, emotional, funny, not boring, full of intense moments and realistic situations of art, racism, friendship.
Both the protagonists are well interpreted, as it is for the other components of the band and the driver's wife.

In fact it's a film that just shows you what it is, as a sophisticated black piano player with a lot of courage drives from show to show in the deep white South, backed by his hard-as-nails Italian driver.It's a very welcome way of portraying heartbreaking practices in society, keeping its focus on the good we have inside, especially between these two unlikely friends. It pulls a trick to achieve this, deliberately skipping the hard moments and only showing the aftermaths, stripping it from too much drama.The camera just never loses sight of either of our friends, and that makes it an exceptionally good film.

"Great Story, Great Acting","Though ""Green Book"" has won a library-full of awards, many critics have been lukewarm about its merits. That is because they wish to see it as a commentary on race relations in the U.S. That is like viewing ""My Cousin Vinny"" as a commentary on the American judicial system.The film, based on a true story, is about the dynamics of a relationship between two men from different stations and cultures. Tony (Viggo Mortensen) is a meatball hired to drive Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an erudite black man, on a concert tour that passes through the deep South. Written, in part, by the son of real-life Tony, it is a rewarding story of education and transformation that provides both laughter and tears.The pace of the film is perfect. The viewer feels like a third passenger in the car as it motors from venue to venue, state to state, while a charming battle of wills evolves.

Green Book Review,"Viggo Mortensen delivers a transformative performance as Tony Lip, embodying his rough-edged, street-smart character with authenticity and depth.

Mahershala Ali, in an Academy Award-winning performance, portrays Dr. Don Shirley with elegance and complexity. Ali's nuanced performance reveals the loneliness and dignity of a man navigating a world that respects his talent but rejects his identity.The film's strength lies in the chemistry between Mortensen and Ali, whose dynamic performances bring humor, tension, and genuine emotion to their characters' evolving relationship.

A good look at America's prejudices and society that fostered segregation in the 20th century,"""Green Book"" is a very good film, set in 1962, billed as a biographical comedy and drama. The film was inspired by true events that year when Don Shirley toured the Deep South accompanied by Frank Vallelonga. Shirley was a black classical pianist and Vallelonga, known as ""Tony Lip,"" was an out of work white bouncer from New York's Copacabana Night Club. In true order of content, this film is first a drama, then biography, and then comedy. It's a film about prejudice, family, racism, class distinction, success, opportunity, and the social constrictions of the period.This was in the time just before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Opposition to the racist laws and policies of the Deep South had increased since the 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott by Rosa Parks. Major civil rights efforts were yet to come. Very little attention has been paid to the segregation practices and beliefs of the Deep South since then. What depictions there have been tend to paint the racial prejudice as being perpetrated mostly by rednecks. But this film shines the spotlight on the wealthy, upper class, and high society of the white South. One can't help but wonder how long segregation in the South otherwise would have lasted, or if it would have survived the Civil War at all. If the upper class whites, professionals, educators, businesses, churches and individuals had shunned racism and decried segregation, it surely couldn't have taken hold or survived so long.This is a good film and a good story. It also shines the light on prejudices within races. In Tony's case, within ethnic groups, although he is seen to initially harbor ill thoughts of blacks. And, in Don's case, inner-racial prejudice is based on status, upbringing, background, and education. But, if humanity isn't reason enough to end and abolish racism, the film shows that other social factors can help do so. In this case it's music - among the blacks and working classes of all color. Yet, the white elites don't even waiver in their prejudice in the face of great talent and art.This is a very good film for any time. It won three Oscars including best picture and best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali who plays Dr. Donald Shirley. The movie and Ali also won the Golden Globes that year.Here are some favorite lines from this film.Tony Lip, spotting a big billboard as they drive south out of Ohio, ""Kentucky fried chicken - in Kentucky! When's that ever gonna happen?""Dr. Donald Shirley, looking over Tony's letter to his wife, ""Dear Dolores - D-E-A-R! This is an animal,"" pointing to Tony's spelling.Tony Lip, ""So, can I put, uh, 'P. S. Kiss the Kids?'"" Dr. Don Shirley, "" A P. S.?"" Tony, ""You know, at the end?"" Dr. Shirley, ""That's like clanging a cowbell at the end of Shostakovich's Seventh."" Tony, ""Right! And that's good?"" Dr. Shirley, ""It's perfect, Tony.""Tony Lip, ""You know, the world's full of lonely people waitin' to make the first move.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Great character relationship,This film really relies on the great performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They give amazing portrayals as their respective characters and their wonderful journey together brings them closer and reconciles their vast differences. The portrayal of racism in America is disheartening and at times a bit extreme but is treated in a nuanced way.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Heartwarming,"I an not one to use the word ""heartwarming"" to describe a film I like. A rare film that goes for the heart and succeeds.

Classic Road Movie,A tour de force by the two leads. Mahersala routinely transitioned from pompous elitist to vulnerable loner in the same take while Mortensen played against type and nailed the Bronx - almost wise guy - character to a T. The script while strumming the emotional chords avoided taking too many liberties which resulted in an exceedingly good film,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
Good film,"The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

I love the Italian vibe throughout and no matter how you put it, Italians can always make something funny. Even though Doc seems very well read and literate, he still almost seems dumb and oblivious, I just wish he has a tiny bit more street smarts/common sense.

A Pleasant Surprise,"Both Lead actors give great performances in this humorous, charming, interesting and modest film.
Many times throughout the film I was waiting for an over the top, unrealistic display of the characters morals. I am very glad that this never happened, great credit to the Director for allowing the smaller moments to carry the film. In doing so you are given time to think about all these moments and what they mean to you and the characters. These characters evolve through the film as they both learn about themselves and each other. Again not shown with grand gestures but with small changes, just how the main theme of Racism needed to be changed and still does even to this day.
The modesty of the film sets itself apart from other films of its type. It doesn't feel the need to shove its important themes down in your face but hope you have the openness to acknowledge them.
Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are well worth the watch and both deserving of award nominations as well as the Director Peter Farrelly.
A lovely film that has it all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Green BookThe hardest part of driving through the southern US is convincing folks the internal combustion engine isn't witchcraft.Sadly, the driver in this drama must also persuade southerners that his black passenger is human.When nightclub bouncer Frank Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is laid off, he takes a job driving around jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he plays throughout the lower states. While the lowbrow Vallelonga and the snobbish Shirley struggle to find common ground, they eventually become friends and learn to navigate the racism embedded in the south.Loosely based on a true story, many liberties were taken to make this interracial buddy movie more palatable to modern day audiences. And while the freedom taken can be called into question, the overall message of tolerance is inarguable, along with the strong performances.And while having a white male driver may curtail racial violence, road rage incidents would double.

Fried Chicken At Its Best,Nick Vallelonga has surely an Oscar here a heart warming tale from beginning to end.The acting is a masterclass of how it should be done. Racism in the 50s ruminates throughout and the ugliness it reflects on everyone who promotes it .Mahershala Ali plays the irrepressible Dr Shirley with passion and grace and is hilarious at times without slipping from the role. This said his co star Viggo Mortensen is equally stunning as Tony Lip and is the total opposite to Alis character care free but still holding on to his morals for the love of his wife and children. An absolute delight and an absolute favourite to be awarded for its shear delight.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

You Gotta Be Kidding,"8.2!! Do NOT fall for this rating. I have never seen so many cliches and overacted/overdramatized scenes crammed into a movie in my life. It has the slick and polished production, but that can't overcome the steady stream of nonsense this movie dribbles forth. Sadly, these are the types of movies Viggo always seems to stumble upon, and honestly I don't think he possesses the talent to tackle anything of real substance. This movie had very strong subject matter but the handling and production was 2nd rate at best. The best thing here is the music and the cars of that era. Skip it. There's way better movies on racial tensions out there that aren't a laughable mess. Mississippi Burning. A Time To Kill. Avoid this stinker.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Couldn't possibly be more cliché... it's good!,"Is this the 2018 Oscar deserving movie?
How? It's not much more than a big cliché made movie!The music tells us when we are supposed to feel things. The stereotypes start and end where generally they do in these type of ""feel good movies"", with the mandatory redemptive scenes for both parties, because ""of course we know"" are always ""both parties fault"", just to make sure nobody gets too offended.Everything is calculated, cold. No decision artistic. Everything ""acceptable"" but forgettable.
Anyways. The movie is good, because it looks great, the pace is great, the music and dialogue fun and the actors good.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are immense, and the chemistry between them is so perfect.

Simplistic & characters are not believable,"One of the most overrated films I have seen. I saw it when it came out and was shocked by the Oscars. Did we see the same film? I mean, it's okay and fairly enjoyable for a simple, feel good sort of movie. But the actors are not believable at all, I'm aware they are ""acting"", the script is silly at times, and at no time did I get lost in the story. It felt more like a made for TV type of film. It's enjoyable and easy to watch and a lovely little story line but best picture? Seriously? And while Mahershala Ali deserved the Oscar for Moonlight (a stunning film) this win was a real stretch. He was not believable in this role and the dialogue was eye rolling worthy at times. Not his fault, he did the best he could with it. He's a great actor but I just felt the film was too shallow and trying too hard in the ""feel good"" department. I enjoyed it but compared to The Godfather? Gimme a break on the 10 stars lol. It wasn't the best year for movies so I can forgive the Oscar (my personal pick was The Favourite) but this is one seriously overrated film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"

Did the film properly place the struggle of Black people in its rightful context?,"Critical Review of Green Book - Rating: 7/10Green Book succeeds in delivering an enjoyable and engaging cinematic experience, with a screenplay that crafts well-developed, relatable characters within a lighthearted and accessible narrative. One of its greatest strengths lies in its ability to evoke emotions, particularly anger, in response to the racial discrimination depicted in the film. A movie that manages to provoke strong feelings in its audience demonstrates a certain level of cinematic effectiveness that cannot be overlooked.However, despite this emotional impact, the film suffers from several critical flaws, the most significant being its simplification of the struggle against racism, reducing it to a hopeful, reconciliatory journey rather than an urgent fight against systemic oppression. The central narrative focuses primarily on the white man's triumph over his own prejudice, rather than the Black man's battle against an entrenched system of racial discrimination. This framing reduces Don Shirley's character to a mere supporting element in Tony Lip's personal transformation, rather than making him the central figure in the story. The film could have been more compelling had it depicted a more realistic confrontation with racism-one that acknowledges that real struggles for equality often require more than passive resilience and that resistance can sometimes necessitate confrontation.It appears that the film deliberately took this approach to secure broader acceptance from American audiences, mainstream festivals, and global award circuits. Hollywood often favors narratives that provide an optimistic and palatable take on historical injustices, rather than confronting them with the harshness they deserve.Despite these shortcomings, Green Book deserves credit for successfully constructing complex character identities, particularly in its portrayal of Don Shirley, a man caught between two worlds-alienated from Black society yet never fully accepted by white society. This layered characterization adds depth to the story, yet it falls short of fully embracing the tragic dimensions that could have made Shirley's personal struggles even more compelling and emotionally resonant.Ultimately, Green Book is a well-crafted and emotionally engaging film, but it remains a safe, middle-ground choice, prioritizing reconciliation over confrontation. By offering a sanitized version of historical struggles, it diminishes its potential impact, making it less powerful than it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy"
