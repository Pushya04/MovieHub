Fantastic.,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Just As Intriguing The Second Time, Too!","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Storytelling at its best!,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best movies EVER,What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie.This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.,,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Great entertainment, though it pigeonholes itself there","This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"""The Prestige"" starts well but cheats with its own premise...","There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc.Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film.So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie).The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Webby meshwork of magic and mystery,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on.

Give This Film Time to Sink In...,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen.

Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more.

Magical!!!,"Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.Great Movie, a must see",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Magic in parts, meh in others","The first time I watched ""The Prestige"", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.This movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.Nolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.What lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.The music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.Mercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.""The Prestige"" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.Invulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with ""Tenet"" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A Great Tale of Rivalry, Obsession, Revenge and Sacrifice","In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Christopher Nolan is the real magician,"The Prestige is about rivaling magicians trying to ""out-illusion"" each other with the ultimate magic trick. But really you are the one who feels like you are being tricked, this film has plot twists from start to finish and each one is even more shocking than the last. By the end you will want to rewatch it 100 times to follow along with all the tricks. It is the kind of film that you will not want to miss a single second of so you don't miss anything.

I'm addicted to it,"Every so often I see a film that I get addicted to. As soon as I watch it in the cinema I know I'm going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.Well The Prestige is the latest of these. This film gets better and better with each viewing. Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.Christopher Nolan is a master. Even though he seems quite humourless in his DVD extra interviews. He makes extremely entertaining films that are well cast and superbly executed, just as the Prestige is.All those who never liked the film should be rounded up in a field and used for crazed scientific experiments, we could use Tesla!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Masterfully Handled!!!,"I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together.

Remarkable. Nolan's best,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Over-complicated mess of a Nolan,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan's best? I think so.,"One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.Watch it; it is truly magical.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Top Notch cast and many plot twists will make this film a must see,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige.""""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan's writing masterpiece! One time is simply not enough.,"This movie is beyond brilliant. I never payed that much attention to it the first two or three times I watched it on TV, but god, oh god, is it worth watching again! Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

a gorgeous film,"What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions.

That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning.

Roma Film Festival -  the Prestige: ultimately unconvincing,"""The Prestige"" has everything a film need to be great: two lead actors named Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, for the first time together, a supporting cast including Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansonn - I felt Johansonn was kind of useless here, though - and the direction of acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much.

An outstanding movie.,"Magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier were once friends, but following an accidental death, the pair are determined to outshine, when ultimately destroy one another.It's a dizzying, dazzling, complex mystery, it may need a rewatch, as there's so much happening, it may be a little hard to keep up with all that's happening in front of you, but there's no denying, this is a captivating film.One of the best lineups imaginable, headliners Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both tremendous, two genuine legends, both at the top of their game.

The best movie of the year!  (minor spoilers),"The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is!Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE!Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, ""BOOM"" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment.

An impressive cast star in it with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the leads; and Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie supporting as the film plays with the viewer's mind more than any movie has since Nolan's ""Memento"". The use of normal linear plot setting along with flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks are what help to accomplish such a perplexing work of genius.Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are rival magicians in an end-of-the-nineteenth-century London. Borden develops a new trick which frustrates Angier and compels him to do things which are almost inconceivable to find out his secret. Cutter (Caine), Angier's illusion creator, insists that Borden uses a double where Borden goes in through one door and the double comes out the other; much to Angier's disbelief, he vows to find out Borden's method and use it to improve his own act.""The Prestige"" is yet another astonishing and remarkable film from the fantastically skillful Christopher Nolan which propels the viewer on a ride through the dark hearts of two men.

My Favorite Film Of All Time.,"The Prestige, is a film about love, friendship, rivalry, competition, and magic. The film is Christian Bale (Borden) and Hugh Jackman (Angier) who are friends and become enemies as they compete with each other for a number of reasons.Christopher Nolan, the director is perfect for this film, he creates an atmosphere perfect for every scene, will his leads act throughout this atmosphere like it's their own creation. Wally Pfister, director of cinematography should have won an Oscar for this, exaggeration? Watch the film yourself.I can guarantee that you will love this film.

The Metaphor of Human Alienation and the Expression of Desire Paranoia,"This is a story without a winner. Because whether it is the absolute worship of success or the inability to give up on hatred, it is destined that this game will never die, the soul will never dissipate, until one party pays a fatal price.Fatal is never magic, fatal is always the darkness of the human heart who does everything to succeed.The setting of the film is in the Victorian era, which not only brings in exquisite and complex costumes, gorgeous and flashy stage backgrounds, and bizarre and psychedelic stories, but also creates an illusion of a distant distance - that is, the restlessness and loss of the human heart that only existed in that era, and now in civilized society, we are rational, restrained, sober, and disdainful.As the old magician said, ""People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.On our path to success, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, we will not break our souls into pieces or make choices that are both beautiful and gloomy, right?People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

One of the most engaging and impressive character pieces I've seen all year,"""The Prestige"" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan.""As for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in ""The Machinist"" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...)The film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.Chilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"What can I say, wow!","What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to ""Usual Suspects"", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Best movie I've seen in a long time,"Depicting the story of two magicians, who develop a rivalry that eventually turns out into a true war, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that keeps you connected all throughout its two hours. Some people said about it that sometimes the action tends to be boring, but I consider exactly the opposite: I didn't have the time to get bored, due to the very well-written story. The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally ""strong"" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it. It's a film to savor and to feel (and eventually maybe to love)!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
If this doesn't sweep the boards at Oscars night...,"Quite simply, THE best movie of the year (closely followed by Rian Johnson's Brick). Intelligent, witty, excellently shot (a superb mix of breathtaking pans and establishing shots and very involving hand-held/steadi shots), with the finest actor of a generation (Caine) and very likely his successor (Bale).No spoilers here, as unlike Memento,The Prestige's tricks can be worked out before they are revealed, and audiences will have great fun doing so. This is a tale of rival Victorian magicians, whose obsessions lead each into darker and darker places as Jackman's Angier seeks revenge for the death of his wife, and Bale's Borden looks to prove himself the better of the two magicians. Even without the mystery, twists and turns, this story is an excellent character study, something that carries the picture and at times supersedes the mystery and science fiction elements of the plot.Like Memento, it has a non-linear narrative, though not such an extreme one...the narrative is played out in three stages, like the magic tricks within it - first the pledge, then the turn, finally the prestige. It can be followed easily enough by anybody with a decent attention span, and reaps great rewards for those who follow it closely enough to try and fathom its mysteries. As with magic, the trick is not what has been done, but HOW it has been accomplished.Nolan is fast proving himself (along with David Lynch) the master of non-linear narrative film-making. His movies put the non-linear pretenders in their place (you know who you are), and shows that, even in this age of mass-consumption and dumbing down, movie audiences can be allowed to think, and don't need everything spelled out for them.Can't wait for Oscars night, if this doesn't walk home with a few (Nolan particularly, Bale and Caine) then there is NO JUSTICE!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The movie is about more than the trick,"If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Magic Show,"Antici..................................pation!( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences.The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it.This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here.

It's so refreshing to see a film like this amidst the rest of the rubbish that Hollywood tends to churn out at this time of the year.Beautifully shot, the film is visually stunning. The actors performances are all fantastic as well, and it's great to see Jackman in an unusually dark role - watching his obsession take over him slowly until he turns into a very unpleasant character was an interesting departure from his usual roles. Bale delivers a great performance as well.I won't expand on the storyline as many here have already done that, suffice to say that although they deviated somewhat from the original books storyline, the films ending is nevertheless well-crafted and executed.Definitely one to purchase for the DVD collection!

Great film,"I've been a fan of Nolan for a long time, ever since Memento. He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays ""franchise"" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians? The man is a master, only a notch below Hitchcock himself, and this film is his masterwork, so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"This is the movie ""The Illusionist"" tried to be...","""The Prestige"" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually ""one up"" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.In the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.The performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in ""The Machinist."") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.This is the movie that ""The Illusionist"" tried to be.

Secrets are my life,"I rarely sit down to write a review for a film I have seen, but this movie is well worth my time.I have seen it three times, and honestly have thoroughly enjoyed it all three times. I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies, and I cannot at the moment think of another I can say this about.So what is it about the prestige? Is it the BEST story? Is it the BEST acting? Is it the BEST cinematography? I would say the answer to these three questions is probably no, not BEST, but very very good. When a film can succeed in such a way on so many levels, it makes a lasting impression. The Prestige is definitely this type of movie, and one of the most entertaining I've ever seen.The acting is marvelous. Maybe nothing Oscar worthy, but this movie didn't call for that type of role. Christian Bale is perfectly mysterious, Hugh Jackman is spot on as a revenge seeking widower, and Michael Caine adds exactly the right support to bring it all together.The cinematography and art direction really give this movie the mood it needs to be memorable. You will be sucked in to its mystery, and each scene will keep you on the brink of illusion and reality.Christopher Nolan's touch of teeter tottering timelines may frustrate the casual viewer, but it will challenge and entertain those who are ready to tackle the secrets of the film. You will be guessing and guessing, hoping for that home run of an ending, and trust me...it's a grand slam. You will not be disappointed. Better than Memento.But what is it that takes this from a great movie to a masterpiece? For me it was the sounds. The mysterious score added wonder to all the right moments, making this more than a movie, but an experience that I will look forward to being a part of again and again.Every element was there, every aspect executed in superb fashion.

I wish I could give 11.,"If I could be granted one wish it would be that I could give The Prestige an 11 rating. It's an outstanding movie, far from anything you've ever seen. At first, my only motives for seeing this movie were seeing it with this kid I liked and because I'm madly in love with Christian Bale. I didn't pay much attention to my date. I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is ""storytelling at it's best."" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it.

"""It is inhuman to be so cold""...","""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked.

Real Magic...,"The Prestige is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is totally unique, keeps you gripped throughout and the plot is so clever and original. You don't see many films about magicians, maybe thats why I found this to be so interesting, and I doubt we'll ever see a better one. The film is not really about magic though. It is about obsession. It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn.""I need to know his secret."" ""Why?"" ""So I can do it better.""By the end, it is difficult to tell who you are supposed to be rooting for, because both main characters aren't exactly good guys, and I think this makes the film very unique. It is not about good triumphing over evil, rather it is about how you can get so caught up in one thing that it rules the rest of your life, and the dangers of becoming obsessed.The acting in the film is superb. If you went to see a professional magician, you'd see the showmanship and antics that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman perform in The Prestige. The special effects are fantastic, as are the illusions that are performed. Michael Caine is, as always, brilliant. He is still proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent.Christopher Nolan's direction is, obviously, brilliant. This is a fantasy film, and he has still made it look completely real. I also think his screenplay for all of his films, especially this one, is the best by anybody. Never does he just put things in front of you to watch. The non-chronological order he uses means that as you go along, any questions you may have are answered along the way, and this makes for a wonderful cinematic experience. I think this sets his films apart from other directors'. In summary, I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan is the real magician here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Top Notch!,"When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.The Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.Two aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ingénieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.At first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.This leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.For those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.Every little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.If someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.I will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clichés, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant!,"When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Shakespearian in both scope and quality,"If the script for The Prestige was found in Shakespeare's house, it would credibly be accepted as his work. It is firmly based in period facts, and goes beyond them. It has the gorgeous talent of allegory, appealing to all, and to each at different levels. If you follow them all, the movie will bring a shiver to your spine when, as layers of reality, each as real as the next, are peeled away in this shrewed screen play, revealing men and man, women and woman, tragedy and joy.So many fragments of the story mirror others: wife's and partners and girl-friends and Daedalus-like science... yet the film holds them all clear in mind. The film itself is finely crafted: gorgeous detailed sets reward the eye, and multiple viewings.The casting is perfect: Bale at his driven, rather than simply raging best. Jackman, so brilliantly failed and jealous, Scarlet and Rebecca hall, in a partnership completely distinct from VIcky Cristina, but which must surely have alerted Woody Allen's eye.David Bowie is perfect and his own fame helps convey Tesla's own struggle with being ahead of his time. The presence of Andy Serkis (You MUST see him in Einstein and Eddington) is becoming a code for must-see movie.This is, simply, one of the best movies of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A mesmerizing masterpiece,"From what I read about The Prestige in the paper, I was expecting an exciting, entertaining little movie from one of my favorite directors starring three of my favorite actors. So, rather casually, I drove up to a nearby theater with one of my friends to see it. I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, but I suspected I would at least enjoy the experience.I can happily say it was the most pleasant surprise of my life. My mind was utterly blown by the dark, beautifully crafted masterpiece that seized control of my senses and not for a moment let go. The plot involves two magicians, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman), who were once partners but are flung down paths of revenge by a tragic event that may or may not have been an accident. From this relatively simple base, the movie spirals down into the abyss of obsession, competition, and plain hatred in a manner that will keep you guessing towards the end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give magnificent performances, aided by a strong supporting cast including Michael Caine and David Bowie(!) Nolan's brilliant directing and Jackman's masterful acting shed light on Angier's obsession that eventually consumes his live, as he desperately seeks to unravel the mystery enshrouding his rival's ultimate act, 'The Transported Man.' The answer to the enigma will drop your jaw and send a cold shiver down your spine. The twists and turns in the deliciously convoluted plot are quite natural, not at all like the cheap gimmickry abounding in the works of M. Night Shymalan.Staged like an enormous magic trick, The Prestige keeps you guessing and, more importantly, questioning. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had seen for several days after I left the theater. The Prestige easily stands as one of the best movies of 2006. I sincerely hope it is given some serious consideration for some Oscars. In my mind, only Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' strikes me as a better movie.""

Mr. Christopher Nolan:  A Genius,"After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility.Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain.No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie.

"Memento (10/10), Batman Begins (10/10), Prestige (You do the Math)","WOW! It's been a long time since we've seen a decent film that excels in almost all aspects. Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, to name a few, were all just amazing. Then again after Memento and Batman Begins...could we've expected anything less from ace director Christopher Nolan. The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads.

Masterful Film-making,"I was fortunate that this movie was still playing at three theaters in my area this week. With junk like Santa Clause 3 and The Return in the theaters, I wanted something that looked truly stimulating.I wasn't disappointed.The Prestige is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. For starters, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Hugh Jackman perform magnificently, and will keep your eyes riveted to the screen. David Bowie was a nice surprise, and the recipient of a makeup job so convincing that my brother and I almost disbelieved it was he. Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are very convincing. Scarlett Johansson's performance is somewhat flat, but she makes up for it with sex appeal and flair.Apart from the acting, the effects, sets, and ambiance of this film make for an excellent period piece. I was particularly enamored with the scenes in Colorado Springs. Simply spectacular.I will reiterate the conclusions of the aforementioned writers. This movie is a magic trick unto itself, with the magnificent writing and twist of plot.You too, won't be disappointed if you go to see it. Leave Santa Clause 3, Deja Vu, Bobby, Borat, and Flushed Away in the theaters. If you can get out to see The Prestige, it is well worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"An interesting movie, but really not that surprising","After seeing the movie, I was surprised by the number of 8, 9, and 10 stars that people gave it, saying things like it was ""the best movie of the year"". I must disagree. This is a movie worth watching for entertainment's sake, since individual aspects of the movie are top notch, but overall I would leave movie of the year to something like The Departed instead.Pro's:1) Very good acting2) Unique plot3) Nice effects, especially when you see how magic ""really"" gets done4) Believable characters -you definitely empathize with both main characters, despite their treachery5) Extremely tight plot. It brings to mind the Harry Potter books, actually - every little detail is important and plays a role. Things that you are think are periphery turn out to lead you to the conclusion. Good foreshadowingCon's:1) So, so so predictable. I was shocked that people were surprised by the ending2) Inconsistent idea. This movie tried to be about two things. It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old ""is there magic"" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing.3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)All in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra ""oomph"" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily.

The Prestige (2006) - Are You Watching Closely?,"Christopher Nolan, the master of tricking the mind, comes back with his biggest hit since ""Memento"". ""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints!

"Well made but off-puttingly complicated at times, especially towards the end","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLondon, the turn of the Century. Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.Director Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.Well, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.The title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.A good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Prestige - It's An Illusion With Little Real Class To Be Found Under The Surface,"Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!If it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing.

Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson all performed wonderfully with each actor fully melded with their on-screen persona.Once again Nolan is a master of time and he uses this to a great advantage in a similar fashion to Memento.Without a doubt, this movie is recommended with two thumbs way up.

Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy.

A Masterpiece of Originality,"It is not often that we are given the privilege to see a truly original story, not a remake with different faces and effects but instead a unique tale. It is a regular complaint by movie enthusiasts that the business is dominated by copied or reworked story lines. This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Pure genius!,"At one point in the film, Hugh Jackman's character says ""That was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" I walked out of the theater thinking the same goddamn thing! This whole movie is just one big trick that the filmmakers have pulled on you, and by the time it's over, you'll realize that you just spent a couple bucks on a huge, two-hour magic trick. This may be my favorite movie ever. Just when you think you know what's going on, something else happens! It is very, very complicated stuff. There are flashbacks upon flashbacks, and it may be a little difficult to follow. Acting a key element in this film, and it's mostly great. Christian Bale carries it all on his shoulders, as he truly is the ""Prestige"" to the film's great rick, which I will not reveal. Hugh Jackman is good as the magician who grows mad with power, but Bale far surpasses him. Michael Caine is as memorable as always, but he's essentially playing a harsher version of the character he played in ""Batman Begins"". One of the best performances comes from Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife, who becomes confused and depressed after he loses his former glory. Scarlett Johannson isn't really offered much to work with but she does have a few memorable moments. The films final twists and turns will leave you so shocked that you realize everything you were going to say you hated about the movie, you now love. See this magic trick. It's very dark and depressing stuff, but you know that you want to be fooled.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Seems like some of the film is missing..because not everything adds up...,"In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Are you watching closely??,"When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.The Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value.

I also consider Batman Begins to be the best of all the Batman films so far, maybe even the best comic book film so far. Christian Bale I also consider to be a fine actor and almost all his performances so far (which I have seen) have been the best I have seen for his age.I was not disappointed, my high expectations were met and at no point during the film did I become bored, the story moved along swiftly and the film did not rely on stereotypical portrayals of the period, Nolan actually made the period feel fresh.Christian Bale as usual gives a stellar performance and Jackman holds his weight as the supporting lead. I was not entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as she seemed quite wooden (and pouts her way through the film) in a role that relied on her looks, a special mention should go to David Bowie who was excellent and will hopefully appear in more serious acting roles.Overall greatly entertaining, not too confusing and deeply engaging.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film.

Set in the late 19th century, the film follows two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who are locked in a fierce competition to create the ultimate stage illusion.Nolan's masterful direction, coupled with a sharp and layered screenplay, draws the audience into a world filled with illusion and secrets. As the narrative unfolds, the film delves deep into the personal sacrifices each magician makes in their quest for supremacy, revealing the darker side of ambition and the complexities of duality. Themes of obsession and sacrifice are woven seamlessly throughout the story, keeping viewers engaged until the very last reveal.Jackman and Bale deliver stunning performances, infusing their characters with depth, passion, and an unsettling intensity that mirrors their rivalry. The supporting cast, including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson, adds richness to the narrative, further enhancing the film's depth.Visually, *The Prestige* is a feast for the eyes, with its atmospheric cinematography and period-appropriate set designs that transport viewers into the world of Victorian magic. The film's editing is particularly noteworthy, masterfully juxtaposing timelines in a way that heightens suspense and intrigue.With its intricate storytelling and haunting score by David Julyan, *The Prestige* is not only a compelling tale of rivalry but also a meditation on the fine line between illusion and reality.

The importance of secrecy. Never think that spies are the best!,"A historical story line which demands a lot of attention to detail and art. Selection of the best in the class cast. Fantasy with realistic touch with scientists as characters. Salute you .. director. you did it well.I have a different view point for a certain point. I believe to keep the essence of the story 'importance of keeping secrets', you could have taken another mystical point to conclude the story. Like the live characters do not able to find out the secrecy even at the climax. May be for a commercial success of the movie, after that point, you could have indicated some points to the audience. Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then. But I believe, a person who sacrificed friendship & love (and many others..I cannot be a spoiler here!) will not do this at certain point to prove something to person who is no longer important to him.once again..

Pulling strings,"Using advanced storytelling techniques (see the Advanced Screen writing Class and the Masterpiece Software) is probably the single best way to set yourself apart from the Hollywood screen writing crowd. But this approach is extremely challenging as well, and if you aren't careful you can weaken the very story you are trying to showcase.In their story of competing magicians, the writers of The Prestige use a double storyteller. While not uncommon in a medium like the novel, this advanced technique is extremely rare in mainstream Hollywood film. Structurally a double storyteller creates two equal main characters. When you have virtually unlimited amount of time to explore character (as in a novel), this isn't a problem. But in the relatively short two-hour time period you have in a Hollywood movie, it's a huge problem.If you add the advanced technique of making both characters unsympathetic, you compound the problem even further. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, characters don't have to be sympathetic. But they do have to be compelling. By cross-cutting between two main characters in the time a writer normally has to define one, these writers make both of their heroes superficial and opaque.The great strength of The Prestige is the plot. But ironically, that simply highlights the fatal weakness of the story. This film about slight of hand and trickery has plenty of slight of hand and trickery in its plot. But without the proper character work, it's all just pulling strings. By being extra complicated, the mechanics of the plot actually become more, not less, obvious. The audience pulls back and notices they are watching a movie.Instead of showing us how clever they are, these talented writers show us how they have failed in the first job of the writer, to make the audience care.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A night with Nolan, Bale, Jackman and Johansson","Very good movie with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Christopher Nolan at the helm. The film moves at a brisk pace, and kept me gripped to my seat. One of Christopher Nolan's better offerings, it's definitely worth watching for its incredible entertainment value. That said, the central characters' penchant for mischief and murder came off as cold and unnatural given their occupation. Beyond that bit of criticism, I would recommend watching this movie.

The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
My Favorite Nolan,"Yes, TDK was unbelievably awesome. Yes, Inception was original and awesome. No, neither of them is Nolan's masterpiece (to date). That title belongs to The Prestige, at least in my opinion. Featuring an amazing pairing of Jackman and Bale, and the hot off of critical failure Insomnia, Nolan's movie scorches from the beginning. Putting Tesla in as a historical anchor was pure brilliance, and with the aid of Tesla technology most of the illusions they pulled off could easily be done, even the shocking ending(s). Therefore, despite what some might say, this is all entirely realistic.In fact, I think Nolan would be smart to re-visit Tesla and do a biopic, because there are few people as insanely weird and full of pure genius, in history, as Tesla was.On the surface, this is a simple magician versus magician period piece, but it slowly evolves into a battle of wit between two incredibly driven men. The twists in this movie, the first time viewing, are nearly impossible to predict (unlike Inception/TDK), and everything comes together perfectly. One of the most under-rated movies, ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Goes Deeper than Necessary,","The Prestige is a good movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a bizarre journey as we follow the lives of two competing magicians who go through extreme lengths to exceed the other. Things begin to heat up quite fast, with some very bizarre twists and turns throughout, showcasing the complications these magicians go through to make everything appear magic.However. I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit.I also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery.Two magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation.Best Performance: Christian Bale",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
excellent movie - a perfect clockwork mechanism,"this movie is excellent... the story is outstanding and the plot full of twists, yet there are plenty of perfectly fitting clues during the movie... acting is good too and the late 19th century setting is detailed and intriguing...While undoubtedly entertaining ""the prestige"" gives you a chance to think about the endless conflict between lies and truth or fiction and reality, stage roles and real life managing at the same time not to judge the characters and leaving to the audience the freedom to decide where good and evil (if any) stand...a ""must see"" for everyone, thought it would be wise to note that during the movie appear a few scenes that while not truly violent might be quite upsetting for a young public...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great acting & cast; plot has few big holes to make this a fantasy film,"Enjoyable film IF viewer ignores obvious plot flaws. Hugh Jackman is born in ""top class"" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.The other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced ""magician engineer"" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.Acting is excellent from entire cast.

"Outstanding, Beautiful, wondrous ...

Different,"A very different setting, a very different story of the art of magic and illusions makes the movie a classic. Bale and Jackman fight it out for the top spot in the theatrical worlds of magic and trickery.

Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen. The dialogs are good, performances great but what makes the flick stand apart from the rest is the imaginative storyline that made me sit the entire movie, moth agape.

Nolan's more modest masterpiece.,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians, Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman). The two battle over deceiving and outsmarting each other as they try to be the better magician. Spanning several years and often jumping backwards and forwards in time, The Prestige is a beautiful, brooding tale about obsession and how far it can and shouldn't go.Being one of Christopher Nolan's more modest films (being made between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and on nowhere near a larger scale), The Prestige is one of those films that only those who pay attention understand it's true greatness. With a typical Nolan-esque cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine), the film is setup for quality cinema and does not disappoint. From start to finish you are fixated and deprived of attachment to the world around you much like Borden and Angier as you too do not want to miss any of the films trickery.One of the best things I like about The Prestige is how it deceives the viewer just as a magician would to their own audience. 'Are you watching closely?' a line which is repeated throughout The Prestige hints at the films very own nature. 'You want to be fooled,"" the last lines of the film as uttered by the legendary Michael Caine, leave the viewer in a bewildered state as they reconsider what they have just seen.The cinematography is grand. DOP Wally Pfister who has worked on all of Nolan's films I believe, deserves just as much credit as the director himself. From the dark and electrifying theaters to the eerie Colorado Mountains, The Prestige looks fantastic.Having seen the film several times and enjoyed each viewing as much as the next, The Prestige continues to amaze me. It truly is a mesmerizing and brilliant film which just cannot go unseen by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Well now, this is a rare case","Typically, if there is a book and then a movie, the book is the better by far. Enter Christopher Nolan, and this is no longer the case.As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling.There is enough foreshadowing throughout the movie to make one giddy. I loved how Nolan chose to focus much more on Borden's personal life than Priest did in the novel. All of the developing back story is gone, but what is gained is worth it in my opinion. Borden's wife, played by Rebecca Hall, was an unexpected treat. She certainly out-performed the other female lead. . .At times, the movie was a little too enunciated, my reason for giving it a 9 and not a 10. Just a little more faith in the audience, especially at the very end, would have been nice.As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier at the end of the movie. A real surprise though was Hugh Jackman. Of X-Men and Kate and Leopald fame, I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought, ""Wait, that's Hugh Jackman. Oh dear, good for him."" Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.Splendid entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It Had Its Moments,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Like the Nolan brothers? This is a must see film.,"A wonderful movie with a twist to beat all twists . . . everything I'd expect from the Nolans.

Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that ""The Illusionist"" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is.

Another Magical Work by Nolan.,"After watching 3 of Christopher Nolan's shows, I really have a high expectation of this movie. In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.""The Prestige"" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's ""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"", though they are effective for their respective movies.I watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.Hugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.Like other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.Despite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar.

"A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film","I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Brilliant,"""The Prestige"" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in ""plot fillers"" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a ""T"" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford.Two days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images.

This Movie is Excellent,"This movie is truly excellent. For some reason this website is full of negative comments on films. The people behind the writing and directing of this film are the same people that made Memento. The acting is superb. The twists are very well done. The trailers don't give away what the movie is about and you are kept on the edge of your seat until the final scene. If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"incredible, should be watched more than once","Watching a movie ten times is stupid. Unless, of course, that movie is The Prestige. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Candy for the mind,"I did something tonight that I have never done before. I saw a first run movie, twice in the same weekend. I can't remember the last time I've seen two first run movies in the same weekend (I suspect it was in high school), I do remember the last time I saw the same movie twice in theaters (Memento).As everyone who knows me know, I'm a serious Christopher Nolan fan. Ever since I saw Memento I've been hailing him as the second coming of Alfred Hitchcock, and have the full expectation that when his career is said and done he will be universally recognized certainly as the greatest director of his time, possibly of all time. Greatness is often achieved by making a single innovation in your craft and repeating it with increasingly mastering execution. No one has ever used non-sequential time lines as effectively as Nolan did with Memento, and my one reservation about his place in Hollywood history has been that that style could never be as masterfully used in another film again... that his second work could never be equaled, let alone surpassed.The Prestige has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment. The flash backs he used in Begins showed that he has an understanding of the technique that is unrivaled, however the use of it was not nearly as complex as it was in his early works. Prestige more follows his first work, The Following's, use of non-sequential time than Memento's in that the ordering of the scenes is very complex, by far his most complex yet. Not only are the scenes ostensibly randomly arranged, but also in parallel following the thoughts of two men at the same time. But of course the arrangement is not random, the order is there specifically to misdirect the audience... much like the magicians in the film do when performing their tricks.But it goes beyond misdirection, the scenes themselves are very powerful imagery investigating guilt, sacrifice and obsession... but the time line adds to that as well. Following seemed to use this style to add to the suspense and give the audience a little puzzle to figure out, Memento used them to do all that and force the audience to feel like the protagonist, The Prestige uses it to do everything that Memento did only the protagonist is not on screen, it is audience. With ever twist and turn you feel the mystique of a magic show, scratching your head not at how anything particular on screen happened, but how the story could come together like it does.The most amazing thing is I still can't figure out how Nolan does it, the emotions Memento and Prestige invoke when seeing them for the first time is pure ecstasy, I know of nothing that can do the same. When its over you wish you could forget everything you just saw and watch it again just to feel that way again and again. But then you watch it again anyhow, because it was so phenomenal with the expectation of not being nearly as good as the first time, and you see all the little things you missed the first time around and just marvel at the mastery of it all and get a chance to look back into the crowd and watch their jaws drop as pieces of the puzzle fall into place.9/10: Not quite Memento but close. My only misgiving is was I was I had the puzzle together enough to see the big picture about half way through the film, although I know only one person thus far who has had the same experience. Expect to see lots of 10's on this one, they're well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Devastating. You will be completely immersed.,"A lot of words come to mind upon seeing this again, and amongst them are ""brilliant,"" ""devastating,"" ""masterful"" and ""diabolical."" The Prestige, for those so shamefully uninitiated, is a pretty much completely perfect film, taking the viewer down a dark, twisted road of revenge, lies and deceit as two former friends destroy each other.There isn't a whole lot wrong with this, and when I said back in March that The Illusionist was better than this, I must not have remember just how good this was. The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent psychological/sci-fi thriller,"'The Prestige' is a classy thriller that appeals to an intelligent audience and is effortlessly one of the best films of the year. Set against the backdrop of a very authentic Victorian London, the film sees two magicians, rich toff Robert Angier and working class Alfred Borden, determined to make their mark in their expertise of thrilling their audiences. But their friendly rivalry descends into bitter, obsessive feud when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife and relations between them sour to a life-threatening extent.The acting in this film is exemplary but then you expect no better considering the actors involved. Christian Bale plays the cool, reserved Borden who maintains his control in contrast to Hugh Jackman's the volatile Angier, a man whose hatred has turned him from suave to almost unhinged in his fanatical need to trump his rival. Michael Caine brings a calm, maturity to the film as Angier's loyal friend Cutter while relative newcomer Rebecca Hall gives an affecting performance as Borden's loving but increasingly bewildered wife.The setting of 'The Prestige' has clearly been put together with love. Victorian London is flawless in depiction, giving the eerie atmosphere of the darker era where there was a sharp divide between rich and poor, the working class were relegated to slums and jails were hellish. The costumes were wonderful in design, especially some of Angier's suits which do well in enhancing Jackman's aristocratic role.The actual plot is filled to the brim with twists and turns that should satisfy any mystery-lover. Sci-fi fans may piece the puzzle together quicker than those left hanging until the end but this should not put anyone off since what really makes the story is the interplay between Borden and Angier. The animosity-- largely kindled by grief, guilt and masculine arrogance-- is fascinating to see how far two men, who could have had successful lives were there not this feud, go in their pursuit to 'beat' the other. Caine's character Cutter offers nice input in showing how far can one man stand back and watch it all happen before he is forced to intervene. There is also a very interesting ethical debate raised, that I won't reveal in deference to those who haven't watched the film.This masterpiece is highly recommended to those bored of conventional, run-of-the-mill blockbusters and want something deeper for a change.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Even spoilers will be of no help!,"The movie, if to be described in a single word, is unbelievable, with the word taken in it's utmost literal sense. Christopher Nolan does his magic on the novel written by Christopher Priest in 1995, and brings it to life in a way no one could have accomplished. With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Higher than Citizen Kane?,I liked The Prestige but this is seriously higher rated than Citizen Kane? The Prestige wasn't even the best movie the year it came out.

Powerful !!!,"Christopher Nolan has directed excellent movies before. There's always a great deal of mystery in his films. This is no exception. Just like in Memento, in the Prestige he uses a fractured time line, giving the necessary information of the future for you to keep wondering how it got there, but he saves the secret for the last minutes.This film is about two magicians who, having been friends and co-workers, begin a rivalry that will eventually destroy them. Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect. If you add that to the acting of Bale, Jackman and the other cast members (Caine, Johanssen, Bowie), a romantic sideline and the sci-fi touch, you get one of the best movies in the decade. No doubt about that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the most phenomenal movies I have ever seen!,"I am very picky when it comes to movies, and I also like all genres. My favorite genre is a psychological thriller. Having said that this movie just blew my mind. In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over.

Did you watch it closely?,"After some of the reviews this film was receiving from the popular press i was quite reticent in going to see it, my major motivation for going was namely the direction of Christopher Nolan and the extremely accomplished acting of Christian Bale, however after i finished watching this film i was nothing but shocked, amazed and truly humbled by one of the greatest pieces of film-making i have seen in rather a long time.I would like to start my review by saying this film is NOT and i repeat NOT about the revelation of the trick and how it was achieved. I have read some rather snooty and sniping comments levelled at this film and how they state that they saw the twist coming from a mile off....that is the point, there are enough clues throughout the film to show the spectator what is going to happen and Nolan does not hide these facts, they are there for a reason and i will not give the true reason away, all i will say is that if you know what makes Psycho and the Usual Suspects such masterpieces then you will know why The Prestige is a film of such ilk.Not only does this film have such a strong story it also sets itself in such a believable period of time, no expense is spared on the set design, the cinematography and editing has all the hallmarks and contemporary feel of a Nolan film, however it adds a haunting and almost tangible feel of impending dread throughout. The immediacy of the film meant as a spectator i was never left flagging and i was shocked to realise that this film was 2 hours and 20 plus minutes long as it felt i had barely sat in my seat before the credits rolled at the end, such the power of this film is that it felt that i had been on a journey with the main protagonists and came out of it a different person.My one concern of this film was the performance of Scarlett Johannsen. I am aware that she is in the film as part of the exposition, however she is that bad and her abilities are that wooden that i still sit here in amazement in how she can still get work in Hollywood, however that is just a small point and thankfully her part is limited.In conclusion i feel that this film will be misinterpreted a lot and if you you like your twists in the Saw or Seven vein (good films that they are) then i feel that you will be left disappointed, however if you want to see a masterpiece of film technique and true grandiose themes then The Prestige will be for you, I watched it closely and i got the point...so the question is did you?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Surprising and thought-provoking,"It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.I have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Dark, depressing, plodding, ponderous, and unbelievably dull","I much preferred 'The Illusionist', as that film at least had likable characters a viewer could hope would prevail, in the end. I've seen 'The Prestige' twice, now, and I think even less of it after the 2nd viewing than I did after the first. But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.Others have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch.

"Great, epic film","This movie is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions.

Superb exploration of its subject matter,"I've just watched The Prestige and thoroughly enjoyed it.I've always had a fascination for stage and street magic - not so much to ""figure out the tricks"", but with an appreciation of the combination, of stagecraft, misdirection, and sleight of hand. The great magicians aren't remembered for ""clever tricks"" - rather, for the overall entertainment, for the illusion.And this film is perfect for all that. There is a mystery to it (in fact, at least two mysteries), but the clues to each are telegraphed all throughout the film, in plain sight. You have to watch and be alert.I figured out one of the mysteries in the middle of the film, but was still fascinated by how it was done. I think this is the same thrill I get when I'm watching a film about con artists (or a good episode of the old Mission Impossible), because what is shown is not always what is.And as this film explains, it's not how such things are done that matters (because once it's explained, no one cares any more), rather, it's that creation of illusion so that we have ""mystery"", that does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A wonderful flick filled with tricks,"It's always nice to see a director-actor duo collaborate in successive projects, especially when they can be removed from the massive studio work situation that surrounds a film like Batman Begins, which is where we find Nolan and Bale, filling in time between Bat films. A subsequent pairing allows the director and actor to further their relationship and speak in a kind of shorthand, bringing their collaboration to new heights. Think of Scorcese-DeNiro and Scorcese-DiCaprio, or Spike Lee-Denzel Washington for examples of this.The term relationship is key, as The Prestige centers around the relationships the characters have with each other and what is perceived as their connective tissue plays both within and beyond the film. The audience is placed in a very strategic position of both knower and seeker of knowledge, and like a good magic trick, it is what we perceive and expect that will equally guide us and trick us towards the final act, or what is referred to in magic circles, as ""The Prestige"".Nolan's previous work (Memento, Following, Insomnia) has built upon his manipulation of audience engagement with film texts, and tweaking our sophisticated knowledge as viewers in such a way that our work as an audience helps propel the film as we are forced to guess, then second guess our preconceived notions of where his films are headed. Without recognizing our intelligence as an audience, the film would have no place to go.The psychology of Nolan's films are like that of a masterful storyteller, akin to Robertson Davies' Fifth Business set of novels. The make up and structure of the medium, whether it is writing or film-making, or magic tricks, is key to the enjoyment of the medium's content. We are well aware as we watch The Prestige, how the film unfolds in three acts, exactly as the magic pieces are described in the film. It is both a pleasure to behold on a story level, as well as a film level. Technically, it is parlaying exactly what it is being mystically told as the plot develops. This movie is a classic example why film schools exist.Without giving too much away, this film is a pleasure on many levels, and worth subsequent viewings to fully appreciate and explore. The cast is perfect, as Bale and Jackman play two anti-heroes, whose sides we can easily assume or oppose, depending on how one reads the film and the characters' motives. Johansson plays a wonderful femme fatale, who we never can quite trust. Is she part of the illusion, or the only source of truth? Where does Caine's character's loyalties lie? His performance may perhaps be the best of the bunch, another testament to how prior work with a director leads to greater performances in their own ability to work in shorthand with each other.If you can't tell by my tongue tied review, this film has volumes to speak about. Another thought provoking piece to add to Nolan's young but impressive resume.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Predictable and Contrived,"There was very little to enjoy in this movie. The characters were so unsympathetic as to create apathy for what ever happens next. The plot was predictable; the twists were contrived and silly.The movie itself, while very stylish and pretty to look at, felt forced. It lacks the smooth illusionist's quality that allows us to suspend disbelief and be deceived or dive in and accept the illusion. Instead it bumps along and tries to bully us into believing that we were just fooled.The greatest success of the movie is the creation of the period. The costumes, sets and scenery do an excellent job of putting us in the setting. Visually, the movie is excellent.Dr. Tesla's scientific solution is a horrible plot contrivance that turns a mediocre movie into a something worse. The result of the experiment fails to surprise or shock. The ""trick"" can be seen coming at us. Personally, I wanted be wrong and hoped there would be some final plot twist that would surprise and redeem this movie. There wasn't.This movie fails to come together.

"Prestige a fun, well made, dark film.","If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before ""The Prestige"" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, ""Oh wow, this is getting boring,"" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie.Magicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the best of friends until Borden accidentally kills Angier's wife during a magic show. They part ways, but Angier is suddenly obsessed with taking revenge on Borden. He sabotages one of Borden's shows and ends up wounding him. Now Borden wants revenge. What follows is a series of one-upmanship between the two rivals.Jackman and Bale are brilliant as always, showing the madness of these characters and their need for revenge. Michael Caine plays a mentor-like character named Cutter with a strong cockney accent, and does amazing. The other actors; Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie, are all noteworthy holding their own against the great acting chops of Jackman, Bale, and Caine. One thing that confused me though, it is never really explained why they go to such lengths to hurt the other, when it was an accident to begin with. This was explained in the book, but not in the film. Everything else though was masterfully crafted, and well explained. The cinematography, the somewhat grainy look, the dark and sometimes humorous approach of the film are all trademarks of Chris Nolan. He showed he could direct with ""Batman Begins"" which also starred Bale and Caine- and he has shown it again with ""The Prestige"". It is a fun film, with plenty of twists and turns, and is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Oh, and if you didn't catch my drift before, read the book as well. I give ""The Prestige"" 9 out of 10. It is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It absolutely blew my mind.,"The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.I did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.The opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician ""Cutter"", are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the ""secrets"" to some of the tricks are revealed.The second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.A rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.That, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather ""true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.Hugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.Christian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.The entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Abracadabra.,"The Prestige sees two rivaling magicians, Borden and Angier, in an intensive battle of wits that goes so far that their lives at stake. The two are portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who deliver powerful performances, supported by an excellent cast of Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and, guess who, yep, David Bowie.Director Chris Nolan again shows his trademark by going back and forth the storyline as the film progresses, much as he's done with the critically-acclaimed Memento and Batman Begins, which, through his skillful execution, is used to tremendous effect. With involvement from his brother, Jonathan Nolan, the duo are able to recreate the suspense and complexity as shown in Memento, intriguing the audience as they are brought deeper and deeper into the story.This is story-telling at its finest.

Tesla - Have you watched him closely?,"The film is brilliant, but its brilliance is also it's greatest downfall. It's a film for the awakened, but a sleeping pill for the already sleepy. To appreciate the film is to already be aware of certain facts, or to have faith in certain schools of thought, primarily the possibility of time travel.Tesla was a genius. A scientific prophet maybe. He claimed that concepts for many of his inventions simply appeared to him in his mind's eye or in a dream. A long explanation of Tesla's life could be made by somebody with sufficient knowledge, which I don't have. But I do have faith - that he was a man who knew things that have changed and will continue to change the world and the way that we think.The film is a truth puzzle. To understand the film, is to understand that there are concepts and ideas that have been repressed from us, to be free from the fear of uncertainty, and to embrace the vast pool of possibility and discovery that is humanity's gift. The film addresses the two polar characteristics of man - his ability to be logical, and his ability to be emotional - and merges them into a mutually exclusive relationship. That is, one cannot exist without the other.For those who are at odds with the film - the prestige of our lives is the discovery of truth, and I encourage those who wish to understand it's message.

To Live the Third Act,"""The Prestige"" will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.In the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret.Thanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the ""living"" on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.Michael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.It's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.Watch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved.

"""You're familiar with the phrase ""man's reach exceeds his grasp""? It's a lie: man's grasp exceeds his nerve."" 🎩","What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick.

It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts.

"My opinion on ""The Prestige""","I had been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced it would be at the helm of Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan (me, being a big fan of Memento), and became even more excited when i first saw the trailer. It looked serious, moody ,dark and just plain interesting.Upon seeing it a week ago, i wasn't let down. At all.I don't need to write down the whole damn summary for this movie, many others have already done that.If you haven't seen this already, i'll just say that your in for a thrilling, dark, sad, violent,complex and enormously satisfying heck of a movie.The thing is just very well acted through. Bale and Jackman are good as they normally are, and they aren't presented as one-note characters as i've read elsewhere. Their characters have motives for their actions, no matter how unjustified and cruel they are, and it doesn't make it seem like we should pity them for that, no, both guys almost hit the bottom of morality here. Michael Caine does a standard role for him here as the Angier's assistant, but he brings his usual charm and his always good acting chops. Perabo and Johanssen are beauties to behold,and both do a good job, though their roles are minor, especially Scarlett's. Hall is good too, and carries a shocking and very sad aspect of the film very well. And David Bowie as Tesla is one of the coolest cameos,ever.The movie itself may be confusing, as it uses misdirection to present situations out of chronological order, but it's never too confusing, you get the time to organize every situation in time for the finale. The only grip i had with the movie, at least at first, was that it started very slowly and took it's damned sweet time on every minor event, and you might loose some of the initial interest or excitement you had.But at least 45 min. into it, it sets itself on overdrive and never lets you go.Oh, and it looks bad ass. The production values are utterly amazing.Just go see it, forget about infamously obvious twist ending, just let yourself in, put your butt cheeks in the damn seat and let the film surprise you and, well, entertain you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Intelligent and incredibly suspenseful,Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006.

The game for the young,"Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, ""Obsession is the game of young men"" In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. ""The Prestige"" starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, ""Watch closely"" In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. ""The Prestige"" perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies; Bale as Batman in ""Batman Begins"". However, there are no heroes in ""The Prestige"". Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his ""Transported Man"" trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"") infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his ""The Prestige"" is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. ""The Prestige"" is one of the year's best movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
How many times can you double-cross your audience?,"In 1890s London, two magicians--once protégés of the same aging illusionist--consistently undercut each other on and off the stage, reveling in the one-upmanship; Hugh Jackman has the show business flair, while rough-hewn toughie Christian Bale is more intent on conquering the intricacies of unexplainable magic. Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Are you watching closely?,"2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes.Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film.It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant.All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Proof that an ending can make or break a movie,"Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.""The Prestige"" is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with ""Memento"" and rejuvenated the ailing ""Batman"" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of ""Insomnia,"" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of ""The Prestige."" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the ""Saw"" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, ""The Prestige""'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.In ""Secret Window,"" Johnny Depp told us: ""The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good."" Too bad the same can't be said for ""The Prestige,"" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Wonderful story of magical rivalry is best seen knowing as little as possible,"The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in.

Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the ""sparklies"" of the box.Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Obsession is a young man's game,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in ""The Prestige"" a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla.

Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!,"The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Great Story, Great Acting, 10 Stars","First of all it really has to be said that Christian Bale is a god amongst men, at least in front of a camera.

Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you.

Frightening about human nature,"This film is powerful, moving, and shocking. It shows what happens when people are suffering, and do not know how to handle their suffering in ways that do not hurt others. What begins as a friendship, then becomes a competition, eventually turns into a maddening and psychotic race to defeat another person and to destroy the other person's entire existence. In doing so, it dehumanizes everyone involved, and is frightening in terms of what it says about our inability to contain our pain. Saul Bellow once said something to the effect that an honorable man is one who does not pass his hurts along to others. These people fail to be honorable, with tragic results. And yet, they are not evil.The storyline, setting, and acting are all superb. David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla is masterful casting. This may be the only filming of this brilliant man, someone who changed civilization, yet was the participant in his own self-destructive competition with someone less talented who we all know, although only because he won the ""competition,"" not because he was more talented or important.This movie, like few others, stays with you.

A magician's life is surely more complex than what I thought earlier. I simply loved Christian Bale's double role. Michael Caine only made it too perfect. Hugh Jackman did his bit as expected, and so deserves mentioning. The movie definitely deserves a rating much better than it's current. Maybe very few people watched it. The Prestige may just be considered Christopher Nolan's best till date. A must watch for people of all ages. It deserved better than everything it earned-in terms of both popularity, as well as gross.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An interesting story well told,"It attracts you at first because it treats a subject everyone likes: magic and its secrets. But then, from the start, you see the plot quickly thicken. Writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has already proved his brilliance with Memento, plays with the timing of the story yet again by skillfully shuffling four different periods in the storyline, and adds an exciting pace by revealing a new twist with every step, so you never get used to anything or bored. The performances are dead-on and the actors very well cast indeed. A little too long, but it pays to see it all through. You want to have some fun? Try to figure out what happens next. The movie will by far exceed your expectations. Very entertaining indeed.By the way, Tesla existed in real life, though I seriously doubt he built all the things shown in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Casts a Magical Spell Even Over the Magic non-Fan,"After a slow start, during which I was tempted to walk out of the movie (but I did not, because I'd read positive reviews here), ""The Prestige"" did cast its spell over me.""The Prestige"" is visually lush, with high production values. Ornate Victorian coaches, gleaming beaver-skin top hats, high and low rent theaters and slums are recreated in glorious, or inglorious, as appropriate, detail.The actors are all fine. Scarlett Johansson did not annoy me as she usually does; the director got a real performance out of her, as well as got her to wear her usual revealing neckline. Hugh Jackman is well cast as a man with a charming surface and a dangerous, secret interior life. I've never seen Michael Caine more appealing. He's the older mentor character here, and he doesn't seem so much to be performing as just being.Christian Bale is riveting as a young, scary, ambitious Cockney magician.I wasn't crazy about David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. (His name *was* ""Nikola,"" not ""Nicholas."") I think of Bowie as a man who shocks, and he was uninteresting here. Tesla is an historical figure who lived a fascinating, controversial life, and I just didn't see much of that on screen. And Bowie's accent was all wrong; it was a big deal that Tesla was a Serb. Depicting him with a Dutch accent, as Bowie seemed to be doing, is kind of like depicting an African American historical figure as a WASP.Andy Serkis, as Tesla's assistant, was one of the most fun things to watch in the whole movie. I kept thinking, as I was watching him, ""Who is that guy? Have I seen that guy before? Whoever he is, he is really fun to watch."" Dang if it wasn't Gollum, from LOTR.The movie offers a few tidbits from the world of magic -- a cameo by famed NY stage magician and historian of magic, Ricky Jay; discussions of how various tricks were performed; magic lore. But this is never heavy handed, and though I'm bored by discussions of stage magic, these scenes didn't put me off.The plot -- well, I can't say anything about the plot. Part of the reason for watching the movie is the pleasure of attempting to work out the puzzle as you watch the film.The plot is a device to depict two men going at each other's throats, and losing their own souls by doing so. Ambition, Envy, Pride, Competition, Secretiveness, Obsession: lotsa big themes we can all relate to, whether we are Victorian magicians or not.What was missing, for me, in this otherwise quite excellent movie, was any emotional depth.A couple of examples.In his early scenes, I had a hard time believing Hugh Jackman as a hungry young magician. He is in his late thirties, and he looks it.His character is married to a much younger woman, who is blonde and pretty, and passive, as a doll. She's little more than fringe on the stage. I had a hard time believing their marriage. Given the importance, to the plot, of their union, this inability to invest in their marriage was almost fatal to my ability to invest in the movie.A key female character's suicide rang false to me for a couple of reasons. This was a very likable character, and her suicide threw the movie terribly off. Her suicide was never reacted to with any appropriate depth. At that point, the movie really did seem like too much of a wind-up toy that existed only to serve its trick ending.This is especially unfortunate, because a key line, ""I love you today,"" and its ultimate meaning, speaks volumes about the nature of love.Poor Scarlett Johansson, who may never overcome the curse of her lush body and director's urges to exploit it, is made to fall in love a couple of times, and her only motivation for taking this monumental step is that she is given seconds-long scenes in which she looks into a man's eyes and -- SNAP! -- falls in love.With just a little work and a few more lines of dialogue and action to fully animate its female characters, ""The Prestige"" could have been that most perfect of creations, a movie that entertains both men and women. For primarily male viewers, there is the clockwork plot and the cutthroat competition. For female viewers, there could have been fully realized characters, including fully realized female characters, inhabiting a film that has a heart as well as a crafty little head hiding schemes.Instead, the only real warmth in the movie comes from Michael Caine, the wise old man whom directors love in a way that they could never love disposable young female beauties like Scarlett Johansson, and a movie that this viewer could very much like, but never love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Uncompelling, so-so script, poor plot.","Like memento, here we have a relative simple story which by telling it either backward or through bits and pieces is supposed to become interesting. On the whole of course that never works for those with an imagination larger than that of an amoeba or for those that have seen the formulaic twist in already way too many predecessors.In the case of Prestige, to my surprise, there wasn't even a twist to speak of which really didn't matter much because the movie became drying paint already so much earlier, albeit in a nice shade of the colour blue.The story of Prestige is practically non-existent. But by telling it by means of flashbacks, tiresomely revealing spoon-fed bits of it, the plot and intrigue unfolds. Fast paced editing to throw in some confusion for good measure and some fake beards and fancy dress-up to, i guess, try to confuse the viewer on who was who and more importantly; when. Yet, as more and more of the story unravels, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a story but more a collection of dreary facts.In the ""Usual Suspects"" for example, there was actually a compelling story unraveling while the writers worked their way towards the twist. Prestige only had some repetitive drama and therefore relied soly on the twist itself. Alas, many spotted the twist some 10 minutes into the film and it was hardly an earth-shattering twist anyway. I found no chemistry between the key-players and Bale and Jackman just lack any charisma whatsoever in their role (the keyword is magical showmenship, something they both lacked) and are therefore miscasted. Think i'm being harsh? Imagine either one of them playing the role of Eisenheim or Leopold, both charismatic characters/actors in The Illusionist.. I rest my case...The performances in Prestige were on par but the script was just too monotonous on too many occasions. On an even more annoyed note: Bowie was unrecognizable, Johanssen reduced to the human equivalent of a tittybar and Sir Cain to be honest, failed to impress but may have done this on purpose as a lesson learned from his literally outstanding performance in Children of Men. Another highly overrated film from 2006 in which his performance painfully made the acting of practically anyone else a complete joke.The cinematography in Prestige, though suiting the story and time in which it was set, was relentlessly dark which really was eye-candy but on the other hand didn't help the many plodding and derivative scenes.The only thing that made the movie endurable was the fine female company I was with, which provided the necessary distraction which made me miss some key-scenes which offered a bit of challenge to work it all out.I guess Nolan just isn't my kind of storyteller and his rather one-tracked stories not my cup of tea.4/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want?","Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want? 'The Prestige' is suspenseful, with a great cameo by a surprise actor, and sub-plots that make you watch the movie five times before putting it all together. Yes, what is better than David Bowie himself being the genius scientist? Well as good as Bowie may be, incredibly enough, a lot in this movie surpasses even him.Magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are co-workers in their young careers working for manager Cuter (Michael Caine). The two end up being enemies after a piece of magic turns fatal. Angier and Borden then battle to become Britain's best magician while constantly trumping each other. The film shows that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive man to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away.'The Prestige' comes from simple terminology used by magicians. As Cutter explains early in the film, there are three parts to a magic trick. The third is the prestige, which is making the object re-appear. The curiosity of the prestige of the great 'Transported Man' trick is what carries the viewers' attention throughout the film, and eventually it awes all in the conclusion.This film is a wonderful science fiction mystery that can make anyone believe that all events in this film are or were humanly possible. The setting is the turn of the twentieth century in Great Britain. Dark colored clothes and low-key dark lighting are used to set the tone of the film. Many shots are taken under stage, in dark dressing rooms, in bedrooms at night, in prison cells, in cemeteries, in secluded forests, and in dark allies. All the foreshadowing of darkness that dawns upon all the main characters involved, from the headlining magicians down to the scientist secluded on a mountainside.The dark colors and close facial shots are very reminiscent of Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind'. Both flicks have a wonderful ability to hold movie-goers' attention and make them debate the possible outcomes up until the end of the film and even after viewing.The magicians show that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive them to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away.

"More like ""Memento"" than ""Batman Begins.""","As a former professional magician, the concept of this movie is close to my heart. It was fun seeing Ricky Jay, a real magician, playing a small part. Equally fun was the faithfulness with which most of the magic was presented. Rather than stoop to the level of camera tricks, the magic presented is the same as it would be presented by any modern day magician.Similar to ""Memento,"" this movie skips about in the time line where some information presented earlier makes more sense later when you see it in context. Be prepared for rather plodding plot more in keeping with the offerings of M. Night Shyamalan with a similar style twisting ending. Personally, I guessed the ending too early.Faithfully reproduces the time period.Personally, I think Hugh Jackman (as Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (as Alfred Borden) are too similar looking in appearance and demeanor, which made keep track of who was whom a bit distracting for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians.","Christopher Nolan directed seven films so far, and The Prestige is his worst one. It's not necessarily bad though. The Prestige is typical Nolan filmmaking. There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Oh what a tangled web...,"When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'!

Complex Plot with Twists upon Twists and a Horrific and Shocking Ending,"I went to this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. Only about one in eight seats in the theater were taken, not that many. Most of the people in the audience seemed young.The movie starts off ordinarily. The first half is a series of events. The movie jumps from one time period to another. Many scenes left me scratching my head. A magic trick consists of three stages: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Like a magic trick the movie started out ordinary. Borden and Angier are two magicians in deep rivalry. They go to great lengths to sabotage the other's work. It got to the point where every time they were performing a magic trick on stage I would anticipate something would go wrong. Many of these tricks involved guns and axes, so I was preparing myself for something very loud and shocking.After about halfway through the rather ordinary story of rivalry turns interesting as the two magicians read their diaries. But still I felt disoriented and didn't fully grasp everything. Towards the end though, everything made sense, and the plot fell together. It is a very complex and very shocking story. It is not just the plot that was excellent. The film seemed to have a lot to say in terms of themes. I won't give away too much but at the end the little girl Jess watches the magic trick that involves the little bird disappearing. She's amazed by it. She may want to know how the trick is done but once you realize how it is done it's probably not a good idea to tell her. Essentially the world is simple, cold, cynical, and miserable, but these tricks give happiness because they suggest this is not so. This deception is not isolated to simple magic tricks. The vanishing bird trick is analogous to what happens to the magicians. Some people will go to great lengths for an art.I enjoyed this film not just for its plot. I started to think that deception is just in the magic shows. They are not just in the characters and their lives. They are everywhere. It watched this movie six days before Christmas and in many ways Santa Clause is a magic trick, a deception. But it's more than that. I look at the football fans in stadiums and wonder whether they are just individuals proud of their teams or country or whether they are just totally deceived by marketers. In my life pretty much everything that gave me happiness turned out to be quite simple, quite pessimistic in reality, whether it's religion, family, or love. There is no magic, just science. There is no emotion, just biochemistry. No country, just politics. No morality, just power. Like the vanishing bird trick, you just don't want to know how it's done.Now when I spoke to people after the movie most of them didn't mention these ideas to me. They were too busy asking me about the mechanics of the plot, who was who, why this happened, and so on. But I think if you plan to watch the movie you should focus on more than what happened on screen. Try to infer certain concepts from the film and relate these to what you already know from experience in your own life. You may be quite surprised.The movie probably shouldn't be seen by small children. One reason is because of the on-screen deaths that occur.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The magic is in not knowing,"The Prestige is for my money, one of the best films on the subject of magic. Christopher Nolan has created a film that, like his earlier film Memento, plays on audience perception. The film is even presented like a magic trick. In magic there is the pledge in which the audience is shown something ordinary. At the start of the film we are shown a trick gone wrong as Hugh Jackman dies, drowning in a glass cage. The turn is where the magician performs the trick. For this film, the turn is the bulk of the storyline as we bounce back and forth through time following Angiers (Jackman) and fellow magician Borden (Christian Bale) as they study and master magic tricks. A tragic accident causes Angiers wife to die and a rivalry to grow between the two magicians. We watch as Angiers grows increasingly obsessed in his search for the secrets of Borden's tricks. Borden in the present tense of the story is on trial and sentenced to hang for Angiers death. Mixing these events, Nolan tantalizes the audience with many sleights of hand which will leave you guessing. It is only the end, or the prestige of the trick that all is revealed and we see how this story has truly played out. While I won't give up the twist, it is a very fun twist that does nothing to dampen the rest of the film. The Prestige is dark to be sure but there have been darker films over the years. Kudos go to Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale for standout performances and to Nolan for a superb script and nuanced direction. Give this one a go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Prestige"" has amazing twists, amazing reveal","What makes ""The Prestige"" so different from other films is that the storyline is so fresh and original. So many times we have seen stories about a secret agent on the run or superheroes saving the world. But the Prestige concerns two magicians obsessed with mastering the new arts of magic tricks, and their obsession, even to the death, to figure them out before the other.Christopher Nolan's film-noir style brings a very brooding and ominous feel to the film, which in the end, turns out to be very deathly and the audience realizes that the climax has been met by a series of lies.Yet, when you feel like you understand what is happening in the plot, either a twist occurs or you reach the end of the film realizing that much that has happened was a lie anyway. This may be an ambiguous way to describe the events of ""The Prestige-"" but this is indeed the way the movie goes, until you are left at the end full of additional questions that you thought you already had the answer to- and want to see it again as soon as possible! 4/4 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Pretty people in pretty costumes,"As sometimes happens in Hollywood, two films with extremely similar plots are released the same year—Capote and In Cold Blood, Florence Foster Jenkins and The Florence Foster Jenkins Story, The Darkest Hour and Churchill—Christopher Nolan's The Prestige came out the same year as Neil Burger's The Illusionist. If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman. Both plots seem to dance around someone who will stop at nothing in his quest to find out the truth behind the magic tricks. I've seen both films all the way through, and I still have trouble telling them apart.If you're looking for eye candy to go along with your magician story, The Prestige is the one to rent. Hugh Jackman, in his clean-cut handsomeness, is the star. If you liked him in Kate and Leopold, you'll be very happy to hear he looks almost identical in The Prestige. He and Christian Bale spar off one another, since they both seem to be master illusionists—oh, wait, that's the word from the other film. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is Hugh's girlfriend and assistant, and Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Roger Rees join the supporting cast.Christopher Nolan, creator of the slew of Batman remakes, cast two of his favorite actors in this film after working with them in Batman Begins: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. It's really nice to see the actors and actresses working well off each other, which isn't particularly surprising since most of them worked together in various films before. While some of the twists and turns of the plot are entertaining, as is usual with a Christopher Nolan script, as the end credits roll, audiences are able to find some flaws if they choose to think about it.

On reflection, Christian Bale isn't that great and his accent really seems put on and not natural. Michael Caine is fine and Scarlett Johansson is mostly OK, though she doesn't always convince. There is also a nice little cameo from David Bowie. The effects are clever and the actual story is pretty good. So why wasn't I more blown away with this film?

Somehow, the writers managed to make the story totally unbelievable in every way as well.

A dark and twisting snake of a film!,"The Prestige is an awesome film. The character development is done really well and I was drawn into the film despite being sceptical of it.For me it was Christian Bale that stole the show. He favours the understated style of acting and understands that a lot of the time less is more. This makes for a believable and heart felt performance.My favourite aspect of the film and part of its beauty is the way the film is been structured. The explanation at the beginning of the film of the three stages of a magic trick could also be applied to the plot. The following quote sums up how the film is created: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The Prestige has more than enough twists to keep you on edge and even though you know they're coming they're still clever.For all the praise I can give there are few criticisms. Parts of the storyline don't quite seem to fit together. I found myself having to let a few faults and coincidences go in order to enjoy the film.I particularly liked the three levels that the film operated on. As a simple film about two magicians feuding with a colourful storyline; as a drama that sucked the viewer in and made the characters problems and successes your own; and finally the level that makes this film stand out was the darker side to the film. A plot that reveals itself in the end as a sinister struggle full of death and treachery.The Prestige is a must see so book your ticket now! : )",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Beyond good and evil,"Nolan's last haunting masterpiece is an impressive allegory about ambition, sacrifice, arrogance, obsession, titanic effort to go beyond natural limits and to challenge God. Nietzsche ""Ubermensch"" concept is embodied in the fight between these two Victorian-Age magicians, as well as the conflict between science and wizardry, instinct and rationality, respect of the rules and compulsive intention to go beyond good and evil. When you go out of the cinema, you think about the inner sense of this movie again, and again, and again...

"great movie, dark story about an all consuming rivalry","""The Prestige"" is a movie by the same writers/director as ""Memento"" so I had great expectations and luckily I wasn't disappointed at all.First of all it looks great, a lot of effort went into the details of the locations and costumes etc. It's very moody and the whole atmosphere of a late 1800's England fits just right. The acting is great too, all characters in the story are understandable and believable. Also, by introducing the historic character Nikola Tesla a certain it-could-be-true feeling is added to the movie (very entertaining performance by David Bowie by the way).The movie covers a long time-span and shows many interesting locations, so in a way it's also an adventure movie. There are several twists but it's all integral to the storyline and not just some gimmick. As always with these kind of twists, a lot of people pat themselves on the back because they figured it all out right away (or so they claim). But for me the twist wasn't the biggest surprise in the end.Instead, the amazement comes when you think about what the main characters must have been through all along, the sacrifice.

"The prestige has a ""prestige""...","First of all Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman was a great choice for the roles and also i don't think anybody could expect anything less from the young but talented Christopher Nolan.Everything about the movie from the costumes the music to the atmosphere puts you right inside the it.I don't want to get analyzing the scenes or what happens to during the movie because i think that the best part is to go the cinema and just be surprised,not only with the quit different story but from the fact that even when you think that you know whats coming up next you will probably be wrong because you'll be surprised again.For me this is one the best privileges that a movie can have since when you are a movies fan after so many movies you have watched it seems like you're always going to know what is going to happen,even maybe the finale of the story from its beginning. Another really realistic and maybe somehow terrifying fact that you become aware of by watching the movie is what one can do to achieve his biggest desires. In general its a very smart movie,the plot never lets you slack. I don't like getting overstate but this might be for me the best movie of the year.It's a must see.If you are a movies fan watching this movie will remind you why you became one,on the other hand if you are not,this I think is a great reason to start being one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Really dark and twisted...,"Christopher Nolan's latest offering from his brother's story is not only a dark and thrilling adventure filled with mysterious plot twists but also a brilliant character study. The two leading characters are written wonderfully and their style of never-ending rivalry was really a pleasure to watch. Their contrasting style as magicians, their markedly different points of view were really designed well. It was an interesting take on how success changed their lives in two different manners.Like the characters they play, the two leading actors also constantly kept on trying to outshine each other. Jackman pulls off a very convincing and controlled performance as Angier, the perfect entertainer. But I must say it's Christian Bale who steals the show as the mysterious Alfred who never lets out a secret until it's time. His character has so many dimensions and his performance is just utterly flawless. You can see mystery in his eyes and smell it in his words.Among the other actors, Michael Caine again delivers a purely professional supporting role. Scarlett Johansson as Olivia is somewhat one-dimensional and she did not receive the best dialogues too. It was fun to watch David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. I think he does a fair job to this sort of off-beat character.Nolan's direction is the major thing which makes this film tick. He spreads the story into several non-linear segments and although it might seem confusing to the audience to follow the plot in this different time-period segments, it successfully enhances the atmosphere of mystery. The plot twists are never rushed and each takes its own time to grow. Although I didn't like the absurd basic idea behind the true explanation of 'transported man'... still the ending is excellently executed.May the Nolans keep this quality up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Disappointing,"Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. ""The Prestige,"" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no ""Memento""; it's not even a ""Batman Begins.""What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity.6/10. A big disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fine Looking Production Wasted on an Incoherent Script,"Christopher Nolan's latest puzzle movie is like a big heaping plate of spaghetti: when taken together, it looks like a complete and satisfying meal, but if you pick up any one noodle individually, you find that it's not connected to any of the others and just trails into nothing.I felt like a complete moron walking out of this movie, because I completely missed the big surprise twist at the end. My wife had to explain it to me on the way home. But in thinking back on the movie, I decided that the fault did not lie with me (or so I'd like to believe). Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have written a muddled and confusing screenplay, in which every single plot detail (and there are many) gets equal weight and nothing takes central focus. The ending doesn't feel so much like a creative twist as it does a cheap trick.The performances are fine, though none of the characters ever comes alive. There's so much intricate plot to race through that no one has time to develop any nuance into their roles, and all of the characters serve as ciphers for the plot rather than as psychologically believable and consistent individuals. Christian Bale comes off best; Hugh Jackman is as bland as ever; Michael Caine is just kind of there; and Scarlett Johannsen may as well not even be in the movie for the importance placed upon her.Movies like ""The Prestige"" bug me. They spend all of their time trying so hard to trick and mislead that they never get around to telling a compelling story that I care anything about. Five minutes after you walk out of the theatre, the plot starts unraveling like wet Kleenex, because the film doesn't build its plot from the character level up (which the other magician film from this year, ""The Illusionist,"" did and which is why that's a better movie). ""The Prestige"" is a magic trick that leaves you wanting your money back.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A real gem; a movie that is thoughtful, creative and brilliant","This must be one of the real finds of 2006 for me personally. Not that my expectations of this movie were a little low but that I just thought that this type of movie could only go so far in terms of plot and direction. With some excellent twists, tremendous acting and engrossing storyline The Prestige came out as quite possibly my choice movie of 2006. Let me start with the acting. Just excellent, with the likes of Jackman and Caine and even David Bowie putting in a great cameo appearance. Christian Bale, once again, proved that he is an excellent talent. I think his range of acting makes him one of the most sought after actors of his generation and he has never disappointed when I have watched his movies.The story revolves around two competing magicians/illusionists, who after an unfortunate event begin an obsessive game of cat and mouse to see who comes out on top as a premier magician. Both performers do not hold back to sabotage each other's acts as the game gets increasingly more sinister and deadly. The movie, for me anyway, starts off a little slow, but I promise you to persevere. The effort you'll put in to understand each man's motivations, to understand their backgrounds and to lay the foundations for the second half is well worth it. I cannot emphasise this point enough as at one point, I must confess I thought 'just what is the point here?'. But the movie begins to make sense and comes together quite expertly and as the pace lifts you'll be wanting more by the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The film is a carefully woven tale of two magicians and their rivalry, and is something that keep you glued to your seats right till the end. Now thats some storytelling. A must see for Nolan's fan and I just kept thinking, how does he do it. The Memento and Batman Begins fame director/screenplay writer at his best again.

Don't forget Rebecca Hall,"Not much to add to the comments about a film that will be remembered as an outstanding milestone in the careers of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Christopher Nolan. Except to note that Rebecca Hall turns in a heartbreaking performance as the loving, tragic Sarah, victim of her husband's obsession, despite his partial (not exactly the right word but what is) love for her. Her perceptive take on the secret defining her husband's twisted nature is the essential clue in the movie, though so subtly put that it's almost impossible to catch until that secret is revealed.What a year for great movies! ""Illusionist"", ""Scarlet Veil"", ""Prestige"", ""Last King of Scotland"", ""Babel"", ""Scandal"", etc, etc...And even the flawed films like ""Good German"" had riveting performances. Film is back this year in a fantastic way and ""Prestige"" is one of the, if not the, best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Clever, but not highly compelling or memorable","A very clever film (not surprising for a film about a couple of magicians) that is so concerned with being clever, that it becomes a little confusing. I was left thinking I needed to watch it again, not because of the pleasure I had watching it, but because I wasn't sure I ""got it,"" completely. The problem was that I had absolutely no sympathy for the two magicians who were so self absorbed, and mean spirited in their relentless ambition to out-do each other, that I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. Also, I think it was a little too long for what it was, to the point of getting a little tedious. All this is not to say that there aren't some positives. Firstly, the cinematography in this film is outstanding. I saw this on DVD, but I can imagine it would be great on the big screen. The wardrobe and set design where excellent, which really helped bring an aura of authenticity to this period piece. The acting was pretty darn good as well, which is no surprise, considering the veteran talent in the cast. I enjoyed seeing David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla; he so transformed into this character that I didn't realize at first who the actor was. Also, it added an element of interest to call attention to Tesla the man, whose visionary theories are considered revolutionary, even in modern times. Although duplicating people...this may be a little much even for Tesla. But I'm no expert on Tesla. The Presence of Scarlett Johansson in the cast was also one of the reasons I wanted to see this film. Her role here, though, was a little on the insubstantial side. Not surprisingly, she is cast typically (it seems, lately) as the smokin' hot eye candy of the film. She certainly is capable of playing character roles of much more depth, as I have seen in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" for example. Nonetheless, I think she did do a good job here, for what it was. So all in all, I would have to say that for me this was a mildly interesting and entertaining film, though certainly not highly compelling or memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Brilliantly written and executed,"I heard from a friend who saw this that this was the most brilliant made movie she had ever seen, and she couldn't seem to emphasize that enough. That was enough to get me to see it in the theater (which i rarely do). This was easily worth the price of admission. The plot line is genius and keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. Even if you guess one of the twists in this movie, you will probably find that you overlooked 1 or 2 more that you didn't see coming at all! This movie was so good, I went to the theater two days later and saw it again. It's wonderful the second time, too. Maybe about as good as the first time. I noticed more and more very smart aspects of the movie the second time that I didn't catch the first. I didn't know it was a Christopher Nolan film (Memento, Batman Begins) until after I watched it, which didn't surprise me as his work has always impressed me in the past, and continues to.

I'm surprised yet not at all shocked ...,"At the professional critical reviews that ""The Prestiege"" has been garnering. To claim that The Nolan Brothers have under-written or half-directed this movie, or that ANY of the players on screen gave less than stellar performances is as great an injustice as walking out on the film halfway through or before it's wonderful climax. In fact, I'm convinced that some of the critics may HAVE done just that!! Sure, some of the ""twists"" are a bit predictable for the above average cinema sleuth, but overall, there is a very clear dichotomy between the audiences in the film watching the ""magic"" on stage wanting to believe it is real, and the audience in the theaters watching this film and wanting to believe that the magic ISN'T real.This film is easily the best I've seen this calendar year, and The Nolans are quickly rising to the upper eschelon of my favorite filmmakers. Again, wonderful, layered performances from all of the involved cast, and beautiful set design and cinematography all around.

Miraculous cinematography,"I admit, I 'm fun of Nolan movies. However is really difficult to avoid comparison with his older masterpieces, especially the memorable ""Memento"" and yet this one is one his highest achievements undoubtedly. A few notes only that worth a few arguments: the very persuasive sense of the era of late 1800s, one of the most interesting of all times; he managed to give the deepest depth of the 2 main characters and the master Caine, at his best roles/acting ever, he fitted like the hand in glove; for a movie that could easily slip in the category of ""entertaining"" aspect of cinema ,mainly,because of the theme itself never did. Is the first time that I see the beloved Scarlet J and not ""concentrate"" on her at all, neither even comment on her; the plot and the mystery wouldn't leave my notice a moment to spent on her physical assets, but the serious part of the plot; that had never had an inch of chasm, neither left any doubt to the rather unbelievable, almost surreal happenings and scenes; the logic was always there masterly hidden. Also the Tesla character is as peculiar as should be; N Tesla was one of the most genius, non-conventional scientists of all times and the choice of Bowie added a lot to that feeling. Of course, last but not least, the astonishing ending, that one moment ago could not be expected neither imagined in such an imaginative scenario.

Disappointingly obvious,"There are many reviews on this site saying how after The Prestige they walked out of the theater in awe with jaws dropping. Personally, I didn't get it.The movie was a trick badly done. The ""turn"" is too transparent, revealing all the secrets to one that isn't simply waiting for the prestige. That is, by the middle of the movie, you can have a pretty good idea of how it will end. This would be fine if not for the fact that the ending is really all this movie is about. I suppose you might be able to enjoy it, if you're not that analytical and just take things as they are.Personally, I enjoyed The Illusionist much more, although that movie too had an all-too-obvious plot.Finally... as for those denouncing Tesla, rumors have circulated even until today about his experiments. The trick with the lightbulbs as seen in the preview? That was, and is, possible. Yes -- Tesla invented it. Tesla experimented with all kinds of things, including the technology seen in this movie. If anyone could have accomplished such a feat during that era, it would have been Tesla. This is a work of fiction so do take it with a grain of salt.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A masterpiece - and Morgan Shepard is in it, too!","This movie was a big surprise for me. I expected some kind of mystery thriller, but this movie was for more sophisticated as I thought it would be.First of all is the complex way it is narrated, with a narrator at the beginning and the end, but mostly a visual presentation of a diary that also takes into account another diary read by the owner of the first diary - and the owner of the second diary reads the first diary in jail! That's not the usual sweet and simple Hollywood brain candy, and it's obvious at this point that the movie must be based on a clever novel. That's probably also were the script's meditations on the nature of show magic come from. The ending will be a big, big revelation, but all the loose strands come together in a very ironic climax.Photography is good, if somewhat gloomy, fitting the plot, of course. But it's a wonderful break from the artificial and computer game like looking photography often found in Hollywood movies today.Acting is great overall, that's all there is to say. David Bowie is wonderful as the somewhat sinister, faustian inventor Tesla. And, of course, I was so surprised when I saw Morgan Shepard in his small but wonderful part! He's a magnificent and distinguished actor who mostly gets small parts, which is quite a shame. He was also in Ridley Scott's Duellists or the Seaquest TV serial.Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the score: while this bland and repetitive piece of music works OK in the movie (you don't hear much of it), it doesn't survive the light of day on a CD. That's no big surprise, though, when a score is ""produced"" by Hans Zimmer, that overrated wannabe score composer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Three Parts Of A Magic Trick,"The Pledge:Christopher Nolan, the brilliant man who brought us Memento and Batman Begins and soon The Dark Knight, brings us The Prestige. Starring Hugh Jackman, Wolverine from the X-Men movies and soon to have his own film, and Christian Bale, Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The movie is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Jackman and Bale respectively.The Turn:Their rivalry is something more than two competitors. It becomes about revenge. Eventually one of them discovers an amazing trick. Soon the other becomes obsessed with finding the secret. Everything he does becomes about finding the secret to the first trick. Later he finds an even better trick. A trick so astounding that not even the man who builds most of the tricks can understand it.The Prestige:Trusts are broken. Loyalties are tested. Loves are lost. Watch the movie carefully. This one requires you to pay attention and follow along. The movie is told in a non-linear format, even more so than Memento. There are subtle clues in almost every scene. This is no movie to text-message, make out, talk with friends, or even go to the bathroom during. Each and every scene helps to build to this mystery of what's going on. Missing one scene means certain confusion. It's not something you can half pay attention to. Even if you do pay attention you might just have to see it again just to see all the build up to the final trick.The Response:Amazing. Though if you found Memento confusing you may want to skip this one. But if you're a Christopher Nolan fan or always like a good mystery you will be sure to enjoy this one. Enjoy this one while you can. Movies with this level of excitement do not come around too often.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Story-telling at its finest,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as a pair of young, up-and-coming magicians who start out as friends, but eventually become the bitterest of rivals with each man obsessed with finding out the other's methods.What amazes me is just how well told the story is. It pulls you in with the opening scene and just doesn't let go. The film doesn't follow a linear path. Instead, it starts off by providing a glimpse of film's final stages and then goes back and fills you in on what happened to arrive at that point. The film frequently jumps between different time periods, in some places juggling three time periods at once, but it's done so well that it's never confusing about where you are in the story.The subject matter deals with magicians and their methods for tricking audiences. What really makes it interesting is that the film is put together like a giant magic trick. When you reach the end, everything just falls into place and fits perfectly. Repeat viewings don't detract from the movie at all. Rather, they simply add more depth to the overall story. You gain a greater appreciation for the acting and story-telling and are more aware of how the film's props hint at the story's eventual outcome.The performances are fantastic all around. Hugh Jackman gives a noteworthy performance as Robert Angier, an originally decent man who has allowed himself to become twisted with hate and obsession with learning fellow magician Alfred Borden's tricks. Christian Bale delivers a top notch performance as Borden, the target of Angier's obsession. The excellence of Bale's performance isn't as immediately obvious, but during repeat viewings subtleties and nuances of his performance that are tough to spot the first time become more obvious. Lastly, Michael Caine is excellent in a supporting role.All told, this is just one fantastically made movie. Highly recommended. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Hugh Jackman is Australian putting on a fine American sound. Christian Bale is Welsh providing an impressive London street sound.There will be a need to see the film a second time, to see how cleverly the screenplay was written. Beautiful work.

Sure if you didn't notice, thinking back about the details will blow your mind, but I think it's too obvious what's going on.

Christopher Nolan gives us another masterpiece,"""Are you watching closely?""The Prestige is yet another mesmerizing film helmed by Christopher Nolan. A masterpiece in most respects, it sucks the audience in with its complex and riveting narrative and benefits from an amazing cast and fantastic production choices.

Every viewing reveals more of the impressive way Nolan foreshadows what's to come, giving the viewer everything they need without resorting to cheats. Every detail is thought out, every clue carefully placed. With its opening voice-over, Michael Caine informs the viewer exactly what the film will accomplish and how you will feel.

Never did I see any single actor command a stage as he did. Hugh deserved every accolade awarded him. The show itself was quite good but Jackman was BETTER than the show. The problem is that this stage genius makes lousy movies and ""The Prestige"" proves it.First of all, it cannot compare to this years excellent ""Illusionist."" Not even close. ""Prestige"" was filmed in the dark--by that I mean every scene was dank, dark,ominous,creepy, crawly and downright annoying. I felt like I was sitting in an unlit cellar. The plot was highly confusing. The English brogues were as thick as mud and difficult to understand. The acoustics was awful. They needed Tesla like a hole in the head. All those top hats lying around ranked stupider than stupid. Novocaine was better than the usually brilliant Michael Caine.

Who ever thought that a story on eighteenth century magicians could be so interesting, involving and damn it, I have to agree it was deceptive, it does not fit in with the mind boggling sci-fi movie category but the script was so well written, that one cant just appreciate the movie if he does not get involved with it. The logic for a part of the ending can be conceived with many possible start points, but the beauty of this movie is, whatever be the start point and whatever be the path of your reasoning, you'll end up saying ""wow"" to the end. You might continue to debate on the nuances behind ""how it could have happened"", but you'll never debate on the quality of this gem. Congrats Mr. Nolan, ""The Prestige"" is the rightful successor to ""Memento"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An excellent movie to watch after ages............,"Well, what can i say, it was one of the best movies i ever watched. Christopher Nolan has always been one of my favorite Hollywood directors. I have always enjoyed all his movies, whether it was the memorable Memento or the beginning of the new chapter in Batman Begins. But over here, Nolan has managed to portray a fine movie despite making some changes to the original plot by Christopher Priest. Nolan has managed to pull out excellent performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine, as ever is, dependable on his role as the sidekick. The ending of the movie actually leaves the viewer gasping for more. I strongly suggest this movie for viewers to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Are you looking closely?,"The Pristage is a great fantasy drama film, that keeps you engaged to the very end. Once you have finished the film, you will want to watch again immediately to see what clues you missed after the surprise ending. I love this unique and well made film. Nolan is such a great film maker. He always seems to cast the right actors for his films. This movie plays with your imagination and keeps you guessing towards the very end of the film.

A mixed bag of tricks.,"The Good: Great plot twists, very cool magic tricks, and of course, Michael Caine.The Bad: Three alternating time lines is confusing most of the movie, some of the twists are easy to spot before they are revealed.Too Small: The role of Scarlett Johansson's character.Any movie about magicians has to satisfy one cardinal rule: have lots of magic tricks to totally dazzle the audience. The Prestige follows this with true style, and the first time you see Alfred (Bale) perform his trick, ""The Transported Man,"" your jaw will be hanging down as you think, ""how the hell did he just do that?"" It's moments like that that make this movie lots of fun to watch, but you will certainly long for more than they give you, taking into account the length of the movie. At two hours and twenty-one minutes, it's like a roller-coaster going at half-speed. Sure, there's thrills, but it still leaves everyone hungry for a boost in the pace. Probably the best (and worst) example of this is a moment in the film's finale when, as a certain character dies, his last breath seems to come out twenty different times for him to spit out a Shakespearian soliloquy before he finally croaks. You can practically hear everybody in the theater thinking the same thing: ""Just die already!"" Before you check this movie off of you ""must-see"" list, however, take into account that despite the length, this movie is quite entertaining. The story of two competing magicians seems like it might be as dry as a bone, but the grudges that Alfred and Robert (Jackman) hold against each other are not just about pride; they are genuinely driven by heart and soul. It's easy to see how much these to guys hate each other, and don't worry about not knowing why, because you'll find out within the first half hour of the movie.As far as performances go, not enough can ever be said about Michael Caine. His brilliance as an actor steals ever scene he's in. Jackman has probably had his best performance thus far in his career, except maybe for Swordfish. Bale is terrific as always, bringing every part of Alfred right into your face. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job, but her role was far too small, and at the end of the film you'll be wondering why her character, Olivia, wasn't explored a little more.When you actually do go out and see the movie, a fit of confusion is going to come over you quickly, possibly lasting into the last 40 minutes. It's not the plot twists that will confuse you; those are pretty ambiguous, and many people will call them out before they are revealed. No, the way this movie hurts your brain is with its three time lines, which alternate between scenes. In the beginning, Robert is dead, and Alfred is going to prison. Then, all of a sudden, they are young, up-and-coming magicians. And before you know it, we're with Robert in Colorado, as he tries to find the secret behind Alfred's greatest magic trick. Sometimes, you will think that these time lines come in sync with each other, but I'll save you a lot of of confusion right here: they don't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Very well acted, one of the best films done for a while","I had seen the trailer for this film but didn't know what to think of it. I put off watching it several times, but when i eventually did watch it.... WOW!!!! What a fantastic film it turned out to be. Michael Caine is great, as are the two leading male roles. Plus the added bonus of the gorgeous Scarlett Johannson, she is just simply stunning. She'd look good in whatever you dressed her in, plus she can act too. The twists and turns in this film are great, they keep you hooked right till the end, and what an ending. The other good thing about it is it takes you back in time to explain certain things that happen in the movie. Very well directed. I enjoyed it that much, i took my girlfriend to see it a couple of days later, and thoroughly enjoyed it once more. Really is a must see film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Good show, but just short of true magic.","In some sense, you can consider The Prestige Christopher Nolan's return to his Memento tricks after his bat-movie excursion. Working again with his writer-brother Jonathan, Nolan brings us back to a movie that spins and whirs with movie magic, but as much as I'm impressed by the presentation of the film, I feel like somewhere along the way, the film lost its heart. Let me explain.The basic setup is this: Two young magicians become bitter and deadly rivals after a trick goes wrong. When we start the movie, we hear Michael Caine telling us the basics of magic. There's the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Nolan (or shall I say Nolans?), trickster that he is, takes this concept of magic and uses it as the structure to the film as well. This is akin to how Nolan built his narrative structure in Memento around the memory loss concept, but in The Prestige, the story is told far more straightforwardly than its predecessor, even with all of its twists and turns.Yes, this is a movie about magic, like its recent colleague The Illusionist and like what you'd expect from a film about magic, things aren't as they seem in the film. But the Prestige left enough clues early on that a well-read kid like me could pick up on all the twists and turns before they came. Fortunately, the film still manages to be quite fun even if you know what's coming up because the presentation of the film is quite enjoyable. Nolan has this stony directorial style that bathes everything in a shade of cool, which works really well for movies about bat-themed crusaders and yes, even about magic.On the downside, the film spends so much time trying to be tricky that I think it misses out a little on the tragedy of the two characters. Not to say that it doesn't touch on it, but I feel the overall film would've benefited a bit from focusing just a little less on the ""ooh, I'm so clever"" turns and a little more on the different effects of obsession on the main characters and its consequences on their lives. By the time the credits rolled, I saw that the film was trying, but it wasn't enough to get me at a visceral level. There was too much cool, too much showmanship and it was all very entertaining, but I saw hints of a really good drama underlying it all and I think it got lost a little in all the show.I loved the period stuff, I loved that Nikola Tesla was put in the film, played surprisingly well by rocker David Bowie. The minor characters and the major characters, I felt, were all played well and the direction was clear. I do have to admit that I probably would've been even more impressed by the film if I wasn't able to peek behind the wizard's curtain and figure things out too early. And unlike The Illusionist, this film does resolve its magic, so you're not left unsatisfied by an ambiguous story.The other problem I had with the story is that it was hard to develop sympathy for the main characters once they started battling. What they do doesn't draw sympathy anymore because there doesn't seem to be much left to redeem--both characters become shells of men and there's nothing left for me to hope for. Despite the fact that we are given the perspective of Hugh Jackman's character, I found myself just as much concerned (even though it wasn't much) for Christian Bale's character. But since both characters have such despicable traits and neither seems to really manage to overcome them or add a real dimension of humanity to them, they become a little two-dimensional.But still, I was genuinely entertained, just by the impressive presentation and storytelling. And it's a rather enjoyable film about magic. I was just let down because the setup had potential to be a little more and it didn't seize it. A rather enjoyable film, but not great. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The period setting was totally convincing and the on stage drama the best since Amadeus. The intense atmosphere created by Bale and his stage rivals really keeps your eyes glued to the screen.

The story is somewhat hard to understand, because it will sort of flash from the past to the present and you sort of lose track if your not watching closely.

The Prestige,"A truly great movie that keeps the audience anticipating what is going to happen next throughout. ALIST cast, along with a master director. A film that doesn't receive the credit it deserves. Doesn't stick to a particular genre and holds acting performances that I believe Oscar worthy. Hugh Jackman, the gifted method actor swaps his aggressive wolverine blades and plays a obsessive magician who holds every card in his pocket; the love of showmanship. However, Jackman isn't the only magician in this monumental tale of rivalry. Christian Bale also plays as his bitter rival. Bale, being the best magician in my opinion, although he doesn't hold the same characteristics and showmanship as Jackman, it is hard not to be fooled by the magicians mysterious ways and Bales tremendous acting displaying his love for magic and trickery. A love story for the obsession of magic and being a entertainer surrounds the movie, along with other hard hitting life events. Loved ones lost from Both sides, this tale of two men fighting against each other is sure to keep you guessing while you crunch on your movie food and it is nearly impossible to predict what happens next from beginning to end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"good, but slightly over-rated","By now we know that the unexpected would be for Christopher Nolan to make an expected film. Yet, 'The Prestige' is to some extend the most expected film of Nolan until now. It is an adaptation of a novel about the rivalry between two magicians turned into a life long obsessive fight, and although we do find interesting issues like the relationship between perception and reality and the border between life and illusion for an artist, the overall script is too much conventional in structure. The most disappointing is the ending, sure, we get an explanation for much of what we have seen, and the explanation makes sense, but then the magic is gone. You do not explain magic and expect for magic to stay.On the good side we have a strong hate story, which stays in the memory on the memorable stories of rivalry brought to screen, in the line of the 'Count of Monte Christo'. The script is well written, with some memorable lines. We also have Michael Caine whose every new act seems now to radiate personal charisma and the joy to be with us and act for us. Please Mr. Caine, stay with us and act for us forever.On the less good side I will put the acting in the two principal roles. Contrary to the majority of the opinions I do not believe that either Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale did a memorable job here. I mean they were OK, but the roles offered much better opportunities. Scarlett Johansson is undercast here, she deserves much more interesting roles. Cinematography and sets seem to be a little bit uninspired. Yet, the greater disappointment is that there is too little magic left when the film ends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I think it's better if you watch this movie with some friends, so that you can discuss your theory about why this and that happened, with them.

Christopher Nolan's brilliant MAGIC act.,"""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" - Christopher Nolan.The above quote is yet another example of a case of delicate and extraordinary screen writing. Guess what, this movie stands to its expectations raised in first few minutes. This is not just about magic but the life behind the acts. As Cutter (Michael Caine) narrates above quotes we see a magician performing on stage. A strange thing happens during his act (which of course I am not going to spoil) which takes you right to the core of what this story is all about. That opening scene creates a lot of questions. But interesting as it has been it makes you create your own theories. Its for you to find out what happens next.This is a story about Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman)and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who are working as assistants for a magician Michael Caine. Every single act they watch of their own master and other magicians, they become curious about the acts and try and break those in their heads. As the story continues the situations arise when they rival against each other. That turns into a quest. A quest for the creation of the greatest magic act ever. All you have to do is just sit back and enjoy this unbelievable ride into the world of MAGIC.First accolade for the movie goes to Christopher Nolan, who was my immediate favorite the day I watched ""Following"". He has an uncanny ability to present. He is a master story-teller. The movie has a lot of pace. Though I saw the twist an hour earlier but it rather made me look for an explanation and Nolan has one that fits right in. He gives yet another fantastic screenplay after Memento and Batman Begins. Non-linearly written, based on Jonathan Nolan's short story, this saga glues you to your seat.The performances were fine. Especially Christian Bale. His acting gives this project a real life. This movie shows us his talent beyond the action scenes of Bruce Wayne' other half. Hugh Jackman wasn't far behind him. He delivers his performance with much intensity as well. Their rivalry keeps you guessing and thinking all the time. Next up is Michael Caine. He fits quite admirably in the character of Cutter. Singing legend David Bowie is memorable in his short performance as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning as usual.This movie is dark, tricky, illusionary, intense and of course has something that I have never seen before. Applause to Mr Nolan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Good acting, poor production","I'll keep this short and to the point: The Prestige is an interesting story with pretty decent acting, but could have been much better were a little more thought put into post-production. Both Bale and Jackman played their parts quite well, but the flip-flopping of scenes between past and present were ambiguous at best and nearly every twist was foreseeable (if not obvious) long before it was discovered by the characters. For a movie about two magicians I would've expected the ending to reveal a secret I wasn't anticipating the entire second half, which for obvious reasons made the last hour drag on waiting for the inevitable. In short, wait for the DVD. It certainly isn't worth paying $10 at the theater, for the acting is decent but not outstanding, the magic marginal, and the eventual revealing fairly obvious. It is less a matter of ""who and how"" and more a matter of ""when"" they'll finally tell you what you've suspected since the first 45 minutes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

is this the actual ending?,"THE PLOT: Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier rise to become world-renowned stage magicians. Early in their careers, they meet and a bitter feud develops as they constantly try to out-do, and even sabotage, the other's acts The events of the past are revealed primarily through each of the magicians' diaries. Borden develops an act called The Transported Man, and an improved version named The New Transported Man, which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye and without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous acts to shame. Although never explicitly revealed, it seems probable that the secret of The Transported Man is that Borden, all his life, has been two people; his trick involves extreme use of a twin brother as a double, to the extent that they both live the same life. Angier cannot discern the method that Borden uses and desperately tries to equal him, and with the help of the acclaimed physicist Nikola Tesla For Angier's trick, Tesla successfully creates a device capable of teleporting a being from one place to another, but which has a surprising side-effect.THE ENDING!!! The first time WHEN angier uses the device in his workshop alone, one of two things happen. The first interpretation is that the original Angier shoots his newly-materialized duplicate dead on the spot. In subsequent uses of the machine for public performance, the original is dropped through a trapdoor into a tank of water, drowning him, leaving only the new ""transported"" Angier alive. However, it can be argued that the first time Angier uses the device, the first duplicate killed the original, and the other duplicates drowned during the performances. It is believed that the Angier in the new location is a duplicate, and their personalities are exactly alike. The final scene of the movie reveals a long dark corridor, the walls lined with metal-reinforced glass tanks, each containing a secretly-drowned Angier.Borden again breaks into the backstage area. However this time he sees one of the clones drowning. He is seen watching Angier die, accused of murdering Angier, and sentenced to death by hanging. In the end one of the brothers dies while the other lives on to take revenge on Angier, killing him amid his deceased duplicates RATING 8.5\10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

excellent,"Without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. where to begin? Surprisingly the best performance I thought came from David Bowie as the émigré to America N. Tesla.

Michael Caine comes to each role now with an accumulation of experience that makes his performances as taken for granted as richly designed tapestry unnoticed until you consciously examine the weave,cut,and design. Perhaps the only disappointment as far as acting goes is from Scarlet Johannson's performance although in looks as always she is a delight for the eyes.

Are YOU watching closely...?,"A film about magicians, friendship, jealously and rivalry. It's very hard to sell this film and to try to explain it without giving too much of the (pardon the pun) 'magic' away. A tale of two magicians set in Victorian England where their friendship turns sour when an act they routinely perform goes horribly wrong. The pair part company and a rivalry ensues. A bitter feud emerges when they both try to outdo each other with an array of tricks and illusions. From the outset it may seem like this film is all about magic and the art of illusion, but it isn't.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows a similar structure to his previous effort Memento where the narrative doesn't start at A and follow on to B. Instead there is flashbacks and flash forwards, as the reveal and revelation is slowly bought forward. We embark on a merry-go-round where we are left guessing where it stops and where we get off, but the level of intrigue that it creates just keeps you wanting more. To truly enjoy, appreciate and most importantly understand the film, your attention is required from start to finish and focus must be retained throughout. It's not a film you can switch off and come back to.From the off, we are given an explanation of the three part structure to every major trick, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. The prestige is the final reveal, the re-appearance from a disappearing act, making the impossible seem possible... What follows is a trail where the magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) accused of murdering his rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). From there on in the story unfolds with Borden reading Angier's diary where the first flashback occurs and the start of complex twists and turns showing how they started out as friends and with the eventual fall out which turns them to bitter rivals, with Angier trying to uncover how Borden achieves his greatest magic trick 'the transported man' and out do him.Funnily enough, this film so weirdly different and it's not what you'd expect. It set in Victorian England yet it never once feels like a period drama. Detail is key, as the focus is with the characters and never the background. Of course the costume and setting provides the backdrop for the story but the main theme is about obsession.Both leads (Bale and Jackman) are on fine form and the rest of the supporting cast raises the bar. The performances are subtle and sublime, with the nuances and deliberate misdirection to mislead us into thinking who we see as the bad guy may not be the villain of the piece. That isn't to say that there is a villain but nothing is ever clear in this wonderfully realised screenplay.Such an understated film with much to get your brain cells a work out, there's a lot to take in and you may not see everything the first time round but as the first lines mentions ""are you watching closely?"" there is a lot to admire about how the whole thing is constructed and like any great magic trick, the film only allows the audience enough details to carefully reveal the smaller pieces of a puzzle where we, the audience have to fit together to see the bigger picture. Is what we see the real truth or is there something more otherworldly, supernatural or unexplainable. With elements of science fiction thrown in you wonder whether things can get any weirder but when the final act is revealed you may well feel cheated or left feeling a sense of wonderment and just like a magic trick, you think to yourself, how did they pull that off? if you liked my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Masterpiece,"In the beginning i was reluctant about this movie but the director drive my mind to the theatre because i'm a big fan of memento. I left the movie just like a zombie with a million concept ideas about the story. It's a Masterpiece with a solid acting and a wonderful and intelligent screenplay. Christopher Nolan was the great magician with the real prestige in the end of the movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale divide the master role of this game of ambition, Michael Cane the mentor of both. They will deceive us with mind tricks, they will fool our minds with illusions about the story.If you love movies that splinters your mind don't loose this outstanding work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An amazing film you should definitely see,"This is an amazing film. Its a film that makes want to see it again instantly after you've first seen it, partly cause you want to see if everything makes sense, and also cause of how spectacular it is. One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan at his Best,"Welcome to the world of magic. Nolan drives us through an unforgettable journey in the world of Passion (read as magic), Ego (tussle to outclass your competitor at any cost) and a thrilling cinematographic masterpiece which is here to stay. Chistopher Nolan is known more for his work in modern classics like Memento (2000) & the Batman series but this movie remains my personal favourite of his works. Michael Caine and Chritian Bale (both personal favourites of Nolan while casting) give an stellar performance yet again but the one who completely dazzled me in this one is Hugh Jackman. The man to man war between Jackman & Bale to outsmart each other in the magic tricks is a treat to watch. Scarlett Johannsson is pretty as always and gives good support to the men here.The Non linear Story telling (which is trademark of Nolan's work) only adds to the suspense and beauty of this film. As the pages are unfold, It completely keeps you on the edge of your seats. I would definitely not like yo ruin your experience by leaking something out of the story. Watch out for the climax which completely left me dazzled personally.The 1900's set up charismatically elevates the cinematic experience & the background score is dangerous for your nails (Pls don't bite ur nail while watching this :P). I rate this movie 10/10 as very few films have impressed me to this level. Good Work Nolan and keep it up. Eagerly waiting for your Inception (2010). I recommend this for everyone personally as this roller coaster ride through Nolan's vision is a rarity. Don't miss it at any cost.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
My favorite movie all time.,A lot of people struggle with choosing 1 movie to be their favorite but The Prestige easily takes it for me. I've watched it over 100 times easy and I just really love how you figure out more and more as you rewatch it over and over.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Ultimate Trick!,"I had seen this film when it first came out and remembered liking it very much. Now, years later I decided to give it a rewatch, I can definitely say this- what an amazing film. The screenplay is strong, very mysterious and always keeps the audience second-guessing everything. The film is like a never ending maze. It has so many twists and turns, so many layers to it. Christopher Nolan really is a genius. I have considered his finest works Memento and The Dark Knight, but I can say this holds up to those films pretty much in every way. His direction is masterful and elegant. The performances are great, and the tragic rivalry between Angier and Borden and it's outcomes certainly are a great character study for each men. For me, I started with my own view of each character, and thought Angier was in the right from the start. However, as the film goes along, the film itself forces you to change sides and change your whole perspective on the characters. I thought this was really amazing and rarely does a film make you do that. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are very good, especially the former. Having seen her here and in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, she seems to be a great actress, and in each film she has outshined the still-talented Johansson. Having seen The Illusionist, I can say this is on a whole other level. The Illusionist was good, but entirely different besides the magician perspective. The Prestige is a perfect example of why we see films. We want to be entertained, we want to be mesmerized, and we want to be tricked and enchanted by the whole world a film brings you into. The Prestige is the ultimate trick!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Pay Close Attention,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.After seeing ""The Illusionist,"" which I thought was amazing a magic movie can get, I held my expectations really high for ""The Prestige."" I'm comparing these two films because they were released close to each other, with a similar genre as magic films. Which is the better movie, you ask? ""The Illusionist"" blows ""The Prestige"" away.I'm starting to wonder why this film has such a high rating. Probably a lot of fans of Christopher Nolan, who is known for making great films, such as ""batman Begins"" and ""Memento."" I would say this movie is just mediocre, and not at the level of his usual films.I will say this film has style. The cinematography was great. What I was disappointed by this film is the on going predictable-ness. I might be in the majority when I said this. I saw the twist coming. What came from the very first scene in the film was a great ""pay attention to the movie!"" moment but it went downhill from there.Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing at least two times from two very laughable and improbable scenes. Other than that, the film tries to be clever and trying to create something new at the same time. But all fails. It's mediocre at best from the storytelling. The performances were decent, in the end.Overall, I found it a hard film to love and to watch over and over again (they say watching this film over and over again will make it better). The visual effects were good, the plot may give you some disbelief, and the film is just one step back for Nolan. It's a worthy rent, at least.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sci-fi as a deus ex machina?,"I was told by several people things like ""This movie is awesome!"" and ""you'll have to watch it like three times to figure out what happened!"" Well, I can pretty comfortably state that the movie is not ""awesome"" and it only took about 1/2 the movie to figure out what was going to happen. I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true). If you do watch it, and I don't advise against it because it's a better alternative than a lot of other movies, don't be surprised if you come away shocked not at the ending but at the way it comes about.

Is Hollywood actually getting something right this year?,"It just seems like I'm seeing a bunch of good movies that have been released in 2006: The Departed, The Illusionist, United 93, and now The Prestige, an exciting magic drama with exciting stars: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The Prestige is a well thought out story that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, has great acting, fun magic, and a fantastic look and feel. My friend thought the film was too long, but I thought it was extremely well paced. Believe me, this is a film not to be missed.The Prestige is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Rupert has showman appeal that gets the audience excited and Alfred has the gift of how to perform magic very well. They go back and forth pulling horrible tricks on each other that not only causes hurt feelings, pain, and death. They also are playing with their lovely assistant's, Olivia, heart. How far will they go just to see who can out magic who?I absolutely loved how much Rupert and Alfred played off each other, you couldn't even choose a side because both of them were complete jerks, if that's even a strong enough word for it, but they did it so well. I loved how they kept trying to figure out each other's secrets and outwit each other in every one of their shows. I have got to tell you that Rupert's shows are so much fun to watch on the screen! There are some good laughs and cries throughout the film and I am not going to be surprised at all if this film is nominated during Oscar time. I would highly recommend The Prestige, one of the best films of 2006!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

An illusion of a magic thriller.,"The Prestige begins as does The Illusionist (2006): Magic tricks in the 19th century that astound the audience in the film and in front of it. The difference is that Prestige offers the secrets of many tricks where Illusionist bares few if any. Perhaps that difference reveals a figurative distance between the similar films: Prestige keeps an emotional distance, as do its characters, while Illusionist is very much about love between a man and a woman with the illusions serving that love. Indeed, ""prestige"" from the Middle French means illusion and tricks.The Prestige tells of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), rivals for a lifetime. Their intense competition centers around being the best magician in London, a feat mostly connected with Borden's electromagnetic transporting a man in a split second to somewhere else. Angier wants the secret, and that's no secret in the film, nor that both men share the affection of Angier's assistant, played by the increasingly curvaceous Scarlett Johansson.The convolutions of plot are no surprise coming from Christopher Nolan of Memento fame. The downside is that the plot becomes repetitious, especially as it circles the doppelganger motif. Truth and illusion are served well, many times over, until redundancy and boredom set in, certainly for this reviewer who usually loves ambiguity and paradox.A ""prestige"" is the final stage of a trick, the one that brings back whatever had vanished and asserts the magician's preeminence. This film did not bring back for me the terror of the trick as Illusionist did. The trick is probably that Prestige looks like The Illusionist but is an illusion of just such a magic thriller.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great! Kept me on the edge of my seat!,"Let me commence my abridgment by stating that this movie is one to remember--it's a masterpiece. It left me with curiosity every minute of the movie.

I am no critic, but this movie would be ""two thumbs way up."" In comparison to his other wonderful movies, Batman Beins and Momento, i would say this is the best.

An interesting story about two disgusting characters.,"This film addresses the intense rivalry between two illusionists who try to overcome and injure each other after a serious and fatal accident in a joint show. It's a story of unbridled rivalry, revenge, pride and vanity. The film has many merits but the main one is the script, the story that tells us. There are some more predictable parts, others seem initially incomprehensible until the movie explains everything. The ending is one of the most positive aspects as it's totally unexpected and, in fact, makes everything else worthwhile. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman played the main characters, working very well together and showing us the best of each other. They are brilliantly aided by veteran Michael Caine and by Scarlett Johansson. David Bowie is a surprise, but was quite reasonable in the role of the famous physicist Tesla. In fact, the whole cast did a good job and met expectations, at times when it failed to shine. However, the great problem of this film is precisely the characters. They are detestable, especially the magicians. No one was able to deserve my sympathy and, deep down, I was glad to see both of them being punished for their wickedness. Caine, in his character, mirrored this repulsion very well at certain scenes. And while Tesla's machine allowed a good increment to the story, the way it was done was so far-fetched that it spoiled the movie a bit, too. Anyway, it's a good movie with a very interesting story, fulfilling well its mission to entertain and surprise the public.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Most Original Movie In Recent Years,"Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE is one of the most shockingly-original films I've ever seen; rather, the book of the same name by Christopher Priest is really the most original. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem ingeniously cast, with Bale as the inwardly-focused, pensive, quiet magician, and Jackman as his rival, a boastful, flashy showman. These characters also mirror the two actors' styles; Bale is more of a deeper character actor, and Jackman is, and always has been, very entertaining to watch, but his acting has always been like a bucket of buttery popcorn; it tastes good when you eat it, but you feel slightly sick after you eat it, and it has no nutritive value. Having said this, the two actors have never been better. The story is ultimately clever, albeit quite confusing at times. Much like the TV show ""Lost"", the pertinent, plot-heavy duologue is intentionally vague, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. Just like a good magic trick - or a good Prestige, rather - the audience willingly immerses themselves in this twisting, creepy world; you WANT to be confused.

If you don't see this film,you are missing out on a great story, with great actors, and an awesome directing job by Christopher Nolan.

Do you believe in Magic?,"The Prestige: 9 out of 10: Two magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) develop a deadly rivalry that threatens them both.Some days I don't get critics. This is a fantastic film with a wonderfully twisty story, incredible acting, and excellent period detail. Yet it sits at a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. One of Christopher Nolan's worse as director. The bloated Dark Knight Rises sits at an 87%It is a bit of a head-scratcher. It did come out during particularly good run of films in the theater ( Scorsese's The Departed, Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers) and it wasn't the only costume drama attacked that weekend (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette was savaged by critics) Some people didn't like the end but I think it is more than a bit brilliant. One caveat is that I did like the film more on repeat viewings after a little time had passed. I can see how the initial reaction might be slightly harsher.Still, The Prestige has easily recovered and sits comfortably in the IMDB top 250 a couple of spaces from The Departed. (Time has not been as kind to Flags of our Fathers which is all but forgotten.... However, Marie Antoinette has also picked up some fans over the years and is bordering on a cult classic.)I am not talking about The Prestige simply because I don't want to spoil it.

Many twists and turns in this intelligent enjoyable film,"I can't wait to say that I loved this film! It was gripping, engaging, and surprised me a few times. I mean genuinely surprised me. The film is about rival stage magicians, rife with their lingo and culture, but more importantly, the film works much like a magic trick or illusion, offering its own misdirections while showing you everything. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both superb as the obsessed magicians. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo were very good as supporting female leads, though one of the best performances in the film was from Rebecca Hall. She made me want to look up her filmography. Michael Caine and the few others in immediate supporting roles were all good. I've heard mixed things about David Bowie's appearance in this film, but I think he was just fine; his appearance is more an extended cameo than anything else. The sets are authentic looking for the period, the writing is excellent, and even the music was excellent, if a bit subtle. The direction was superb, as was the editing. This is the rare film that gets everything right while telling a compelling story. It combines solid drama with an intriguing mystery and more than a hint of the fantastic I am hesitant to say anything about the plot, other than it concerns rival stage magicians in late nineteenth century London. Even the trailers for the film show precious little, probably for the same reason. Well worth the price of admission, I urge those interested to see it while its on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"For the look on their faces...to make them Wonder, just for even a moment...","Brilliantly using the role of a magician as an allegory for not just the ""magic"" of film-making, but for the dark, psychologically complex motives of the auteur filmmaker, director Christopher Nolan has dispelled his critics who claim he's just another hack and treated his fans to a twisty delight with ""The Prestige."" This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic ""Memento,"" the haunting ""Insomnia,"" and the refreshingly dark ""Batman Begins""), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.""The Prestige"" is almost impossible to critique without giving away a major plot twist, as the actual twists make the film so fascinatingly rich in that deep down spooky kind of way. The story of dueling magicians (a fairly good Hugh Jackman and a typically brilliant Christian Bale) gets off to a prodding start after we're told from the opening shot by Bale's eerie voice-over narration to ""watch closely."" Slowly, and inevitably, the tale of one-upmanship and revenge gets under your skin as you try to figure out what the biggest trick is going to be.Where this year's similarly themed ""Illusionist"" was lush and romantic, ""The Prestige"" is brooding and riddled with psychosis. Focusing on one trick and fueled by love, ""The Illusionist"" sucked in viewers. Focusing on the twisting of time and narration and multiple tricks fueled by competition and hatred, ""The Prestige"" transfixes viewers into a slow-burning flicker of mesmerized menace. Like Nolan's other films, the blood really starts to pump in the second half as the actors are allowed to truly emote and chew the scenery (think of Carrie-Ann Moss's turn of character in the later part of ""Memento"" and you'll get an idea of the level Jackman and a superb Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife reach when performing ""the turns""), while the plot mechanizations begin to carefully fall into place and their character arcs intertwine in fantastically tragic ways.Michael Caine (always reliable in these type of mentor roles), Scarlett Johansson (a bit over-exposed this year through no fault of her own by multiple releases but doing a decent British accent here and looking smashing as always), Andy Serkis (a crafty trickster of an actor), and David Bowie (as Tesla) provide fine acting support. Meanwhile, Nolan turns the screws of his mind games tighter than any other bankable director working today and painted a look on my face...that for more than a fleeting moment, but for the entire two-hour runtime and many hours more after, made me Wonder. ""The Prestige"" is pure movie magic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Much better than the usual fair,"This was an unusual story, told and acted very well. It took me awhile (and I'm usually very quick) to see where it was going. Like the Illusionist it opens up many a moral dilemma for the audience. The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time.

"Clever, dark, haunting and competition to its deadliest..","The author of this storyline must have the most disturbed and brilliant mind ever! This story may be sci-fi, however, the issues that we could relate to, is astonishingly in abundance. Take the core of the movie - competition of magicians. It is a reality that you must have the better trick to lure more customers. In this phase of competition, it is called healthy competition. As time passes, you move onto the next phase - resent. This is the phase where you begin to figure ideas to eliminate the competitor. Then comes the final phase - obsession. From healthy to obsessed. Obsession is the phase where you go beyond competitive elimination - which is now dangerous and life-threatening. Just like the 3 stages of magic which was the theme of the movie - The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. These issues, although depicted in a sci-fi way, is very true in reality. Humans compete for business. Humans begin to try damaging other people's business. Humans begin to assassinate other people so they could have their turf for their business. We live in a very twisted world, and this movie is no different.You can see here, that this movie could be depicted and interpreted in many ways. Obsession could be seen as a disease, slowly gnawing your life away, leaving marks at each milestone it eats. Just like the missing finger of Borden, and the injured leg of Angier. It is full of meaning, similes, metaphors. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and will blow your mind away. Every time you think about this movie, you seem to always think of something new, like I did with this comment above! I think this will be a classic, just like thrillers such as Seven.

It doesn't try to make the magicians look like warlocks. The centerpoint of the film is the dark rivalry between Angier and Borden. Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife during a magic trick and they become enemies. They try to one up each other. Angier is obsessed over Borden's Teleported Man trick. He must find out how it is done. He gets a new assistant that he falls for but sends her to Borden to discover the secret. However, she falls for Borden and this cause's Borden's wife to commit suicide. Angier goes to see a scientist and he invents a cloning box using electricity. This is where the supernatural elements come into play. Through a series of events, Borden is accused of Angier's murder and is sentenced to die. But, is Angier really dead? What about Borden? What was the secret to the Teleported Man? All of these questions are answered in a confusing ending, but the cloning part still doesn't make complete sense to me.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but I though it was difficult to follow and plus a little to long.

Entertaining - but slightly overheated - mishmash of Victorian period  melodrama and science fiction.,"Two Victorian London magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson) become involved in professional rivalry which has dramatic and far-reaching consequences for both of them.Magic is by its nature being able to appear to bend the rules of nature and/or physics - while, in reality, being no more able to do so than you or I.Equally the role of an intelligent viewer is to try and guess and predict the unexplained, the how, or the hidden twist (if you believe there might be one). A film which is allowed to take both feet of the floor (more literally than metaphorically!) destroys all such audience games.You can't knock Michael Caine for his supporting roles, because he plays them so well. Jackson and Bale are both overheated and a bit hysterical, and besides which, professional rivals tend not to hate each other deep down. There is - again deep down - a respect and admiration for the skill of the other.Here, for the purpose of the plot and a does of extra drama, this relationship has to turn murderous. This film could have survived, and be even been better, with a bit less plot and a bit more breathing in the dusty backstage atmosphere of the music hall.(And very well created it is - the art direction is simply superb.)Feel for female lead Scarlett Johansson, not a lot to do and almost window dressing in this production. I will watch her career with interest, (which red-blooded male wouldn't?) when she has more to do than looking good in an assistant's costume.While entertained and involved I have to say this is a lesson more in what the audience is prepared to accept than it is a cleverly crafted film script. Many films contain nonsense and illogical developments, but this doesn't lay its cards out on the table early enough. You can't switch formats mid-film.In many ways, it is a form of cheating.

Nolan has once more provided another great film and i now eagerly anticipate the sequel to batman begins hoping that he has me edging out of my seat once more. I cannot think of two performances in a movie that contrast so well as Jackman's's and bale's in the prestige and it is a compliment to their skill and the director Nolan. I also have to compliment the ending which was fascinatingly eerie and fulfilled the criteria of the film it was not a failed like that of the departed.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Mind-boggling philosophical exploration of illusion and real magic,"Intriguing, wondrous exploration of illusions and science/magic, with much to leave the viewer thinking for quite a while after the end. Beautifully done--writing, acting, directing, design--all transport us to a fictional previous time and place.Very philosophical, yet enjoyable for those who just want to experience a good story.I only wish I'd seen this in a theater instead of on DVD. If it is ever re-released, be sure to see it on the big screen. I will. This is one film that almost requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the nuances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An amazing portrait of obsession that gets better every time I watch,"This intricate puzzle of a film is simply the greatest thing Nolan has ever directed. A masterful example of cinematic sleight of hand, which is the perfect tonal echo of the craft of the magicians in the story.The first time I watched I had a little trouble buying the Tesla stuff, but with repeated viewings over the years, the fantastic elements of the plot take a back seat to the most important aspect of it all: Obsession that drives men to a downward spiral of mutual destruction. It's like a two way Moby Dick where the rival magicians are each-other's White Whale.Rebecca Hall is great in this movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as a priggish upper class showman and a down-and-out blue collar dude respectively. It's amazing to see Ricky Jay work- and of course Michael Caine brings a great gravitas to his raisonneur character.Nutshell: SEE THE PRESTIGE.Honestly after a lot of rewatches- my only complaint is I wish the black and silence lasted a couple seconds longer after the final line.

life-ruining bad,"I hated this movie. I saw it in the theater and after it was over I just felt horrible. I was hungry but I didn't want to eat anything, I was tired but didn't want to sleep, I didn't want to talk to any of my friends, even my cigarette tasted bad. I ended up going home and washing dishes. Three or four hours later I snapped out of it but it was real downer.It's not even like the movie was depressing, I like depressing movies, I like dark movies and sad movies and horror movies. But this was something different, it was life-ruining bad. And it wasn't even that any one aspect of the film was flawed specifically, (although I particularly hated the editing) just the entire movie turned me off. I don't know what I am supposed to leave this movie with, a lot of people keep saying that the entire film is a magic trick, which would make the film's director the magician. so in the end when he outsmarts me with his twist ending, I guess I am supposed to be amazed and astounded at how clever he is, and how not clever I am.I don't know why anybody would want to see a film where the director is just flaunting his intellectual superiority over his audience.The movie is like some awful prank, like director Chris Nolan took my car keys and through them in a river.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Great Acting & Storyline - Definitely worth watching,"I had long been looking forward for this Movie to come out, and I was not disappointed. Right from the opening scene it caught my attention, and it kept it for the duration of the movie.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale had great performances, and throughout the story I could almost feel the rivalry between them. I enjoyed the way the movie was set out with the mixture of flashbacks and diary entries.I was left at the end of the movie thinking 'Wow'. Although sometimes I think movies can go overboard with the twists and turns, 'The Prestige' has just the right amount to be understood without watching the movie a second time, but enough to leave you wondering on many occasions.Definitely Worth Seeing - It was one of the better movies to be release in a slow year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Just Plain WOW,"I am not one to recommend any movie to anyone because I have eclectic taste when it comes to everything. HOWEVER, this movie is incredible! The visuals are stunning, the twists are perplexing, and I applaud the costume designer for an incredible job presenting the time period without being over-the-top. What an amazing story line with the right combination of love, hate, science, magic, action and adventure! Fewer movies are being created with the energy and passion of The Prestige. Not a line or shot is wasted - and the 2+ hours run time flies by. For me, it was truly a pleasure to see David Bowie back on the big screen and playing such a key role. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are wonderful eye candy - but the depth of each of their characters draws you in as well. Perfect in every way - and in my top 10 movies of all-time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely amazing film,"In my opinion this is probably the greatest film I have ever seen, an awesome cast at the peak of their performances. Christian Bale is often referred to as a 'wooden' or 'emotionless' actor, but I blame this on the fact that for a great deal of his films he has to put on an American accent, but during his performance in this film he sticks to a British accent, it may not be his natural one, but it seems to open him up to new emotions that he cannot portray with an American accent. Hugh Jackman is also sometimes ridiculed for his acting, but for this film he doesn't play the mindless, anger-driven wolverine which I feel limited his acting performances, as all he had to do was flex his muscles and shout, but again, this film shows his true potential as an actor and it is truly astonishing. Michael Caine... Well there's nothing to say, you can't go wrong with Michael Caine. Scarlett Johanson, despite being a fairly minor character, was actually quite impressive, particularly with her accent which was spot on, though I felt her character was a bit pointless (other than to keep the gents happy obviously) but that would be a problem I have with the book itself rather than the film adaptation. All of these brilliant actors, each of which I would say providing the best performances of their careers so far, coupled with Christopher Nolan, a director who seems to be able to turn anything into an amazing film, make this film a truly amazing experience, and believe me, you will want to watch it again. 10/10 - my favourite film",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Finely structured complexity,"Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie (as Nikola Tesla). Well you thought ""The Sixth Sense"" had twists and turns? Not compared to this one! It's the late 1800's. The next generation of stage magicians is coming  and they are VERY competitive. Two are near the top, and keep trying to out-do the other for top position. Then things get out of control. This is SO much fun, and the complexity is so finely structured, you finally just sit back and let yourself go for the ride. Think roller coaster that keeps shooting past the starting gate for another loop. ""The Prestige"" has a sub-story, and that is of the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose biography I recently read. You will enjoy knowing that ALL the inventions and events depicted for Tesla were TRUE  until you get to the final secret related to the top hats. That's all I'll say. This was an exhilarating cat-n-mouse-n-mouse-n-cat-n-mouse story.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Highly overrated...,"As a fan of Christopher Nolan's work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I thought I would enjoy The Prestige as well. I was wrong. The good news is I just caught the film on Encore, so the only thing I wasted was my time.I do not fault Mr. Nolan or any of the actors (save a lacking performance by Scarlett Johansson). The real problem here is the story. Without going into detail let me just say that the movie started with an interesting premise and devolved into a ""I'm better than you"" farce between the two main characters. I sat there in disbelief as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (both of whom I admire) were forced to lower themselves into a story like this. One of them wrongs the other somehow, and the other then returns the favor. This is Bale's most unfortunate film role choice since Reign of Fire.Now don't get me wrong...as I said I do not fault the actors. Bale and Jackman performed as well as they could under the circumstances. However, since the story itself lost my interest, even the greatest actors in the world could not save it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The script is good, full of twists and turns and an overall interestingly structured story, but unfortunately it is very complicated, which is not helped by the constant time jumps.

The Prestige,"In a time where the same ideas are rehashed, The Prestige brings the age old revenge story into a refreshing and consuming light. The movie, though long, keeps the viewers' attention and has every mind trying to figure out the story before it even comes to an end, however, a second viewing of the movie might prove better than the first; for those who love to solve mysteries. Upon the second viewing is when subtle clues become more clear and the ending of the film becomes much more believable.

Are you watching closely?,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, two magicians performing their acts in the late 19th century. After an escape trick goes horribly wrong, the men turn sour on each other, and engage in all sorts of cutthroat moves as they start competing with each other and scheming to learn each others' secrets.Before going in, I knew that this Christopher Nolan film was intended as a classic case of a ""you didn't actually see what you thought you saw"" story. It's perfect for a story about magic & illusion, and may even catch some people off guard, as it was also intended to be the sort of film where, if you *didn't* have it all figured out, you'd re-watch the picture - perhaps more than once - to pick up on whatever you missed.While it ultimately seemed, at least to me, to be a little wrapped up in its own cleverness, it *did* tell a solidly entertaining period story, with a first-rate cast (also including Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie (as Nikola Tesla), Andy Serkis, Roger Rees, and other familiar faces) completely committed to these characters. Caine, as could be expected, is definitely a standout as the wise old ""ingenieur"" behind the tricks.In the end, I think this did have something pertinent to say about the way that some of us *want* to be fooled; we don't *want* to know the secrets or the behind-the-scenes details. There remains a certain fascination with the whole concept of magic, although perhaps not as much as there was in the years in which this tale is set.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Prestige:You'll be talking about it long after it's gone.,"The Prestige - Christopher Nolan's latest collaboration with Christian Bale in which magicians in turn-of-the-century London who battle each other for trade secrets. The rivalry is so intense that it turns them into murderers. Hugh Jackman plays level-headed showman Rupert Angier to Bale's unpredictable but brilliant magician Alfred Borden.The performances are very good all around. I caught Scarlett Johanessan's fake British accent slip same as Natalie Portman's (V for Vendetta) once or twice. They must've had the same voice coach. Bale is sinister, seemingly omnipresent and omniscient, and usually the most watchable character on screen, though Hugh Jackman makes for excellent competition as a man getting down and dirty as he gives up all in a bid to be the best magician. Michael Caine is charming and talented support as always. I didn't even recognize David Bowie as Nikola Tesla; he was almost the real Prestige (unveiling of third act in a magic trick) of the film The tricks, while not as fantastic visually as in The Illusionist, are much more realistic and there is more of a desire to see them unveiled. The cinematography and scripting are top-notch, and the film has the wonderful dis-jointed yet well-paced quality that has come to be a trademark of Christopher Nolan. The film has some genuine suspense to it, and I can't tell anymore about the plot than this, but nothing and no -one is what it seems. The entire film is a magic trick, and the denouement is infinitely more satisfying, weighty and horrifying than that of The Illusionist. For a film titled after the shocking climax of a magic trick, this ending does not disappoint. The only question is whether the film is worth more than one watching. It also was a bit long, though I'm damned if I could figure out what to leave from it. Still, it'll undoubtedly be in my top ten of this year, so I'll give The Prestige an A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Christopher Nolan's dark fantasy piece is smart, dazzling, but a little meandering","The main purpose of magic is not to impress others nor to deceive them, but to simply give the illusion of something fake appear real for artistic purposes. That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine). But one night during a show, their performance goes terribly wrong that results in tragedy. The fateful event turns their duo's friendship into a bitter rivalry and soon leads to the two in an obsessive battle to discover each other's secrets. It's not long before their heated rivalry escalates into a downward spiral of deceit that threatens to not only tear apart their careers on stage, but their own personal beings.As this film deals with magic and sorcery, it should come to no surprise that Christopher Nolan brings a wide plethora of twists to the mix; and with a smoothly compelling script and striking visual resonance, Nolan appears to be at the top of his game. Wielding with spectacular directorial talent, Nolan drives this film with plenty of nuance and astounding visual potency. As the story revolves around a heated competition of revenge and deception that makes for some very dark and occasionally morbid moments, it pulls into a dark, eerie journey of Christopher Priest's novel with plenty of surprises supplemented by Nolan's stylish direction. Though the plot holds a fair amount of intelligence, the unnecessarily slow pacing does tend to kill the interest of the story. Instead of introducing the lead magicians at the beginning, the film proceeds through a non-linear narrative opening with Christian Bale's character Alfred on murder trail (for reasons you don't learn until later) which becomes intertwined throughout the story until the very end, before giving us the proper introduction on the characters. Along with this another subplot centering on famous inventor Nikola Tesla who's oddly played by singer David Bowie, trying to invent a teleporter. Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling not only overcomplicates the plot, but he doesn't execute in a way that is effective as what he achieved in 'Memento'. On the bright side, this director manages to keep things moving at least most of the time, and builds up the story up to a shocking, unpredictable conclusion. The performances by Christian Bale , fresh off of Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and Hugh Jackman both stand out; and the supporting cast including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as Robert Angier's assistant also make great appeal in their roles. While nothing particularly Oscar-worthy, these actors manage to fit the bill.The Prestige, though slightly inferior to Christoper Nolan's other works, is a smart, dazzling fantasy period piece with alluring energy of Nolan's directorial efforts and a fine array of charismatic performances by a likable cast. Though the level of complexity in the plot make the story a challenge for the most naive film goers to sit through, it also serves as a reminder of the fine cinematic talent Nolan never stops bringing to the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful","Rewatching this makes it pretty clear what Nolan's primary focus is in storytelling (if it wasn't obvious before) - perspective and the subjective nature of it. What better way to expound on that than in a story about dueling magicians hiding their secrets from one another.There are metaphors galore in this (how could there not be in a film about subjectivity and obsession) but it struck me this time how convenient the story is. It moves constantly and forcefully forward, revealing twists all the way, daring you to try and outguess it, so at first it's easy to miss on the plot contrivances and somewhat simple nature of it all. But I'm also not sure how much that matters. The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

this stylish thriller perfectly works on many levels,"The Prestige is a stylish thriller, story about obsession, magic trick and metaphor of a film art at the same time. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) the movie perfectly works on every level. On the most obvious level - it is a superbly shot thriller keeping in a heart-pounding suspense with numerous twists and turns. As regards psychology, we have a dangerous obsession with searching for something new and an intense rivalry between two different personalities, which is reliable owing to excellent performances by two leads - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Their characters are not only obsessed with personal ambitions, but they also resign from family life by hurting people they love. In the allegorical sense, the flick is an overt metaphor of the magic trick in which creators show more things than actually communicate and viewers' aim is to decipher a riddle. Besides, they often reveal secrets concerning the enchantment. Finally, Nolan focuses on a labourious creation process. Filmmakers, just like illusionists in this movie, do everything within their power in order to amuse viewers and the effect is sometimes incommensurate to their hard work and devoted time. To conclude, The Prestige is a first-rate cinematic experience which both criticizes and glorifies film-making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Incredible,"This movie is quite possibly the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life. Christopher Priest's novel is brilliant, and it has been some time that I haven't been able to put a book down. That being said, this was one absolutely incredible movie.Frankly, I am content with it being a horrible adaptation. Christopher Nolan has taken Priest's genius premise and created another genius story. While I feel sorry for Priests, the Nolan brothers definitely deserve immense credit for a such a difficult task. I was completely engrossed in the film. It ranks, certainly, as one of the best thrillers I have seen, alongside Memento, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and some of the great Hitchcock films. It's hard to discuss the plot without giving much away (and a very simplistic storyline can be obtained from this website elsewhere), but I will say that the twists, even if they are already known, are mind-blowing. Keep in mind, however, that this film is a fantasy, or science fiction, whichever term you prefer.The Nolans' script is marvelous, as is Christopher's directing. Michael Caine gives a very good performance, as do all the supporting cast members, namely Andy Serkis' and David Bowie's short roles. The very fact that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are in a film together is enough to see that said film, and they both give outstanding performances (as both usually do). Jackman does an awesome job as a gentlemanly sort of character, consumed by his obsession for the secrets of his opponent. But it is Bale (who stands as my favorite actor) who steals the show (perhaps the last parenthesized quotation reveals a bias). His portrayal of a Cockney ruffian is brilliant, and he, like Jackman, completely assumes the identity of his character. Both are equally deserving of Oscar nominations (and, quite possibly, wins), and it can unfortunately be a rare thing to have two such marvelous actors in the same film doing marvelous jobs.The Prestige is one of the finest films of the year and may unfortunately be out-shadowed by other very fine films. It is an incredible story, one only strengthened by the fantastic performances of Bale and Jackman.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliantly conceived and executed,"The Prestige is a tale of bitter revenge between two rival magicians during the end of the 19th century. The film is set largely in a bleak London which helps to portray the true grubby nature of the obsessions that begin to envelop the two young magicians played magnificently by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden).The story is truly engrossing; the nature of the magician and the compulsion of Angier and Borden to constantly outdo the other provide the perfect ammunition to twist and weave the plot without slipping into the realms of the implausible. Illusion is the order of the day and the constant frustration of both Angier and Borden as they try to discover the truths behind (and sabotage) each other's tricks is palpable.Michael Caine as Cutter  Angier's friend and career aide  puts in a stellar performance as do Rebecca Hall (Julia) and Scarlett Johansson (Olivia) as the two love interests (although their screen-time is minimal). David Bowie (Tesla) is fantastic as the scientist visited by Angier in the hope of discovering and besting Borden's greatest trick: the transporting man. It is this particular trick that is the focal point of a cinematic climax that will be remembered (and applauded) for a long time.The last time a film left my head spinning as much as this was after watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time, and I cannot give any higher praise then that.Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of enlightening us to the ins and outs of the magician's industry at the turn of the century (where stage entertainment was a massive money-spinner) whilst still leaving an element of wonder and mysticism. The portrayal of these two men as solely committed to their magic (at the expense of all else) is brilliantly conceived. The film is shot beautifully and the direction is spot-on considering the difficult era being portrayed.There is only one slight word of caution: the film is cut very tightly and jumps from the perspective of both Angier and Borden through two time threads, often too swiftly. This isn't a criticism as such, merely a warning to those that don't like non-linear story telling as it could become confusing.Overall a brilliant piece of work that will please and delight almost any audience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Ultimate Magic Trick,"""The Prestige"" is easily the best film in the last two years.I've seen it twice so far and I enjoyed it more the second time around because many of the scenes that had seemed flawed the first time around are actually very important to the plot.""The Prestige"" is a magic trick unto it's self.

Then go back and see it again and if you pay very close attention, you will see that everything actually fits into place perfectly.My pet peeve with Hollywood is that they spend $200 on special effects but don't bother with writing a decent script.

Probably Nolan's and the decade's best.,"The Prestige - It is undoubtedly Nolan's best yet. Better than Dark Knight, better than Batman Begins and definitely better than Inception. It wouldn't be an understatement to say it is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time. All Nolan movies that followed have been exceptional but still won't be able to match The Prestige. The Prestige is an instant classic. It will leave you amazed and more importantly it will leave you wondering, why haven't you witnessed this masterpiece yet.The direction by Nolan is flawless, and so is the screenplay. The dialouges are honest with no hint of pretension. There is a unusual flow in the movie which helps Nolan switch from one story to another inter-wined story but still doesn't leave you confused. The movie from scene one is as gripping as it can get. And at the end of the odd 130 minutes, it doesn't end there. It stays with you.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are very believable as magicians and illusionists with an obsession to perform the greatest illusion. Michael Caine is very natural as usual. Even the supporting cast do justice to the script of the film.But what really makes The Prestige stand out is the script. Full credit to Christopher Priest on whose novel the movie is based as well as the Nolan brothers for the gripping screenplay. I have not read the novel but I don't think it can better than the movie.

The ending has a very cool twist as well, though nothing really special: Nolan's films are very entertaining, but he is not a Stanley Kubrick and never will be.

Nolan Delivers Another Fine Film.,"Christopher Nolan delivers another fine film with Christian Bale and Micheal Caine in tow, again. Like Batman Begins, the cinematography in The Prestige draws in the viewer whether the shot is a panoramic Rocky Mountain landscape or a squalid London slum. Nolan's sets are intrinsic to the story and make the unfolding drama all the more compelling. So much of the story is dependent upon the scenario in which a scene occurs. This is a period piece for the 21st century. The performances are very good to excellent by the entire cast. Christian Bale satisfies again with his nuanced role as a competitive illusionist. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman going for roles of substance given his strong acting ability. Micheal Caine, legendary, enough said. The women in the film are equally good. I was floored to learn that Ms. Perabo, who plays Bale's wife in the film, is a native of New Jersey. Her period London accent is flawless. Scarlett Johannsen develops nicely in this film and as long as she seeks dimensional characters like this, she can count on a long and rewarding career. Seeing Bowie on film is always a treat. His turn as Nikola Telsa is well suited to his repertoire. The story is well written and superbly directed. Anybody who writes a spoiler to this film is doing those who have not seen the film a disservice. I only hope Nolan can get the recognition he deserves when all the awards are given.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Highly Recommended,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I saw it in theaters with my friends and was crying hysterically at the end. one of the last lines is really a killer. You have to see it at least twice to get EVERYTHING, because it is pretty fast paced compared to other movies with a lot of details. The ending will have you shocked, astonished, and willing to watch it again and again. I'm very very glad that this movie made IMDb's top 250 movie list because it deserves to be up there. Even though it didn't win any Oscars or golden globes, I know that they did a phenomenal job on it. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are fantastic actors to begin with, and this was the first movie I've seen with Scarlett Johansson in it. If you haven't seen it, go rent it NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"An intense, visually magical, emotionally charged piece of work","The visual experience of this extremely authentic period piece, consummate acting and storyline will leave most earnest moviegoers with a truly exhilarating experience. You expect the leading actors to do something familiar from their other work but they give us new dimensions. Michael Caine again proves his timeless value to the enhancement of any role while David Bowie offers a portrait of elegant, aged sophistication fronting electrical spectaculars, ancient reminders of Ziggy Stardust. Although the film has slower expository moments, the contribution to the grand finale is something to behold. If magic is what you wish for, magic is what you will receive. The name only belies the true ""Prestige"" of the final act. There are facets that make this film watchable with a repetitiveness that will seem tireless. It can and will involve a satisfaction and identification of inner emotions that are played out and identified by all of us. The film can easily define the recently modern terminology ""obsessive-compulsive"" behavior. It also can serve as a guide on the price of success at any cost affecting so many of our fellow human beings today. For those who scrutinize detail, there are scenes of turn of the century London you will find irreconcilable with modern sanitation and relative cleanliness of large cities. The artifacts, apparatus, equipment, and scenery seem to have been crafted with such exact precision as to have been transported from history. The character of Nicola Tesla was real and a real genius overshadowed by Edison; Tesla and elements of his work are still shrouded in mystery to this day. In summation, this movie is magical and a fulfilling treat for those with imagination and the absolute enjoyment of carefully merged fact with unknown possibilities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Fantastic!,"""Are you watching closely"". The Prestige is the best film i have ever seen in the cinema. A film which has Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine and Scarlet Johansson is bound to be a shocker. This film is about two magicians trying to be the best by preforming the transporting man trick, but there's a twist. A very good twist which leaves you guessing all the way through. This film is very confusing, but at the end all the questions you had will be answered (hopefully). With brilliant performances from all the cast members this is a film which must be seen by anyone who loves mysteries and magical mayhem. So get up and walk down to your local cinema and watch The Prestige.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Prestige Show,"Christopher Nolan brings yet another a mysterious movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well.At Borden's murder trial, Angier's engineer John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. The rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him a great deal of money and Cutter's friendship while providing him with a collection of his own suicide victims; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth.True to Nolan's style, at 130 minutes, this film is lengthy. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit drawn out, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline was a bit unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen.The Prestige is sacrificing, non-humorous, and dark—and well worth a part of your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"great movie! """"must see""""","This was an EXCELLENT movie!! One of the best I've seen. This is my favorite movie of all time. With suspense, unpredictable plot, and a touch of romance has made this movie a movie for every type of person. If you already love Christian Bale this movie will make you love him even more. The writers are absolute GENIUS'S!!! They wrote this movie amazingly! Even throughout all the twists they made it perfectly plausible and fairly easily understood. I think I'm going to write to the writers congratulating them on such an EXCELLENT movie. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johannson, and Michael Caine, did a SUPERB job. They timed everything perfectly, and the emotion was entirely believable. There were multiple quotes that I will remember for a very long time they were just so GOOD! On the drive home after seeing this movie you will just not be able to stop talking about it. Throughout the seemingly serious plot, there are several parts that will just make you laugh out loud. All in all this was a SUPERB movie!! Not one even close to being as good! TWO THUMBS UP!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Very Disappointing,"Hugely disappointing effort here. I was expecting better from Nolan, after the great ""Batman Begins"", but this was a real letdown. The story is disjointed and confusing in that it keeps jumping back and forth in time so much that you lose the time line, and it all gets muddled. You're not sure what is taking place when. The dialogue is lacking and the direction is not nearly as inspired as I'd hoped. Christian Bale is more effective playing Americans than Brits somehow, and his Cockney accent is not very convincing. Jackman is underwhelming. The major secret of the film is so absurd and deflating that I felt cheated as the credits popped up. If you want to see a ""Turn of the Century Magic Movie"", rent ""The Illusionist"" a much more elegant film, and although it relies more on the supernatural and the suspension of disbelief, it is far less ridiculous and contrived than this dung heap.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Wizard of Oz is nothing compared to Christopher Nolan,"The prestige is about two rivaling magicians in London during the turn of the century. Nolan accomplished a unique, not to say magical movie. From the actors and their performances to the dialogs to the background music...everything is presented in a magical way. Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: The movie shows you something ordinary, but of course it isn't. The second act is called The Turn: The movie makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.

Crap Covered Pretzel with Sweet Glaze,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now that you wouldn't be missing all that much if you didn't see this movie. It tries to pass itself as historical fiction, pertaining to a time period in which magicians were willing to do anything to usurp their fellow illusionists, but at the end it dabbles much too far into the realm of impossibility-explained-with-science that it effectively ruins itself and drops down to the uninteresting ""sci-fi"" category.For about the first two hours, it was what I expected. A dark, mysterious, captivating, and twisted piece of storytelling. I've come to associate each of those elements with director Christopher Nolan and his oddly familiar castChristian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, and Scarlett Johansson. But at some point during the course of the above-average directing and acting, the writer messed up. I don't want to give away too much, but it effectively ruins the greatest magic trickthe Transported Manfrom the movie. It became convoluted. It tried so hard to be darker, more mysterious, more captivating, and more twisted, that it eventually turned itself into a pretzel. A crap covered one.The final scenes made an attempt to fix up the original mess by delivering a punch that was actually thought-provoking. Still, you could pass this one up until it comes out on PPV or Blockbuster. Don't pay full price, unless you're a big ""Batman Begins"" fan and need something to satisfy your taste buds until ""The Dark Knight"" is released in 2008.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Prestige deserves many prestigious awards.,"I was amazed by this movie. Everything is done beautifully from the acting to the set to the costumes. You certainly feel like you're immersed in the story and you've gone back in time to the height of magic. I was a bit surprised by some of the secrets. I won't give anything away, but I'm good at guessing films and this one I only got about 50% correct, which is really low for me. Even if you are completely paying attention, it's sometimes difficult to keep up. I almost wanted to start taking notes in order to figure out what was going on. Every actor is amazing, and the plot twists will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I've given a first try, check it out!Copy and paste: http://one.revver.com/watch/157915Just to be honest, i've to say that many of the techniques and the ideas shown in this movie had been already used by the director Christopher Nolan in ""Memento"", which is with no doubt (imho, obviously) his real masterpiece: flashbacks, enigmas, ambiguity of the characters, etc. Perhaps ""Memento"" is a little excessive; in order to fully understand the movie you must watch it almost twice (with high level of attention). ""The Prestige"" is a more commercial version of Memento, but it includes all the features and the ideas that made fantastic Memento.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The PERFECT Nolan movie !!!,"I am a Nolan fan, i am looking forward to his new movies. I think Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight are the best movies I have ever seen. This man knows how to create a masterpiece! He has specific characteristics, like Burton and Shyamalan. You like their movies or not, generally you can tell ""This is a .... movie!"" as soon as you see a movie of them.In my opinion, some directors want to reveal themselves, their characteristics in a movie. I think Shyamalan's Lady in The Water and Nolan's Prestige are such movies. I see Nolan as a magician. You can see all the pledge, the turn and the prestige in all of his movies. The best part of his movies is that you cannot see the trick easily. You can watch the movie again and again, and you may still see new points. You may still change your mind about the truth, about ""the trick"" or you may just be lost in surrealism, in a multi-dimensional truth. You may just see what you want to see and you can never get what was Nolan brothers thinking, just like a poem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Masterpiece,Additionally to the great cast this movie is very exciting and shows many turns and twists. Christopher Nolan proved once more why he is one of the most wanted director of this time.

The movie starts off exciting right away and it continues to hold the viewers attention. There is so many twist and changes through the entire movie and nevertheless the viewer never gets confused. This is definitely a movie that is fun to watch and that is definitely worth getting. Also with again world class performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.

A Magical Experience,"Set in a dark and malice late-Victorian England, The Prestige is a diabolical and intriguing thriller film by one of the most critically acclaimed director of our era, Christopher Nolan, about two stage magicians engaged in a competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion. This competition leads to sinister proceedings that moves both the story and audience to an ambivalent and ominous state. It's a tale of obsession and deception, a magic trick that creates a lasting impression.The movie follows a solid story structure that made all the acts propulsive and fast-paced. Nolan's mastery of cinematic deception and visual illusions enables the film to proceed in a non-chronological yet understandable sequence. The changing of time and space between each cut makes the story engaging and entertaining to watch. The puzzles and tricks that were utilized makes the audience be part of the problem-solving in each scene, and although the answers are right in front of our eyes, Nolan still managed to hide them in plain sight, and were only revealed at the very last moment.The characters in the story are lovable, relatable, human, and well- developed. The performance of the actors gave justice to their characters. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the two magicians propelled the rivalry of their respective characters to a grander height that helped on amplifying the overall emotion that drives the story forward.Cinematography wise, the film is indeed magical. The utilization of visual illusions and tricks through editing reflected the theme of the story, which is deception. The use of parallax effects made each act more watchable. The overall lighting and music throughout the film created a dark and gloomy ambiance which made the movie overall, a more thrilling experience.The Prestige tells the story of humanity's obsession and greed for power through two magicians who are willing to take all means necessary to top the other. It's a tale of demise amplified by suspense, deceit, compulsion, and avarice. It's an intelligent and cerebral film that is easy to understand when you watch it carefully. The amount of its rewatchability which is kind of rare on today's films makes each viewing a different and delightful experience. This is a film I would recommend to everyone especially to those who enjoy thriller films that is full of puzzles. The story of The Prestige is already commendable to its roots but if we look carefully towards its lessons, we will realize how rewarding this film really is. As said in the movie, we know the truth but we want to be fooled because of our desire to be amazed. Learning the truth however doesn't kill the magic, but brings the magic within us.#EAPP2017",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The acting was superb throughout, and we were brought back to what was a truly exciting part of English history.Having re-watched the trailer, it is obvious that this would be an ideal film to watch twice as almost every line refers directly and cleverly to something that is revealed later on in the film.

Amazing film!! One of the  best  of the decade!!,"I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.Hugh Jackman(who finally makes a great film outside of X-Men.) Brings his acting to whole other world, he pulls no stops to be cruel and vicious. He brings a great darkness the likes we have never seen and an obsessive nature like on other. Christian Bale(Who in my opinion stole the show.) Is another who rocks the house in this film, he brings a more sadistic side than Jackman and really almost out classes him in this film. Bale really steps up his game and brings a whole new level of obsessive rivalry to this movie. But all in all the whole cast does magnificently in this handsomely mounted film.The Prestige is not your average film, it requires strict and complete attention to truly grasp and understand the story and plot. Kind of like The Matrix if you sneeze you will lose what is going on in the film, it's that complex.

A real magician tries to invent something new...,"...and that is exactly what what Christopher Nolan has done with this wonderful piece of conjured magic. In 2000 he amazed the viewing audience with his wonderful Momento and...trust me...this is equally as good if not better! Christian Bale shows us once more that his Reign of Fire days are well and truly behind him as he puts in a dazzling performance as the moody and slightly arrogant Alfred Borden, who triggers a series of hate fuelled events when his hunger to make tricks seem more dangerous causes the death of his colleague's wife. His former colleague, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), then sets out to destroy not only Borden's career but his whole life along with it. The pair are quickly caught up in a 'punch-for-punch' type battle which, it soon becomes very clear, will not have a happy ending. Also, credit to Michael Caine for his calming performance of Cutter who seeks to help Angier succeed but yet at the same time shows, by contrast to himself, just how enraged both characters of Borden and Angier are becoming in the battle.What Nolan has done is not only created a visually beautiful movie with his Victorian era setting but also shown us what lengths man can be driven to through competition in a way which can be related even to the present day. However, the end of the movie will not please everyone as it takes a huge jump in the science fiction direction. I however loved where he went, and I think that anyone who has even the slightest glimmer of imagination will too.A lot of people have compared this to another movie of 2007, The Illusionist. Don't! This is David Copperfield, whereas The Illusionist is Paul Daniels. A must see of 2007!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Unlike his recent movies, that are more on style than substance, this ""smaller"" movie is an example of how to maintain a storyline without trying to outsmart the audience with cheap tricks like backward/forward armies and other such nonsense.Nolan needs to rewatch his own earlier movies and make note of the old adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

Once: Excellent.  Twice: Masterpiece. Thrice: All-Time Classic,"It's quite possible that THE PRESTIGE improves more with repeated viewings than any other movie ever made. As you might have gathered already, there are revelations at the end that force you to reinterpret everything you've already seen. The second time through, it's a different movie. Now, this trick has been pulled off before (most famously by THE SIXTH SENSE), but what makes THE PRESTIGE unique is that our identification with the characters changes once we know what was really going on, and the movie, which on first viewing is flawed only by a slight coldness, becomes profoundly emotional.It's possible that Christopher Nolan (and his screen writing collaborator, brother Jonathan) will never top MEMENTO, because the concept of that movie is so original. But in every other way, THE PRESTIGE is a more accomplished film, and it's so good that it (and its predecessor) actually make an argument for Nolan being the best director since Kubrick. The screenplay takes a justly acclaimed World Fantasy Award-winning novel and, astonishingly, improves it greatly. The screen story seamlessly cuts between three separate time-lines (or four, if you consider the very beginning of the movie) so deftly that you may not even notice how ambitious such a structure is. Unlike MEMENTO, the structure doesn't call attention to itself, but like their earlier movie, it is integral to the story being told.This is (the first time through) a hugely entertaining movie which (on subsequent viewings) turns out to be a deep meditation on obsession, on illusion, on sacrifice, on the nature of art and its audience. It's the best single movie of the last five years (exempting THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and, along with DONNIE DARKO, the best science-fiction or science-fantasy movie since BLADE RUNNER (and maybe since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The amazing world of magic and wizardry.,"Before watching this movie, I've already known Christopher Nolan from his several previous works such as Memento, Insomnia and Batman Begins. His talent as a director is a gift given not to so many, and that gift made the movie ""Prestige"" a masterpiece. The movie grips you to your seat and takes you to a world of magic and wizardry. While watching the movie, you find yourself in the middle of the war of pride and honor between two rival illusionists. They push their limits in creativity to be better than the other. All the illusions or tricks shown in the stage are amazing, and that is Christopher Nolan who gives each of them the thrill that increases your adrenaline.About the actors, Hugh Jackman is again great like he has been in many of his former movies. In the movie, after the loss of his wife, his ambitious struggle against the once fellow friend Alfred Borden (Christopher Nolan) impresses everyone. Christopher Nolan, plays the fanatic character who dedicated himself to illusions and tricks very well. Apart from these two, Michael Cane and David Bowie play the most colorful two characters. Especially, David Bowie gives life to the most debated scientist ever, Tesla.The only thing that a person should do while watching this movie, is to be patient and tolerant in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The first 15 minutes is quite confusing and one can become dizzy while following who is who. But then the movie will grab you tightly and will never let you out even many hours after it ends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
fun - but not quite satisfying,"An enjoyable movie which will wile away your time pleasantly in the company of some excellent actors, principally Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale - the latter surely one of the most interesting, intense and unpredictable actors working in movies today. They are expertly supported by the one and only Michael Caine, with a couple of delectable cameos from Andy Serkis and David Bowie.The women's roles, though well-performed, are under-written and fundamentally unengaging. This is a regrettable flaw, but there is a greater one - a trap which the authors were clearly perfectly aware of, but didn't seem to be able to avoid.The trouble with movies which have Great Revelations in them, as the story of this one goes to great pains to point out with regard to magic tricks, is that there is an inevitable disappointment once you know the answers. Given that the Nolans knew this to be the case, one might have hoped for some chasm of mystery left open. But it's all pretty much rounded off in the manner of an old-fashioned whodunnit. One can almost hear the writers' glee as they tied up another loose end, and then planted the trail that leads to it somewhere unexpected. The last time I felt anything so self-conscious was in The Last of Sheila, many years ago. What stops this from being as brittle as that film is the warmth of Bale, Jackman and Caine. Even so, for some reason the writers' minds somehow tick away audibly in what I'm sorry to say seems to me a too-clever-by-half kind of way.Whatever my complaints, this is a very fine confection, full of clever tricks, and a pleasant way to fill a couple of hours. My feeling is that the Nolans wanted to achieve something more than that. Unfortunately, they haven't succeeded.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It's not all that...,"Well, I've been interested in cinematography for the past 10 years of my life, I've watched all kinds of movies and I always seek the best, and please remember this is just my opinion...I watched the movie expecting something HUGE after all that hype, and I have to say, I couldn't be more disappointed, the twists were so clear from the beginning, the whole story seemed so trivial to me, it really doesn't deserve the hype or the high rating it got, although I couldn't say anything but ""Brilliant"" about the acting, that was the highlight of the whole thing, the directing was just ""Decent"" at most, and the make up was ""Horrible"".I gave this movie 5/10 only for the acting, the clothing and the decoration.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Interesting Duality Concept on Dark Competitive Spirits of Professional Magicians,"Before the successful of their big blockbusters, the Nolan's siblings explore the world of stage magicians by summarising the magic performances into three parts - the pledge, the turn and the prestige, which the movie further develops based on the structures although it starts off slowly with its own unique beginning. It seems that in most Nolan's film, the ending scene always appears at the opening but his narrative style however manages to make audiences to forget that regardless on the complexity of the content he tries to confuse us, it is actually a straightforward plot with the key answers already revealed indirectly at the first scene. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity. Although with a bit of weaker scores (due to no Hans Zimmer), Nolan's smart piece of magical art is interesting to stress that the trick of victory comes only when a person overlook and think that he has already won the rival.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Masterpiece of allegorical fiction,"This movie works on many levels: and thats what makes it great.The Prestige is a roller-coaster ride, a sweeping tale of intrigue and malice as one magician tries to one-up the other and vice versa. Twists and turns abound, possibly even some loops, as the movie approaches an inspired climax that doesn't waste the previous hours the viewer spent watching the movie (*cough* Shyamalan *cough*).Like Mement, another Christopher Nolan masterwork, this is a movie that will keep you thinking long afterward. Not only must the viewer come to grips with the winding plot but he or she can also ponder the concepts driving the details. For me, this was a movie about identity, what people do to stay elusive and one step ahead of your competition, not to mention the results thereof. It still amazes me the little details I can remember and place meaning upon that I didn't really think much of at the time. I would put examples, but the best ones I can think of are plot spoilers (and I wouldn't ruin the movie for my good readers).A few of my friends thought this movie was a bit too long though they still enjoyed it. As for me, I thought it the perfect length. There wasn't a moment wasted throughout.The Prestige follows through with top-notch performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine with well-done performances by the ladies and other supporting cast members as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

What a performance. Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie also with excellent contributions.Wow, wow, wow. What a movie, it's so freaking good really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
They Want to Be Fooled,"This film is, on the surface, a story concerning rival magicians in Victorian London. But, at the heart of things, it is really a film about film-making.As far as I'm concerned, the goal of any film is threefold. I call it the 3 Es: Engage, Entertain, and Enlighten. Before either of the later two can happen, the audience must first be engaged. This means giving them a point of reference; that is to say, introduce them to something familiar right off the bat: a character that is relatable, and a situation or conflict that is easily comprehended. Once the audience is engaged, it is the filmmaker's duty to then entertain them, by putting the established characters in humorous or nerve-racking situations. There is a certain flare for creating truly entertaining scenes that only a few select directors possess. There is a kind of showmanship quality to film-making. The final thing a film must do is enlighten the audience. That is, the film should come to a point that stimulates the mind of the viewer. This is not always achieved and is even more difficult to pull off than pure entertainment. This third aspect is what separates great films from those that are simply good. It helps the film stick in people's minds long after they have seen it.The above three elements of the film viewing experience are directly comparable to the three stages of a magic trick, as discussed in ""The Prestige"". These are The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Turn is when the audience is shown something ordinary; a handkerchief or a small bird. This is much like the beginning of a film when the audience is engaged by something equally familiar. The second part is The Turn, when the ordinary thing is made to do something extraordinary, like disappear. ""But,"" as Michael Caine's character says in the the film, ""you wouldn't clap yet. It's not enough to make something disappear. You have to bring it back."" This seemingly miraculous return of the vanished object is The Prestige, and it is the most important part of the trick. These latter two parts are similar to the way entertaining the audience can bring them to something enlightening; how a heart pounding chase scene can wind and twist and turn, and then deposit us at some great, profound truth.Another convention of magic tricks that is shared in film-making is the suspension of disbelief. It is said in the film that the audience knows that it is only an illusion, but they don't want to know how it is accomplished. ""They want to be fooled"", as they say. This is equally true with the film viewing experience. Any individual of even average intelligence knows full well that what they are witnessing on screen is not entirely real, but they ignore that fact. They want something extraordinary. They want to see something aside from their familiar reality. They want to escape, and it is the job of both the magician and the filmmaker to render a believable fantasy for the viewing public.Filmmakers are the magicians of their day. With both magic and cinema, people go to the theater to see something outside of their own, regular experience. They are, at first, presented with something against which they can compare their own lives. ""I know what this is. I get this"", they think to themselves. Then, through this relatable proxy, the audience is taken on a journey into previously unknown territory, where they witness things they had never imagined and certainly did not expect. Then, at the end of this voyage, and indeed because of it, we come to a profundity that we had not known, yet it is undeniably true. We leave the theater having gained a fuller experience. Or course we know it was all smoke and mirrors, but to dwell on this notion would ruin something very special.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A wonderful magician... but a dreadful showman,"According to Micheal Caine's grizzled Cockney showman Cutter, every great magic trick consists of three parts.The first is the pledge - our magician shows us something ordinary. In the opening minutes of The Prestige Nolan fans will certainly feel on safe territory. The nonlinear narrative jerks us, under the familiar tones of Micheal Caine (currently Nolan's go-to man for Wise Old Associates), into the world of late-Victorian showmen - a world of canary cages and dusty warehouses, red curtains and blinding spotlights.Nolan's familiar themes of all-encompassing obsession (tackled brilliantly in his Batman films and the earlier Memento) are instantly addressed in the characters of Alfred Borden and Robert Angier, two magicians locked into a battle of wits over the accidental death of Angier's wife - of which he holds Borden responsible. Like a latter-day Hitchcock, Nolan has carved out a style of thriller all of his own - the washed-out orange filters, the noir-y smoky streets, Christian Bale, Micheal Caine. Strip back the super-hero elements and you've almost got a Victorian Batman Begins - except with two Batman's who prefer to use their brains over their fists.The second part of any great trick is the turn - in which our magician takes the ordinary something, and makes it do something extraordinary. It's from this comfortable position that The Prestige's increasingly convoluted and at times outright nasty plot can unfold - as the rivalry increases, consuming their entire lives, Angier finds himself drawn deeper into something close to true magic - and like all true magic, your disbelief - the 'look on their faces,' the source of Angier's obsession - becomes paramount, as Nolan is giving full reign to introduce the truly fantastical.Like Hitchcock the plot is everything - all the characters and backdrops are for the most part - like Scarlet Johanson's assistant - set dressing. In The Prestige everything hinges upon the twist. Nolan is perhaps the finest thriller director working in Hollywood today, yet the true human focus of his films is often subservient to the narrative - and The Prestige is no different.Borden's relationship with his wife seems unnecessarily forced (despite Bale's decent performance) and a little devoid of chemistry, as is Angier's with his assistant (Johanson) - yet this matters little, as the human element is there only to make the shocks more potent. As Cutter says, a lovely assistant is often one of the best forms of misdirection, and as The Prestige's narrative unfolds this soon becomes apparent in the film itself. The exception is David Bowie's surprisingly poignant turn as long-suffering failed genius Nikola Tesla, and the ever-reliable Micheal Caine.Finally at the end of any good trick, a magician brings back the object, the final deception - The Prestige. And as seems to be the case with all thrillers post-Usual Suspects, the twists in The Prestige's final reveal will completely change your viewing experience a second-time around.So... is the trick a success? Perhaps Angier's words sum up Christopher Nolan best - 'A wonderful magician, but a dreadful showman.' The narrative itself, the film's core, is perfect - in fact its twists and turns, its self-referencing, its playfulness elevate it above almost any other thriller released since.Yet where Nolan falls down is the presentation. Cinematography ranges from competent to good, but you don't get any Kubrick-style flashes of genius. Other than the two characters driving the plot, there's not a lot of human emotion to the proceedings - you never find yourself particularly caring for many of the side-characters, even when terrible things befall them (and without meaning to give too much away, terrible things DO befall a few of them). I've already compared Nolan to Hitchcock - a little hyperbolic, maybe, but he's the closest thing we have these days to the master - and he shares his faults, too.And yet for all that, The Prestige is a trick not to be missed, a rare enigmatic gem of a film that fails to give up all its secrets even at the end. A must-see for thriller fans, and an awe-inspiring treat for everyone else - and unlike the tricks it portrays, definitely worth seeing twice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent production with a broken plot contract,"The Prestige is a superb period mood piece with outstanding cinematography, excellent acting, great dialogue - and a plot that is a huge let down.We are told that every magic trick consists of three parts: the Pledge, that sets the stage and seemingly makes any trickery impossible, the Turn, where the trick happens, and the Prestige, where it all comes together to amaze and baffle the audience. The Prestige delivers a zinger of a Pledge: a vividly imagined Victorian London, a mysterious death, and two young genius friends turned bitter rivals - and an impossible piece of stage magic on which it all hinges. It all plays out splendidly with fantastic performances by both lead and supporting actors (with the exception of David Bowie's poorly conceived Nikola Tesla, and Scarlett Johansson, while great, is wasted on a role that never goes anywhere).But The Prestige lacks the Prestige. After setting the expectations high for a fiendishly clever reveal, the entire soufflé collapses as the finish relies on not one but two cop-outs that break the contract between storyteller and audience.All in all, The Prestige is immensely enjoyable for its acting, dialogue and cinematography for close to two hours, despite some plot weaknesses and occasional slow pacing, and equally immensely frustrating as the expectations for a clever reveal are not so much subverted as simply betrayed.Had as much effort been put into the plot as into the production, The Prestige might have been a masterpiece. As it is, it is still a very good film as long as you don't invest too much in the plot reveal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nearly as flawed as it is amazing,"Vastly entertaining period piece, centered around the rivalry between two magicians desperate to one-up each other, could have been one of the greatest mainstream riddlers to come along in some time. Instead, The Prestige tries so desperately to be the mind-melt it is envisioned as that the constant surprises feel suspiciously rote, character motivation feeling surprisingly laughable. Clearly, the Nolan brothers' dense script wished to outdo themselves, perhaps a tad overambitious coming from minds that produced the solid, compelling, deliciously confusing Memento.Here, crazy turn of events run like clockwork, authenticity comes and goes depending on the scene, and viewers foolishly witness a plot inside a vacuum that does not contrast any sort of real world interaction with the magic-centric scenario. All this makes the enjoyable twists and turns that Christopher Nolan employs throughout the introspective romp feel slightly less impacting then they should have, at times even coming across as laughably ridiculous; which is a shame really, since this original cat and mouse tale still ends up being something quite special.Banking on heavy replay value through inherent ambiguities that further enhance the mystery's shelf life, there is still an admirable amount of rational explanation to justify the increasingly unbelievable and enjoyable pace that will continue to indulge throwing viewers out of the loop if they do not, as illusionist Alfred Borden insists ""pay attention"". The brief narration may feel slightly condescending by basking in the art of it's own clever twists, but if someone had to be pretentious about the intricate script they have crafted, I am glad it is these guys. I just wished they would have spent a little more time fine tuning some of the individual scenes, since their ambitions often seemed to exceed a hard pressed wow factor.Cast-wise, the always hard working Christian Bale seems to be the only one that truly owned his character in the period it was meant to take place. Hugh Jackman usually felt way too modernized, and the A-list supporting cast felt out of place, almost superfluous. Even Michael Caine, one of our oldest and most respected working actors around, here in a role that is written as the glue to hold all of these wild themes together, feels unnecessary and forced most of the time. All in all though, The Prestige is a treat, overcoming the awkward setup to seduce viewers into caring about this most irrelevant of fictitious rivalries with compelling, creative force by the time the stage curtain has lowered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the worst movies ever,"It's the longest movie I've ever sit through, it felt like 9 or 10  hours at least. Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted  and stupid written only to get to the last ""shocking reveal"" that  ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction  Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood  believe that people are still impressed or interested in this ""usual  suspect"" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need  to be ""fooled"", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to  outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige).  And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not  that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just  that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the  writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible  or at least smart. No luck with that.  Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just  glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of  hours of my time with it.

Enjoyable but Far-fetched,The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and takes place in late Victorian London. The movie is enjoyable but just a little disappointing given the ecstatic reviews. Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play two competing magicians who start out as colleagues and end up as deadly rivals. It's set at a time when stage magicians were well paid and treated like rock stars. Angier is a smooth and polished American with considerable stage presence. Bale is a driven blue-collar type with brilliant and original ideas. Both become obsessed with their rivalry. Jackman enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to develop the ultimate magic trick. Unfortunately the results are unbelievable and spoil the movie.The acting is top-notch with a number of scene stealing performances. Cutter (Michael Caine) helps both men at the start of their careers and later becomes a mentor to Jackman. Scarlett Johansson plays a beautiful assistant who sleeps with both men and ends up disliking both of them.Jackman and Bale play ambitious Faustian characters willing to sell their souls to be the better magician. It's difficult to accept that two intelligent and rational humans could believe that their quest is worth the pain and sacrifice they inflict on others. Ultimately both characters seem flawed and somewhat delusional.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

More Intricate Than Clever,"The Prestige is a bag of tricks, an enigma inside another that misdirects and, at least tries to, suprise you till the end. However, while it's certainly intricately put together it's more complex than clever. The core twist isn't that hard to guess and the only part you might not expect if you aren't to familiar with it is the aspect which classifies it as a fantasy. Although in a movie that's almost entirely 'real' it's almost out of place to inject sci-fi.The film is told in a nonlinear fashion and combined with the fact that some parts are intentionally unclear it seems all over the place. While it spends the whole time traveling through time and piecing the story together, it's not till the last third that it truly kicks into gear. The majority of what's before is mostly backstory and magic shows(which even as something of an amateur one, I can say gets to be redundant and boring).The cast of the film is stacked with big names ranging from Christian Bale who's one of the finest actors of his time, to Hugh Jackman who's well cast here and the ever enduring Michael Caine. Which works well in a movie that's so focused on characters. The plot is centered around a rivalry but both the characters are rather unlikable and you can't pull for either though it ultimately lands on Christian Bale as its hero.The Prestige never pulls you in too deep nor does it floor you with its shocking reveals, but there's always something perplexing about it and it's a proffesional production.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Prestige,"As ever with Christopher Nolan films the chronology needs close attention - as so many of the clues as to what the hell is actually going on require a considerable degree of concentration (and multiple viewings) before any semblance of quality emanates from the outwardly cluttered and, frankly, preposterous plot. We start with Christian Bale (""Borden"") about to swing for the murder of Hugh Jackman (""Angier"") but of course it is not that simple; and through a series of complex flashbacks we discover just how these two, erstwhile friends and colleagues, got themselves into this predicament. This is a story about ambition, obsession - to succeed and to hate; it has elements of love - both men have relationships, one the cause of their estrangement; the other (with Scarlett Johansson) continues to fuel it. The whole nature of their profession - illusionists; conjurers of/to the imagination - lends itself splendidly to the subject of this vendetta. The look of the film is first class, with Wally Pfister creating a gem of vivid imagery with some wonderful visual effects too. The performances are OK - they are not great; the dialogue is likewise. For a film essentially about seeing being believing (or not) the script is frequently too wordy and overpowers the subtle opportunities for the actors to demonstrate rather than speak their parts. Sir Michael Caine probably brings the most authentic accent to the proceedings - the others left me needing quite a bit of convincing; and the brief appearances of David Bowie as Tesla were a poor choice of casting, I felt.

MY MOVIES: Nolan's Magic!!,"The Prestige. Every magic trick has three parts. The pledge where you show something ordinary, The Turn where you make that ordinary thing disappear and The Prestige where you make that thing appear again. Without The Prestige, a magic trick is worthless. On the same line, Nolan's magical movie works. He starts you showing few ordinary humanly characters, surprises you with its twists and turns of the story and then leave you speechless and awed at the end.Centred around the professional and personal rivalry of two magicians played by charismatic Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, The Prestige is a genius work of Christopher Nolan. With its non-linear story telling, he keeps you glued to the show of magic and life of magicians. With is period setting, great visuals, delicious dialogs and top notch performances by its lead and supporting actors like Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, Nolan creates a feast of cinematic magic.There are hardly any loose ends and revelations at the end, even if you saw them coming much earlier are great enough to leave you impressed. What also works in favour, that it is a mind bender and you might like to revisit to enjoy it more and more.I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for The Prestige. As it is said in the movie, people love to be fooled in this otherwise simple world, The Prestige is nothing less than a great magic trick played in front of you leaving you smiling and clapping at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Were you watching closely?""","The Prestige is both extremely straightforward and endlessly perplexing. When you reach the final twist you may think the experience is over, but the greater implications of his character's actions are exactly what make this one of Nolan's best films. Releasing a year after Batman Begins, Nolan pushes aside the blockbuster superhero shtick for a self-reflective film about obsession and love for one's craft. The themes explored are limited and specific, and Nolan focuses on them with pin-point accuracy throughout the entire runtime. It is a confusing and devastating film which is ultimately about art, admiration, and how far someone is willing to go to achieve their goals.The only issue I found was with Scarlet Johansson's character, Olivia, who seemed to have a ton of potential but ended up lacking dimension-I'm not a fan with how sidelined the three women in this movie are in general, but Johansson's character is by far the flattest.Nolan jumps around through time quite a lot throughout the movie, but these choices actually serve the plot rather being a gimmick. Great performances from Christian Bale, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, and Piper Perabo (who should have been one of our biggest movie stars!). And, oh yeah, one of Hugh Jackman's best performances to date.The Prestige deserves a second viewing (at least!) as soon as possible. Nolan ends the movie by gentling goading us, the audience, to see if we have fully received the magic of the film:

One of the best EVER....seriously!!!!,"I went into this film a bit apprehensive, I can't lie. Having enjoyed Nolan's first two films immensely, being slightly disappointed by his third ( though I have this feeling I need to give it a second chance) and totally digging his fourth.come one Bale as Batman it's a no brainer! Needless to say I didn't quite know what to expect. Part of me felt this was a little side film in the interim between Bat flicks (stupidI know that now) Part of me was hoping he hadn't completely gone Hollywood. Literally 30 seconds into The Prestige and all doubts just floated away. Nolan is back in a big way, and I cant emphasize this next statement enough.if you haven't seen this film get off you're a$$ right now and see it. Stop reading this review and just go!! What can I say? I was utterly blown away by this film. Everything was amazing about it, the story ( who knew a film about magicians could be this good), the cinematography, the editing/pacing, the performances all top notch. It is a film that is at least on par w/his previous work and arguably his best so far. One of the best times I've had at the movies everand I see a lot of films. You see I went in not knowing much other than this was a new Nolan film and the cast. I hadn't even a seen a trailer yet. Perhaps this was why I was in such awe of the story. Though that's not it entirely, the story combined with its non linear presentation has this way of grabbing hold of you and not letting go until the finale. The structure is brilliant, with out giving to much away the film is for the most part told from journal entries being read by the films two leads. The story is told in a non-linear fashion that is a bit confusing but you will quickly get a a handle on things. Or maybe I'm just slower than everyone else lol. I could go on forever about how ever aspect of the film was brilliant but that would just be time your not watching the filmand quite honestly if you've already seen it then you already know. Or maybe you don't and you think I'm a complete dork for digging this silly film about magicians.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Very good and highly recommended, but not in my top 10 for the year","I've read some of the other reviews after seeing this, and I have the urge to say, ""Get real, this was darn good, but it wasn't THE QUEEN or THE DEPARTED. It's sure better than 75% of the movies out there though.It's about magic and it draws a person into this world of illusion. Unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, this goes into a world of professional rivalry which escalates until it becomes deadly. As such, it entertains massively and is a movie one will be glad to have seen.This shows that Christopher Bale and Hugh Jackman certainly are serious actors capable of being more than comic book characters, and Christopher Nolan is more than a director of comic book adaptations.This is indeed a movie to see, but don't stop here.

excellent,"was a brilliant movie!!! beginning was a bit slow but yes very good. it was hard to understand though the ending. a quite confusing film but thats what made it so great. i don't recommend it for those who want a simple film as it is far from it. its not like those straight forward type films, in which a simpleton could understand. there are dark aspects to it which could shake up people but it gives it that suspense feel which makes you want to watch more. i was sort of put off with the film at first as it was a very boring start. it doesn't attract audiences to stay and watch the film, but lucky i did. like other film this has a slow start which may put you off but i do say that you must stay and watch the rest. overall i think everyone should watch it, it does give you different sort of movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Full throttled, Gripping and Leave you amused!",Without any doubt this movie comes in top 10 best movies I have ever watched in my lifetime till date and It will surely be for a coming long time. Nothing of this tale left you unsatisfied or bored at a single second. Truly a masterpiece to must have in one's video library. hats off to all the team! Human emotions represented at most vibrant colors and zest of passion of one's mad obsession. Another aspect which drives this movie more near to my heart is the Scientific historical facts used as baseline of story. Magic is not just a game but a way of life.

Real Magic!,"It doesn't matter how many times you watch it, how you look at it or what the haters say: This movie is incredible, its flawless, a masterpiece. The cinematography, the acting, the music... I really don't think it has any flaws. Every detail, meticulously crafted. I have only praises regarding this movie, here are my biggest. First, the acting. Most actors in this movie have, in my opinion, given the best performance of their career. Even in the voice overs, actors give stellar performances. My second biggest praise is obviously the direction. Like I said, every detail is given careful attention. Christopher Nolan has a near-perfect record but I find that The Prestige is its best. Finally, the integrity this movie has is something I simply can't get over. The plot is perfectly parallel to the script's structure. While the plot itself is incredible, the fact that it aligns flawlessly with the movie's meaning is something cinema has rarely done and I think its worth mentioning as one of the biggest achievements in its history.

"One of the top Nolan films and one of the very best and remarkable films ever made! Two men, one vendetta, The Prestige.","Historical / thriller / fantasy film. It takes us back to the 19th century, to another era, where two young magicians are in their infancy. A fatal mistake of one in the other's wife, starts an eternal vendetta, something beyond than just competition. As the plot unfolds, the original incentive of the vendetta has been forgotten, there is only rivalry now, with no return. It also introduces us a vendetta behind the vendetta. So, apart from the vendetta of the two magicians, there is also the well-known Tesla-Edison vendetta and there the film gives some science fiction with a fiction Tesla device.

Two Face,"""Batman Begins"" 's sequel may not be the one you think it is. If the end of the last Christopher Nolan's picture introduces a new and laughing threat in Gotham City, which will indeed face the Jocker in 2008, it also announces complex narrative ideas, that ""The Prestige"" greatly develops.Inspector James Gordon, portrayed in ""Batman Begins"" like a pessimistic crime philosopher, theorized evil as a mimetic spiral, saying that if justice uses masks, tricks and theatrical fear, like the Batman does, the villains he fights will do the same. The two faces will always imitate them-self, in a perfect symmetry that leads to more elaborated weapons and increase the level of violence. ""The Prestige"", even before this confrontation between the Batman and the Jocker, illustrates Gordon's statement, through the confrontation between two magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, for those who dreamed about a cinematographic crossover between Batman and Wolverine...) in the dark streets of London in the late XIX century (those who lived there or read ""From Hell"" know what I'm talking about). And of course,as the movie goes on, their fight becomes more and more dramatic, more and more epic, and more and more violent.""The Prestige"" already transcends Nolan's filmography and could be seen like the artistic apogee of his career (for now on), because it mixes the great storytelling style of ""Batman Begins"" and ""Insomnia"" with the experimental narration and style of ""Fallowing"" and ""Memento"". The film also develops thematics from the previous Nolan's movies, such as the dualism of the characters, which always are in the edge of madness, the obsession which leads to the lost of your humanity, the constant in and go in time, which loses the spectator into the tortured consciences of the characters (but you always understand everything because of the intelligence and the finesse of the construction), etc. This great storytelling, mixed with this accurate style defines what we can call ""narrative realism"". This means that all the realistic elements of the movies only goes to maintain the dramatic progression of the plot and to develops the themes of the movie. That gives the impression that the story and its progression is all that matters in the movie, but that it only works because of the complexity of the style that underlines it : multiplicity of the points of view, intermix of the time lines, suspensions of the revelations, etc. ""Narrative realism"", which can regroups cinematographer like Nolan, but also Shyamalan, creates a new form of modernity, in with the storyline is essential - whereas it isn't in post-modern cinema, as you can experience it with Lynch or Tarantino 's movies. You enjoy fallowing the plot of the movie, but you also take great pleasure in its complex structure, which is clever and modern.In my opinion, such a fun redefinition of cinematographic modernity hasn't occur in American cinema since David Fincher's ""Fight Club"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Pay close attention...,"In magic (or illusion for that matter) every trick consists of three acts - just like a movie. The first part is called The Pledge. The second part is The Turn. And the third part is called The Prestige.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as rival illusionists Borden and Angier. They were friends who worked together, until an unfortunate incident made them enemies. Now they are competing in the world of magic, and intentionally ruining each other's shows.Most of the film takes place in the past, telling us about the troubled relationship between the two men, in the midst of an investigation into Angier's death. Oops, spoiler? Nope, no spoiler. The film starts with Angier's death, and then traces the events leading to that moment. 'The Prestige' is a stylish mystery thriller, with plenty of thrills and twists. As with magic, nothing is what it seems and you have to pay very close attention. It also effectively illustrates human obsession. Both men in turn are the protagonist, and the antagonist.Michael Caine stars as Cutter, the man who invents the gadgets for Angier's illusions. Borden's main trick is The Transported Man, which Borden invented. Angier copies the trick to the best of his ability. However, Angier still doesn't know how Borden does his trick, and Angier and Cutter are trying to unravel the mystery of this trick.The trick is also the center of the movie, and has to be kept in mind when the film ends on a bit of a confusing note. If you've paid very close attention to the movie from the start, everything will make sense. Nothing here happens by chance. This is a brilliant script, very well acted by seasoned actors, and it is visually great, as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An absolute gem,"This is one of my all time favorite films. It's clever, well made, well acted, well directed and the scenes and camera work are impeccable, and impeccably timed. The plot and narrative is tight, gripping and keeps you guessing with some genuinely suprising OMG moments (unless of course you're clever enough to work it out - or boring enough to ""read-up"" on the film beforehand).One of my favourite aspects of the film is the competitive one-upmanship between the 2 leads; the rivalry is palpable. I honestly can't get enough of it. The way it moves them to push the boundaries of their creativity, deviousness and preparedness to to do whatever is takes to win, no matter what the cost, speaks volumes to their utter obsession with their craft.If you like good films, and aren't hung up on genre, I highly recommend this gem of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nolan's real follow-up to Memento,"After his brilliant breakout film Memento, director Chris Nolan went on to create the forgettable Insomnia and the overrated Batman Begins. The third outing to come (The Prestige), however, is his real follow-up to Memento, in my own honest little opinion, both in quality as well as in depth.This moody and complex film is a real treat for cinephiles wherever they are. Describing a fatal rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two competing magicians in 19th century London, it capitalizes largely on the length some people will go just to get even with their professional opponents. While the magic displayed on screen is what catches your eye at first, it is the swirl of emotions our two lead characters go through that makes this a true delight. Spanning over numerous years, we see Angier and Borden going from great career and personal heights to the lowest bottoms in their pursuit of the one true magic trick that'll make people remember them for years to come.To top this all up, the movie itself acts as the ultimate magic trick, with its various acts working as the required steps that allow us to fully enjoy and realize the final twist for all its brilliance and originality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Are you watching closely?""","FILM: 9/10.Christopher Nolan's 2006 film, The Prestige, is just as mind-bending and captivating as I remember it. From the very first scene, I found myself completely drawn into the intricate battle of wits between Christian Bale's Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier. The film's narrative structure, with its Nolan-trademarked non-linear storytelling, adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps you guessing until the very end.One of the highlights of this rewatch was David Bowie's portrayal of Nikola Tesla. Bowie's performance is nothing short of excellent, capturing the enigmatic nature of the legendary inventor. His presence on screen is magnetic, and every scene he's in becomes instantly more intriguing. It's a testament to Bowie's talent as an actor that he seamlessly fits into the already stellar cast.Another standout aspect of The Prestige is David Julyan's score. It's sparse, yet incredibly effective in building tension and enhancing the film's mysterious atmosphere. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the story, and the score's minimalistic approach allows the performances and plot to take center stage. It's a masterful work that lingers in your mind even after the credits roll.As I followed Borden and Angier's rivalry, I became engrossed in their obsession with magic and the lengths they are willing to go to outdo each other. The film delves deep into themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions. Each twist and turn in the plot challenges you, and the final revelation still leaves me in awe. The Prestige is a testament to Christopher Nolan's storytelling prowess. His direction is flawless, and he effortlessly weaves together themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the nature of illusion.The Prestige is a cinematic gem that combines a compelling story, brilliant performances, and a touch of magic. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and thematically rich experience. This rewatch reminded me of why I fell in love with this film in the first place, and it has only deepened my appreciation for its intricacies.

Some of his earlier films are now downright embarrassing!I confess that I felt a little bit cheated during the early scenes in this film. I felt that there were unnecessarily complex scenes which did not seem to move the plot along. In retrospect they were probably simply building character etc. But after the first half hour or so we settled to some fascinating insights into these two complex characters.The whole plot was built up beautifully, with clues to the final 'denouement' that would have had Miss Marple chuckling, and no, I did not see the triple twist coming. I saw the water tank one quite early on and sat congratulating myself that I had 'worked it out'.Congratulations to the writer for having a twist that had me kicking myself for not seeing coming!

I guess I expected too much,"I loved the actors in this move. I also love the director. I was, unfortunately, tainted I fear by my viewing of THE ILLUSIONIST, which was a clearly a better film in my opinion. I mention THE ILLUSIONIST for only two reason, reasons that caused me to like THE ILLUSIONIST and made me disappointed in THE PRESTIGE. First least significant was the magic performed: I was far more entertained by the former movie's magic tricks than the latter, which were explained and therefore less magical--even the ""scientific"" tricks, which I will not spoil here. Second and far more important, was the level of intelligence in the plot and the writing of the film. THE PRESTIGE suffered, in my opinion, from twists that become illogical, right to the very end which was obvious to me from the middle of the film. Meanwhile, THE ILLUSIONIST, which again I admit tainted my experience by raising the proverbial bar and challenging THE PRESTIGE, brilliantly revealed incredibly intricate plot motivations and actions that we only figure out at the very ending of the film--though I suspect many viewers will not put all the pieces of THE ILLUSIONIST together even after being handed the details by film's end. In short, THE PRESTIGE was an enjoyable film for high school students and for people who want to see a movie by will not think about what is happening. THE ILLUSIONIST is for college graduates who actually earned their degree. I realize this sounds very snobbish, for which I am sorry. But I am trying to be honest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nolan not a one trick magician,"My goodness, Christopher Nolan is on a roll, after his stellar, mind-bending debut 'Momento' and his superb Batman Re-invention, Nolan has paused to show his versatility before embarking on The Batman Sequel 'The Dark Knight' to give us 'The Prestige'.It's a dark,almost Shakespearian film about two Magicians, both friend's and rival's, who's passion for the performance of magic turns into a bitter obsession to outwit each other. This obsession becomes a dangerous cat and mouse game of intrigue, jealousy, after a tragic event, but what is illusion in this deadly game, and who is fooling who.The first thing that must be commented on is the magnificent script by the Nolan brothers, complex and impeccably executed. Secondly A superb cast. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cain, Scarlett Johanisson, David Bowie, the cast does a magnificent job, particularly Bale and Jackman. Bale in an intense and cold performance, Jackman flawlessly switching from vulnerability to intensity with ease.

Astonishing!,"This film is why you go to the theater and then back and then another time. From the first to the last it delivers.

I found myself turning the story and characters over and over in mind and even found my dreams influenced. Typically the impact of a film leaves me as soon as I walk out of the theater. I've not felt the impact of film in such a personal way since The Dead Poets Society.My one complaint is the non-linearity of the story in key places.

Not terribly mysterious; too many twists,"The prestige, we're told, is the third and final part of a magic act, the one in which the twists and turns occur, the denouement of the act. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Apparently magicians analyze and study their craft endlessly, trying to improve, compete, excel, and dominate. The Prestige is about two lifelong competing magicians in 1900s London who are constantly trying to discover each other's secrets. Eventually, as they top each other, there's death, perhaps murder, placing everyone they know in mortal danger.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is the showman, the magician with a flair for the dramatic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is the moody technician with the creativity and intelligence to pull off the most remarkable stunts. They would seem to be fine complements for each other, but each is so set on beating the other that all pretense of camaraderie is abandoned.What follows, of course, is a couple hours of twists and turns, with so and so turning out to not be what he or she was purported to be. One of Angier's tricks goes horribly awry, and Borden is blamed for the result and is jailed. Is he guilty? How did he accomplish it? Linking the two masters is the aged Cutter (Michael Caine), who's been training them both since they were just starting out. A veteran of the gritty, no-holds-barred magic world, Cutter Knows Things. With a glint in his eye and a crusty grin, he reminded me more of Long John Silver, except without the eye path or the walking stick. Nothing like a crusty ol' sage to keep everyone in check, right? The heart of the animosity between Angier and Borden is that it's thought that Borden somehow was responsible for the death of Angier's wife during their act. Then Borden goes on to fame and fortune while Angier has nothing. Even Borden's tricks kick the ass of Angier's tricks, so much so that the latter journeys to, of all places, Boulder, Colorado in the United States to seek out Nicholas Tesla (well played by David Bowie), who'd built a funky device for Borden to use in his own act. All that's missing is Angier shouting, ""Vengeance will be mine!"" Enter Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), a trollop/assistant who joins Angier's act. They fall in love, surprisingly. (That sentence brought to you by the word ""sarcasm."") Meanwhile, Borden falls in love with HIS assistant and knocks her up. So it's sort of like real life.Perhaps where the movie really lost me is in its science - one must suspend quite a bit of disbelief in order for key parts of the film to be acceptable. That's one of the risks of a story about magic; modern audiences know a lot more about science than did those at the turn of the last century, so there'd be much more skepticism. If Angier's trick were shown today, people would have myriad guesses as to what really happened, whereas in the 1900s it was all magic and wonder and crap like that. Still and all, the way in which Angier accomplishes his trick seems like a shaggy dog - it's in the story merely to move the plot along.I like movies with twists and turns, but when there are so many of them I no longer know what's right and what's wrong, I kind of lost interest in the movie. I hate not knowing which way is up, because when the credibility of each character - and, by extension, their own reality - is called into question, then the viewer has nothing to go by, and truly Anything can happen. Which makes me wonder what the point really is.On the plus side, you have the subtext of Batman (Bale) versus Wolverine (Jackman). Even Alfred from Batman is there (Caine).

One of the best of the year,"""The Prestige"" is a film about two magicians who are friends at first but when a tragedy strikes, the two split up and have their own magic acts. A rivalry begins between them and from there, the movie twists and turns like a windy road.The acting is the strongest point of the film. Jackman and Bale are both charismatic and extremely likable, although I'll admit I was cheering for Bale (Who wasn't? :P). The plot is well developed and some have complained about the length but when you have a good movie playing, you don't notice the time. Once the movie grabs you, it doesn't let go.Definitely worth the admission price. Go see it, tell your friends, and you'll thank me later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Two rival magicians escalate the already fierce competition between them.,"The plot of was totally enthralling and kept one guessing from beginning to end. The film beautifully captured much of the ambiance of the late Victorian era. At times, the cinematography was incredibly breathtaking, but more importantly, the entire spirit of how tough and cutthroat the competition must have really been for magicians trying to make a name for themselves in those days was readily evident. The characters were superbly acted by all concerned because they were quite believable. In particular, I thought Michael Caine was outstanding as Cutter and I was additionally happy to see David Bowie portray Nikola Tesla.I also enjoyed the fact there was a truly 'surprise element' to it which might prompt people to think about what transpired within the movie on a deeper level. It is very refreshing to see a movie come along that's original in many aspects. The movie was well written and directed, to say the least.I love movies which I can come away with with a sense of something significant having happened which causes me to reflect. This movie definitely fits the bill.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely Magic!,"I love magic tricks. It's the intrigue of how the magician did it, the risk of knowing it could kill the 'assistant' and just the whole feeling of knowing you'll see something amazing.'The Prestige' is strikingly similar to a magic show that you'd see at the theatre. It starts off grasping your attention, and then quickly throws you into the action, where you see a performance gone wrong, which left me covering my mouth in shock.If 'The Prestige' had been filmed with any other actors, I probably would have been disappointed (but only so slightly). Jackman, Bale and Caine are all stars we are fond of, and they have only boosted their reputation by giving stunning performances in this film. Johansson's acting was a little dull and uninspired, but her roll was, in the end, fairly small.The storyline was at some times a bit confusing, and I found myself trying to work out what came when and who was who, but it all fell into place in the final half hour, along with a plethora of shocking twists that make the story better and better. I can't say how close it is to the book by Christopher Priest (I'm soon to read it), but from what I have heard, the films is highly respected by most fans of the novel.I don't want to go into the story too much, because it would ruin the movie for anyone. It's a film to see when you're aware and observant, though, as it's quite easy for you to get confused and possibly spoil the movie.I'm giving it 9/10, and it gets 'Film of the Year' from me, without a doubt!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it.,"Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it. While having only a few films under his belt (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia), trust Christopher Nolan to produce, write and direct films only of this extraordinary depth and caliber.Another thing to clue you in on how marvelous The Prestige is: the exceptional cast. Premiere cult actor Christian Bale (also of Batman Begins, American Psycho) convincingly switches from ruthless to charming as the richly layered magician Borden that rivals multi-talented Hugh Jackman's suave but obsessive Angier. Michael Caine as their subtly complex assistant, David Bowie as the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla and Rebecca Hall as Borden's quietly suffering wife all add to the tension, mystery and suspension of disbelief that make The Prestige such a success. Scarlett Johanssen is the only one who unfortunately becomes just the cherry that tops all the eye candy, but her screen presence is unquestionable.This is Nolan's best piece to date: his film-making resonates the magical theme, the dark, moody textures of the period, and the fragmented storytelling. He mirrors the obsessive, fiercely competitive magicians on screen, by showcasing his expertise in using flashbacks and foreshadowing; each framed element carefully placed, everything connecting to the beautifully poignant end.The Prestige hooks you in from the very first scene of the mysterious mountain of top hats; you allow its stunning imagery, characters and storyline to seduce you into its enigmatic world and leave you enthralled but aching for more when the credits roll and the evocatively appropriate soundtrack ""Analyse"" by Radiohead's Thom Yorke stays with you long after your cinematic experience. Nolan's slick sleight-of-hand demo proves that commercial efforts need not be blithe, campy or depressing to also be critically acclaimed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Under the Radar 10 star movie,"Hugh Jackman Is on fire!!!! Every movie he touches is great. A spectacular actor. Chris Nolan (the director) is also on fire. All his movies seem to be fantastic. This is not really a period piece even though it is set in Victorian England, but told not through the repressive usual way, but from the way that Victorian England was also a time of great amazement, People all over sought amazement as this time was the height of science and therefore pseudo-science. This movie has the best storyline ever. the Storyline is itself a magic trick and you won't know how it comes together till the end and when you do, it's a bit scary.

Great performance.,"It's best to not reveal anything about the plot as it's not fun to ruin the moment, just like magic tricks. Instead, I'll mention a few things about The Prestige. Go with the open mind, and I'll promise you love it.The Prestige is well directed and written (you can thank Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for that). While I haven't read the original novel, apparently Christopher Priest was completely surprised by what he was seeing, so I can guess that anyone, who has read the original novel, will like this movie too. Excellent cast. Everyone gave their best, but I did find Andy Serkis a bit weird but you can't blame him. You already know where his fame came from and you can't unsee it. Other than that, no complaints. You can see Nolan likes to use same actors in his movies. I do think that maybe Christian Bale was the best actor, and I'm not surprised by that. The man knows how to give a good performance. Hugh Jackman was also good. It's always a relief that he has a talent to play roles that aren't Wolverine (not that he was bad in it, he's great) This movie isn't special effect heavy as other movies directed by Nolan but you can compare it to Memento, despite the differences in themes. Just like Memento, it's more of a thriller and drama than an action movie.The Prestige does show a pretty convincing impression of the end of the 19th century. No CGI backgrounds that look bland. The editing, music and cinematography is standard good quality you would expect.There were a few moments which I did find questionable, and as something that could break the suspension of disbelief. Luckily, I wasn't bothered that much and those moments were only a few.I don't want to give too much credit to Nolan brothers as I don't want to discredit anyone else that were involved in the movie but if you like their work, I'm 100% sure that you will like this movie just like the others. It may require a repeated viewing to some people but I don't consider it a bad thing. I highly recommend The Prestige.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great film,"The prestige is just so unpredictable that you wort see the final scene in the film coming. Great acting script and setting. It takes you to an otter World, its movie making ad its Best. Its sure Worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Prestige,"As the title suggests, this could be the final review of the prestige but as the movie starts this will be my final take on what is a brilliant movie and achievement in film making. Throughout the years I have watched the prestige too many times but this just speaks to how good it is with a number of factors some quite obvious others not so.The prestige is by no means a simple movie and this expertly shown with Nolans signature exposition this can be seen in the opening scene's and this sets the tone for the rest of the movie which is a great touch as I feel some people may be confused by the name and how a magician can make a great film. One of the obvious staring points for The Prestige is that it has a stellar cast and with this comes some of the best acting you will see in a movie; even from David Bowie, the main treat for the audience in my opinion comes from Hugh Jackman as his level of acting in The Prestige is hard to come by; not a foot wrong, he really helps to capture the desperation and want and need for passion and curiosity and it goes to show the level some humans will go to, to find out what the trick is. Again another star role in Christian Bale's character is definitely not squandered as he shows a dark and gritty but quiet way of going about his life almost begging the question if he is bi polar until the prestige is reviled this is just another reason The Prestige is one of the best films in the last 20 years.Visually, The Prestige is nothing short of unique I would say stunning but there is not many if any other movies shot in this way giving a sort of vintage feel to it as even if The Prestige came out 50 years ago it would still be as critically acclaimed because there is little CGI used which probably could be worked around. That being said the use of this type of Imax cameras helps to give the movie dark and cold undertones which in my opinion helps to show desperation and a greed for fame but also keeping the mysterious nature of how the trick is done.Now for the best part of the movie, undoubtedly; the story telling is just off the charts beautiful evoking passion, inquisitiveness, shock and most of all sadness this helps to give an almost frustrating sense when nothing is reviewed to the audience almost keeping its cards hidden. The best part of the story telling for me has to be how the movie is structured, With the beginning of the film being the pledge: with it being two ordinary magicians that seek greatness and we've all seen that before, then the movie movies onto the Turn making the actors and characters do something extraordinary but not too far fetched for it to be unbelievable in this case it would be the teleportation magic trick, Then for me which is some of the greatest film and movie making ever The prestige of the film one of the most apoplectic and shocking obviously no spoilers but this really is the twist of all twist; only Christopher Nolan could pull something so brilliant off with such incredible execution almost as good as the magic trick it self.This really is a film makers film and for the prestige of my review the twist you could say is that this movie is terrible, no I'm just kidding this is definitely one of the best movies ever made with a collection of everything the viewer and director would want showing just how powerful a human can really be when their mind is set on greatness taking only themselves into account which is why I believe this film is nothing short of a masterpiece and I do believe a 10 out of 10 is the least I should be giving it, and still to this day I believe it is extremely under appreciated and underrated with honestly no movie even coming close to the genius and creativity of what is and will be one of the best endings to a movie ever.Thank you for reading,",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

While she went and saw Little Miss Sunshine, I had the best theater experience of my life (to that point) and I've loved the film ever since that cold rainy night.I'll try not to be biased when I say this, The Prestige is Nolan's best film.Audiences seem to complain about a lack of development in Nolan's characters. Not in The Prestige however. On a first viewing, audiences are transfixed by the two most believable stage magicians ever put to film, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden who are played awesomely by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden) as they tamper with each others Magic Acts and attempt to uncover the others secret all set beautifully to a post Victorian world. But on second and repeat viewings it is the ensemble cast that really steals the show especially Michael Caine who plays Cutter, a stage magic engineer. Also the two lovers of Borden played by Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall who is absolutely worth watching on the second viewing.

Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige is one of those rare films that truly reward repeated viewing. One would think that a film that relies so heavily on a twist at the end would feel flat the second time around but instead knowing how things fit together allows you to fully appreciate how masterfully it is all foreshadowed.The script is great, the editing is brilliant and the vision required to bring this to life is staggering. I have watched it three times now and I'm yet to find a flaw in how this is put together. My appreciation grows with each new viewing. The cinematography is great as well. For a period piece it feels remarkably fresh and almost contemporary.The acting is good if not great. Christian Bale gives a restrained but nuanced performance as Borden while Hugh Jackman impresses as his nemesis Angier. Not Oscar-worthy material but more than serviceable. Among the supporting cast it's worth mentioning Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah and Michael Caine as Cutter. They both provide the heart and soul of this movie, a counterpoint to the single-minded obsession shown by the two protagonists. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are always a delight to watch even if their parts here are fairly small.A great study in the nature of obsession and how it brings two men into a downward spiral that can only end in disaster.

Nolan rules...,"Christopher Nolan rules... I have seen most of Nolan's previous work - The Following (mostly unkonwn in this part of the world), Memento (his breakthrough) and Batman Begins. With increasing budgets for each of these films the rich layered texture of his scripts has becomes grander without taking anything away from the script.With Batman Begins Nolan used two great acting talents in Christian Bale and Micheal Cane. Cane is a proved talent while Bale is establishing himself as up and coming leading man (courtesy Christopher Nolan). He has used that combination again with addition of another dependable star - Hugh Jackman.Jackman and Bale are two Illusianists who are learning the ropes of putting up new illusions under the tutelage of Cane, the master illusion builder. Amongst the two Bale is a natural illusionist while Jackman is the natural showman. Their friendship is never really developed or even implied though they are shown to be friendly but always competitive. However an on-stage accident changes all that and turns the competition into rivalry and as the years pass by rivalry turns life threatening.However great the cast maybe the star of a typical Nolan movie is its script. His movies use actors as puppets - like Hitchcock used his actors. The characters come in and say things that are absolutely baffling and at the end of the film all the random straws are neatly tied into place and suddenly make sense.A great film that needs to watched at least twice... I am eagerly anticipating the DVD release of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nolan hits (yet) another one out of the park,"No slump in sight for writer/director Christopher Nolan. He's now four for four, following up the solid efforts of ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"" with the equally fantastic ""The Prestige."" When's the last time a writer or director managed four consecutive films under their belt that were each fiercely distinctive and creatively successful? Nolan added further insult to the incompetent and lazy of Hollywood by actually improving upon the source novel. The eye-rolling one experienced while reading Christopher Priest's prose became gasps while watching Nolan's skilled adaptation. Nolan not only ""fixed"" Priest's novel, but turned it up to 11, conceptually. Good direction and especially good writing are invisible -- people expect a competent job. Only the truly great and truly terrible stick out. Nolan's accomplished something truly great on both levels. Superb actors (especially one bit of stunt-casting comes as a wonderful surprise; usually these types of cameos detract from a picture but Nolan's steady hand delivered), lush production design and careful attention to the thematic bedrock make for a contemporary classic. The only shortcoming, which is minor, might be the show's abrupt cutting around during the first act, which could seem a bit confusing. The unique layered non-linear continuity (diary-within-diary-within-story, etc) works flawlessly when Nolan's taking his time. Keep the film's curious first image in mind while the narrative untangles and keep your mind open when things turn toward steampunk. And you fanboys who were miffed because Nolan ""wasted time"" on this feature between Batman blockbusters should rejoice. The guy has more than enough juice for the Dark Knight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Real Amusement,"""The Prestige"" is a 2006 American psychological thriller film directed and written by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Scarlett Johansson and is about the competition between two stage magicians in late-nineteenth-century London, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). The narrative is portrayed in flashbacks as the two men strive to outdo one other with more deadly and complex pranks, culminating in a dramatic final showdown.The film delves on issues such as obsession, duplicity, and the sacrifices one is ready to make in order to achieve success. The film also explores the concept of ""prestige,"" or the closing act of a magic show that leaves the audience speechless, and the lengths one is prepared to go to obtain it.""The Prestige"" was a critical and economic triumph, and it received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. The storyline, cast performances, and directing of the film were all highly praised.The performance was fantastic, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who were brilliant in the picture; the film embraces the end-of-the-nineteenth-century period, and it is a terrific film.David Julyan composed the film's soundtrack, which was commended for its ability to complement the tale and express the passion and emotion of the film's story. Classical music is also included throughout the film, including ""Nimrod"" from Elgar's Enigma Variations and ""The Hall of the Mountain King"" from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt.Ultimately, ""The Prestige"" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking thriller that delves into the obsession, deception, and sacrifices that are necessary for success in the realm of stage magic. Its outstanding performances, brilliant directing, and use of music make it a must-see picture. The sophisticated narrative of the film, with several twists and turns, will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The way the plot twists fit perfectly on the story and the fact they actually relation the story to the time where it happens is brilliant. It's a movie that we do not see that often and a definite must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"almost, but not quite","Every once in a while there comes a movie that is captivating. When watching such a movie, one forgets that he or she is even watching a fictitious story at all, and when such a movie ends, movie-goers excitedly try to remember every last detail of its plot and try to more fully appreciate every intricacy that went into it. More often, however, there are movies that seem to have all of that in the works, but just miss the mark. Christopher Nolan's (Batman Begins) newest film, The Prestige, is an example of the second type of movie. The acting, costumes, and editing that worked so well to immerse the audience are all but wasted due to the film's disappointing conclusion.Christian Bale (of Batman Begins fame) plays Alfred Borden, a magician who at the start of the film is on trial for the murder of fellow magician, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Borden is convicted and sent to jail to await his execution. While in jail he is given Angier's diary to read which chronicles Angier's rivalry with Borden, and his obsessive attempts to recreate Angier's ""disappearing man"" trick.The first element that comes into play is the editing. Nolan chooses to tell his story non-linearly, starting en media res and skipping from various points in time in each of the character's lives. In so doing he is able to take relatively simple subject matter (the rivalry between the two men) and maximizes its effect. Each scene is edited in such a way that it reveals something new about the character, that if done otherwise would not be as evident. Nolan also manipulates our emotions by constantly showing the darker sides of the two main characters in such a way that we don't know who we should sympathize with.Of course without the wonderful performances all around, the editing would be rendered moot. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play their roles pitch perfectly. How interesting it is to see both of these actors fresh off two comic book movies (Batman Begins for Bale, and the X-men trilogy for Jackman) both able to adjust themselves to more serious roles. Jackman's obsessiveness is always believable, never forced. Likewise, Bale' portrayal of the arrogant and selfish Borden is totally convincing. Bale, who is Welsh, once again proves that he is a master of accents, moving so easily from the American accent showcased in Batman Begins to a British accent here in The Prestige. Of special consideration is David Bowie in the role of Nikola Tesla. His character is called in near the end to help Angier finally create a better magic trick than Borden's ""disappearing man"" trick. Bowie owns the role, demanding out attention, being both sympathetic and cocky at the same time.Finally, the costumes and set designs all work to immerse us in the story. The movie was shot on real locations, and it shows. The costumes look entirely period, and before we are even told that the movie takes place in 1887, we know right by looking at the characters. If the movie doesn't get nominated for academy awards in these areas it would be a real shame.The sum of all these parts help to create the illusion of reality, or rather, credibility in the story. Here in lies the major problem with the film. The ending revolves around the murder of Angier, and how it relates to the machine used in the ""New Disappearing Man Trick."" While I cannot reveal the secret, all I can say is that it is terribly disappointing. It stretches credibility too far, as if the writers had finally come to the ending without realizing that they needed to write it. It also works to discredit the characters as true magicians and inventive thinkers.In the end there is a lot to like about The Prestige. It is wonderful in both its simplicity of story and complexity of themes. It is a wonder to look at, and much can be gained from a second viewing. All you need to do is be prepared to really suspend disbelief.***/*****",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Abacadabra - no bunny from the high hat,"At the end of the 19th century two helpers to an illusionist are good friends. One of them married to a third help. They pick up the tricks from their master and things go well. Until a sudden event changes things in a big way.

The Prestige- A Truly Outstanding Movie,"Christopher Nolan strikes back!!!! He is one stylish Hollywood director who knows how to make you believe the unbelievable. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians it is also a complex character study about how self-destructive an obsession can be. Integrating this plot with a love story and a sci-fi twist truly makes this a masterpiece. The Prestige comes with a unique plot with a fabulous drama and an amazing star cast - mainly two powerful, riveting stars in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Pitting these two seasoned performers against each other was a stroke of a casting genius- it feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities. The director has very well recreated a period of show business history- an era during which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The script written by director Christopher Nolan based on a novel by Christopher Priest is itself a juggling act, bouncing back and forth in time, teasing us with a whole extra layer of suspense.

This fact will put you to the edge until the denouement.What I really liked about the film is that it was presented as such a normal, ordinary plot, just like any other movie in a periodic setting. Furthermore, the director presented the theme-envy, obsession, and deceit, in the coolest way to present these things--SUBTLE! The cast was too good. This film exposes one of the BEST ""RIVALRY"" stories of the decade. I'd have to give it a thousand claps and a HANDS DOWN!There were a few who hated the movie. Yes, it tells nothing about benevolence. Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self-preservation. And yes, the director may have over-sensationalized the theme for some (But I think he presented it as subtle as he could). he thing here is that the decisions made by the director works for the advantage of the film. Why would I feel bad if there is not one character who conveyed a positive disposition? The nature of the characters reflects human nature--and as long as a character does that--it is REAL. We should not be looking for a benign protagonist here--besides, that's getting OLD. Films that project NON-CONTRAST between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights. They are laying off the archetypes, the formulaic sense that's been going' on in the film industry for the past 10 years, which should be the case now in the 21st century film-making. AT LEAST THIS MOVIE TRIED, and as far as I know, SUCEEDED.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Are you watching closely?,"Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The filmmaker shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The director makes his ordinary film do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.So it is with Christopher Nolan's latest mind-bending masterpiece. It plays with you deliberately, as a magician's audience, makes you believe something, brings you into something which appears ordinary; believe me it isn't. The Master of Non-linear Film-making - Christopher Nolan.Hands down Oscar nomination. If I had to guarantee one nomination for this film -- Best Director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Only perfectly crafted,"""The Prestige"" is an excellent movie from the technical standpoint (except for his score, but I will refer to this later): Bale and Jackman in particular gave a great performance and Nolan is really good as usual. The film is interesting mostly because of the intricated structure of his plot, where the Nolan brothers have fun in crossing the flow of time over and in changing constantly who to root for.
But unfortunately I have to say that it has, in my opinion, poor emotional weight. ""The Prestige"" is listed as a thriller but I didn't feel the suspense, except for two scenes. And also his ambiguous nature about the protagonist doesn't help, because the real protagonist is the fight that I didn't find that exciting. But for this issue the worst thing is the score. It isn't bad at all, but it isn't nothing. I hardly remember a point in a film where it played and I am almost convinced that the movie was scoreless. For someone it may not be an issue but I think a score is useful when it enters your brain and enriches the scene, not when it is hardly listened.
""The Prestige"" is a very well crafted movie that hasn't the emotional weight that could bring it from a good movie to an excellent one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Worth watching closely,"This movie is not for everybody; it is an exquisite mix of flashbacks and developments, more complex than Memento, but some viewers will find it confusing, complicated, or will see plot holes over the first half of the movie. The jumps in the time line are not an obstacle to character development, but help them as back stories; I got acquainted to the characters in The Prestige and actually cared about their struggles, their successes, and the deaths. Acting was very good overall, the environment was good and I felt in the 19th century. This is a recommended movie for intelligent people, ready to accept the twists and the moments of confusion in the midst of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Best Movie of 2006 and One of the Best in the whole film industry,"Sorry for the review, but I am not English so there are some mistakes I am sure. :) What I wrote in the summery is true in my opinion. It's sure that this is one of my favorite movie. I think that was the biggest fail of the year that the actors and the director got nothing in the Academy Awards. And I can't imagine which movie was better than this in 2006? Because 2006 was one of the worst year in the film industry in my opinion. I remember just for a few good movie. I recommend the movie for everybody who like to think and not just watching the explosions (which I like, but this movie is about something else). It wasn't long for me, I think this is the kind of movie what I would call ""a perfect one"". I don't think that everybody could write a better ""Prestige"" then this. The sound effects and the music created a very good and formidable atmosphere. Oh and my favorite character was Tesla like in science.

Extraordinary!!!,"According to the dictionary, the prestige means: ""reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes"". The prestige is what Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan have for making such a good movie.The plot is extraordinary. Just like any magic act, the story also has three parts. In the 'Pledge', we are introduced to the two magicians, competing against each other for the better act. On one hand there is Angier, who loves his wife and believes it is showmanship that makes an act great. On the other hand we have Borden who believes you need to make sacrifices and live your act, not just perform it, to make it great. In the 'Turn', Bordon accidentally kills Angier's wife and Angier wants revenge. The competition between the two starts getting dirty, each one trying to sabotage the other's act. Then Bordon comes up with 'the transported man'. Angier is unable to replicate this act and becomes desperate to find Bordon's secret. Both men in their constant effort to best each other end up destroying their family and their lives. The 'Prestige' is truly the Coup de grace of the movie where the secrets and sacrifices of the two magicians are revealed and everything beautifully but shockingly falls into place.The movie is a tale of obsession, love, sacrifice, misdirection, revenge and 'getting your hands dirty'. Maybe I haven't seen a lot of movies but The Prestige gave me what I had never seen before. Do watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Cinema Homage,"In London at the turn of the XIXth century to the XXth, two young magicians compete to unmask their respective tricks - first moved by revenge, since one attributes to the other the death of his woman, and after by the simple spirit of rivalry, which nothing is capable of pacifying. The trick of the movie: both protagonists have careers as superheroes. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Christian Bale as Batman. What interests most the English director Christopher Nolan (of Amnesia and Batman Begins), however, is the difference of what you see and what you think you have seen - which is, in a certain way, a homage to cinema itself. Besides the great directing, it still has great performances by both Michael Caine and David Bowie.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I figured out the ending of this movie before the movie ended. Well, I figured out most of it; there are a few twists and turns that you pretty much can't predict. The beauty of this movie is that, even when you've figured it out (and you might, if you try, but where's the fun in that?), watching two dudes be completely obsessed with a competition--and with revenge--remains compelling.Other complaints--that the characters are cold--gets at the very nature of obsession.

That wasn't logical and impossible. I found the way the whole movie was put together very well, however it should have stuck to one main theme.

When i see the film second time, i realize that there are really too many clues that prepare spectators to the end of the film.The start and the end of the film is well, but there are some boring scenes in the middle of the film.The sound of Tesla's invention is a bit disturbing.

Obsession and Magic.,"I've got to say firstly, Chris Nolan has wow-ed me ever since I saw Memento, all those years ago. He is an exceptional auteur, and wields the conventions of time, space, and suspense like a master... and The Prestige is indeed his masterpiece. Everything from the direction, to the ambiance, to the nuanced performances just sucks you into this world. It is perhaps no coincidence that this film plays like a magic trick. As Nolan manipulates the viewer through his 'pledge', and 'turn'. The artful misdirection within these first two acts, makes the impact of his 'Prestige' even greater.The Prestige is a passionate lamentation on obsession, the likes of which I have not experienced since reading Moby Dick. Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) is the 'Ahab' of the piece, and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) is his 'White Whale'... or at least his secret is. Another polished performance comes from Michael Caine, as the ingénue Cutter, who is the 'Ishmael' of this story... And what a story it is.My reasoning behind why this film manages to be so impactful, is because it takes the time to layer every character. No cardboard cut-out, comic book heroes here... Despite having Batman, and Wolverine as the two leads(LOL). This film makes you invest in the characters, and those that go for the journey will be rewarded with something that makes you feel... Which in today's cinema(that has too readily become a 'Snakes On A Plane/Gen Y wasteland'), is truly something special.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I swear, this movie deserves even a higher rate. It's marvelously good.

Abracadabra!,"Christopher Nolan has directed wonderful movies like ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"". ""The Prestige"" continues Nolan's glorious path of becoming one of the top new film-makers in the world.In ""The Prestige"" two friends Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) become rivals after tragic accident. First the game seems to be harmless but then rivalry becomes deathly. Both of them are trying to come up the most brilliant magic trick to become the most powerful magician. A beautiful assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) creates even more turmoil between former friends.""The Prestige"" is a flashback movie. The editor Lee Smith has established to cut the film so that it is not hard to catch every turn. Nolan has written an adapted screenplay with his brother Jonathan which is based on a novel by Christopher Priest.The cast is very best A-group. Especially Christian Bale is very convincing performing Alfred. Michael Caine is a man in the right place playing Robert Angier's associate Cutter.

Throughout the entire thing, I was thrilled and absolutely absorbed in the story.It has a very interesting plot line and explores how far people are willing to go to achieve their ultimate goal.

How the mighty fall,"Sure, it's clever, but not clever enough. ""The Prestige"" falls behind high expectations raised by the filmmakers' track record, by stunning trailers and a magnificent poster that would grace any museum wall. Unfortunately, the key plot device is predictable from half-way through at the latest. But then, Wally Pfister's masterful cinematography is compelling all by itself. Also, perhaps one shouldn't complain when a movie gives you David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. The script sure strikes the chord of truth when it calls him ""not a magician, but a real wizard"". In my book, that's as accurate a description of Tesla as it is of Bowie. From what I've seen of the Nolan brothers' work, I wish they stuck to their own screenplays like they did in ""Memento"". Having said that, I still can't wait for ""The Dark Knight"". If anyone can teach that old bat some new tricks, it's Christopher Nolan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Modern Magicians,"I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that ""The Illusionist"" is a romantic caper film and ""The Prestige"" is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the ""magic lantern show"", which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A weak spot in the setup,"We are mystified about which kind of knot Borden ties before the accident, and I find it strange, however dramatically efficient, that Nolan doesn't use the question until the burial. I think that in real life that would be the first thing one would check to see what went wrong with a trivial trick - especially because it has been an issue between them. But certainly a highly entertaining movie, with great acting, beautiful pictures, and a catching storyline. Like ""The Departed"" it is a movie one can watch over and over again and still enjoy for it's many twists and cleverly situated clues. The mind-blowing experiment with electricity which is accredited to Dr Telsa, is symbolically destroyed by Edison.

the REAL prestige,"The Prestige, a movie that will bend your mind. The prestige, a movie that will bend your back as you desperately try to see the hidden clues that you may have missed earlier on. here's my opinion on the movie. lets start with Huge Jackman. the name says it all. Jackman being Australian slang for bender of minds and back and basically thats what he does in this movie. he is great and really presents a perfect layered performance. you never really understand what he's saying but you get the feeling that he knows what he's doing. it always helps to have the ability to act through understanding and huge has got this. Scarllett Johansun, a great actor, was brilliant in mean girls and certainly has the ability to act and bend minds, but let's just say that the word fugal come to mind when talking about her performance. she knows it and it shows. George Lucas once said that if an actor doesn't want to be in a movie and doesn't believe the magic that they are presenting then it will show on film. George was right. Scarllett doesn't believe in magic and its clear. she never says anything supportive of Huge Jackman or Christin Bale because she obviously doesn't believe in magic. she needs to let herself go more and be free and stop holding onto prejudices of black people and magicians. everyone else in the movie was fine, great even. watch out for the star cameo role (you'll know it when you see it). let's just say that the butler from the nanny named Fran would approve. Anyway, ce'lar vee, a great movie but don't see it coz u probably wont get it at all. PS Huge definitely has a notable bulge in his pants in the opening scene. i think it could help for any Oscar nods. i would give it 8 but that bulge is worth at least a 10 by itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind- boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century.

One in a Million.,"There are occasions, when you know, you have seen something amazing. Something you don't see quite often. In movies, Prestige is definitely that something.I left the cinema with the feeling that I have seen an amazing movie, comparison to which I can hardly find. There were some good movies that came out recently, but Prestige is truly one in a million.Prestige belongs to the mystic genre of movies. It's mystic not only because there's a mysticism, but also because of the indirect narrator's style. It belongs with movies such as : Sixth Sense, The Butterfly Effect, Donny Darko, The I inside, Angel Heart, The jacket etc ... . Can't say it's the best in the category, but I definitely enjoyed it more than anything I listed.The ending twist point was already done before ( Snapdragon, Les Rivières pourpres ). But as Michael Caine's character stated : You have got to know how to sell the trick. The outstanding way this twist point was sold to us, the viewers, makes the whole movie original.The interesting plot and the perfect performance make this movie enjoyable, and unforgettable.

Good but not good enough,"The production is wonderful and the acting very good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do great work here, and Michael Caine is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson is good, too, but she is underused in this male-dominant film. There is a lot of twists and turns, but the problem is, they also give away a lot of clues, right from the beginning shots, so if you have paid attention (and who wouldn't, once you enter the theater knowing you're about to see a mystery/thriller about magic), halfway through you would know how the story is going to end and what is happening. That's the problem with the film. With every great magic trick, you can't tell how it's done even if you look very closely. It's not the case with this film -- it's predictable once you figure it out, and it's not difficult.It's not to say it's not enjoyable. The crosscutting, non-linear time lines can be confusing at first, but the director is smart enough to leave you visual clues so once you find your marks, the technique is interesting, keeping the twists close to the vest for the audiences. But once again, they leave you enough clues that if you have paid attention, you will figure it out. David Bowie is fun to watch, though -- I didn't even recognize it was him (although I recognize Mr. Gollum). Another problem is that the film focuses on the rivalry and the oneupmanship, and it feels cold. Compared to the Illusionist, which I think is a superb romantic mystery, the story and ending of The Prestige are less than emotionally rewarding. It's like a nice magic trick -- it will leave you giddy, full of wonder and imagination, but ultimately empty emotionally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An entertaining semi sci-fi psychological thriller l!,"The film was directed by Christopher Nolan and all of his films never disappoint, his films always keeps the viewers thinking a lot and guessing the whole time, and his films are the kind of films that makes people want to go back and rewatch it because there is just so much complexity in the story and interesting themes/symbolism in it (and I like how he really tries to make the symbolism to be a little more obvious so it's easier for most to understand and not too complicated).The film explores the field of magic/illusionist acts during the last decade of the 1800's. It is very interesting to explore this topic and it gets you more interested in magic performances during this time period and what people did for entertainment at the time. The story has a lot to do with revenge and one-upmanship between one guy who was a skilled illusionist, and the other who was a skilled showman and presenter. They both started their careers working on stage for a magic show manager who puts together the magic performances. One day during a live stage performance, it went terribly wrong and one of the guy's wife dies in the act (she also worked with them as a performer) which caused him to seek revenge on the other guy because he thought that guy was responsible... but upon seeking revenge, he gets very obsessed and goes great lengths to do it. But who will outsmart the other? You'll have to see the film.Another great classic semi sci-fi thriller by Christopher Nolan (I said semi sci-fi because you'll later find out why when you watch the whole film). His films always keeps me thinking, even days after I finished watching the film. I makes me want to go back and rewatch the film so that I could better piece together the story and symbolisms/themes behind it. And it also has stellar actors that you'll probably recognize, during the period when they weren't super famous yet. After you finish watching the film, you'll want to go and read up more about the film to better understand it fully, and that's why I love Christopher Nolan's films.

Read the novel instead,"I finished reading the darkly elegant novel ""The Prestige"" by Christopher Priest about a week before renting the DVD. Perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment, but the movie is an absolute dog; it pales in comparison to the novel. I have to wonder what Christoper Priest thinks of this film.Call me a purist, but I would love to see the novel made into a movie that respects the story's original plot structure. Too much that is worthwhile in the novel, such as the addition of Borden's and Angier's descendants to frame the story, has been deleted. Too much that is ridiculous has been added to the film. The story has been butchered beyond belief. I realize that Nolan is known for playing with the chronology of events, but his piecemeal approach destroys any possibility of real dramatic tension building towards any sort of climax.One of the strengths of the novel was that the story was told largely in the form of diaries the two magicians had written. This offered us some back story to give context to the conflict between Angier and Borden, and also allowed us to get inside their heads. The characterizations in the movie, are for the most part, extremely one-dimensional and superficial - completely without subtlety. The acting is mostly a snore, with flat performances from most of the actors, an exception being Rebecca Hall, who showed some emotional depth and engaged the viewer. At least the special effects were snazzy. But far more electricity was generated by Tesla's machine than existed between any of the characters, which is really too bad.

A Magical Dual of Wits,"Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is a spellbinding tale of rivalry and obsession, set against the backdrop of Victorian-era magic. The film's narrative structure is ingeniously layered, resembling the very magic tricks it depicts. It unfolds in a non-linear fashion, which not only captivates the audience but also mirrors the complexity of the characters' own obsessions.At its core, 'The Prestige' is a study of the human psyche under the strains of fierce competition and unyielding ambition. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale deliver compelling performances as rival magicians, each consumed by the need to outdo the other. Their portrayal of Robert Angier and Alfred Borden respectively brings a palpable intensity to the screen, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.The thematic depth of the film is profound, exploring the costs of relentless pursuit of greatness. It delves into themes of sacrifice, secrecy, and the fine line between dedication and obsession. These themes are masterfully woven into the narrative, making the film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining.Technically, 'The Prestige' is a masterpiece. Nolan's direction is meticulous, ensuring each scene is fraught with tension and mystery. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is both beautiful and haunting, perfectly capturing the era's allure and the darker undertones of the story. The score, composed by David Julyan, further enhances the film's atmospheric tension.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters' journeys. The climax is as surprising as it is satisfying, leaving viewers to ponder the film's underlying message long after it ends.In conclusion, 'The Prestige' is a brilliant piece of cinema that masterfully blends narrative, performance, and thematic depth. It's a film that not only entertains but also invites the audience to question the very nature of ambition and the price one is willing to pay for greatness. Christopher Nolan has created a timeless classic that continues to fascinate and intrigue, much like the magic tricks it portrays.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Best. Movie. Ever. Made.,"I hate period movies. Not my thing.... BUT...This is my favourite movie, I've seen it twice on the day when I first saw it. In the last 16 years I have seen it again countless times and it never gets broing, even knowing all the twists. There is always something else you can spot. This is imo Nolans BEST movie and unfortunately also the most underrated.It is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 and ones you have seen it and as well read the script, you will understand why.A modern Masterpiece, something every upcomming director OR writer shuld assess in detail and learn from.

Are You Watching Closely vs Obsession,"THE PRESTIGE begins like a usual revenge story going to be end up on one's win over another.But as the story progressed the movie kept surprising the viewers.Like a magic trick,
Everything was normal until the dissappeared object reappeared from nowhere.It seemed like a ordinary movie till the extraordinary Climax Twist exploded.Take a Close Watch to get cleared on progression.The movie took a flight like revenge as the take off to obsession to destroy the career of the opposition to a Sky diving experience Climax portion.It contains animosity in human caused by obsessions and protecting one's prestige to any extent.I'm sure, the only part which reduced the love for the film for some viewers was Sci Fi element. But it was a much needed element for the incoming wonder.And moreover it showed the non-popular battle between two wizards Edison and Tesla.Every NOLAN film contains any human emotion as a base of the script.Here it is obsession and prestige causing to sacrifices.The movie is filled with 3 timeliness and changes the point of view if I'm not wrong.The screenplay of THE PRESTIGE is one of the best in nolan movies if not the best.So does the captivating cinematography owes appreciation too.The best thing for me was art direction which is really under-appreciated. There was numerous props used for magic tricks and the stage setup for the shows.Atmosphere created felt like it was happening on early 20th century.I'm not gonna talk about Nolan I'm an ardent fan of him.Next the main thing performances :
Ah The Christian Bale as Alfred Bordon
I don't know how he played such a complex character without showing the complexity outside.It felt like a magician keeping his secret inside.Such a Legend I'm already a fan of him after watching American Psycho and The Mechinist.And then there is Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier
Mostly the story was going through his POV
And he does his job well.. Be it obsessed face, be it the animosity inside to destroy his only opponent.The dialogue delivery of him was neat.The movie doesn't take one's side so we won't sympathise with none makes the story better.And Michael Caine as John Cutter.It was nice to hear that he call Bale as Alfred, haha.The Prestige is the apt title for the film.It will make you think about the movie after watching. I got amazed by the sacrifice of Alfred and ______ to be the Professor.Take a Watch it won't fail you.That's it

Terrific,"Since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I will simply explain the basics. Two rival magicians compete with each other to see who is the better magician. Hugh Jackman's character becomes obsessed with one of Christian Bale's magic tricks and tries to discover Bale's method. Throughout the story, many twists and turns arise and I found the movie to get better as it went on. The acting was top-notch and the movie was executed wonderfully. However, the ending, which I will not divulge, had good aspects and bad. Still, the movie was so intriguing that it kept my interest the whole time.

"Magical, Mystical Tour - The Prestige","Such films as The Illusionist, Houdini and The King of Masks and others have all done excellent jobs with the subject of magic. The Prestige deserves to be right up there with those classics. I love magic and films about them, and I was not disappointed in this one. The King of Masks is my favorite all time magic film. This film comes close; the performances are impeccable, the direction is on the nose, and the production values are first-rate. The screenplay is erudite, and should be appreciated by the intelligent viewer. The really great magician in this film is neither of the leading actors, however. It is Tesla, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time; hounded by the heinous Thomas Edison, a person we were taught to revere in school. It is only now, in the information age, that we have found out what a despicable person Edison really was. There is no relation to reality and the Spencer Tracy film about Edison. He was a criminal. But the film is about magic, not criminal acts, or even Tesla (although we surely could use a good film about him). If you have even a passing interest or appreciation of good magic, then this film is for you. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Bowie as Tesla was a spark of genius casting,Christopher Nolan stepped back from this and allowed the story to dictate every aspect down to the lighting and editing.

The real mystery is the praise this film received,"Christopher Priest's novel novel on which the film was based is to my mind by far the least interesting of his that I have read. It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted ""The Illusionist"" is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Prestige Review,"The Prestige is a brilliant story of revenge, jealousy, and obsession between two 19th century magicians. This movie really works because of the good performances, great direction from Christopher Nolan, and a story that keeps you guessing. Alfred Boden (Christian Bale), and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), start off as two magicians aides that are quite good friends. But after a series of unforgivable events, the two becomes enemies constantly trying to one-up each others work. This is when the story becomes a gripping revenge and obsession thriller, with each magician vying to create the perfect illusion. Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career as the emotionally tormented and obsessed Angier, a man who loses everything in order to create the ultimate trick that not even Boden can top. Bale gives a good enough performance, but he does come off as a smug jerk of a character throughout the majority of the film. The good acting as well as the intense direction really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you just as perplexed and frustrated as the magicians in terms of finding out how these illusions are performed. One thing I was worried about with this movie was that after going through many twists and turns, it wouldn't all tie together in a conceivable way. Once the movie reached its climax, however, the whole thing made complete sense and came together in a very nicely. Overall, this is a great obsession story that really makes you think, and also features good acting and near perfect direction. A definite must-see, especially for Christopher Nolan fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The trickiest magic in the world is the knot in your heart.,"If the magic in the magician is called magic, then the magic in this movie can only be called acrobatics.

6/10,"The Prestige was decent film filled with and excellent cast, sadly the Storyline limits this movie. It is too prolonged for the plot, though it was an interesting and entertaining movie for the first 30 minuets it gets old and lacks serious substance aside from trivial feuds and shallow romance. I appreciated the realism of the dialog and admire the challenge it must have been to maintain the attention of viewers solely with the use of magic tricks but feel strongly that the length of the movie was too drawn out for the boring and anti climatic ending. Sadly it was predictable and lacked originality aside from setting and the occupation of the characters.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan's first misstep? Maybe.,"This film is too smart, or perhaps the word should be convoluted, for its own good. Nolan has crafted a movie about obsession and revenge under the guise of magic but the execution stalls in many areas. Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite... With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart, the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways, except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end, the film's climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that aren't all that surprising or hard to guess. The acting by the leads- Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is top notch but that should be a given.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Review on movie,"One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time. The movie was well acted, interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and the twist at the end was surprising.

Full of twists and turns,"Based on a clever, original idea for a story thats full of twists and turns making for a really entertaining movie.Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine are three brilliant leads backed up with strong supporting acting performances.The way the protagonists stories are narrated through the reading of each others diaries was a nice touch and added an extra element to the storytelling and relating to the characters.Early on, I felt there was a bit of jumping about through different periods in time and in a couple of scenes, it wasn't immediately clear where these fit into the timeline of the story, but it all fit together shortly after.Some parts were a little long and drawn out but maybe necessary for this type of storytelling with lots of twists and turns. I can often see a twist coming before it happens in a film but I wouldn't have guessed how this film concluded. Definitley worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Bit Love It or Hate It; I Love It,"Let us start with a quote from the film.""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course...it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"". "" So says the opening narration of this movie. It's one of my favorite openings in film. Though film is a visual medium, I find that a good poetic speech every now and then can make more of an impact than many sweeping shots or well-choreographed action sequences. It's not a universal opinion, to be sure. But it is definitely one that I hold. Perhaps that's due to the fact that I am a writer to the deepest, darkest, most intimate corner of my heart and soul, as you can likely tell if you've read enough of these recaps.But if you want to talk about pure movie magic, look just to the content of the speech. Of course, it is about magicians, and it forms some detailed and resonantly captivating framework for the rest of the movie. But it could be easily construed as symbolism for the effect of movies and the movie-making process. Think about it. I did. You ground the audience in reality, take to the cinematic skies, and then stick your landing. I don't know if that was intentional. But it certainly is effective. Now, take a deep breath with me. And dive.Once again, I am an Nolaniac. If you want to call me a fanboy, so be it. You're wrong. Dead wrong. Damn wrong. In fact, I hate that term when it is applied to those smart and thoughtful who do not deserve it that it makes my blood boil. But I've been called worse. I... do have a tendency of going off on rants, don't I? Oh well. Whatever.But as a Nolaniac, I can safely say that this is the most Nolan-y of his movies, for better and for worse. I can safely say that there are 3 of his movies that even people who don't like his other movies or are indifferent to them all love. Those being TDK, Inception, and Memento. This is the 'measure movie', if you will. If you love this movie, you likely love Nolan movies. If you hate this movie, you likely hate Nolan movies. And if you're indifferent to this movie, you likely are indifferent to Nolan movies.The basic plot is simple enough, particularly for a Nolan movie: two magicians try to one-up each other. But this is not just a movie about magic; it's a film about pride, folly, showmanship, desperation, and the extents to which one will go to achieve their desires, even at the cost of their own sanity. Stylishly stunning with great acting and a gripping plot, it is one of modern cinema's great marvels as well a movie that wants to be seen time and time again.It may not be as haunting upon a second watching as Memento or as thematically resonant upon a second watching as TDK or as striking and impressive upon a second watching as Inception, it is the Nolan movie that I say reveals the most upon a second watching. Mostly due to the ending twist, which was... interesting, to say the least.Like Interstellar, I movie which I like alright but is probably Nolan's weakest to date, many of the people who hate this film hate it because of that ending. They feel like after the curtain was pulled up, there is nothing to witness. I disagree with them, but I do admit that they make a few good points.While it is not as big of a problem here as it is in the scientifically-minded Interstellar, the revelation of something that could conceivably called 'real magic' does mess with the tone of the film a bit. And it is not as sharp or thrilling or thought-provoking as many other Nolan movies, which is why I put in here on this list.Of course, I can't fail to mention that this film had a golden rating from me by the time they went to visit Tesla for the first time. Though I am a film critic first, I do say that I am not a cyborg (though that would be cool) and thus am not without feelings. And while the section is gritty and dark and accurate in its depiction of the landscape of the Old West and is objectively a high point, it is the combination of Tesla (one of my favorite scientists) and Colorado Springs (where I've lived since I was born) that permanently endeared this movie to me.Which brings me to my closing statements. This is a movie thematically about perception and like most Nolan movies, it runs along the tracks of its themes. So let me say this: your opinion of The Prestige wrests mostly on perception. If you are looking to bash on this movie, you will bash on it. If you are looking to adore this movie, you will adore it. And if you are looking with an open mind for an impressive film experience, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

What a surprise ending!!  I was SO CERTAIN that it wouldn't be stupid!,"I don't care about the people in this movie, nor about any romance or struggles they were involved in.And if I say to hell with the characters--the message is the point; that's even worse. The message is neither inspiring, nor enough of an opposite of inspiring to give the stimulating, titillating gift of darkness.I really went in wanting to like it, and wanting to care about what was going on (and I really like almost all of these actors). And I'm normally not too good at guessing endings and so on... Wow. Not one single surprise that you weren't at least suspecting far in advance. Sometimes, it just boggled the mind; when something was introduced as a surprise, I was sitting there thinking, ""Um, didn't they explicitly reveal this an hour ago?""Maybe I'm just missing the point that it's really for twelve-year-old girls or something.Yes, that must be it.I really feel robbed. Sometimes after a movie, there's that afterglow that just fills you up. Sometimes, it's so sad and moving that you can think about it five days later and still work up a tear. Sometimes, it's that it's so fun to think about it, over and over the details... In this case, what I'm left with is wanting to kick someone. It's the feeling of sorta wanting to kick myself, but the 8.5-star rating that's currently the average on IMDb excuses my mistake.The movie makes you feel like a sucker, and gives you almost nothing in return.It was mildly pretty, but...

"""Are you watching closely?""","Christopher Nolan follows up the great Batman Begins with an excellent psychological, thriller, drama.Not one of Christopher Nolan's original scripts but rather based on a Novel by Christopher Priest. Though the Nolan brothers Johnathan and Christopher adapt the novel into a screenplay and they do it in spectacular fashion. I've never read the book but if the book is as good as the film then they did a great job.Nolan teams up once more with the acting talents of Christian Bale and Michael Caine and both did great just as they did in Batman Begins. Alongside the two great actors is Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. Hugh Jackman shines opposite to Christian Bale, though I feel the weakest in this film is Johansson. While she is a great actress her attempt at a British accent is not the best and the subplot with her never captured me. These are probably nitpicks in what is an overall strong film.Great cinematography, great writing, and a great score makes The Prestige one of Nolan's best films.Next up in Nolan marathon The Dark Knight -IMDb: 9/10

Great movie,"'The Prestige' is set in London in the early 20th century and revolves around the power play of two magicians. The movie lives from the fight between the main characters played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. However, it is not a natural rivalry in which they spur each other on to top performance. Nor is it primarily about being seen as a better magician by society. The focus is on the simple fact of wanting to be better than the other. And everything else in the lives of the two must submit to this situation.It's really nice to see how this game keeps coming to a head and the limits of what is acceptable are pushed further and further. You never really know at what point who has the upper hand and in which direction the whole thing will go. The movie has a lot of smaller and bigger twists that are anything but predictable and lose impact even after watching it several times.The character played by Michael Cane explains how a magic trick is constructed. It consists of three acts. In the first act, the magician shows something supposedly ordinary. In the second act, the magician manages to make the ordinary do something extraordinary. In the third act there is a twist and the spectator sees something shocking.In the end, a trick is only interesting if you don't know how it works. This is exactly the point that makes you think and doesn't let you go.This setup of a magic trick was incredibly well shifted to the level between the two main characters. Every segment of the two's fight works on this principle. The two shock each other over and over again with something that can't be expected or explained.For me, 'The Prestige' works really well. I've seen the movie several times and it hasn't lost any of its impact for me. On the contrary, when you know where the story is going, you pay attention to other details.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The big revelation is a big let down,"""The Prestige"" is a very well crafted movie. The camera work, the lighting, the set decoration, the costumes and the acting for the most part are very well done. The way it flashback and flash forward yet maintains its cohesiveness and and build suspense is a testimony to Christopher Nolan as a film director and to his editor. Despite all this the big surprise the audience is hoping for is pretty much revealed to anyone closely paying attention with about 50 minutes left in the movie.The film is about a couple of magicians who were co-apprentices when they were young, until a tragedy set off a bitter rivalry. The rivalry reach a climax as they try to out do each other with a trick called the teleported man. The quest for the answer sets the audience for a promise of big surprises yet in the end what we get is something so obvious and yet another one that is so far fetched that it stretches one's suspension of disbelief.To me the only surprise is what happened to the Hugh Jackman character in the end. It's what happened to him in the beginning that created the bitterness among the two friends. And the Christian Bale character was in no way at all likable. But I suppose it's appropriate because it's when we realize that the movie is no longer about the revenge but about the egos of the magicians/showman. They are not just trying to awe their audience but also to one up each other. They want to come up with one trick that will make their fellow magicians envious.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very good performances, Michael Caine is wonderful as always playing an older magician who guides Jackman. Scarlett Johannson did a decent job although her English accent seem to change, very early on it was as cockney as Mr. Caine's but later on it sounded more upper class. David Bowie was a bit of a surprise as real life scientist Nikola Tesla. I didn't recognize him at first.Over all I would say that as a period piece and a character study of magicians it was well done but it's main failing is the big promise and the big revelations of the teleported man, one was obvious and the other was ridiculous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The main premise (which leads to the great ""denouement"" at the end) is not only obvious, it's ridiculous. The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it. It's about a couple of guys so consumed by mutual hatred and envy that they can't seem to get a life of their own. This movie makes The Illusionist seem plausible and coherent by comparison.

An excellent Thriller,"First off, let me tell you some other movies I like in this Genre.The Usual Suspects, The Inside Man, Phone Booth - Movies where the plot is never standing still; There's always something happening, and you always want to know what's happening.As The Prestige started, I was thinking that it could be alright, but it was a lot lot more. It was AMAZING.An extremely good script, and an even better plot.A good performance by Scarlet Johanssen, A great performance by Michael Caine, a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman, and an outstanding one by Christian Bale, tied together with one of the best, most original twists ever, gives you a movie that you'll be thinking about for the rest of the day.The twist was so good in fact, that about 24 hours after watching it, I was still thinking ""Oh man, that was excellent!!!""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An excellent movie,"The Prestige was a wonderful movie. It had great actors, a great storyline (though sometimes kinda confusing), and was a great thriller. Although I knew the actors playing the characters, I was so into the movie I did not see Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale. I just saw their characters, and that means that they did a good job. I was always hooked on the storyline and was never bored throughout the whole story. I just wanted to see what would happen to the characters. My only problem was that it was kinda confusing. The good guy was the bad guy and vice versa, and the whole concept of cloning was tough to understand, but they ended it very well and in a way that I understood the whole thing. That whole day all I was thinking about was that movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
magic,"In the world of magic, both the magician and the audience on the stage are immersed in the illusion of magic and can only choose to be the deceived person of magic.

Magnificent Magicians in Period London,"I loved The Prestige. It was recommended to me by a close friend and did not disappoint. Everything for one's art is the ultimate theme. Then, what is art? The intertwining of Tesla and Edison with the fictional, but believable, characters makes this movie even more dynamic and fascinating. My favorite performance is Michael Caine.

"""Just because it's simple, does mean it was easy""","The Prestige is Chrisropher Nolans fifth film. Over the course of the story, we see the rivalry of two magicians. Played by Christ Bale and Hugh Jackman, their relationship leads to the death of one of them in the middle of a performance. The Prestige might be one of the best things to come out of Nolans lucrative career. Thematically and conceptually, it works well, but the thing that I think highlights its qualities is the fact that it does overcomplicate itself.Nolan has an undeniable eye for spectacle and that has made his style mainstream and highly profitable, yet what he has is that his spectacle is always equally matched by his ideas. Nolan's vision is as deep in philosophy as it is in scale, and it's rare to see a director so versatile in talent and on such extreme fields too. Sometimes, Nolans ambition is greater than his skills as a director. I'd highlight tenet as the prime example of Nolans hubris as a director.If I had to compare Nolan films, I would say this is just shy of my top spot, as of now. I think Memeto is just better. The concept is so challenging, yet its application leaves only positives. But compared to something like Interstellar, their visuals are superior, but I think that The Prestige marries the idea of a magic show with the themes of the film better than Interstellar could do with space and time. The pacing for The Prestige is also exceeds Oppenheimers in terms of how it wants to tell its story on top of the fact that I think Nolan loses himself a bit in the third act of Oppenheimer.In the actual film story, I felt that Nolan was doing a bit of that when he was showing the diary and Tesla as chronologically that was leaps and bounds ahead of the other story. This isn't done poorly it more so raises the question of why it is in at all as it feels like a needless complication. Aside from that one Nolanism, this works. The magic tricks are really REALLY interesting to watch set up and perform, and that all comes down to how dedicated these to are to their roles. Not once do I have any problems with these two actors or their position in their story. Both, if working together, could do great things together, yet fate simply didn't play out in their favour. They do a superb job at not letting you choose a side as they can make a character do a bad thing and let them remain sympathetic. They give you every chance to get you invested in the story, and it all works in concept and execution to expand the narrative.I also need to say that thematically this is my favourite Nolan film. Magic isn't all that different from movies, and this is magic. I honestly wouldn't have given this four and a half stars if the third act wasn't this good, but it's really good. The idea of lying to people about how something is done just to make yourself famous is brilliantly used. Fame alone is brilliantly used, but it goes a step further as fame is mearly a metric the men use to show who's the better magician.The idea of something being simple but not easy so clearly demonstrates everything I could say here as everything you can get out of the story is here. No time is wasted on anything that the story isn't about as even if it is about magic it's about pushing it to put on the best show possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Another mind-boggler by Christopher Nolan,"As Christopher Nolan also directed Inception and Memento, it is no surprise that the Prestige is a complete mind-boggler. The Prestige is a great film because it is multi-layered, intricately written and demands the full attention of the viewer. It often cross-cuts back and forth between two separate narratives, which means you need to be completely engaged in the film or you'll end up confused. I've also never seen a film about magicians and showmanship before, so the Prestige opened up my eyes to a whole new film genre. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson were all great as the leads.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/4ZM11a",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"If you've seen one magician movie, you've seen 'em all","This was a fine movie in some ways. The actors were excellent, especially Michael Caine. The action kept moving. The twists (and you know there are going to be twists in a movie about magicians) keep on coming.However, the movie has a lot of flaws: The editing among all the different chronological sequences is confusing. I think the director intended us to be unsure of (for instance) who is reading whose diary when. It's not that hard to sort out where we are given a minute or so following every jump in time and space, but after a while it's annoying to think the director requires such tactics to keep us off balance.The part played by Nicola Tesla is ridiculous. My jaw dropped toward the end of the movie after they asked us to accept such a preposterous piece of pseudo-history.Scarlet Johanssen's accent is consistent, but how come it's the accent of an upper-class Englishwoman, when she's hanging out with these low-class magicians? At least it's better than David Bowie's accent. He is supposed to be Croatian but sounds like a stoned Scotsman.The skimpy costumes worn by the magicians' assistants seemed too skimpy for Victorian times.I guess I just don't like magician movies. They're always about revealing how tricks are really done, and, as someone says early on in the film, If you reveal the secret of the trick, you instantly lose the audience's respect. To compensate for that, they have to rise to a crescendo of revelations, and it's never enough compensation for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
8.7/10,"The beginning was very slow and could be classed as 'complexed', however the more the story progresses the more immersed you become in the story.

I had no need to worry, gripping throughout and met every expectation and more.The Prestige might not be 'the most rewatchable film' due to seeing behind the magicians curtain but it definitely be one I'd recommend to a friend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
We choose to be fooled.,"In fact, the ending is already faintly visible after the middle stage. It seems foreseeable that both sides will suffer, but the question is just what their ultimate magic will be presented in, and what sacrifices will be made. The emergence of the copying machine has brought the viewing of movies to a new level, and from the overall concept and initial metaphor, the emergence of the copying machine precisely reflects sacrifice and alienation to the most extreme extent. Behind every wonderful magic, there is a blatant murder - the murderer is himself, and the murderer is also himself. What is the one left behind thinking when the bone chilling climbs up his spine? The symbol of the machine age is socialized mass production, in which products are constrained by unified standards, and creators are also shackled by unified standards. It seems that this entire society is a huge copying machine. We face the same thing every day, think the same thing, eat the same fast food, kill ourselves, and create ourselves again. What have we sacrificed in the ""magic""? I don't think this film is purely entertainment. It may be because its tragic and dark tones evoke tragic memories of the early 20th century, or perhaps today's society is just an upgraded version of the Victorian era, with fundamental contradictions far from being resolved or even recognized, or we would rather turn a blind eye. Just like the last sentence in the movie: We choose to be fooled.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Prestige is Nolan's masterpiece!,"With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece of a mind bender, in essence, he has created a cinematic magic trick (much like the novel is a literary magic trick). Everyone is in absolute perfect form and you can tell that at this point, everyone in terms of Nolan's crew, is right on the same plane. The performances are top notch, Hugh Jackman shows us range and emotion that he has not yet displayed on the screen. Wally Pfisters cinematography is absolutely radiant, capturing the light and shadows and bringing another time period alive. Nathan Crowley's production design is impeccable, he has constructed complex and detailed sets that evoke the time period and the atmosphere of this rather dark film.For me to say that this is Nolan's best film so far is certainly tough. All of Nolan's films are masterpieces in their own right, but I think that The Prestige is a knock-out. I can only hope that come Oscar time, this film and all of the individuals involved are remembered for their flawless film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

No-go,"Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
great,"Before the birth of movies, magic was probably the most magical entertainment in human society. However, the emergence of movies means that human vision has entered a more magical era. From this perspective, movies are undoubtedly another kind of magic. The prestige organically integrates the traditional entertainment of ""magic"" into the film, and allows the magic show to continuously drive the story forward. There is magic in the film, and beyond the magic is the film. The twin brother, the copy person and so on have the element of magical colour to also be mixed in among them, true true false, false true true, fell into a kind of inarticulate and inarticulate but meaningful ending finally in. Magic is deceptive, the movie is creating illusion, but in this unpredictable illusion, we can feel the infinite reality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Yeah... I'm thrilled again,It happens with every Nolan movie. The guy can't do anything wrong. Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most. They're great(did I say great like 3 times?) Special effects are good I guess. Well it's not Dark Knight nor Inception there aren't so much but those which are there are great. So yeah there you have it. Another masterpiece by Nolan.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant storytelling!,"Christopher Nolan absolutely knocks it out od the park on this subtle masterpiece of outstanding storytelling and character development. Nolan takes the audience on a century-old ride into real entertainment and excitement. Both magicians are desperately amazing and flawed at the same time, and audience is left guessing at every turn. Nolan once again challenges his audience with an outstanding story, which is perfectly delivered by a star-studded cast that does not disappoint. Bale is especially amazing as he keeps the audience in a trance of excitement and confusion. As usual, Michael Caine flies under the radar but steals the show at times.

Dark tale of magician rivalry takes many twists and turns...,"Perhaps there is such a thing as a story taking too many twists and turns, and not all of them credible. That's the major fault of THE PRESTIGE which pits two very ambitious magicians (HUGH JACKMAN and Christian BALE) against each other in a manner that hasn't been seen on the screen since Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played dirty tricks on each other in SLEUTH.But there are other compensations in THE PRESTIGE to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for the serious movie-goer. It captures the look and feel of Victorian England with its beautifully detailed sets, artfully low-key in lighting but teaming with vitality and authentic looking period decor.Then too, the performances are all at a perfect pitch to make it an ensemble cast of acting pros doing their best to keep you guessing until the final shot. MICHAEL CAINE is wonderful in a colorful supporting role as the man who devises some of the ingenious stunts and SCARLETT JOHANSSON makes the most of a rather brief supporting role as a traitorous magician's assistant. And as the scientist who leaves Jackman with one of his most inspired tricks, David BOWIE is excellent as Tesla.But the last fifteen minutes are shrouded in such mystery and some highly doubtful explanations that the conclusion comes as a bit of a letdown after all the build-up to what the viewer can only hope will be a plausible ending.Christopher Nolan does much better with this than he did with MEMENTO, even though the tricky story structure is again likely to add confusion to all the entertaining twists and turns that occur on a regular basis.But overall, it's a very entertaining and puzzling piece of work with sleight of hand magic at every turn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Untrue to the novel and really bad taste,"Typical Hollywood movie and a complete ruin to the novel true meaning. In few words, what a bunch of emptiness which give you a really bad taste to the people who has read the novel. Yes, good entertainment for all the wrong reasons. I don't know how the original writer let this movie to be out maybe his dark side took over him when the screenplay was shown to him. Ending different to Novel, showing that Hollywood doesn't care about moral values anymore like having more blood in your hands is better. Plus many discrepancies along the movie related to the original novel. I never expected to be similar to the novel because it is just a movie but at least I was expecting to keep similar contest related to the novel. I wouldn't advice watching this movie with your children or family because it will send the wrong signal and set of moral values to the young ones. The novel was more meaningful because it take you to the whole stage of friendship, rivalries, competition, vengeance, repentance, and spiritual awareness. The violent final just show,like this year Oscar that blood and violence pay and let's forget about teaching real values to the kids. Killing is better and vengeance evens more without any self repentance. If we keep rating so well this novel adaptation there won't be novel adaptation but completely new stories claiming to be from from books just to sell better. I wonder if the Lord of the Ring adaptation to the big screen would have been made like this movie, I would not go anymore to cinema to watch new novel adaptations knowing that they just would be a big disappointment.

Underrated and Underseen,"Along with INSOMNIA, the 2006 film that Nolan directed, THE PRESTIGE is probably one of his least known and least viewed films and that is too bad for it is a wonderful motion picture that proves he is a strong director with a strong vision.Dubbed ""The Warring Magicians"" film, THE PRESTIGE stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as two 19th Century Magicians who are...well...at war with each other. Of course, they started out as partners, but soon became enemies, each trying to out do each other and to discover the other magician's secrets.Cleverly written by Nolan and his frequent collaborator, his brother Jonathan Nolan - and based on the novel by Christopher Priest, THE PRESTIGE will keep you guessing throughout, trying to figure out ""how they did it"" and are constantly being surprised by double turns, back stabbing and second guessing.Bale, by this time in his career, has established himself as a powerful actor - and he shines here. Joining Bale is Nolan regular Michael Caine as the mentor of the two magicians, a young-ish Scarlett Johannsen as a a woman who falls in love with both of them (of course) and Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo as Bale's and Jackman's wives, respectively. But...the surprise to me in this film when I first saw it - and again when I recently re-viewed it - is the performance of Hugh Jackman. This film shows that Jackman is more than just Wolverine - that dude can act. As a magician, he is showing glimpses of being ""THE GREATEST SHOWMAN"" (but that is another movie for another day) and more than holds his own against a fierce Bale. Finally...special notice needs to be made to the actor who portrays inventor Nikola Tesla - perfectly cast in this role is Ziggy Stardust himself, David Bowie. It's a shame that Bowie did not act in more films for he captures the screen in the brief appearances he makes in this film.As for Nolan - he is now coming into his own as a Director.

Sinister sleight of hand,"Cinema and stage magicians share a common secret about us, the viewers: we don't want to believe the reality - we enjoy the sensation of being transported to a world where we can gasp at the magic. ""The secret impresses no-one: the trick you use it for is everything."" Exploiting this parallel in a darkly sinister period piece, The Prestige weaves a tense and gripping tale of a fatal feud between two rival magicians.In the skilfully recreated Victorian London, Director Christopher Nolan performs another sinister and chilling sleight of hand that forces us to look closely at every frame, just as we did in his backwards-moving masterpiece Memento (about a desperate man trying to avenge his wife's murder while suffering from the loss of all short-term memory). The two magicians (played by Bale and Jackman) are poised somewhere between being scientists and conmen and risk all for the secret of the greatest stage trick - and the two women in their lives weave in and out trying to discover the inner secrets of these men with whom they are involved. Seeing the story from several angles, the viewer shifts perspectives to work out what is real.Almost like another conjuring trick, David Bowie, and to an extent all the actors except Michael Caine, are subsumed in their characters and barely recognisable at first glance. Caine, as the magician's ingeneur (the person who designs illusions behind the scenes) is a lynchpin, giving a powerful and convincing performance he can believe in. Scarlett Johansson, as the inexperienced but devoted magician's assistant, creeps up on us subtly and, thrown between the two main characters, is another one who might not be all she seems.Cutter, (Michael Caine) explains the format: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secretyou won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" Gone is the image of the jolly magician. This is no Paul Daniels era of hocus pocus. If it goes wrong, things might get nasty. If it goes right, you are left with that gasp of amazement on your face that every magician craves and every filmmaker seeks. Perhaps the feeling is more important than deciding whether you actually want to find out or be fooled. Whodunnit or thriller, The Prestige is a rather clever piece of entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sabotage and dirty hands play an important role in their work but with every failed act, their work but also characters greatly improve.It's a very interesting movie which doesn't amaze you with its magic, but, on the contrary, with its plot, characters and especially, it's finale. It's very complex, extremely well thought and executed, its deep atmosphere drawing you slowly into its world.It's a very good movie for magic lovers like myself, but also for people in search of mind boggling plots. A must see for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Brilliant, Under-rated film","I think this film is a vastly under-rated feature and is one of Nolan's best in terms of the narrative and plot. The film is great in that it keeps you thinking throughout with it's woven non-linear structure and the cast that are in the film seem perfect for their respective characters, the film charts the personal and professionally rivalry between two magicians in the Victorian age with each ruining each others performances in a different number of ways before building up to it's twist of a climax, Michael Caine plays his role well as the fatherly figure for Algier (Hugh Jackman)whilst the leading cast play it well as two men obsessed with topping the other as things take a turn for the worst the more the film plays out, for me Bale's character Borden is the better of the two but Jackman still puts in a great performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Just Plain Stupid.,"the era was ridiculous, the magic acts unbelievable, more like just plain Computer Graphics. The entire concept of this film is just pure loony. ""magic""? come on ! Only the stupid would regard any of this stuff entertaining. Dialogue was even dumber. Camera angles BORING . Yeah, tree's disappearing into thin air. Hahaha. so stupid. I was laughing so much in the Theatre. This IMDb is totally inaccurate. or the demographic is certainly skewed. The only redeeming element of this film was David Bowie's Character Nikola Tesla. If anyone can perform acts of extraordinary ability it'd be Nikola, he was a genius ignored by Americans cause of his Jewish/Hungarian heritage. Not to mention how Thomas Edison started a propaganda Campaign to discredit Nikola's inventions. Nikola developed a device that would allow the conversion of energy in such an efficient way that he wanted it to be Free. A free energy/electricity for everybody. Thomas Edison didn't want people to benefit from Free energy. and blah blah blah,.. okay the movie was just plain stupid, did I write enough here yet ?",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Overrated,"Hmm.. Honestly, didn't enjoy it all.Love the actors and Nolan is my favorite director. But it was like watching a 50 Hour movie. I'll discuss every part i didn't like in this review.I understand this is Nolan and narrative/timeline he uses is something he loves to do. But honestly it's unnecessary confusing!The frequent jumping between points in different timeline made it frustrating for me and difficult to follow the progression of events. I feel it was unnecessary for THIS movie to do that! For instance, in memento that was the whole point of the movie so it's fine..
But for the prestige it made it more complex and would have loved a normal flow to the narrative.Honestly, wasn't impressed by the plot twist.Wasn't shocking.. His ""silent"" brother who was there the whole movie, of course he had something to do with the twist. You should have seen it coming.Also, I feel like the War and revenge between them is weak. So one guy (even though mistakenly) kills someone's wife.. so he steals his Magic trick for revenge???? What a lame way to get revenge and satisfaction.. only to die at the end?Also, The characters shown in the movie are portrayed as great Magicians yet the tricks shown are simple and lame. First the tricks were Authentic/Normal/traditional.... then suddenly Tesla creates a crazy machine which turns to science fiction? Hmmm.. I don't knowI loved the atmosphere of the movie... yet the previous points I mentioned are the reason i didn't enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Every great magic trick consists of three acts,"The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. In this particular case, the audience is shown nothing less than Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale displaying their magical acting and accompanied by a magic deck with cards so valuable as Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie.The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. The magician goes by the name of Christopher Nolan, and his something extraordinary is the filming of this movie, which captivates from the very beginning: the settings, the pace, the staging, everything is managed in a way the audience will but get hooked.Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. True. But if what you never saw before comes to be some ""Deus ex machina"" sleight of hand, part of the audience shall feel cheated; and all the previous work, though highly remarkable, will end up being part of a trick that lacks ""the prestige"".",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Best Film of the Year,"Earlier tonight I went to the cinema with a few friends to see The Prestige. I had seen Casino Royale the day before and felt that was the best film I had seen this year by a long way. However this all changed when I saw The Prestige. Not only boasting a great cast that included Jackman, Bale, Johansson, Caine but also a fantastic director and an exceptional screenplay composed by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Without giving too much away all I can say about the story is I think it contains some of the best story telling I have ever seen on the big screen. The acting in the film is also of a great quality with probably Jackman's best performance and Christian Bale continuing from where he left of with Batman Begins.Simply this is the best film I have seen all year and one of the best I have ever seen.

Magic behind the magic,"A great film!, 7 well earned stars for this movie; this is a little below the user's ranking, but in my personal standards is very high. I recommend deeply this movie; the way that you get involved with the tricks and the engineering behind some great magic shows makes you almost feel like a magician too; all the scenarios and cinematography is captivating, and the story keeps you at every single moment deeply involved with the film. Please watch the film and feel the magic behind the magic, the acting roles are performed excellent, the intensity of Angier and Borden is tense and captivating, and the involvement of Cutter with the tricks is great too, a magical film behind the magical tricks of the 19th century entertaining industry.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Seen a dozen times but the same pleasure every time,"A movie that keep you in it from the start to the end. The first thing I thought of at the end of the movie was to ask myself when I was going to be able to watch it again. A good intrigue that keeps on going in which you really try to understand what is going on. A good acting game that makes it all fabulous.

Greatest movie of the year!,"This is probably the best movie I have seen all year. The plot was so secretive and suspenseful that it kept me guessing the whole time i was watching it. The ending was some what of a mystery, and i still am not quite sure of what exactly took place, but the directors and writers of this movie definitely deserve an award.The movie has two hidden morals, one that deals with the brutality of rivalry and one that deals with obsession. Obsession can sometimes lead to one's ultimate downfall. This theory is proved correct by the plot of this movie.Towards the beginning of the movie, I believed that Angier was the protagonist and that Borden was the 'bad guy', but assumptions aren't always what they seem.Other than it's complexities, I also thought that the movie helped the viewer gain some knowledge of the 'tricks behind the trick' having to do with magic. I'm not saying that what they portrayed as the secrets to some old magic tricks are real, but they kept me wondering ""what if..""If you are not easily confused and can keep up with a fast-paced mystery, then go watch this movie as soon as you can!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Definitely A Thinker!,"It has taken me a couple of days to mull over this film in order to write its review.In general I do believe that it's a good film and a good story, but it perhaps has too many twists, so that you don't know what to believe in the end? It all moves a bit too fast as well, I would have liked a few more pauses and maybe a slightly longer set up at the start.The actors all do their parts very well. Love him or hate him, Christian Bale is ideal for these roles.

Brilliant film-making and it keeps me pumped and ready for the next Nolan picture, The Dark Knight, which is a sequel to the also awesome Christopher Nolan movie, Batman Begins.

Interesting but confusing,"The film is great. I mean it has interesting plot, some action etc. BUT look at the actors. OK, they are not ""the same"" people, but with fake beards, hats and stupid cloth it is nearly impossible to understand who is on the screen now. Plus the plot is not chronological, so at the end of the movie you simply do not understand the reasons of what is going on. Who wants revenge, who does not, what does the other guy want!? This is the reason nowadays if there are 2 main characters in the movie one of the is white and the over is black. Because you do not get confused who is who!!!

Poor sound quality,"Watched this via DVD...and the sound was poor, sometimes low and hard to hear, then normal..near the end the music seemed to be drowning out the conversations... I thought Michael Caine was good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale do a credible job, but not stellar. David Bowie in a small role is good. The sets are incredible, and the snow scene with the lights is a wow...it would be nice to see such a light show in real-life during the Christmas Holidays. Still the movie is slow at times, and yet, still isn't too bad--not great, but acceptable. This isn't a great movie (far from it, OK, way from from it), and at 130 minutes does seem long. I thought the story was good, the dialogue passable---when it could be heard. I don't know if others have noticed this, but it did distract from the movie. Quality of sound should be standard, but in this one, I felt it really go to be annoying at times, as I had to constantly adjust the volume up, down, up,down.Movie plot wasn't bad and acting was decent..just poor sound production.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Creative, intelligent, well-written and top-notch acting","The movie follows two competing magicians through their careers, as they each try to upstage the other and as their rivalry escalates. In the fighting, they both loose things dear to them, and each loss is more brutal, right to the very end.The movie was very well written, well directed and the acting was top-notch. Christian Bale plays a magician who is extremely talented when it comes to magic, but not so much when it comes to showmanship. His rival, played by Hugh Jackman, easily surpasses him in that area and catches the eye of the crowd far better. Bale, upset at being the better magician but not seen as such grows bitter and wants what Jackman has.At the same time, Jackman envies what he sees in Bale - his talent, and his tricks and he becomes obsessed with trying to figure them out, namely his most impressive trick, the Transported Man. Jackman comes up with his own version of it, aided with a machine built by Mr. Tesla himself (played by David Bowie of all people, and with surprising accuracy).However, the trick isn't quite what it seems. Really, really, really not what it seems.As a matter of fact, neither is Bale's trick what it seems. Nor is his family life.It all builds up right to the end, with very well placed twists, and the last one the most shocking of all.It's good. Go see it.

"Fascinating film with plenty of suspense, humour, mystery and a little of science fiction throw in this intriguing story.","Near the end of the 19th century in London. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson), his wife Julia (Piper Perabo) and their friend Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to a magician (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Caine). When Julia accidentally dies during an performance. Robert blames on his friend Alfred and they become enemies. Both of them have become famous for different reasons and they are always trying to out smart each other on their new tricks. Alfred becomes much more successful with his tricks and always doing much better than Robert. Robert becomes obsessed on trying to find out how Alfred's secret tricks. Both risk everything to be the greatest magician, while there's full of lies and sabotage between the two. But nothing what it seems between these new magicians, while one of them might have to face tragic consequences.Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Insomnia ""2002"", Memento) made an entertaining, suspenseful, mystery film with plenty of humour with unsuspecting plot twists. Nolan brings many intriguing visual style with drama as well. Jackman, Bale and Caine are excellent in this picture. Which it is somewhat underrated, when it was released last year in theaters. This movie has an fine supporting cast like Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and Roger Rees.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an featurette and an photo gallery. This DVD could have used more features like an audio commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted scenes, outtakes and an full length documentary. But it will be probably for an future DVD release. This film received two Oscar nominations like Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. This ingenious picture will play well on DVD and this have an major cult following as well. Nolan is certainly one of the most gifted filmmakers of the 21th century and plenty of good films from his to come in the near future. Don't miss it.

Well put together -- but not your happy place!,"Utterly gripping turn of the century English theater tale. Excellent period feel, costumes, sets, engaging interplay between all the characters, pacing, cinematography, all first rate. The audience is mesmerized by the magic acts, the romantic entanglements, but at the same time, is left utterly cold by the complete lack of warmth and humanity. This is not a movie for someone looking for a uplifting, positive two hours. This movie is devoid of any warmth. There are no heroes, no good guys, no role models.Scientist/inventor Nikola Tesla, whose work all movie goers have seen, even though they may not know it, figures prominently in this movie. Among other things, he invented the Tesla Coil, which is frequently featured in science fiction movies. The coil generates impressive electric displays, like controlled lightning, arcing between electrodes. The main plot of this movie revolves around the use of this electric ""magic"". The movie is not, however, a scientific documentary, and the leaps of logic from Tesla's scientific experimentation, to magic tricks shown in the movie, requires accepting highly implausible events requiring much suspended disbelief, but that fact doesn't detract too much from the movie's allure. The magic is well enough performed to be engaging and plausible. You want to believe it. It works.The movie doesn't entirely satisfy however. The main thing that does diminish the movie's appeal is the unlikable nature of all the principle characters. You just can't ""like"" them, any of them.The movie well worth seeing however. Just don't go when you're in a bad mood already. This movie will only make it worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Obsession and the prestige,"The MagicI have found that many of my friends seem incapable of enjoying magic tricks. They have an overwhelming desire to guess how the trick is performed  if they succeed, the trick is essentially ruined as no element of mystery remains. If they should however fail, they feel frustrated and cheated. It seems that the only way to truly enjoy magicians is if you let them fool you. In the last fifteen years a genre of films closely following the pattern of the best magic tricks has begun to emerge  films that incorporate a shocking ""twist"" ending which often change the nature of everything that had gone on before. Arguably the best (and one of the first) was the excellent ""Usual Suspects"". The film's twist was largely unexpected (not just the nature of the surprise ending but also the fact that it even exists) and as consequence was an immense popular and critical success. After that, many films have taken up the strategy, with varying degrees of success. The trap that many of them fall into is that the twist ending overshadows everything else in the film. If the audiences know that a twist ending is coming they might overlook the film itself in trying to guess the ending. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" suffered from the disease. Despite being possibly the most intelligent dissection of superheroes ever committed to film, a disproportional amount of attention and criticism were directed against the relatively weak surprise in the end, largely due to unreasonable expectation of following up or even outdoing ""The Sixth Sense"".At least in one part of the reviews and responses, a similar response is shaping up for ""The Prestige"". This is deeply unjust. The film's point above all else is the characterisation of two obsessive characters: Angier and Borden, and that is accomplished brilliantly. And the ending might not that be that bad either.The RivalsAs others have stated the film revolves around the conflict of two magicians of the XIX century, which starts after the death of Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife for which Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is partially responsible. From then on, the two engage in an escalating and destructive game, which largely revolves around the ""Transported Man""- a trick they both perform. This cat and mouse game leads to some extraordinarily tense scenes that Christopher Nolan directs to perfection. Because the film relies heavily on trickery and misdirection, we are never clear where the events will take us. Furthermore, since there are no clearly defined heroes and villains, the expectations of each character's fate are further confounded.The cast is phenomenal. First and foremost, Christian Bale gives an acting masterclass. His Alfred Borden is a deeply obsessed, cold and conflicted personality etched with remarkable clarity by Bale, especially considering the relatively constricting screenplay. His character is not inherently sympathetic but Bale is able to infuse it with enough charisma that he threatens to completely take over the viewers' sympathies. His scenes with Rebecca Hall (who plays Borden's wife) are especially effective  Bale is equally believable as a loving husband and a man too obsessed with his magic to care for his wife.Hugh Jackman does almost equally as well (although he can't quite match Bale's powerhouse performance). He has a more interesting role and a better-developed character arc. Angier starts off as a relatively positive figure, a light-hearted showman and a more obvious protagonist than the brooding Borden. The main plot of the film shows his growing obsession with Borden and his more increasing disregard for anything or anyone else. By the time the film pulls into the final third, his character has undergone a deep transformation into a much more sinister and unpleasant figure  an almost out and out villain. Jackman more or less pulls it off and only seems out of his depth in a few scenes opposite Michael Caine where he, and anyone else, are reduced to scenery as Caine gives a deeply human and above all effortless performance.The most curious of all however, is David Bowie. How he chooses to portray Nikola Tesla is inspired, fiercely original and unexpected. His Tesla functions perfectly in the context of the plot  Bowie giving him just the right tone so that the Tesla of the film can be reconciled with the Tesla of reality. In addition, Bowie's performance is sufficiently layered to leave an open door for a more satisfying interpretation of the ""surprise"" ending.The TwistThe film, by the time it ends, gives an explanation of how both versions of ""The Transported man"" are performed. Borden's version is the film's central mystery and some viewers may feel cheated because the solution is relatively easy to guess (personally I was completely fooled up until the very end  and as consequence was tremendously entertained).Angier's version is also clearly explained  and represents the films biggest weakness. The explanation offered is a major disappointment and it mars the tone of the film significantly. However, at second glance, there is another interpretation that the film seems curiously unwilling to completely deny. Apart from a single shot, which gives credence to the ""official"" explanation, the film chooses to be ambiguous. Every other scene that takes us behind the scenes of Angier's trick is either deliberately unclear or depicted in flashback. Considering how obsessive the Nolan brothers are about tying up loose ends, it is difficult to believe that the ""alternative"" explanation is accidental. As the film itself puts it: ""Once you explain the trick, you are nothing."" Is it possible they deliberately left it unexplained? After all, that's what a prestige is for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"a basic tale of one-up-manship, but done in a great fashion of professional storytelling and acting","The Prestige is like a machine of tricks and wonders, and it ends up pulling off a lot more than it might have not been able to chew. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians, who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter, who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic', which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo), the rivalry and, more crucially, the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden, who is, according to Jackman's Angier, living his entire life as a trick, which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier, who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film), who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye, with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen, in a spiffy English accent that works), on the sidelines.What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters, who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician, while the other is a better showman, and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film, and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall, one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality, and how one can cheat death or not, or again, and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed, or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling, with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us, and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain, or rather, a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen, yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary, and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises. It's one of the best productions to come out this season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Disappointing,"Not having read the book but, always being interested in magic, I really looked forward to seeing this film. The first bit was well done. How two magicians started and then became rivals. After that it became interesting when one of them, Bordon (Christian Bale) developed an illusion that his antagonist Angier (Hugh Jackman) could not replicate or surpass, teleportation. In fact Angier is insanely frustrated at not being able to work out how it is done. Then, the whole thing just crumbles into a nonsensical, far-fetched mess of pseudo-science and gruesomeness which destroyed my interest completely. Strangely, the final reveal, where the audience is able to work out how Bordon performed his illusion, is very satisfying in it's simplicity (often the secret of a great trick). But, I'm sure that the writers could have come up with a better storyline and still arrived at the same conclusion. So much promise, so little fulfillment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

a strong piece of cinematic legerdemain,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation - a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are the two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage. Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel. The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core. More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making. The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along. Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Prestige is Superb,"""The Prestige"" is a superb drama. It represents the struggle between two masterful magicians in London. Hugh Jackman gives a superior performance as the tall handsome Robert Angier. And Christian Bale plays Alfed Borden, the counterpoint in this exciting and slickly done cinema. Scarlett Johansson is the younger attractive blonde wife, Olivia Wenscombe, who assists in unraveling the competitive nature of the constant battle. One is particularly impressed with the cinematography and muted color that only enhances the enjoyment. The young daughter, Sarah Borden, gives an adequate child performance as the fulcrum of Christian Bale's plight. And last but not least is Michael Caine's portrayal of Cutter, the magic show manager who weaves this tale in a suspenseful fashion to the delight of the entire audience.

Don't miss this intelligent entertaining film!,"Christopher Nolan may be the best young director in Hollywood. ""The Prestige"" is not nearly as challenging as ""Memento"" but is more intelligent than the average fare. You don't need a PHD to get it. Nolan has now made enough films that we can begin psychoanalyzing him. He seems to be attracted to stories that include obsession, revenge and deceit (self and otherwise.) All of these elements are crucial to the plots of ""The Prestige"", ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins."" The ending is a bit ambiguous but this is the world of magic where nothing is apparent. It's hard to take sides in this film. There is ruthless conflict between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's characters but neither is completely the hero nor the villain.

Wonderfully intricate story makes this one a winner,"Once you get all the twists and turns of the plot sorted out in your head (and doing so will undoubtedly require multiple viewings) only then will you really be able to appreciate just how brilliantly conceived the story in The Prestige is. Going back to their earlier film, Memento, writer/director Christopher Nolan, along with his co-writer and brother Jonathan, have shown a unique talent for creating mind-bending, thought-provoking films which leave you wanting to see them again and again to unravel all the story's mysteries. The Prestige may not quite be up to the level of Memento but it certainly stands in its own right as another superior effort by the brothers Nolan.Probably the less said about the plot here the better. Better to allow you to unravel the story yourself. The basics...the story follows two magicians performing in Europe circa 1900. Initially friends they will soon become bitter rivals in a tale of true obsession. As presented in the film, the story jumps around in time which is a key piece of what in the end is a masterfully constructed puzzle. Because of the skewed time line, at times we know more than the characters and at other times we know less. It makes it all the more enjoyable when all the various story lines and time lines converge and finally we, and the film's characters, finally know the whole story.As one might imagine just by looking at the cast list The Prestige is filled with tremendous performances. As the two key magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do a wonderful job of bringing their respective characters to life. Bale is perfect as the quiet, dark and brooding Alfred Borden while Jackman is similarly spot-on as the more showy and ultimately obsessive Robert Angier. Michael Caine is reliably brilliant in his supporting role as magician's assistant Cutter, inventor of illusions. Scarlett Johansson plays a stage assistant and while her role requires her to do little more than look pretty she is certainly up to that task and makes the most of what opportunities the script provides her. Everyone else in the wide and varied cast falls into their roles well, including David Bowie whose appearance as a brilliant scientist screams out ""stunt casting!"" but who performs his part wonderfully and fits right in with the rest of this terrific ensemble. A truly great cast really brings this story to life.While the story is beautifully crafted the one minor quibble one may have is that this story doesn't have quite as much heart as say, The Illusionist, that other circa 1900 European magicians movie to come out in 2006. The Prestige no doubt has a better story, much more involved and complex. But while you can appreciate the story in The Prestige you may find it much more easy to embrace the story in The Illusionist. It's a subtle difference. Both films are tremendously well done and definitely well worth your while. If you're looking for a terrific story, one that will make you think, one that is ultimately surprising and thrilling, you will find few films which fit that bill better than The Prestige.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Tedious. Convoluted.,"The movie was slow moving. Unduly complex, as the the competing magicians tried to outdo each other and learn the other's secrets. The audio was terrible as I had a hard time figuring out their mumbling diction. The movie was too long. It could have been finished in under 100 minutes.The acting was good and the movie was well cast. Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson do a good job but Scarlett's fate was left unexplained and she just disappeared from the screen. The score was just mediocre and the direction could be a little crisper. Movies set in England in the 19th century have a dark hue which I suppose is required to depict the truth but it leaves me depressed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Kayzer Soze syndrome (SPOILER ALERT),"All I want to tell you about The Prestige is that it definitely suffers from the Kayzer Soze syndrome. For those who do not know who Kayzer Soze is -- go watch The Usual Suspects. Since the release of that film there have been quite a lot of Hollywood releases that have tried to copy the formula from Usual Suspects. The problem is, however, 1) the formula is sucked dry by now, and 2) in order to amuse the audience, they need to feel respected and not be messed with. It's not the amount of plot twists that matters, it's the quality. The Usual Suspects had a single plot twist and it was a brilliant one. The Prestige has a whole bunch of twists, none of which are credible or intelligent. And, one must not forget (SPOILER ALERT), the only one dumb enough to use the twin brother concept as a cover-up for plot holes, is Jean-Claude van Damme. Oh, and I must admit, apart from the plot, the acting, cinematography and directing itself is pretty good. Especially Jackman has shown to be more than a mere Muscles from Brussels or whatever town he's from.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
All expectations met,"When I discovered that many of the people involved in the making of this movie, both in front and behind the camera, were also involved in the making of one of my other favorites, ""Batman Begins,"" my expectations for this movie went immediately up, and I must say that I was not disappointed. The writing was excellent, the lines delivered perfectly, and the plot was so original, with so many twists, that it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. The casting couldn't have been better.I think it was a bit confusing at first, as there are so many switches between flashbacks and present day that it sometimes becomes hard to keep up, but it's essentially all sorted out by the time you've really gotten into it. All the same, I cannot wait to see it a second time, when I'll undoubtedly get even more out of the plot than the first time through. Some people also claimed that they had the whole plot figured out from the very beginning, and I guess I feel rather sorry for them, though I myself was kept guessing throughout the whole thing. On the other hand, I believe that there will be many who do not like ""The Prestige"" because it actually requires you to think. (*gasp*) This movie has the same, dark flavor as ""Batman Begins,"" though with slightly less action, and is one of my new favorite movies. I anxiously await watching it a second time, and reading the book.On a final note, do not listen to those who say that this movie was terrible because of the numerous ""plot holes."" Anyone who completely understands each aspect of the plot will see plainly that such holes do not exist, and that those who say otherwise are under a false impression, confused, or just missed something. If you can follow along, there is nothing seriously wrong with this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Show stolen by David Bowie...,"Christopher Nolan films and I have something of a varied history together. While I found Memento insulting, poorly-written, badly-researched, and generally wearing its total lack of knowledge regarding a key plot device on its sleeve, other Nolan films like Batman Begins have sort of redeemed him. In essence, this makes him a bit like the drunk uncle who occasionally has something of import or interest to say. In any case, The Prestige, an intriguing concept that escaped my notice during its theatrical run, is one of the more interesting pieces to come out of the major studios during 2006. Naturally, the title makes no sense to anyone who is unfamiliar with the profession of the central characters, but a masterfully-delivered monologue by Michael Caine explains it all in a manner that leaves one unable to help thinking that it all works beautifully. If nothing else, Nolan knows how to get the best from his actors, and in storytelling of any variety, that tends to be half of the proverbial battle. Especially in a film like this where the performances are central to the story.The Prestige, named after the final stage of every magic act, concerns itself with a sibling-like rivalry between two stage magicians as portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The one point where the film lets them down is that their characters are so identical in nature that one is not really sure until the final act, and not even then in a way, which one is meant to be the hero. Perhaps this was intentional, although it does come off as a goofy accident. Nonetheless, for most of the film's length, we see the two attempt to one-up each other as they vie for the attention of a fickle London audience, performing sleights of hand and other such illusions in a time when stage performance was very much an industry like modern television. The clear difference between the two characters that drives much of the story is that one is a better magician while the other is a considerably better stage performer. Jackman and Bale sell their characters so well that the lack of distinction between actor and character becomes irrelevant.So when I say that David Bowie performs the greatest trick of all during the film's running length by stealing the show, it is important to understand my full meaning. Bale and Jackman are performers at the top of their game, making films that cause the audience to rally behind them even when they are competing with more experienced or even better actors. This is a feat only a small percentage of today's acting pool are really capable of. Jackman in particular has accomplished the virtually impossible by making himself even more memorable than Sir Ian McKellen. So when Bowie walks into frame amidst a shower of lighting as Nikola Tesla, the classical misdirection here is that he is the most captivating and earnest performer. Recreating Tesla's seemingly insane experiments with AC electricity must have kept the special effects team up for weeks. But Bowie performs around them just as the real Tesla would sell them, by acting as if they were the most natural thing in the world. And Bowie even demonstrates they probably were to the real Tesla.Hence, when Bowie is not in the frame, the film tends to lose an otherworldly spark that he exudes as naturally as sweat. Not that this is a detriment to the film in any sense. During many sequences, Jackman and Bale make it clear that to their characters, this is just another day at work. All the awe and wonder we feel when we witness a great magic trick or an awesome performance act, even one as ridiculous as that of the Tokyo Shock Boys, simply does not translate from the seats to the stage. The Prestige makes that so abundantly clear that we are left with little wonder that performing clowns can be such maladjusted or sombre characters when the show is over. In an age where not even the ability to capture audio-visual displays as a string of ones and zeros amazes us anymore, The Prestige gives us a rude reminder of just how jaded we have become. It has been a long time since the DVD-Video format has held me in the same wide-eyed wonder as when I first experienced it, but boy did Bowie's introductory shot come close.At its heart, The Prestige is a story of obsession, a fact that is referenced in the dialogue so many times it might get monotonous to some viewers. Both Bale and Jackman seem consumed with the desire to show each other up that it makes the things they are willing to sacrifice in the process seem quite creepy. And the amazing thing is that it mostly works. With both characters appearing ready to sell out their own mothers to steal glory for a fleeting moment, it gives a whole new historical context to the invention of the American HDTV standard in order to snuff out the Japanese equivalent, and so forth. Whether the film industry would be in the comparative dire straits it is in today if all films worked so hard to create an illusory feel is probably irrelevant. What matters is that The Prestige destroys the argument that modern film does not make the effort to transport the audience. It shows the viewer something that they have not seen in quite this form before, and that is something of an achievement in an industry where it became all about the bottom line years ago.I gave The Prestige an eight out of ten. Parts such as the first half-hour lost me, but the image of Bowie walking through lightning will be burned onto my brain forever. See it just for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
really good movie,"one of the few movies I've seen in the past few years that completely captivates the audience. people aren't reaching for their cellphones of kissing their date but instead are holding their breath waiting for the next word. i had almost forgotten what a truly good movie can do to a room of people. from the first line of the movie you will be memorized by the mystery of it all. the cast is flawless along with directing. the plot is cunningly so constructed in such a way that is gives great satisfaction to the viewer. if gives enough hints for the sharpest of eye and will spin you in a one-eighty once you think you have figured it out. the minute you think that this is just another easier suspense movie, think again and make sure ""you're watching closely.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan delivers more than just smoke and mirrors,"It's now official in my book; Christopher Nolan is the Hitchcock of the twenty-first century. His films are often dark, psychological and mysterious and always intelligent and carefully planned out; he's a real pro of both direction and misdirection. From his early film, Following, to last summer's blockbuster hit, Batman Begins, his films also usually require some intelligence and maybe even a second viewing to put all the jig-saw piece together. His latest thriller, entitled The Prestige, is a combination of the gloomy cinematography of Batman Begins and the swift and often disorienting editing of Following. Yes, it's a thinker, and yes I'm sure some will easily confuse this film with The Illusionist, but these two films couldn't be anymore different. Where as The Illusionist was a romantic-mystery set in Vienna, The Prestige is a dark mystery-thriller set in Victorian era London. This is a darker, meaner and a much more emotionally colder film about two men's obsession with fame and greatness, and to what lengths they will desperately go to get it.The Prestige is about two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Bowden, played marvelously by the charismatic Hugh Jackman and the slick and crafty Christian Bale. Angier is a magician with a real talent for wooing the audience with his razzle-dazzle tricks, and Bowden is the more talented of the two, but doesn't quite know how to engage the audience with his show stopping talents. They were once partners working with a magic stage producer named Cutter (played by the great Michael Caine), but when Angier's wife is accidentally killed in a magic trick gone wrong a strong rival and bitter hatred is born. Angier holds Alfred personally responsible for the accident, and then sets out to get his revenge by up-staging his competition with more dazzling tricks or simply just steal the ones he's already using, but just adding a little more pizazz to win over the crowds and ultimately get all the glory.The rival gets more and more heated when Alfred pulls off an incredible trick that Angier just can't seem to figure out how to duplicate. To the best of his knowledge he tries to replicate the trick, but as he struggles to unravel the mystery behind it meets an obsessed scientist named Nikola Telsa (played very well by David Bowie, that's right David Bowie, how awesome was that!), who's experimenting with electricity. Remember this is the late nineteenth century, and to some that probably was a form of magic back then. As this rivalry gets more and more intense lives are shattered (along with limbs) and friendships are betrayed. The film bounces back and forth from the present time and the past (with the use of 0f flashbacks), which helps to keep the mystery masked until it's ready to be unveiled at the end. But unlike The Illusionist, this isn't a film that's solely a one-trick pony. The Prestige is twisting and turning from beginning to end, and never stops. Some things you might see coming, others you might not, but regardless, Nolan delivers the drama and the suspense to pull you into the film and carry you through it. I won't talk anymore about the film or its secrets; it's far too much fun to discover them for yourself and then talk to others who have seen it afterwards. I noticed a number of people in the theater stayed in their seats until the end credits discussing the film's ending and it's many surprises.The reason I'm not giving this film a perfect ten is because sometimes it can get a bit too confusing, but I'm sure it'll make it even more fun to go back and watch it over and over again just like Memento. Also, emotionally it was a little tough to get into fully. The characters aren't quite fully black nor white; they're a shade of gray that's constantly drifting from the light to the dark. Jackman is especially impressive because of his charismatic charm (remember how likable Wolverine was? Yeah, me too.) and to see him slip into evil is actually kind of spooky. And what can I say about Christian Bale other than the fact that he's an amazing actor. If anyone is to be the ""hero"" of this tale I'd probably put my money on him. With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has given me one more reason why he's one of my favorite film directors working today, and so far his track record is flawless and his films are consistently intriguing and refreshingly original. This film is one of the smartest brain teasers of the year and I am certain The Prestige will make my top ten favorite movies of the year list. Now I can't wait for Nolan and his team to get to work on the sequel to Batman Begins; The Dark Knight. I'm sure that once again I'll be left stunned and thrilled.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Ending is worse than horrible,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINE SPOILERS Slowly paced thriller, that comes apart at the seams because of very lazy writing.The filmmakers decided that the concept of being able to fool people a hundred years ago was not enough. They needed to create tricks that were so advanced and that relied on a science that is not even close to existing TODAY.The entire resolution of the movie relies on turning the main characters into super magicians. They can now do things that are quite simply just magic. This is thrown into a movie that is supposed to be about two guys obsessing on how good the other guy might be in their chosen profession.It is a lazy resolution to a high concept idea.It is quite possibly the worst ending to a top flight production in the last twenty years. Why do this? Why create a machine that cannot possibly exist? Why not have something clever or smart be the reason for how these guys can perform the seemingly impossible, but instead resort to abra kadabra thats just the way it is? There is no way to get over this gigantic plot point, that leaves anyone with half a brain watching this movie feel like they have been completely cheated.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nolan Raises the Bar,"Christopher Nolan is incredible at creating suspense. This movie is all about secrets; secrets between friends, secrets between enemies, and secrets from the audience. As Nolan seems to like to do in his movies, he does a great job of keeping the audience out of the loop and always a step behind. When good directors make a few good movies, it's easy to slip along the way. Each new movie they make is another chance for them to fail, and people start to anticipate these failures because they hold each new film to a higher standard than the previous one. He hasn't disappointed me yet.The acting is well done. I don't think anyone would expect a poor performance from Michael Cane, Christain Slater, or Scarlett Johanson, and they definitely didn't achieve anything less than expected. Hugh Jackman proves to be a talented actor in an artistic film, not just a high budget Hollywood production.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This movie is a boon to magicians everywhere! I highly recommend it!!!,"I went to this movie with high hopes and high expectations. Being a magician myself I was a little wary that the director would not show the true life of a magician. I was not let down. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were wonderful as magicians. Even the eccentric David Bowie was amazing as the scientist Tuslo. At the beginning of the movie we find that Christian Bale is being put on trial for the murder of his fellow magician Hugh Jackman. It then goes back in time and shows you the real reasons that Hugh Jackman and Christian were fighting. When Hugh's wife dies during an act I was very proud of the director. This event was like that of Harry Houdini who died after performing such a trick. If you love murder, a good story, and a good old fashioned rivalry I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Smartest Films Recently,"The Prestige is a film founded upon wit and intellectual conflicts. The Nolans don't want to challenge the audience as much as they just want the audience to know how brilliant they are. And they are! The Prestige is spectacularly brilliant and full of terrific surprises and excellent twists. For any moviegoer who gets a great kick out of a battle of wits, a game of revenge, and an all-around sneaky plot full of schemes and cons and tricks, The Prestige is the movie of the year for you.The cast is very convincing, especially the two leads and Caine, who after half a century in movies will never become too weather-beaten to pack a punch, enjoying the tricks they play on us as much as Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are. The Nolans, though they love to show off a bit, in this case by tacking one too many surprises, they are not yet on the road to self- indulgence like many of today's most impressive auteurs like Shyamalan for instance. They will no doubt be knocked by a few critics by Christopher's use of elaborate, multi-layered nonlinear plot structure, telling two flashbacks at the same time while driving the story with the present day. Following, Memento, and even Batman Begins have flaunted the nonlinear technique to the point where, like Tarantino, they will be accused of using it as a gimmick. However, this technique comes in very handy in building the tension in the story. The film is somehow able to surprise the audience after its already shown us the outcome of something.Once again, it spills a little overboard with its twists and turns once it's satisfied the audience with a dazzlingly brilliant climax, but overall, the film is brilliant and weaves one of the finest suspense threads in awhile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Worth the Wait,"Like the reviewer before me, I've been ready and waiting for this film from the moment I heard about it. The stars, all favorites of mine. The director, amazing. And the cherry on top--Bowie. Unlike my fellow reviewer, I was astounded and satisfied. Performances were top-notch all around, direction was masterful, and the script! Can we talk about the intricate, subtle, mind-bending way the story was constructed? Yes, it is a little on the challenging side, and that's what makes it great. Anything less would have been boring and predictable. But the writing here kept me guessing and led me in directions I sometimes wasn't prepared for. Like Memento, that other masterstroke from the brothers Nolan, the story lines intertwine in time, which always keeps the viewer wondering how the characters got to where (you think) you know they're going.And then there was Bowie. He's been woefully absent from the big screen for too long, and this role was built for him. Seriously one of the best entrance scenes ever, and one only Bowie could pull off. Bale, as always, blows me away with his ability to fully inhabit his character. Jackman impresses again, though I don't know that I am surprised, since he has proved his talent time and again. Caine is an institution unto himself. Rebecca Hall rises beautifully to the task bringing the tortured wife(?) to life. And Johansson--amazing. She is learning more with every role and I can only look forward to a long and interesting career.Run, don't walk to this one. And don't blink while you're there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An entertaining thriller but I've seen better films from Nolan,"This is a good movie as a whole but I feel that Nolan overdid it on the plot twists this time. In my opinion, Memento and Inception are much better films.2 rival stage magicians attempt to outdo one another by performing their magic show and trying to cause as much damage as possible to the other one's career after a tragic accident.The films score is just okay. It fits great with the movie but I didn't find it as listenable on its own. Its combination of notes and chords isn't anything new that we haven't seen before. I feel that its music is just sound effects which are choreographed well with the film.Nolan is known for his elaborate, non-linear movie plots. Here, he relied on plot twist after plot twist before the final major plot twist at the end. Although this made for some good scenes, I feel that he overdid it way too much. After 1 plot twist happens, it confuses you for a bit. But before you're able to catch your breath, the movie hits you with another plot twist and it makes you more frustrated. The movie does it several times during the movie. I was eventually able to understand its plot but I didn't have as much fun trying to figure it out as I did with Nolan's other movies. Also, you have to suspend a lot of disbelief at the ending. I felt like it was done just for the sake of it in this case.However, despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty good movie. It has great acting from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, great cinematography and lighting, and most of the film up to the end is thoroughly entertaining. It's really only the ending which truly upset me. So in conclusion, this is a nice film and all but I've personally seen better movies from Nolan.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I thought it was excellent.,"I thought it was excellent. You know those movies, where the previews are amazing, and then the movie sucks? This wasn't one of them. I wasn't disappointed in any aspect. For some reason I always compare movies to their trailers, because the trailers always make the movie look so amazing, and mysterious, and suspense filled, and usually the previews are better than the movies. This movie was...well..I'll just say I wasn't disappointed AT ALL, like I usually am when I go to the movies.It was very intense, especially when things were revealed near the end. So much so that some people in the theatre could barely stay in their seats. I've never seen people so wrapped up in a movie until last night.The story was great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were all great, and I didn't find any of the acting to be wooden. The cinematography was wonderful, the camera work was wonderful. I was slightly confused at some points, (the movie also takes place in several layers of time) and there are a lot of questions that aren't answered until the end of the movie, unless you're a good problem solver. Most of the people I was with were able to solve some things.I'm taking a film course this year, and our teacher is making us write a review for ""Lone Star."" Well...I didn't like that movie to begin with, but now I wish more than ever that we could have chosen our own films, because I would definitely have more positive and insightful things to say about ""The Prestige.""

Another Gem from Nolan!,"I really loved this movie and can not even really think of anything else to compare it to.

I think I'm still recovering...The acting is excellent, Bale is solidifying himself as one of the best actors out there, Jackman's great, and I like the fact that Scarlett Johanssen's role in the film clearly was not expanded just because she signed on, her presence only adds to the film without trying to be bigger than the story.I would highly recommend this movie and have to say that this movie, along with a few other recent releases (Science of Sleep, Departed, etc) is an encouraging sign of where the movie industry is headed...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Are You Watching Closely?,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.The Prestige is another one of Christopher Nolan's non-linear films that gets better after every time you watch it. It's one of the reasons his films make incredible amounts of money. They require you to go back to the theater and re-watch the film any number of times. I love everything about The Prestige. It has two of my favorite film characters of all time in Alfred Borden and Robert Angier. Both are incredibly deep characters that seek power and legacy. They are rival magicians who get caught up in besting the other and tend to lose people closest to them along the way.It's non-linear structure works to it's benefit by showing flashbacks and flash forwards of them reading each other's diary which has the many tricks each of them have used. As we find out more about each character, we find out that it's become a lot more personal between the two than we previously thought. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give terrific performances that have become a bit understated. But the men aren't the only ones who give great performances, as Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall give incredibly powerful performances as well. Hall hadn't been in any big movie to this point so her ability to hold her own up against Bale and Jackman is unprecedented. Scarlett is as sexy as ever but also surprisingly effective as an assistant to both of them at various points in the film. It's another film that you don't really want to know a lot going in without being spoiled. All I can say is, you will be shocked enough to press play again once the credits roll.Nolan's work here (in only a few month shoot & production) is impeccable. He is quite simply one of the greatest storytellers we have today and has an incredible knack for interweaving multiple story lines and a complicated script into something extraordinary. He's also the best at ending a story. Every one of the endings to his films have been perfect and stayed true to his respected characters.

one of the best of 2006,"Christopher Nolen further proves that he's definitely a writer/director to look out for with this excellent tale of feuding magicians. Without naming any actors specifically, they're all uniformly great in this film. I was captivated from beginning to end and that in itself is pretty impressive and no mean feat. The fact that none of the actors were even nominated for this years Oscars is a mild travesty as it's definitely one of the best acted films I'd seen in 2006. And yes the ending can be seen coming a whiles away if one's paying even the mildest of attention, but that doesn't really detract from the experience one iota.

Watch Closely!,"The Prestige brings the magic to the screen. It's not in the tricks that make you scratch your head but rather the plot and twists. Christopher Nolan has directed yet again another movie worth the price of admission. Many say that it is too long, but (like every perfectionist) Nolan takes about half an hour just to set up. Nolan places his signature on the film as it starts out ahead of the story and goes back. Few could pull off this film due to the confusion of the story's twists and how to reveal them coherently to the viewer while giving off an exciting energy. The costumes were great and really made it feel Victorian. The one downside that critics had were that the characters were flat, but I think that it was quite realistic when all the twists are set out and you look into each character and their reactions. Overall a movie that felt genuinely well made and fulfilled its potential.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
You are so lucky if you haven't seen this movie,"People who haven't seen this movie yet are very lucky that they will get amazed when they watch this. I can easily say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The scenario is amazing. This is not a movie that you can watch over and over but in your life you must not die before watching it. On the other hand, before watching that movie I had so little information about Nicola Tesla. Before I only know that he is the father of magnetism and 1 Tesla = 10.000 Gauss from Physics :) . But in this movie we can see competition between Tesla and Edison , the working version of Tesla's prototypes. And the hard life of Tesla. I am sure most of the people googled Tesla after watching this movie. And the books about Tesla sold many copies after that movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Nolan's sleight of hand,"The first film of Christopher Nolan I saw was his remake of the 1997 Norwegian film ""Insomnia,"" and I found it brilliant. Since then I've been hearing a lot of recommendations of his earlier work ""Memento"" (which I have yet to find a copy of). I was also impressed by how Nolan maintained the grit while providing intellect to ""Batman Begins."" So it was but natural that along with Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" one of my most anticipated films this season is Nolan's ""The Prestige."" Based from the novel by Christopher Priest, ""The Prestige"" is a film that tells the tale of two 19th century magicians - Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) - who are in constant hostility as they try to outdo each other's performance. It is 1878 and Borden is tried by a London court for the murder of Angier during one of the latter's performances. While awaiting his execution, Borden starts reading Angier's diary.Subsequently, the film proceeds in a series of flashbacks. Borden and Angier start out as assistants for a magician whose shows include the risky predicament escape: Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is tied and placed in a tank filled with water and while hidden from the audience's view, she must free herself from the ropes, and open the trick lock. But a mistake during one performance cost her life as she failed to slip her wrists out of the ropes and eventually drowned.With Angier believing that Borden is responsible for his wife's death, the two went on their separate ways and become magicians as well. Eventually, Borden becomes famous with his ""The Transported Man"" act and Angier grows obsessed in finding out its secret. He sends his assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to work for Borden with the hope of gaining the knowledge behind Borden's trick but backfires as Olivia falls in love with Borden.Angier then enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), who reluctantly agrees to build a machine that is supposedly set to aid Angier in performing what could be his greatest trick. What ensues is a labyrinth of twists and sleights of hand that to go into details is far too complicated. Let it just be said that the world inhabited by the characters of ""The Prestige"" is eerily dark and suggestive of the supernatural.I had high hopes prior to seeing this film as I've said, and although it wasn't as great as I expected coming from the director, I still find it to be interesting and agreeably diverting. Nolan and his brother/co-scriptwriter Jonathan has paced the film clearly and straightforward. The plot's details are relatively concealed and restrained at least a few minutes before the denouement, wherein anyone who's been closely paying attention will know the sleight of hand to be employed by the filmmakers for the film's final trick.The cast gives good performances despite their crudely written characters. From the exaggeratedly scrawny guy in ""The Machinist"" to Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins,"" Bale completely inhabits a different character in every film he's in, and he's always believable. Jackman possesses the strength and the determined fixation to lend credibility to his character's motives. Johansson doesn't have much to do here but she provides a feminine touch.""The Prestige"" is finely crafted movie and a worthy addition to the director's resume. It suffers a bit from its tarrying on some parts and from its inclination to spell out so much justification from the characters, but these are compensated by the superior narrative style, good performances, and the opulent sets of the Victorian era. It may not be an outstanding achievement but Nolan is deft enough to make the film's illusions seem genuine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely engrossing.,"The Prestige is a rare film in its own right for the simple fact that it completely engrosses the audience into the story for nearly the entire 130 minute running time and refuses to let go until the finale is revealed. What starts out simple enough turns into a story so complex and layered, it requires multiple viewings to catch everything. First off, the acting must be convincing to keep the audience paying attention, which it pulls off tremendously. Hugh Jackman carries his role very well, Michael Caine is a pleasure to watch, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson also hold their own. The best performance, though, is that of Christian Bale, who also plays the most volatile and eccentric character. Every scene he is in he dominates and it is pretty difficult to pay attention to anything but him.As the story unfolds, we find out a rivalry has come between Jackman and Bale, and they continue to sneak into each other's shows as well as pull dirty tricks in order to learn the other's secrets and ruin him. This is the bulk of the film, and the last 20-30 minutes try and bring everything to light. Many fans have argued that this film cheats with its climax and that director/co-writer Christoper Nolan does this to duck out of anything to complicated or difficult. Those who do, however, are looking at it all wrong. Nolan gives us even more questions after the film concludes, and it takes multiple viewings to understand all the interactions and motivations of each character. Even after you may understand what actually occurred in the story, questions will still raise in your mind about the clarity and realism of these conclusions.In short, this is a near-masterpiece from one of the most talented directors this generation. Nolan is working with incredible powers of the cinema here. The entire plot is told completely out of order, yet it is never confusing or convoluted. Everything here holds up, and while questions certainly will be raised about the nature of the story, no one can doubt the undeniable storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan. It is mostly for entertainment, but it also shows what bitter hatred and obsession with revenge can do to a man. This is truly film making at its finest art form.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
