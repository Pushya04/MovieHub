Mixed Feelings...,"I'm pretty much a fan of Johnny Depp, as I usually appreciate his performance regardless of my ultimate opinion of the movie itself. Sleepy Hollow was a masterful re-envisioning of the classic story of Ichabod Crane, featuring a nice blend of mystery & horror. From Hell seemed like a natural extension of this character archetype, with a loosely-based historical inspiration, adding weight to the horrific scenarios that it depicts. With that in mind, I decided to check it out.There are many things that are done right in this movie, number one being the atmosphere. London is gray, rainy, & dark, and its desperate citizens reflect this foreboding setting well. The women whore themselves out for an extra cent, while the men retain control through intimidation & violence. Racial tensions, corrupt officials, and secret societies complicate the picture, and the actors in their elaborate costumes capture the unrest perfectly. As the film is a work of historical fiction, it takes liberties in the portrayal of certain events/facts, but only for the purpose of increasing the dramatic potential of the plot. In fact, these little deviations in historical accuracy felt very creative, and mostly fit in with the ambiguous nature of one the most infamous unsolved mysteries.The faults, while noticeable, are not disqualifying. The characters are played well, despite being mostly unremarkable to begin with. Depp's Inspector Abberline is likable, though his behavior is inconsistent. As an opium addict, he seems content to waste away his life in an altered state, yet jumps into action without hesitation, and utterly dedicates himself to risk life and limb tracking down a vicious serial killer & sifting through the lies that keep him so elusive. This also serves to make his relationship with Heather Graham, as the female lead, seem slightly artificial. The visionary, opium-induced haze that enables him to keep pace with the killer was an interesting touch, but wasn't utilized to its full potential, in my opinion. Also, the killer's character is not developed enough, and so comes across as ""cartoonishly"" scary, lacking in realism.Ultimately, this is a tense thriller that will captivate your attention, with a unique interpretation of the Jack the Ripper mythos.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Darkly stylish--not based on reality.,"The best thing about an enduring mystery is that people can feel free to take all sorts of liberties with the facts and create interesting ""what if"" scenarios.  FROM HELL is a perfect example.  For the record, the theory behind the killings is pretty much right out of JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION by Stephen Knight, and it's been pretty well discredited since it first came out twenty years ago, even though it makes a hell of an entertaining piece of fiction.I completely discount any criticisms of the movie where people say ""it didn't happen that way"".  Of course it didn't; that's why this is a fictional film and not a documentary.  It's very loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, and about all it retains of it is the Duke of Clarence theory and the stylish look of the architecture.  It's enough to make the film beautiful to watch.Yes, I know that four of the five victims of Jack the Ripper were women in their late 40's, which on the streets of Victorian London would mean that they would resemble crones in their late 60's or early 70's.  Just try to make that fly past a Hollywood studio boss; the casting at least had women who looked fairly human rather than like fallen glamour girls.  I've read a couple of comments disparaging the accents.  Actually, Cockney accents were the norm in the street because people tried to blend in and often weren't eager to advertise Scottish or Irish origins.I call special attention to the performance of Jason Flemyng in the role of Netley, the coachman, arguably the most fascinating and believable character in the whole production.  Most of his best scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, and yet he still manages to pull the movie together into a cohesive whole just by his presence.  (It must have been a heck of a fun role to play!)  As well, Sir Ian Holm deserves special mention for stepping in when the original choice for his role, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, tragically became ill and died just before the film went into production.  I have never seen Sir Ian in any role that I didn't find completely believable, and that ranges all the way from KING LEAR to his role in ALIEN, for heaven's sake.My interest in the whole Jack the Ripper case has been reawakened thanks to this movie, and I'm trying to hunt down a copy of Alan Moore's graphic novel (which is very difficult to find).  No, it's not even close to an approximation of what really happened; nobody will ever know the truth, Patricia Cornwell's arrogant claims notwithstanding.  It's still worth renting, if only for the beautifully ominous score and the fascinating transformation of Prague into Victorian London.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A stylish film, but has little to offer.","A dark and meticulous tale, based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I'm talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters, and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn't stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes.Why did I enjoy this film, I hear you ask? For a start, the direction was superb - the streets of London looked grimy, while the `unfortunates' (i.e., prostitutes) wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate. This produced a wonderful atmosphere, creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking (and very gruesome). Johnny Depp's performance (as the detective Abberline), as always, was hugely enjoyable to watch. He played his character in a very subtle way - halfway between comic and serious. He portrays a desperate man, constantly resorting to drugs so he can pass through the day. Depp and the filmmakers see him as a version of Sherlock Holmes, constantly finding clues that other police officers have overlooked (cliched, yes, but somehow Depp provides a little bit of originality). Abberline even suggests that the killer must be a learned man! How could this be?! While dismissed by all the other characters in the film (for a learned man would never commit acts of such debauchery), we as an audience know better not to trust a detective like this - their preposterous ideas are usually right. Another actor to praise in this is the wonderful Ian Holm. He plays his character with a wry little smile, seemingly enjoying every line he says. His interactions with Depp are great to watch.While the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled, you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.For those that care I gave this film 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting spin on the tale, if not particularly memorable","""From Hell"" is an interesting spin on the familiar Jack the Ripper tale, using the iconic cultural image of the cloaked man with the top hat as the source for a spin-off not of history, but of a graphic novel.The lead performance by Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline (who really existed in 1888 at the time of the murders and really was an authority on the case) is wonderful. Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately, Heather Graham -- as the prostitute Mary Kelley -- is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals, for most of ""From Hell's"" duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.That said, the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane, as one of the police officers involved in the case, has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch, and similarly as convincing as the scenery.This is a very gritty and gory film -- more so than I ever expected. It's quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals, horror elements and history thrown in for good measure, on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique, and very different, and not particularly because it was ""great."" I didn't expect a whole lot, but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could (or should) have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away, but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one's sense of history. (Like Disney's ""Pocahontas."") The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing, if only for its originality.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gloomy, down beat Victorian thriller that doesn't quite make the kill","""From Hell"" is another Jack-the-Ripper yarn. This time around Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick George Abberline, who is investigating the work of a killer carving up the bodies of prostitutes in Whitechapel, London.""From Hell"" is a borderline horror/thriller. There is a fantastical element to the story as Depp receives visions of the killings, when ""chasing the dragon"" (or, in simpler terms, when doped up to his eye-balls). These visions are used to make mad-intuitive leaps on Abberline's parts to help push along the story-line, as the bodies begin to pile up. Unfortunately the killer is quite obvious as the script provides ""red herrings"" which are set up in a manner that you know they're going to be false, so the viewer is ""surprised"" (or not) when the real killer is revealed. That's a shame as it removes some of the mystery from the movie when you realise you got it right. There's also a rather interesting take on the murderer's reasoning, which is not entirely unwelcome, but does feel somewhat as if they need to pad out the story and distinguish it from other Ripper yarns.Depp is, as usual, good. His accent appears a bit muddled however - where is he supposed to be from? But, as Hollywood standards go, it's better than average. Robbie Coltrane provides the humour (such as there is) by being Abberline's quipping side-kick, making dry observations of the situations he finds himself in. Coltrane has shown his acting skills in the TV series ""Cracker"" and he doesn't strain himself here, nor does he outshine himself. The rest of the cast are grand but Heather Graham, as the whore whom Depp falls for, is unconvincing as she looks far too pretty, and well mannered, to be a ""lady of the night"".The direction is alright. The Hughes' brothers manage to convey a generally, downbeat and sombre tone to the proceedings. The vision sequences however come across as slightly comic-booky, a reminder of movies of the 60s/70s where they went overboard on filters and camera distortions in order to depict insanity. Far more effective is the bleak visions used in the TV show ""Millennium"" - here it tends to detract from the seriousness of the moment. Some of the scenes are fairly gory - it features a quite gruesome throat slashing - while other times the violence is seen purely in the reactions of others, without having to expose the viewer to it. Both of these work well. All in all the Hughes' acquit themselves because they fail to actually show a bright, clear image until the very very end of the movie, where the image is accompanied by one of the darkest in the movie. Thus they effectively capture the mood of the city and the times.""From Hell"" suffers from having a lack of tension and a script where characters tend to take on almost caricature tones (some of the prostitutes and the Nickel's gang in particular come across as ham-fisted). Nevertheless there's a mood to the movie, and Depp's performance is convincing enough to keep you watching until the decidedly downbeat end. Recommended for fans of the Victorian thriller/horror genre and those seeking a half-decent movie. 6.4/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"Jack the Ripper is the ostensible subject of Albert and Allen Hughes' From Hell, but this legendary figure is more a point of departure, an obviously sensational hook, than the film's focus.","30 Second Bottom Line: The infamous Jack the Ripper serial killer mystery unfolds in Victorian England as a stylistic who dun it.From Hell is an exciting murder mystery with a number of hints about who dun it to keep things interesting every step of the way. Depp gives his expected, outstanding and other worldly performance. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson and some of the unnamed prostitutes give the film an edge that takes us back a century in time. Heather Graham is OK and I'm pleased to see her doing something beyond Say it Isn't So and more along the lines of Sidewalks of New York. She is, however, a little too pretty, sophisticated, charming and clean for a street ho. Katrin Cartlidge would have been a better Mary. It's a little bit of a stretch to envision the Inspector and the whore Mary falling in love, but stranger things have happened.It's always gratifying to see actors, writers and directors grow; and certainly the Hughes Brothers are doing that. They have not made a lot of films but each one is very good. The two could be a Stanley Kubrick in the making, as he only made 13 films during a long, respected and controversial career. Since 1993, they've made Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp. From Hell is more sophisticated while still retaining a dark tone that is not depressing. Peter Deming as cinematographer has outdone himself with From Hell and Mulholland Drive. It's clearly Oscar caliber work.Although From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, with the focus on a real killer in 1888, the film is not trying to be a JFK and convince us how it really happened. That said, when you realize who the killer is you are faced with an interesting hypothesis.Jack the Ripper may have been crazy, but he was acting out of logic (his own to be sure) and for a reason other than wanting to kill a few prostitutes. The fog in London finally is lifted on the murder mystery and on the Hughes Brothers being great directors.Message on the movie: We can't always have what we want from life. Evil exists. Victorian England was a very unpleasant place and era.So the conclusion is that this movie is a fair movie althouht actually it hadn't got a very clear ending, it is fantastic thriller to watch and remember don't miss this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well worth 2 hours of your time, but it could have been so much more...","An interesting, if not totally successful variation on the Jack The Ripper story, blighted by Hollywood yet again assuming that anyone in London says ""cor blimey"" a lot, and speaks in the same exaggerated ""cock-er-ney"" manner. This is a shame, as the film actually has a lot of good things going for it. Some genuinely chilling set pieces and a suitably grim visual style make for some scary moments. Sadly, particularly in the first half of the film, the Hughes Brothers (directing) seem to spend too much time trying to be visually clever when they should be putting more effort into getting on with the story. When they dispense with the visual gimmickry and the action is allowed to take off, the film is extremely gripping. On another level, the ending is particularly moving. A previous reviewer referred to the film's historical inaccuracies in depth, so I won't retread the same ground, but suffice to say that anyone familiar with the events will be distracted by these, although anyone new to the story wouldn't be affected. Performances are generally good, if not quite the principal performers' best work - in my book, the honours go to the ever reliable Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane. Overall, this film is well worth a couple of hours of your time, but it could have been so much more...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the darkest films that I have ever seen,"""From Hell"" takes place in our worst nightmares, a place so dark and scary that even walking around is enough to drive someone mad. This is a very, VERY dark film. It's so dark that it makes ""Seven"" look like ""The Wizard of Oz."" Then again, you wouldn't expect a movie based on Jack the Ripper to be light and cheery, now would you?London, 1888. A young prostitute was murdered in the Whitechapel district. The police enlist the help of Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) because of the savagery of the murder and because his opium hallucinations help him solve crimes. But more victims fall, Abberline begins to realize that these murders are connected.The film has a brilliantly dark atmosphere. You know that odd creepy feeling you get when you read about haunted mental asylums, and images of demented doctors performing horrific experiments come to mind? That's what ""From Hell"" feels like. It's an unsettling feeling, and the Hughes Brothers are skillful in their employment of this unnerving feeling.The acting is solid, although the film's best hand is the atmosphere. Johnny Depp, who according to his IMDb bio is fascinated by Jack the Ripper, plays things straight (as far as Depp can go in that direction). Heather Graham is also solid as Mary Kelly, the prostitute that Abberline develops feelings for. She speaks with a credible Cockney accent, and tones down the perkiness that she's known for to a very low level. Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane provide good support as well.The problem with the film is the story. Whether it was in the scripting stage or in production, the story is confusing at times, particularly at the end. This is one of those movies where you have to pay attention, or else you will get lost (which is quite possible, considering how strong the atmosphere is).Let me make myself clear: this is a very dark and disturbing film. Most of the violence and gore are left to the imagination (which will be on overkill due to grisly descriptions of the murders), but there is no doubt that this movie deserves as hard of an R rating as can be found. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the blood-phobic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply a fantastic movie,"The critics, nit-pickers and historical pedants who've trashed this superb piece of truly cinematic movie-making have totally missed the point.So what if Johnny Depp's English accent isn't exactly ""right"" for his character? (English accents have always been problematic for all but the most skilled of American actors: Depp pulls it off entirely passably, way way better than - say - Keanu Reeves, risible in Coppola's Dracula. Think of Kevin Costner, who didn't even bother trying in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.) I'm a Londoner by birth, and for me the accent in no way detracted from Depp's excellent performance.As for history, again, who cares if the filmmakers have employed a degree of dramatic licence? This is a movie, not a documentary. Nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was, and in order to make the film interesting and enjoyable the writers have speculated a little. Fine by me.OK, so Heather Graham was impossibly glamorous, but movies with big budgets need a little bit of star appeal. The notion of the ""tart with a heart"" is a cliché, sure, but nevertheless her character works in the context of the film. (Contrast the depiction of prostitution generally in this film with the utter garbage that is Pretty Woman.)What's so great about this film? The quirky, literate script; the performances (all, with the possible exception of Graham, excellent); the wonderful photography and production design; the depiction of the murders themselves - elliptical, shocking, mesmerising; and above all the aura of brooding menace, gloom, cruelty, darkness, melancholy and downright despair running through it as deeply as the veins through a block of marble. This is marvellously thoughtful, evocative film-making, very bold and brave. No happy Hollywood ending, no phoney saccharine or cheap laughs to satisfy the popcorn brigade. This is a proper grown-ups movie that probes some of the darkest regions of the human psyche, places mainstream filmmakers like Lucas, Spielberg, James Cameron and their ilk don't dare to go, or couldn't go even if they wanted to. To me it appeals almost on a subconscious level, forcing us to confront our deepest fears and taboos - death, pain, suffering, human wickedness. I can't think of a recent major release that is so relentlessly downbeat.Don't let the detractors put you off. It's hardly surprising a generation weened on MTV - folk with the the attention span of a gnat and the emotional depth of a paper cup - didn't like it. They've got their Screams and their Scary Movies, and they're welcome to them. This is super stuff, and the Hughes brothers and their collaborators should be heartily congratulated for it.A classic, not so much for the plot, which is a little contrived, but for its sure command of cinema as a visual storytelling medium.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
More of a curiosity than a conquest,"""From Hell"", yet another ""Jack the Ripper"" flick, is somewhat over wrought with lavish cinematography imbuing what we'd like to believe is a bleak and dank Whitechapel District of London with richness; a street whore protagonist (Graham) somehow insulting in her sweetness; and a Scotland Yard sleuth (Depp) uncharacteristically dashing considering his beginning and his end. In spite of these and many other foibles, the Hughes bros and company have breathed life into the old and moldy ""Ripper"" lore with a film which propagates still another hypothesis, a somewhat interesting and entertaining story though more of a curiosity and a conquest. Worth a look especially for those who are unfamiliar with good ol' ""Jack's"" tall tale.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Can Tell This Is An American Film,"Why is it Americans have a laughably ethnocentric view of Britain ? They seem to be under the impression that each and every person of the United Kingdom is a cockney who says "" Cor blimey Guv "" a lot and works as a chimney sweep . In fact the only people we see in American movies who aren`t cockneys are the royal family ! Even BAND OF BROTHERS suffers from this flaw and that was a BBC  co-production ! I must admit that it was nice to see the producers FROM HELL did their homework on 19th century London - By watching MARY POPPINS over and over againNot having a time machine I`ve never been to 1888 London but can`t help thinking the ethnic make of the city is all wrong with everyone talking with a cockney accent , wouldn`t London be full of Scots and Irish swapping their Scottish and Irish slums for one in London ? Just curious because everyone with the exception of Robbie Coltrane`s character is either a cockney or a former public schoolboy , and of course by casting a bunch of native Brits you can`t help notice how bad the accents coming from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are . Depp especially is abysmalAs the film continues you still notice the annoying accents but other irritants force their way into the movie . Despite having characters that existed in real life they`re written beyond all recognition , for instance Inspector Abberline had visions of the killings like some sort of psychic ? I don`t think so , oh and that bit with the diversion at Special Branch didn`t happen either and there`s no evidence he had a relationship with Mary Kelly or that any of the victims knew each other . Talking of Mary Kelly I was going to point out that , physically at least , that the real life Mary Kelly does not in any way resemble the one seen here but being an American film you`ve got to excuse some artistic license where glamour is involvedActually this glamour jars with the opening of the film which shows the London of 1888 being a human hell hole with drunkeness and drug addiction being the norm . Strangely this actually correct , in those days drugs weren`t outlawed and a great many people took all types of drugs that would now be called "" Class A drugs ""( Including Queen Victoria ) though there`s no evidence Inspector Abberline was a user , so once again it`s disappointing to see so much historical inaccuracy involved especially The Rippers motivations . I can`t disprove the theories put forward but do empires collapse like this ? In my opinion - No . Oh and talking of The Ripper it`s very very obvious who he is when he first opens his mouth about twenty minutes into the movie because you`ll be able to recognise the actor`s voice straight awaySo FROM HELL could have been a very good movie , but alas it`s not",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A psychotropic thriller,"There are many things in media that have nearly insurmountable preconceptions that lead to generic truisms. One of these is 'comic books are pure fluff,' and another is 'no good movie is ever based on a comic book'.From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window.  Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888.This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore's story into the crime tale.  Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light.  The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was.All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey.  Ian Holm, Heather Graham, and Ian Richardson also provide good supporting roles.For an historical perspective of the Jack the Ripper crimes, best to watch an A&E documentary.  But for a theoretical description of the crimes, and an artful depiction of a carefully constructed tale, definitely check out the very chilling, very calculated, and very good From Hell.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually Stunning,"From Hell is a gruesome portrait of murder in London during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of Jack the Ripper, a psychotic individual who murdered 5 prostitutes. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the inspector who tries to hunt him down and delivers one of the best performances of his career. The story is well written by the Hughes Brothers and is a truly enjoyable film for anyone who loves the horror genre. However, it is the predictability of this film and the performance of Heather Graham which provides From Hell with a downfall. The spoken dialogue between Depp and a good doctor lets you easily figure out who the murderer is. It does not supply the audience with a surprise or twist. Heather Graham's performance is purely simple and does not illustrate her capable talent. She does not deliver a well-rounded performance as Mary Kelly (also a prostitute) because she does not show essential emotion (i.e. fear) in order to fulfill her role. However, the film is an exceptional horror picture and should not be overlooked by any fan of movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poor Mary Kelly,"This movie, loosely based on the graphic novel of the same name, does not offer an accurate account of the events in Whitechapel, autumn 1888, and it doesn't pretend that it does, so folks preoccupied with the Ripper-case don't have to rush and fill the goof-section with corrections regarding the actual ongoings. It also doesn't rely much on the graphic novel, with the exception of the choice for the perpetrator and all this would imply, although different from the novel keeps it a who-dunnit till the end. The movie is a Hollywood action-horror-romance populated with historical figures who underwent even more liberty, ranging from shallow drafting over purpose-posing to audacious character-alteration. In this sense, recreating parts of Whitechapel in Prague, and this still way too clean, was with all the inaccuracy probably not necessary. But OK, it's a show, and the real background story remains captivating enough, as well as Depp's acquired accent and Coltrane's presence.Too many things strangle the effort, however, starting with the main weakness of Heather Graham being cast and outfitted as Mary Kelly. While the other victims, struggling prostitutes in the most ragged quarters of London, were all made up to more or less look that way, torn clothes, unmade hair, bad teeth and no make-up, not to mention the required acting, Graham's Mary Kelly sticks out the way Cinderella would if arriving in Whitechapel after the ball: hair perfect, careful make-up, tidy, clean, unharmed dresses, and Miss Graham is ready for the cast- party. Needless to say, we never see her getting drunk or even just attempting to go after her trade like the others. But then she's the love-interest, of course. Which is another very ill-advised idea, and we see virtually all cliché Hollywood-rules unfolding, a killer when it comes to this particular crime-case.The movie superficially shines with a cast of very able actors, Depp, Richardson, Holm, Coltrane, the late wonderful Katrin Cartlidge, to name a few, and yet, although the fantasy- and horror-genre ever so often tickles surprising performances out of well known stars, nothing breathtaking happens here, with the exception of Holm's play (although watch, he's doing the chin-thing again), too deep the tracks of expectation in character-behaviour are, and too dominant.Fusing an inspector and a self acclaimed medium, who both had been involved, to a clairvoyant inspector might have, with some tolerance, given this re-telling of the story some spice, but the idea went out in a puff in the end.The choice to stick to the graphic novel's conspiracy-take and involvement of the Freemasonry, which Moore himself, with good reason, didn't insist on being the most promising one, decides a course, of course, one that had already been taken once with 'Murder By Decree', and by taking it a lot of rather interesting theories, indicators and characters have to go out the window, but here we go.'From Hell' is pure entertainment, shallow, spotless, with a camera-work good for the eye, lines that fit together and no claim for authenticity. It kept me watching, mainly for the never ceasing fascination with the Whitechapel-murders, leaning back for the ride. It's not a very good movie, though. I'd give it a well-meaning 4, but the Graham-Kelly, so present throughout and in favour over a chance for an interesting Mary Kelly, spoils it. Hence a 3.And: will there ever be a truly engaging, good movie about the subject?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting and Moody,"Exploring the almost mythic story of Jack the Ripper, this movie gets your right down in the slums with the victims of the story. Depp's character is a bit hard to relate to because he spends a lot of time in a drug-induced haze, even though he is lucid enough while on the job. He'd be nowhere without the friendship of his sidekick played by Coltrane Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is it is hard to see Inspector Abberline's (Depp) motivation to solve the murders, at least until he develops some interest in one of the potential victims, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). Even then he seems so lightweight that he could just be blown away. An atypical hero.A very good choice for a weekend rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One day man will look back and say that I gave birth to the Absinthe Revival ....,"London, 1888.Jack the Ripper.In the streets of White Chapel, there's the working classes, filth, grime, dirt, drunks, and prostitutes. The movie focuses in on a group of prostitutes. Heather Graham is Mary Kelly, a member of the group and the Ripper's last victim. Another one of them, Anne, has happily gotten out of the life by marrying a wealthy artist and having a child together. Her perfect life is shattered when strange men burst in (during the middle of a very steamy sex scene) and separate her from her husband and child. They disappear. Anne is diagnosed with dementia and is treated (a.k.a - 3 holes are hammered into her skull).From then all, the remaining girls are killed off one by one (by the Ripper of course). Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) investigates the murders as they occur. His opening scene is one in which he is having one of his ""visions"" while ""chasing the dragon"" (smoking opium) in an opium den. He ""sees"" the murders before or as they're occurring. Of course we all know of the Ripper, however, the movie is from the perspective that everything that happened, is happening as we watch. We are a part of Victorian London.Jack the Ripper is one of those mysteries. Numerous documentaries and movies have been made on the subject and various theories and conspiracies have been created, because of the lack of a information and a resolution. This movie resides happily within those folds. Just like the real investigation, the movie naturally has holes in it. It fills those hole with atmosphere and style. The murders are very graphics and gets progressively more graphic as the movie wears on. The mood is dark. London is in a perpetual coal fog and everything is black, brown, gray or covered with soot. Color is a sparse commodity, but when it shows is strangely captivating (mainly in the volume of fake blood used).I will not get into the various elements that make for an intriguing mystery as this might ruin the plot and the fun. There is romantic connection between Mary Kelly and Abberline, but it is subtle and is cut short by the plot. There is definitely a class struggle, but that is evident from Dickens and the period.This movie has always stood out in my mind because of its style and atmosphere. I didn't find it scary but at the same time I never feel quite comfortable. It is like your leg starting to fall asleep, yet you are unable to do anything about it. Abberline's ritualistic smoking of opium and his bathtub Absinthe preparation are classic. I can safely say Johnny Depp taught me about and how to drink Absinthe. All in all, this is an intriguing movie worthy of at least a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hammer Horror gets a big budget,"I was a little disappointed with this film, in that it's not nearly as good as Sleepy Hollow.

"""FROM HELL is a dark, compelling horror film... that will stay in your mind for days after watching.","I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack the Ripper, but surprisingly this was my first film based on the story. From Hell is an outstanding mystery and a dark, moody film. This is the type of film that sticks in your mind days after seeing it. You'll have the image of old Whitechaple in your head. You'll have the terrific murder scenes stuck in your head, but most of all you'll have the image of Jack the Ripper in your head. From Hell will disturb you. It might scare you, and it might even bore you (action fans will not enjoy this film). From Hell is certainly not for everyone, but it certainly was for me.Johnny Depp is fantastic. He is one of my favorite actors, and certainly delivers the goods in From Hell. His performance is perfect, and one of his bests yet. Heather Graham also does a fine job in From Hell. I was surprised with her performance. I'll admit, when I heard she was going to be in the film, I was worried. I mean who doesn't get worried when they find out the same actress who was in Austin Powers 2 is going to be in a Jack the Ripper film. But she did surprise me, although I still think she could have done better.The Hughes brothers direct this film with such style. The use of colors in the film is beautiful, as is the use of lighting. The camera angles are crazy, and the film turns out a beauty. Trevor Jones' score is great (As a matter of fact, I'm listening to it now), and fits the film perfectly. The music is eerie, creepy, and scary. It's flawless.The murder mystery is also great. It keeps you guessing the whole way through (I was not successful in guessing who Jack was), and when the killer is revealed, it all makes sense. And let me tell you, From Hell is violent! Although not as gory as I expected it to be, it'll still make you cringe (that throat slash!). A lot of the violence takes place off screen, which lets your imagination run wild, and mine did just that(My head was filled with tons of gory images).A lot of people call From Hell boring. I can see how they think that, but I disagree completely with that. Sure the film is slow moving, but how fast can a murder mystery movie be? I didn't get bored with the film at all... I was completely absorbed in the film. Another problem people found with this film was the love story, which I have to agree with. Had the love story been more developed, the ending would have been much more depressing, as we would have felt for the characters more (This could be what kept the film from an A+ rating).As I said before From Hell is great. It is my 3rd favorite film of the year, and my second favorite horror film (this year). It's a dark, compelling film, that is NOT FUN! There is no comic relief, it's all horror. Had it been a little more scary, and had the love story been more developed this film would be an A+. I highly recommend fans stay away, because you'll hate it.this film to fans of Jack the Ripper, and horror fans with patience. ActionFrom Hell: 9.5/10, A",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad at all,"This was a pretty good show. Depp is one of my favourite actors, and while this wasn't one of his best roles, he still did a great job as Abberline. I also quire liked Robbie Coltrane as his partner with an affection for poetry, Peter Godrey. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, especially Ian Holm. I loved the atmosphere; though I've heard people complain about it's inaccuracies, I love this romantic kind of portrayal of London: the cobblestone streets, the faint street lights through the billowing fog...makes a great setting for a horror flick. One small problem I had was that the plot seemed to move too fast. There wasn't really enough time for anything to develop, especially near the end. Overall it was a pretty good movie though, I enjoyed it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I say old chap, the British accent IS a bit of a sticky wicket","I was amazed (and a bit perplexed) to hear so many of the previous commenters on IMDb  namely, those from the British Isles  make such pointed comments on the (apparently) scarcely believable accents of American actors Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. As for me, being a Yank and all, I neither noticed nor cared too much whether either Depp or Graham turned out a spotless British, Cockney, Irish or what-have-you accent because ultimately I don't know enough about those accents to be able to make an informed opinion. So in that respect I was rather neutral on the whole accent business throughout the film.Yes, I know what an authentic B-C-I accent sounds like, and I too noticed that these weren't flawless, but I never gave it much thought, as both of them seemed at least realistic and convincing enough to allow me to enjoy the overall atmospheric ""look and feel"" of the movie, which was far more important.That being said, I can see where you are coming from. It would be the equivalent of watching a movie, say, featuring Medieval warriors doing battle, where everything in the battle scenes  the weapons, battle flags, helmets, spears, horses, etc.- are just spot-on accurately depicted, but (horror!) here and there you notice that a few of the foot soldiers are seen to be wearing modern-day wrist watches and sunglasses, or sporting the latest pair of Nike running shoes on their feet. Distracting, to say the least  and potentially ruinous to the whole ""magic"" of the movie experience.I get the same reaction, I guess, when I see American actors who were born north of the Mason-Dixon line attempting to do a realistic- sounding Southern accent. My own mother was born and raised in the Deep South; I've personally traveled throughout much of the South, and as such I can spot a real Southern accent from a fake one from at least a mile away. (Good example of a non-Suthnah' doing an incredible Southern accent: Fred Gwynne (born/raised in NY-NY) as Judge Chamberlain Haller in 1992's ""My Cousin Vinny"").But these comments about accents do raise some interesting critical questions. Namely, should Gollywood try to make more of an effort in casting the most appropriate (and realistic) actor or actress in every cast opening? Hmm, let's see, Inspector Abberline was from Dorset... perhaps the producers of this film could have or should have found an actor born and bred in Dorset to fill the role of Inspector Abberline? (Sorry, I don't right off hand know any actors originally from Dorset, so you'll have to provide me a name, if you know of one!). But on the other hand (and we all know this stubborn little fact of filmdom)... yes, that's right, they have to sell those tickets, they have to fill those seats in the theaters, folks. And Johnny Depp  say what you will about him  he *does* at least have that ""fill the seats"" sort of box-office magnetism.I have always admired Johnny Depp, and I like much of his body of work. And I hurry to say that I was not disappointed with his work in this film. I regret that, for many of you, he didn't make the grade as a convincing enough Inspector Abberline, so much so that it ruined an otherwise absorbing and atmospheric film. I can only point out that, given the realities and mysteries of casting, it could have been worse. I mean, thank God it wasn't Bill Murray playing the Inspector! (Danny DeVito, anyone?)With the possible exception of calling the good folks at Central Casting, I don't know what the answer is, I don't know what we can do about it... (Sorry, I don't know their number, but I know it ISN'T ""1-800-GET-REAL"".) But let me just close by saying that movies DO require a certain contribution of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. Until the folks at Central Casting can come up with perfect matches for every cast part, or until actors and actresses can effortlessly adopt themselves to the subtleties of a regional or foreign dialect, well, we will just have to deal with it, won't we?",,Anonymous,Horror
This shouldn't have been made,"What will Hollywood scenario writers think up next? As an historian I am appalled about this story. What will they put foreward as actual fact. Now you could argue, they never said... but anyhow they used the victim's names and murder locations. This can't be serious. What a missed chance. The actual Ripper story drips with drama, mystery, enigma, colourful individuals, should I go on? No, but some third rate, coca-cola drinking scenario writer thought the American public would be better off with some fifteenth rate love story soap. It could even be oscar material. Let me tell him or they, thanks to this 'penny-novel' approach, every well made, well acted and sometimes brilliant visual approach was destroyed thoroughly for me. Victorian England was something else. One piece of advice: check your sources well, if you used sources other than your bank account.

"This one is the real thing, more or less.","As with many films based on true historical events, there have been a few liberties with the film plot. But the character of Frederick Aberline was very much real, and was the lead investigator of the Jack the Ripper murders. I just finished watching ""Murder By Decree"" a 1979 film on the ripper murder subject with Sherlock Holmes as the protagonist, and many of the critics of that film ran down this movie as be too far fetched, or Aberline as a second rate invention. But in fact Abeline (Johnny Depp) was very real, just as was Robert Lees the noted medium of the 1890's who worked with the police on several cases. I enjoyed ""Murder by Decree"" for it's style and cast but this film for it's more accurate portrayal of the events of the White Chapel murders. Depp and Coltrrane are excellent and well portrayed with their warts as well as their good qualities. This film stands well on it's own.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylishly Filmed But Sordidly Told,"This is stylishly presented, and I always find stories of the famous ""Jack The Ripper"" to be fascinating, but this is not necessarily a likable film. Perhaps I excepted more, but this was a bit too sordid in spots. I gave it a second look I year later, after buying the DVD, and found it so sleazy I wound up trading the disc. This movie never succeeded at the box office, and I can see why: bad vibes and poorly told, despite the fine cinematography.Most films starring Johnny Depp are entertaining, and this is no exception. I never got bored with the story but, in addition to the sordid tone to it, I question the storyteller's bias against Masons (no, I am not one nor have any interest in them) and thought there was a bit of anti-Christian prejudice, too. I couldn't understand a lot of the accents, either, which lessens the enjoyment of watching it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Same old yarn, appallingly made","A rehash of The Royal Conspiracy theory, thoroughly debunked by serious Ripperologists (in particular Donald Rumbelow in his Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook). The theme has been used in many previous Ripper movies, in particular the 1988 made-for-TV ""Jack the Ripper"" with Michael Caine as Inspector Abberline and ""Murder by Decree"" with Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes ...This 2001 version is similar, but whereas the two aforementioned films are terribly enjoyable (the 1988 TV movie particularly so) despite being inaccurate in their historical details, the new movie is simply terrible. Abberline (Johnny Depp) is a druggie, who uses opium to ""see"" details of brutal murders, and solves the case. Good job, because he doesn't do any real police work at any stage in the movie, even by 1888 standards ...Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is the whore with a heart of gold, who is sober and pretty right through the movie, with her make-up perfect, even when languishing at the Ten Bells. She never actually plies her trade, though, do the stage is all set for the fairy tale ending. And so on and so forth.I won't even bother to point out the many, many, many factual inaccuracies and plain untruths in the film. That would fill too many pages on its own.Most of the acting throughout is hammy and way over-the-top. The dialogue is appalling, and the directors haven't really read their own script. For example, it is clearly stated in the film that the murders were committed in the dark. Well, they were.There were few gas lights in Whitechapel in 1888. The place was pitch-black as soon as night fell, hence the real Jack could get away with his slayings. Of course, in the movie, the stage - and it is clearly a sound stage, this is not art direction of the highest order - is nicely lit all the way, gas lights as far as the eye can see. But heck, this is the Hollywood version. Except this is not ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" Hollywood. That was nicely done. This is day-time TV Hollywood, as regards plot, dialogue, character developement, cinematography and direction ...Small bonus points in this shammy film: Ian Holm splendid as usual as Sir William Gull, Robbie Coltrane fine as Sergeant Godley, Ian Richardson splendid as always. Otherwise a really bad film. Stay clear. Or rent the 1988 version on video.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, but nothing spectacular!","Impressive. .  . .Stylewise that is.It seems my assumption couldn't have been more wrong about the Hughes Brothers. Okay I know I might sound discriminative about the fact that since making Menace II Society I thought this is the type of ""Hood"" films they'd be only used to doing. . .BOY WAS I WRONG.Not a bad comeback I might add, Johnny Depp as usual gives his best at playing unusual characters like that of ""Sleep Hollow"". Here he more or less does the same only presenting a more somber mood as the inspector in charge of the Ripper case. Performances are good all round (especially to the two stars Catrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp last seen togethor in the Mike Leigh classic 'Naked').Very well shot and stylish backdrops helped provide the movie's gothic setting giving London a truly creepy touch.My only disspointment was that the murders weren't so shocking and brutal as I'd come to expect (maybe the Hughes Brothers should've looked at some Giallos of Lamberto Bava or Dario Argento in order to help gain more reference to the blood and gore portrayed).Overall not a bad attempt, though it was a tad bit dissapointed. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Johnny Depp vs. Jack the Ripper,"A police inspector (Johnny Depp) in 1888 London tries to capture Jack the Ripper.  Unfortunately, he falls in love with one of his intended victims (Heather Graham).  Very loud (WAY too many shots and sounds of stairs coming down from carriages--the sound is ear-splitting!), dark and confusing.  The movie looks fantastic--there are some breath-taking shots of Victorian London.  But, plotwise, it's a mess.  It moves quickly but is very confusing at the beginning, way too plot heavy (the film is almost 150 minutes) for its own good and throws in hallucinatory images ad nauseum (Depp has too many drug-induced ""visions"").The acting helps--Depp is excellent in his role--he looks very handsome and nicely underplays it.  Graham is good but looks terrible--way too pale and drab (but then, she IS playing a prostitute).  The film doesn't skimp on blood and gore--there's not a lot of violence, but when there is it's not pretty.  Ultimately, the film is too long, too grim and too depressing to really enjoy.  Still the producers/directors the Hughes Brothers are talented men.  Let's see more of them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The grisliest Jack the Ripper yet,"The story of Jack the Ripper has long been of interest in the horror cinema. Right back in the creaky old days of the silents he made his appearances in the likes of 1926's WAXWORKS and Hitchcock's THE LODGER. An infamous black and white British version of the tale, made in 1959 by a cheap rival to Hammer, has fallen into obscurity but is still best remembered for the final reel, in which the killer is caught beneath a lift and the screen turns to glorious blood red colour for an instant to capture his gory demise. In the 1970s, European horror veteran Jess Franco gave us his typically sleazy variant with 1976's nasty JACK THE RIPPER, with Klaus Kinski in the leading role, whilst Spanish stalwart Paul Naschy made his own variant. In 1988, to mark the centenary of the Ripper murders, a supposedly definitive television miniseries was made in America starring Michael Caine as the investigating policeman. It's a good but flawed telling of the story marred only by the TV-movie level it never rises above. And now, to mark the new millennium, two brothers best known for their gangster rap movies have given the world FROM HELL, which is for a change based on a graphic novel (which I haven't read) of the Ripper story rather than the real-life murder investigation itself.As a horror film, it works. Everything about this film screams style and class. For a change the gory murders and surgical operations that Jack carries out on his deeply unfortunate victims are shown in graphic detail, rather than only being spoken of like in previous versions of the tale, and no expense is spared in giving us graphic, stomach-churning scenes of the cloaked Ripper calmly sawing out the internal organs of his female victims, kneeling above their prone bodies. Entrails are torn out and wrapped around necks and throats are slashed emitting geysers of crimson gore. Police surgeons repeatedly vomit at the sight of the mutilated corpses and quick flash cuts show us all we need to know about the severity of the crimes, so on a visceral level at least FROM HELL offers pure horror, sometimes nausea-inducing and all the more effective for it. Scenes of the victims being stalked at night by the cruel killer are highly suspenseful, heightened by the dark, baroque music that accompanies them and a high class of acting from all concerned.Attention to detail also contributes to this movie's success and I would go so far as to say that this is the most authentic-looking Jack the Ripper film that I've yet to see. Although some of the choice language is a little too modern to be that convincing the rest of the dialogue, the sets, the scenery and the costumes are spot-on. You have to love the brief appearance of the Elephant Man into the thick of the action and the secret society of Freemasons who operate below ground. Characters sport lived-in clothes rather than the off-the-shelf garb of the Caine miniseries and the London setting is brilliantly portrayed as a rancid den of sleaze and open depravity, packed with opium dens, pubs full of drunken angry men, and streets littered with filth and beggars.The cinematography is spot-on and helps to transport you back to 1888, putting you into the realism of the action as we watch drug-induced nightmares of the Ripper slicing up his victims and taking them to pieces. After the initial half hour which bluntly introduces Jack's figure into the depressing London streets the film takes the form of a detective tale as policeman Johnny Depp searches for clues to find the identity of the killer. Once again the film takes the well-worn conspiracy route of there being a royal connection to the killer, so whilst it lacks the element of surprise (aside from those who are complete Ripper novices) the final unmasking of the villain is still a fine piece of shock cinema and the last reel very exciting, incorporating a violent cab ride and the most gruesome murder saved for last into the proceedings.The cast is bolstered by a host of familiar British faces like Ian Richardson who bring a touch of class to the production although ironically the two leads are American (though you wouldn't guess it, as they do sport impeccable accents as is the norm these days). Johnny Depp once again proves he can do no wrong and it's fair to say that he's become a mini-horror star in recent years with all the genre productions he keeps making. Depp's opium-addicted young policeman makes a nice change from the decent, elder investigators (like Michael Caine in the 1988 miniseries) and he plays a charming, interesting central figure and one which the audience can thankfully emphasise with. Robbie Coltrane plays it tough as Depp's sergeant and basically acts as the comic relief of the production (and boy, does this horrific outing need it). Heather Graham (BOOGIE NIGHTS) is also delightful as Mary Kelly, a would-be victim of the Ripper, and as well as looking spot-on in the role, all flowing red locks and heaving bosoms just like in one of the old Hammer films, plays her part with some skill.I don't have an unpleasant word to say about anyone else, but special kudos goes to Ian Holm who plays a kindly retired surgeon in one of his last major roles. Subtle use of black contact lenses turn the killer into a deeply scary-looking man and the actor playing Jack really does deserve an Oscar for his role here - the final murder in which he believes he is teaching a class is magnificently-evoked stuff and very clever indeed. FROM HELL is a quality production and one of the better versions of the tale and it will certainly take some doing to better this in the future; for now be content in watching what is a well-paced, scary, sometimes disturbing modern horror yarn.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A few nice sequences, exquisite performances, a convincing technical department, and a superb third act. But the execution of the ideas doesn't work. **1/2 (out of four","FROM HELL / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It is the dramatically gruesome ideas that make this film what it is, but it is the poor execution of those ideas that makes this film what it is not. ""From Hell"" contains a few nice sequences, exquisite performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm, a very convincing technical department, and it has a superb third act. Unfortunately, despite those positive factors, the film as a whole doesn't quite work.Jack the Ripper committed five gruesome, ritualistic murders during a ten-week span in London during the fall of 1888. He was never caught. As the first tabloid star of the twentieth century, he is remembered as one of the most notorious serial killers in history.""From Hell"" does not successfully bring him to life, though the Hughes brothers certainly breathe life into the era. The film's sets were created by Academy Award-winning production designer Martin Child. He and seventy artists and carpenters constructed a 20-acre set near Barrandov Studios. Their hard work pays off; the film embodies an entirely believable design. It's a great achievement from a technical standpoint.Based on a popular graphic novel, ""From Hell"" referrers to the return address on a letter from Jack the Ripper. The always entertaining Johnny Depp stars as it's recipient, Fred Abberline, a tormented Inspector who seeks temporary relief with opium. His unendurable addiction gives him visions of the future.Let's have some more about Abberline's internal struggles and opium addiction. Let's dive into his mind and explore the source of these visions and addictions. This is a very intriguing aspect of the character, but the film never really develops this subject. Instead we get a shallow, flat concept that never leaves ground.Inspector Abberline is called to duty when a vicious serial killer takes the lives of several prostitutes. As the bodies start piling, the inspector realizes his superiors are far more interested in preventing public panic than finding the killer. One figure, however, named Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), takes interest in Abberline. As a physician to the royal family, Gull is a powerful enough figure to assist Abberline in his investigation. They discover a secret that threatens everyone who knows it.Albert and Allen Hughes direct the film with a sense of precise detail. They took extreme measures to assure the film's effectiveness. They softened the lighting by placing a silk cloth over the rear of the lenses. They shot the flashback sequences on positive film. Fast motion and time-lapse photography give the movie a unique flavor. The cinematography creates an ominous presence.The Hughes' failure lies not within the technical aspects of the film, however, but within the misconnection with the audience. Despite a plot about the mystery and horror of Jack the Ripper, the movie is not particularly scary, nor does it work as a mystery. Watching the movie, I never found myself guessing the identity of the killer, nor did I follow the characters, or identify with which victim would be the next to go. There is no real sense of a puzzle here; the script does not give us enough to care about the killer or his victims.Much has been said about the film's violent content. Although it certainly suggests strong, gruesome violence, we seldom actually witness it. ""From Hell"" does contain some of the most grotesque images I have seen in film, but as a whole, Jack the Ripper's violent acts are not witnessed, but implied. During the murders, we usually only see a quick flash of a knife, and then partial glimpse of the aftermath of the victims. It's a letdown, since it's one of the few interesting things in the movie.All of this notwithstanding, even if there was more stomach-churning gore it would not have saved the movie. Violence relives tension, and ""From Hell"" does not build a single iota of suspense. No wonder why there is no sense of mystery or intrigue; for most of the film, we are sitting flat on our butts. In a movie like this, we want to be on the edge of our seats. To make matters worse, this film is almost two hours long.You know the sensation you get in your butt when you drive a car for a really long time? That cramped, anxious feeling that makes you want to get out of the car and stretch? That's how I felt during this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
JACK-THE-RIP-OFF,"After watching this movie, I think the tag-line should have been, ""Got Grapes?"" (Got Milk?) or ""Ah, The Power of Grapes"" (Ah, the Power of Cheese).The hero is an opium addict who has ability to envision tomorrows murder, today. He is supposed to be very smart. At one point he is drawing locations of different spots where bodies were recovered, and based on that he figures out that this has some significance in terms of some cult and predicts the location of next murder. At that point he had a good idea that the reason those women were being murdered was that they were witness to a wedding of some loser prince and somebody wanted them to be eliminated. My question is, why didn't he post all the idiot cops right outside that ONE room where all of those women lived? Wouldn't it be easy to just ask a pair of cops to FOLLOW the remaining two or three women in that ONE room? He knew who was getting killed, and why, yet there were cops everywhere but outside that one spot. This is level of idiocy not seen before in any crime movie.Another question: Shouldn't the hero have told the remaining women, NOT TO TALK TO STRANGERS WHO GIVE YOU GRAPES? How about questioning couple of fruit vendors? He also knew the killer was rich and educated, and there were more than one suspect at hand. Yet Jack-The-Rip-OFF gallops through those narrow streets in his carriage, and no one seemed to take a note.The dialogue, the acting, the sets, the cast, the characters, were so horrible, that I found myself rooting for Jack!

Truly effective Gothic horror film,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly, saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was ""good,"" but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it, I thought it looked nice but moved too fast, was a little dumb. But by the end, I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure, it's a triumph of style over substance, but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.I would compare From Hell most closely to Alex Proyas' 1997 triumph Dark City, which, like From Hell, made almost nothing at the box office. I hope, like Dark City, that From Hell will win a larger audience on video. It's not as intelligent as Dark City, which was brilliant in nearly every way, but From Hell equals it in visual virtuosity. Its story, while sometimes lapsing into silliness, is enormously gripping. It's also one of the few horror films to succeed at inducing a sense of dread in the audience. A Scotland Yard detective (played well by Johnny Depp) is on the case of Jack the Ripper, who is himself on the trail of a group of five prostitutes. On the way, Depp discovers that the ritualistic murders are part of a larger conspiracy. The film is full of great twists, the biggest one being simply hilarious in its level of audacity. The end is quite unpredictable (although the climax is a little too predictable).There are several minor flaws in the film. It does go a bit too fast, but its breathless pace ends up paying off well in the end. Many people will be turned off at the level of gore in the film. Seriously, avoid it at all costs if you have a weak stomach. But if you could take it in Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, or Sleepy Hollow, you'll be fine. I actually felt that those three particular films flaunted their gore and were tremendously ineffective in their horror. Yes, even (and perhaps especially) Silence of the Lambs. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that way about From Hell. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nice to watch at home,"Albert and Allen Hughes try to catch the great graphical novel from Alan Moore with the same name with some interesting results ... but also with some obvious misses and commercial ""sell out's"". Johny Depp does a good work in capturing a character that really doesn't matter that much in the original story (and here takes the leading role). Some images also took inspiration from Eddie Campbell's graphic work ... but you will only notice it if you know the original work. I also remember reading that despite a friendly relation with the directors from this movie Moore said that he would not sign any other movie after the rip off done in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" strange he is credited. Maybe this work redone by Jodorowsky would give it the sharpness it deserves, nonetheless it makes a good enjoyment to spend some free time, and if you like the story don't miss the real thing from Moore.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated. Visually stunning Horror movie.,"This is an underrated movie that takes into another direction the well known case of Jack The Ripper. The events and situations are pretty accurate but with the touch of Hollywood. I mean, there are a lot of exaggerations in some situations but the movie is meant to entertain and not be taken too seriously.The characters are great and portrayed perfectly by talented actors such as Depp and Cochran. The direction of the movie is very good and atmospheric. This movie has great cinematography and art direction. The settings are simply great and truly resemble the England of that time.In the Horror aspect, the movie has great gore and violence. I dug the unrated version. The fact that the Elephant Man does a cameo is a great moment in the movie.I cannot comment that much on this one because it has to be watched objectively and do not associate it 100% with the serial killer we all know. The movie is more about fictitious facts that compliment perfectly the original facts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"love the dark, murky, brutal style","It's 1888 London haunted by Jack the Ripper. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is a prostitute in the Whitechapel District. Her friend Ann Crook has a baby and a rich mystery patron. Ann gets kidnapped while others are getting killed. Mary Kelly hides the baby. Police Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) has visions which help in his brilliant investigations with his partner Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane). Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) is a physician to the Royals and a respected medical teacher.I love the dark, murky, brutal style. It's fitting for the times and the subject matter. The story is a bit disjointed which I like for this movie. It's a jumble of pieces from two sides of a story coming together. It is bloody and ominous. Granted, the story doesn't flow smoothly but the style more than makes up for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch for the B-U-T in this review,"If you look at the box office numbers and the IMDb score you will quickly get the feeling that this was not one of Depp's most well received films.And you would be correct.But here is the B-U-T I promised you. And it goes ... BUT this is nonetheless a great performance.And that is the catch. To this reviewer,the films of Depp are somewhat of a cipher. We tend to associate him with some of his most overblown roles -- such the pirate, the boy with scissors for hands, and so on.We do this because he creates the characters so effectively. So effortlessly.But what even his most die-hard fans tend to overlook is that he creates the overblown characters so well because at his core Depp is one of the greatest living actors of our age. He simply hides it too well.What this film offers, aside from a mood and setting to die for, is a real chance to Depp to show what he can do in a serious part ... and he sells it like pumpkins at Holloween.For this reason, as a missing puzzle piece in the archive of his work, I think it deserves special merit.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting but can't sustain the intrigue for long enough,"Interesting take on the Jack the Ripper story.

You will never believe him to be a good actor again when you hear his attempt at an English accent.

Good except for Graham,"Truly enjoyed this version & Johnny Depp - chef's kiss. What really took me out and ruined most of it was Heather Graham. Should've switched and had Sophie Myles as Mary Kelly and Heather as the wife in the one flash back. I can't 100% put a finger on it but every scene with her just didn't seem genuine.Beyond that I rather enjoyed this and the theory which it followed. So many different avenues on who the Ripper was from HH Holmes to the Prince. When they first snatched him, I was like wait what does this have to do with anything & then the name Albert clicks.Reminds me of The Raven with John Cusack.

A ripping yarn? Or a schizophrenic tale?,"What do you get if you mix Edward Elgar, Take That and Ministry of Sound at Ibiza? You get ""From Hell"". This film is a mix of historical fact ( Elgar), urban legend ( Take That) and surreal drama ( MOS Ibiza) coming together to form a strange yet enjoyable dance.The film is set in Victorian London when the poorer classes of London's Whitechapel area lived in fear of the most infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, much is made of Inspector Abeline's opium, Absynth and strychnine addiction, something associated more with Sherlock Holmes than Abeline although historically accurate as the drugs of choice for the Victorian gent in London .Johnny Depp, an actor who seems to pick roles which allow him to showcase his versatility is convincing as Abeline, the unfortunate detective who became a sacrificial scapegoat offered up to the frustrated and furious Londoners by a powerful Masonic order. His London accent varies through the film and is reminiscent of his Jack Sparrow. Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action, but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top, where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known, this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order. The film is filled with factual aspects such as the pressure put upon Abeline to find a Jew butcher as the murderer, the chalk writing being washed off the wall and the intentional misspelling of Juwes. Equally it's full of assumptions, however I couldn't help feeling it's the closest any film has come to the truth. No one has ever sufficiently answered how Jack the Ripper was able to get in and out of east London unseen and un stopped, and the murders, swift and brutal over a short period seemed to end as quickly as they had begun without reason or answer.The plot is simple to follow and unfolds with ease as the film progresses, there are no surprises or ridiculous unbelievable twists but there are some problems with the film. You're repeatedly bombarded with surreal drug influenced moments, expected to believe in a miss fitting romance subplot, asked not to question set and costume design which is accurately Victorian but seems too clean and bright for the age. Perhaps the directors felt Abeline's drug induced visions were important and purposely avoided the classic Victorian smog and squalor we think of to give a bright and fresh feel . Additionally, less is made of Jack the Ripper's acts themselves. Given that the film is titled ""From Hell"" which is how the genuine Ripper letters were addressed, surprisingly the letters and body parts he sent to the newspapers and Scotland Yard is hardly touched upon as the film seems to concern itself more with Abeline and the Masons rather than Jack and his actions. We shouldn't forget how disturbed the mind of Jack the Ripper was and perhaps the fact that somehow these events were indeed covered up, even to this day, the directors were perhaps right to focus on those who sought to perpetrate the cover up than remake a story told so many times before. That said all these things do leave you feeling that the film is not sure of it's own identity and is somewhat confused, schizophrenic even. Enjoyable none the less.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
from hell - good title,"for this lame movie. it wasn't even scary, just disturbing. the killings made no sense. the whole story was quite senseless. was it a cruel love story? a slasher movie with some romance or what? johnny depp was great, that's it. heather graham's acting was disappointing. she didn't even fit into the movie. and how come she always looked so nice and clean while her friends were dirty and bad dressed? my advice - rent on video, don't waste your money on this crappy movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Darkly set but lacking the passion and tension of the story,"In 1888 London psychic detective Fred Abberline (Depp) seeks to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper.There have numerous critics slating this movie for its inaccurate depiction of the legend murderer and the poor adapting of English accents from the two leads.But From Hell is, when you watch it for the first time, undeniably intriguing with a passion and an interior motive to tell the tale of one of the mythical tales of Victorian era.Johnny Depp stars as Frederick Abberline, a worn down detective with a tendency to see the future. Depp's English accent is one to be scrutinized and whilst the critics may have a point on this matter, it doesn't shy away from the fact Depp is arguably miscast in the central role. The bravado of Captain Jack is missing, the surprise and imagination of Edward has disappeared and in the place is a stone coloured mask that denotes misery and lack of enthusiasm that is hard to see the balance of the character when considering the dialogue. For example the eventuality of Mary leaves Depp looking confused rather than surprised and amazed not to forget his expressionless and passionate responds to the constant murders of the womenfolk.Depp's far from on form here but do not be discouraged as come the end of the film we see his character thrive out of the darkness to see some much needed passion that wraps up the political incorrectness of the time and reflect on what has been a startling story.The plot revolves around The Ripper with each murder seemingly brutal with its use of powerful blood and gore to give Sweeney Todd a run for its money. Each murder adds spice and tension to the plot with some conscientious mystery that will baffle and intrigue right up until the revealing identity. Seeing the identity of The Ripper kind of spoilt the flowing mystery of the film and you may be wondering who and why had the film finished with a sharper climax considering the last murder.From Hell is a sharp period drama with a good sense of costume and setting to justify the times and issues that contained within them. The dark lighting and the sharp colours of the sky are worthy mentions to give that extra edge and a feeling of misery to the dark narrative, particularly considering the involvements. From murder to sex, this isn't afraid of shying away from realistic activities of past life, and with the political incorrectness regarding the force and the Monarch it may be seen as controversial.Where From Hell fails is with Depp unfortunately. Had there been a bit more spice and vigour in his dialogue then the plot may have been more engaging, a tad more passionate to really entice the viewer into the dramatic proceedings. The direction by the Hughes brothers leaves a lot to be answered for as some of the sex scenes are awkward rather than fiery and when the Ripper sits down on the bed, you wonder why.

"Dark, shocking, but great","This film was aired on a French channel a few days ago, in its French dubbed version.I absolutely wanted to watch it. First, because as a fan of the UK and anything related to this country, Jack the Ripper is part of this country's history. Second, because I wanted to watch Johnny Depp's performance.I have watched many reports about Jack the Ripper and based on these TV reports, I can say that the film is fairly true to the reality, at least, what we are told about it.It's like travelling back through the years to this Victorian era and living the life of the most poor people.It's an interesting but also very dark and somewhat shocking film, the kind of films that remains printed in your mind. It's a film that grabs you, that you can't watch lightly. It makes you think, imagine, it also frightens you.Something worth watching anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish and intriguing--one hell of a ride!!!,"When I saw the previews my first thought was ""The Hughes Brothers directed this?""  No offense, they're great at what they do.  ""Menace 2 Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"" are both very good movies, but how are they gonna pan out directing a period piece?  Well, this isn't a period piece in the conventional sense.  Most of the time when you think ""period piece"" you think about something along the lines of ""Sense and Sensibility.""  ""From Hell"" is more like a modern day crime thriller/horror flick taking place in the late 1800's.  The sets and costumes fit the period, but the style is modern.I knew nothing about the Jack the Ripper murders previous to viewing the movie, so I found this movie entertaining as well as informative.  And the DVD contains a couple of documentaries about the real Ripper murders.  Like many historians said, there were many suspects, but they never really found out who was the real Jack the Ripper.  So the Hughes Brothers had a little bit of artistic liberty in creating the story.  The plot twist is really neat, I never expected *namesake* to be the killer.  But other than the Ripper's true identity, the Hughes stayed strict to how the rest of the murders were committed.I was surprised to find out that there are in fact a lot of historical inaccuracies present--at least that's what it says in the ""goofs"" section, they could be wrong.  According to the featurette, the Hughes Brothers were sticklers for detail.  But who cares anyway?  So what if they did get a few things wrong?  Is there anybody watching this movie that was actually around during the 19th century?  The sets look magnificent and so do the costumes. That's all I care about.I'm glad the Hughes cast Johnny Depp in the lead role.  He's absolutely perfect at anything he does, never failing to give a vibrant, Oscar-worthy performance.  So him being the star was one of my main motivations for seeing this movie.  I read that actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Connery were considered for the role.  Well, no one can fit the part better than Johnny Depp.  His English accent is perfect, but I wasn't worried he wouldn't be able to pull it off--he's Johnny Depp, he can pull off anything!  Who I was surprised about was Heather Graham.  Though she's often good at what she does, she usually does fluff films and I was surprised that she was able to fluently pull off the English accent as well as deliver a fully convincing performance.  When I rented the movie, the clerk said to me ""Just to let you know:  There are certain historical flaws in the movie...like there were no prostitutes back then who looked like Heather Graham.  In fact, they didn't even look like women.""  Well, Heather did seem a little misplaced among the rest of the prostitutes, who did in fact look as ugly as the real prostitutes during the period, but I was willing to suspend disbelief. Despite that mild casting error, her performance was convincing.  Robbie Coltrane is amusing as Depp's sidekick, and they have an interesting chemistry.  Also among the great cast of English actors are Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.The effects are gory, but not gratuitous.  The Hughes Brothers did leave enough to the audience's imagination.  If you have an extremely weak stomach, you'll definitely cringe and maybe hurl, but if not you should be fine.  But I didn't really look at it as a horror film perse.  I thought of it more as a murder mystery, though many will probably think of it more along the lines of horror.  But even if you think of it as horror, it's not slice-and-dice ""Friday the 13th"" horror.  It's horror with a story--a very good one.  I was intrigued throughout, especially since I knew nothing about the Ripper murders.  And there are some nice touches of comic relief.  I love the scene in which The Ripper says, ""One day people will look back and say I gave birth to the 20th century.""  Johnny Depp pulls out a gun and replies, ""You're not going to see the 20th century.""Those who know a lot about The Ripper murders will probably complain about the littlest of details, and be very cynical in approaching the movie, but I found it to be a wild ride.  It's intriguing, it's stylish and extremely well-acted.  I'm not asking for much more!My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete and Utter Drivel,"I had really high hopes for this movie. what the Hughe's brothers have done is turn one of the most fascinating murder/mysteries of the 20th Century into an music video with no narrative structure or form and absolutely no redeeming features.The love story between Mary Kelly and Abberline is ridiculous. it's only saving grace are the few quips from Robbie Coltrane and some nice character moments by Jason Flemyng.

A fine mystery with great visuals,"From Hell, based on the expansive (read: phone book length) graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is a strong mystery with great visuals.  The film is even more interesting than I expected; aside from its mysteries and scares, it also has some interesting unsettling elements; some I think were intentional, some not.The Hughes Brothers impresssed me with some strong visuals and a moody, evocative interpretation of 1880's London, complimenting a retelling of Jack the Ripper as a Seven-ish murder mystery.  Johnny Depp is the Inspector assigned to the case, who also happens to drink heavily, smoke drugs, and hallucinate vital clues to his cases.  Heather Graham is one of a group of prostitutes that Jack has targeted for murder.Graham's Mary Kelly is the movie's biggest problem.  As a gorgeous movie star with a bad British accent, she sticks out from the rest of the fine ensemble as a poor casting choice.  The rest of the prostitutes she pals around with are plain, dirty, and probably more ""realistic.""  Graham's porcelain face and fire red hair stick out like a sore thumb.As I said, the rest of the cast is excellent, and the film really gets under your skin.  I've never seen anything by The Hughes Brothers before, but they are visually exciting directors, and I'll be looking into the back catalogue to see what else they've done.The unsettling elements come in the form of things like Graham as a Victorian hooker and the lack of likeable protagonists, and the ending that is both formula Hollywood and defiant independent cinema.  Often commercial aspects and directorial vision seem to be duking it out, even within individual scenes.  I don't think either side truly wins; we're left with a mixed bag of emotions and styles.From Hell has a few graphic moments of gore that will turn off some of the weaker-stomached in the audience.  And the ending hits as many hollow notes as good ones.  But still, while it's not the most satisfying movie, it is never boring.  Almost a great film, it winds up an intruiging good film with some unfulfilled potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cheap knockoff, an insult to Depp's talent","I'll watch anything with Depp or Ian Richardson, which is how I got skinned on this PPV rental. For God's sake, do NOT spend money on this sad little ripoff of Murder by Decree -- but with far less talent and entertainment.The plot was ""new"" 20 years ago but thoroughly discredited long ago as being too silly for words. Even Depp's great Cockney acccent was completely out of character for a Scotland Yard inspector, but the portrayal of one pinup-quality whore amongst a thousand utter dogs was just annoying...as was her accent and acting. The storyline was erratic (even where it made sense), and the so-called ""mystery"" was obvious early on. The errors or misrepresentations about the Ripper murders were phenomenal, and only someone totally ignorant of the case could get sucked in at all.Depp is one of the most talented actors around, but even he can be grossly miscast in awful movies (""Blow"" coming to mind immediately). One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in ""Sleepy Hollow,"" which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.There are several interesting (and even believable) speculations on the Ripper murders, and of course most scholars have a pretty good idea who it probably was (hint: it wasn't a doctor, a royal prince or a Freemason). Surely we could have been given an interesting premise that didn't have just class prejudice going for it.This really did suck.

very good film about Jack the ripper with a brilliant role from johnny depp,"I hear you thinking;""Oh no, not another movie about Jack the Ripper."" But this film gives you a good look of Jack and the mysterie around him. Because nobody can tell for sure that Jack has really lived his life with killing people. So any film about him is pure guessing about what happened.After you've seen from hell, you can tell people a little bit more about jack, but on the other side you can tell people nothing new about jack. So why is this film then so good? Well first of all the atmosphere they've captured in this film is taking you right back into the past. beside that there is a scene in the film where you see Johnny depp taking drugs with sugar and absint, besides that there is also a lot of opium involved. but all with all it is a very good movie.so if you haven't seen him this is absolute a must see film.go and check it out. see ya Gijs",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite acceptable thriller,"As far as thrillers go, there haven't been many worth watching in recent times. I'm pleased to say that ""From Hell"", although not perfect, is a neatly crafted and entertaining horror/drama/period piece.I was a little surprised when this film was first released to find out that it was directed by the Hughes brothers of ""Dead Presidents"" fame. Although competent film-makers and better-than-average storytellers, I wasn't particularly convinced that they could recreate 19th century England and the time of Jack the Ripper without at least some American overtones.Fortunately, they have reproduced this era in a very credible manner, with thanks to a number of their cast and crew. Cinematographer Peter Deming has created a claustrophobic and grimy London enveloped in sleaze and darkness and a sky that rarely seems to be anything but dull, even in the daytime shots. Veteran actors in the cast, particularly Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane, add class to the production and Johnny Depp is probably the best choice out of Hollywood's younger male stars to play someone other than an American.The only slightly negative thread is the casting of Heather Graham as a young English prostitute. She just doesn't feel that convincing in the part (especially beside her more experienced costars) but thankfully her role doesn't overshadow proceedings.""From Hell"" tells the tale of Jack the Ripper, who in London 1888, became one of the world's first serial killers, murdering a number of prostitutes on the east side of town. Inspector Johnny Depp, who has clairvoyant powers courtesy of his drug addiction, is hauled onto the case by baffled sergeant Robbie Coltrane. In his investigation, he is aided by prostitute Heather Graham, whose coworkers on the street seem to be turning up gruesomely murdered at an alarming rate. What follows is a dissection through the ranks of both lower and upper class London to eventually trace out the killer and his motives.Saying much more about the plotline would reveal too much, but similar to David Fincher's ""Seven"", it is nice to see a serial killer actually given a personality and a reason (even if quite skewed) for their actions. On the downside, I was able to pick who Jack the Ripper was very early on and the ending does come across as somewhat contrived.However, in a season of disappointing thrillers, ""From Hell"" is a welcome addition to the box-office. Although not a pure shock-fest (it is quite graphic and couldn't have been too far off an Australian R18+ certificate) it is a reasonably intelligent serial killer film for adults and certainly a change from all of the teenage slasher-flick clones which seem to be flooding the market.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline is of course the main character and does a good job like we are used from him. The other actors are all good as well. It might not be the best story I ever saw from Jack The Ripper but it keeps you interested till the end. It's a dark movie, everything I would expect from London Whitechapel in that period.

"From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp","RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective's interest.The film was based on Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy,"" referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there's no evidence that Abberline ""chased the dragon"" or that he had ""psychic visions."" Speaking of real life, Moore's graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book ""Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution."" This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.""From Hell"" plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" (1969) and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" (1970). ""From Hell"" even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society 'gentlemen' in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer's Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad,"I think this movie is a real masterpiece. Everything is fabulous and quite convincing. I think nobody showed London like this with the blue fog (It was really blue not white as mistakingly thought), that you could smell the dirt and tremble for cold. I think evaluation of movies depends on mood very much. You can watch the same movie twice, feeling it's a masterpiece on first time, then feeling it's lousy second time, all depending on your state of mind. I can say I watched this movie in my best mental and physical condition and I insist it's a masterpiece. What I hated most was those funny large contact lenses that the killer wears during killing. This is no supernatural horror I guess, so no basis for shape changes. Is there a historical basis for queen Victoria being involved in masonic rites, and Prince Albert getting married to a prostitute ? If not, then It's a crime specially for foreigners like me, who may learn history from movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
a stylish flick with an interesting Ripper-twist,"This movie had a bit more depth than I expected.  It wasn't great by any measure, but the late 19th century backdrop was supported well by the sets and custom design, making it one of the more stylish period movies I've seen in some time.  Along with that came a another good performance by Johnny Deep, but I felt the supporting performance of Heather Graham could have been played better by a British actress or a lesser unknown.   I just couldn't picture Heather in anything less then a peppy gorgeous blond role (ie Austin Powers), although I have to say she surprised me in this role as the 19th century whore with the tender heart.

"Dark, surrealistic journey into Victorian England","I was not too excited to see this movie when it originally came out, but recently rented it and found that it was surprisingly good.  It takes a played-out story and gives it fresh twist and even goes one step further than usual and solves the crime!  AND the solution makes sense!Johnny Depp, using an authentic Cockney accent, does a great job in the lead as a demoralized inspector seeking the truth about these gruesome sex crimes.   Heather Graham finally gives up her kittenish image and also comes through in her role as one of the ""unfortunates"" or prostitutes of the London streets.The dark, moody atmosphere is created through camerawork, sets and the editing, which has a dreamy, surrealistic edge to it inspired by Depp's opium hazes and ""intuitions"".  Though these visions are not crucial to the plot, they take us a little more into the horror of what these crimes were.If you are squeamish about blood, DO NOT see this movie, because these filmmakers want you to experience these acts even from the point of view of ""The Ripper"", but if you are a fan of the horror genre, I would say that ""From Hell"" is a must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
it was really from hell(I have proof),"This movie was a great disappointment. I have done some research about Jack the ripper and this movie has a lot of flaws. for instance, the murders are not in the right order. neither one of the victims knew each other. and we all know that jack the ripper was younger than 60, absolutely didn't give the victims grapes and Abberline didn't smoke pot!!!!It was all bad! my friend got out of her chair and started vacuum cleaning the room. it was such a badly made film that i just want to go and yell at the people who made this movie. bad bad bad movie! 1 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Johnny Depp does a great job as always and the supporting cast was solid. And the storyline was intriguing filled with twists and turns.This movie is about a young detective who is sent to London to investiage the a string of murders of young woman, mainly prostitutes who are being brutally murdered and cut apart by the man known to everyone as Jack the ripper.This movie was pretty good the only reason I give it a six and not higher is mainly because of the ending.

"Foggy, scary,well acted.","The movie was excellent! Depp's cockney accent is great...but I don't think Abberline was from the East End of London. Johnny has charisma and played it extremely well. I think he should have been nominated for an award. Heather Graham is gorgeous...and her accent could have used a little more work. Her acting was good, better than I have seen in any of her films. The actress that played Catherine Eddows should have been a thin brunette...that was a mistake.And the latest findings on Jack the Ripper (from the author Patricia Cornwell) show that the British painter, Walter Sickert was really Jack the Ripper...and yes, he did kill 5 women and maybe even some young children. Patricia Cornwell spent 3 million dollars on a new investigation with Scotland Yard and she came up with new DNA evidence that links a letter to Walter Sickert, the famous British painter. So as entertaining as this movie is...the new Sickert theory is the most convincing Jack the Ripper so far. I was disappointed that they didn't use this new theory. The real Mary Kelly was young and beautiful...the rest of the victims were in their forties and homely. . Bravo From Hell...best Ripper movie yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
How to ruin a Folklore legend,"I was appalled to see that yet another version of the famous ""Jack The Ripper"" has come and was unsure as to how this one would pan out compared to the rest. Happily, it did not compare to the rest. This film not only took the legend that is ""Jack The Ripper"" and made it in a farcical romance but took a dimwitted view of the monarchy. How can the directors in their right mind sanctioned a film like this without doing their research. And on top of that, took the time to make out that a possible romance could have happened ?. If they think that they could get away with producing crap of this magnitude, then it is another attempt to ""crap"" on the English with a pathectic attempt to re-create what can only be described as ""The most unsolved and greatest who-dunnit"" in modern times.  If anyone is thinking of renting this out, I would strongly advise against this as they will be dissappointed to the brink of switching it off.  I hope that in the future, someone will take the time to make a version which contains a lot more of the facts and not pure speculation as this film did.

This movie is the definition of the Hughes brother's style!,"After watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was really good, but throughout that next week, images and the look of the film stayed with me. The Hughes Brother's depiction of 19th century England is as I have always imagined; the peasantry and the upper class being so separated, the look of the buildings, people, cobblestone roads, fog, and lastly the Legend of Jack the Ripper. Also, keep an eye out for the Hughes brother's use of the camera.This is my favorite Johnny Depp role; he is an addict, genius, poet, and is constantly haunted by the visions he receives.

Johnny Depp is always good...,"Once again Johnny Depp provides us an solid performance. It's hard to not to like the films he has made. This film is a dark one, much like another Depp movie Sleepy Hollow. In my opinion movie was a bit too hard to follow even though the plot itself isn't very complicated. Robbie Coltrane also succeeds to be in good shape in this one. But in general the stage is set for Depp and other performances tend go just in a side. The visual presentation of this movie is also interesting and exciting, although being quite dark, as said. But if you have seen a lot of movies like I, this one really doesn't offer anything new. The ones who liked Sleepy Hollow or The Ninth Gate will probably like this also. I liked both, but because I had seen them before watching this I was quite ready what to expect.

I know what you did at the end of the 19th Century,"Johnny Depp plays Inspector Aberline, a cockney drug addict with psychic powers and a nice line in meaningful stares.  His task here is to catch a cunning murderer, going by the moniker `Jack The Ripper', who is disemboweling the local cockney prostitutes.From the opening scenes, where the whores are portrayed as `unfortunates' with a heart of gold and the gangsters are played as snarling, scar-faced sociopaths, I had my suspicions this wasn't going my particular cup of tea. Subtle? Not a word that springs to mind. The character development was heavy handed, bordering on downright stereotypical. Aberline is given a wife who has died in child birth, therefore he feels alone. Robby Coltrane spouts poetry, therefore he is wise. Mary Kelly has a picture of herself as a child to show that she wasn't always a whore.  Big broad strokes.Additionally, the supporting cast. (Sir Charles Warren, Dr. Ferral, Kidney and his Special Branch hoodlums) where left high and dry with hackneyed dialogue and slender, under-developed roles.The plot development on the other hand was acceptable, though derivative. A series of vicious murders with one potential victim being singled out for development right from the start. A romantic interlude. It even includes the old chestnut where the lovable whores' leave the relative safety of their lodgings one by one (after being warned to stay of the streets!) and are subsequently slashed. Nothing you haven't seen in the Scream movies. However, there is average development in between this that lifts the story slightly. An interesting conspiracy theory is included and the conclusion was a little less conventional, so I suppose that's something.The thing that particularly annoyed me was the style of the movie. When I heard that it was filmed in Prague I was expecting beautiful architecture, atmospheric back streets. No... A lot of the scenes looked although they had been filmed on a sound stage, whose sets were not particularly impressive. Now and again CGI shots depicted `Old London Town' in all its computerized glory. The directors used shoddy effects for the flashbacks and the premonitions. Time-lapse was used unnecessarily.Sound effects during the murder scenes sounded like someone was dueling with a cutlass, rather than eviscerating someone.  I'm sure my organs wouldn't clink and chink if someone went at them with a knife. I'd suggest a trip to the Modern Classics section in the video store for the Hughes brothers too see how it should be done.If you approach this film expecting something other than an average teen slasher movie set in the Victorian era, I think you will be disappointed. I know I was.Cor Blimey Guvnor, stone the crows!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
From Hell - where the script came from?,"Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's brilliant graphic novel 'From Hell' is one of the most original and intelligent works of fiction in recent years, and something I cannot recommend highly enough. Please don't let this useless film adaptation put you off the superb original. 'From Hell' the movie is simply awful. The basic thing which sinks it from the outset is a lousy, illogical script that seems to totally miss everything that made Moore's work so enthralling. All the original and thought provoking elements are thrown out, and the bare bones of the plot are recast as a tired, cliched murder mystery, which holds no surprises or suspense, and which, let's face it was done much more convincingly in 'Murder By Decree' back in the 1970s. Johnny Depp is badly miscast as the middle aged Inspector Abberline, his accent is very shaky, and his drug use and clairvoyant visions are bogus and unnecessarily tacked on. The rest of the cast struggles with the poor material. Heather Graham is also a strange casting choice and not very convincing. Robbie Coltrane is reasonable. Ian Holm is well chosen but his character is a major disappointment. And so it goes, on and on. I liked The Hughes brothers underrated 'Dead Presidents', and enjoyed their documentary 'American Pimp'. I think they've got more good movies in them, but this isn't one. No matter how talented they are with a script as bad as this one there's very little that can be done to rescue this misguided and embarrassing project.",,Anonymous,Horror

Victorian gore and splatter,"Well, you can't possibly expect to see a movie from the year 2001 about Jack the Ripper, without sickening scenes.

Most credit goes to the East End environment (filmed in Prague actually). But not just the environment, but also the make-up, the clothing, the mood of this area is to be believed as authentical.But Johnny Depp isn't good. He goes through the whole film with the same expression, even while ""chasing the dragon"" in the opium dens. Better acting comes from Heather Graham and many things have been said about her being too pretty, but that's not important She is believeable and so is definitely Robbie Coltrane as the police sergeant.Two hours don't appear to be too long.

The Grapes of DEATH!,"This isn't the first movie about the notorious late 19th century serial killer Jack The Ripper and it sure as 'hell' won't be the last. ""From Hell"" is, however, the most budgeted one of the bunch and also the first (at least, by my knowledge) that actually attempts severely to reveal the possible identity of Jackie-boy and the motivations behind his gruesome killings. The screenplay for this film was adapted from authentic police reports from that period, and the prostitute-murders are truthful reconstructions, based on original illustrations and drawings. This realism results in a very compelling, powerful and often shocking first half hour. The prostitutes (or ""unfortunate women"" as they are referred to) of the London Whitechapel-quarter are approached by a sophisticated gentleman in a black coach, who offers them drapes and a tempting amount of money. Shortly after, their murdered bodies are found severely mutilated. They also seem to be missing organs that were removed surgically, which raises the suspicion that the killer might very well be a man of high standing. Police inspector (and full-time opium-addict) Abberline devotedly investigates the case and stumbles on eminent organizations that surely don't want to be linked with the murders. Director-duo Albert and Allen Hughes somewhat lose their grip on the complex story after the third murder and the film's climax is sorely disappointing. The most fascinating thing about the entire production unquestionably is the breathtaking Victorian setting! The London of 1888 is terrifically illustrated, with its foggy streets; corrupt police system and enormous differences in social class. Much more than a horror portrait, ""From Hell"" is a raw ghetto-drama about survival! This isn't surprising, since the directors previously made the minor classics ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"" that are all about social conflicts. Johnny Depp is terrific as usual, Heather Graham makes your heart melt and the supportive cast exists of multi-talented British actors such as Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Jason Flemying (Snatch) and Robbie Coltrane (Mona Lisa).

Excellent film drawing on both fact and popular fiction about Jack the Ripper,"As an avid readers of Jack the Ripper history, to say that both my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised by this film is putting mildly.The film cleverly combines both the facts about Jack the Ripper and the popular fiction that now makes up the staple Jack history.The acting is great, the cast is brilliant, Ian Holme and Jonny Depp are superb. The sets are dark and atmospheric, some of the cinematography is stunning.We watched this with my husband, not a Jack historian who had been put off by the title but he enjoyed the film as much as we did.So the moral of this review - Don't let the title put you off, it is not a horror movie more of a period detective/drama, well worth taking the time to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hollywood treatment of the Ripper murders.,"Johnny Depp plays an Inspector Abberline who is assigned to investigate the murders in Whitechapel attributed to Jack the Ripper.  The film follows the theory explored in an earlier film, ""Murder by Decree"" (1979), that the Ripper murders were really the act of a mad palace surgeon who was killing the witnesses to a scandal involving Prince Edward.I can't think of a more unlikely pair of actors to portray Victorian Londoners than Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.  No matter how they tried to cover it up with elaborate costuming and bad accents, I kept seeing a surfer dude and a valley girl on the screen.  Depp is a pretty decent actor but he was just wrong for this role.The supporting cast is pretty good.  Ian Holm is particularly good as Sir William Gull, the mad surgeon who goes about disemboweling the young women. Ian Richardson has a prominent role as Depp's boss, but the script doesn't give him much leeway to act.The production values are slick, and the director went to great lengths to make the sets look authentic, but the film lacked any inner conviction. ""Murder by Decree"" made more of a social commentary about the perversity of the royal family and the social structure of Britain at the end of the 19th century.  Here, sensationalism seems to be the dominant theme.Maybe if the movie had been directed by somebody besides the Hughes Brothers it could have been more complex.  They should stick to hip hop culture.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

How would you all react to a movie about Jeffrey Dahmer with this sort of Hollywood-ised romanticism attached?All I can point to in this movie is the six buxom prostitutes washing themselves in the crystal clear waters of a horse's trough, standing around exchanging pleasantries like characters from a L'Oreal advert.  Perfect, lustrous, flowing hair, clean complexions, great teeth, a touch of makeup in the right places.  Oh, OK, not 6 stone, starving, filthy and battered.  My mistake.The Americans' accents are abysmal. The quotations from Shakespeare are an embarrassment. The Freemason malarky is all more frat party than Victorian England. The ending is a travesty so obscene that it beggars belief.The only consolation in the movie is bravura performances - with nothing to work with - from Holm, Richardson, Coltrane and MacNiece.I echo the sentiments of a previous comment - I hope the ghosts of history catch up with the Hughes Brothers some day, I really do.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Holds Up Pretty Dang Good, 20ish Years Later","No spoilers here
(wish reviewers would check the spoiler box when submitting)
For a 20ish year old movie, I was pleasantly entertained.The cinematography is STILL very good. Interesting camera angles and uses. The direction was very focused. The score, at times, seemed to over power a few scenes.The actors were all sublime, although the character of Mary, seemed a bit forced.I understand that this was adapted from a graphic novel, in which I've never read, so I had no expectations or comparison.The costumes were appropriate but too Hollywoodized in the case of poor working girls.The setting, was perhaps a bit dated but nothing majorly distracting.

The make up and hair (and teeth) seems to be the most dated part of the movie, and has not stood the test of time as well as the rest of the film.Yet despite these minor issues, this film holds up well for it's age, and compared to much of the industries fluff and stuff that's been out the last 10-20 years....

Some curious shots of the UGLE's Masonic Temple, and an very resumed Initiation on the York(Emulation) Rite. The mysteries involved The Ripper's crimes were, of course, linked on freemasonry matters, only because of the equal 'discreption' of the noble fraternity, but, otherwise, the disposition of corpses, in the sequence of killings indeed makes a pentacle star. An accurate detail that Mr. Moore and the screenwriters had kept intact of the original crime scenes. Let us remember that the Whitechapel District were, at the late 19th century, crowded of British Caballah students, for the Jewish neighborhood and for any occultist, or even for a free mason, or Rosicrucian, a Pentacle Star IS truly a symbol of the man in evolutionary ascendant state, and, the same star, in reverse, the 'Baphomet', or 'Sophia'(greek word for Wisdom), in ATBACH system of Hebrew language conversion, makes the analogue image of the 'Goat of Mendes', or, the Devil, in symbolic compilation.

Moody horror that covers the holes in it's plot with a great atmos-fear,"In 1888, Inspector Abberline investigates the case of `Jack the Ripper', who is murdering his through a group of poor whores on London's streets.  As he grows close to one of the prostitutes, he also begins to detect a conspiracy that is higher than he suspected.Adapted from the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell comic this is a dark little horror movie.  The story opens and closes with Abberline in an opium den (draw your assumptions from that) and follows his investigation into the murders of several whores.  The story uncovers a conspiracy that involves police, special branch, masons, surgeons and perhaps royalty.  The middle section is the one you need to be focused during - at one time there are quite a few possibilities bouncing around and you need to concentrate. However in the latter stages the story is clearer as the Ripper is revealed - although his portrayal as a psycho and an intelligent controlled man don't sit well together.Story aside the film's strength is in it's direction, it's sets, costume and total sense of place and mood.  The sets are excellent and 19th century London is well recreated.  The mood brought to the streets at night also deserves praise, the camera moves around shadowy streets - however it does it without cheap `jump out of shadows' teen-slasher style tricks, here it is more a sense of fear than a series of sudden shocks.  The directors bring plenty of fresh tricks to the story - plenty of imaginative scenes (including one where a victim lies still while the action around her body speeds up to get to the morning), and there are plenty of quick cuts and edits to make us create our own horror.  The creation of unseen horror is well done by the sound effects - there are plenty of blade noises, cutting of skin etc - you don't see it onscreen, but you can't help but see it.The film most horrible idea is of London ruled by a cold Queen who only sees poor subjects as things or material to be worked with.  This idea is played through the elite - the masons are happy to do anything to achieve their aims, experimental surgery is played out in front of audiences and the disfigured are not seen as people.  This concept, added to the excellent mood and direction make up for the weaknesses in the plot and the occasional bad performance.Depp is good as Abberline - a stronger willed man that his Sleepy Hollow character, and manages to do a good accent for most of the film.  Heather Graham is not as good - she's too pretty to be one of the whores and her accent wavers regularly between London and LA.  She is good for most of her scenes, but her scenes with the rest of her whores seem overdone by all the ladies.  The group of women all seem to be saying their dialogue extra loud and with extra accent - I can't really describe it but they don't feel natural.  The rest of the cast are filled out with excellent Brits - Holm, Richardson, Rhys and a small role for a well known face in Lock, Stock's Jason Flemyng as coach driver Netley.Overall this is good - the fear is instilled through sound, mood and shadows.  The final 15 minutes feels like it reverts to a standard thriller with a standard mad bad guy, and the end may be a little too happy - but just remember it opens AND closes with Abberline off on opium (get it?).",,Anonymous,Horror

The Hughes brothers take a mediocre stab at reviving one of the most horrifying murder investigations of all time.,"Known for creating effective dramatizations of violence in urban culture, the talent of these two brothers is lost in 19th century London. Even though From Hell misses the mark, you have to give them credit for trying. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, this movie is a speculated story about the cryptic tale in 1888 East London surrounding the aristocracy, a madman named Jack the Ripper, and five unknowing whores who all share a deadly secret.Within the Whitechappel district of London (an exceptional facsimile built just outside of Prague), a murderer is on the loose. Set out to capture this mysterious villain is Inspector Frederick Abbeline (Johnny Depp). We first meet Abbeline as he wakes from an opium trip, a frequent substance used by this character to thwart his clairvoyant visions. Abbeline can see the murders before they happen. Thus, he is the one man to find the killer. The story focuses on Abbeline and a group of whores who are the primary targets of the grotesque human-carving rampage. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the whores, slowly befriends Abbeline as she becomes terribly frightened for her life. Abbeline discovers that these murders are so precisely executed that only a man with great knowledge of the human anatomy can be responsible. This is when he meets Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician of the royal family, who assists Abbeline in piecing together the puzzle. Screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias do a terrific job of hiding the man in the shadow's identity until the last minutes of the film.If your stomach could withstand the gore in Hannibal, you'll have no problem with this movie. It makes you wonder where the boundaries are nowadays for cinema as far as what is appropriate to show on screen and what crosses the line. It is much more effective if you leave certain things to the imagination instead of forcing your viewers to cover their eyes at every corner. Bloody effects are a bad excuse to further the plot; it's unessential; not even needed. The love relationship between Graham's Mary and Depp's Abbeline is an undeveloped side story that gets lost in the cobblestones of London. Yet again, it does nothing to further the plot and strips the story of its momentum, catering to Hollywood's unnecessary must-find-romance-somewhere agenda. Heather Graham as a wench is so unconvincing that it is sad to see the poor girl attempt to spit out an accent. Compared to the other whores in Mary's group of friends with missing teeth and bad complexion, dirt seems to easily avoid Mary and dental hygiene must be on the top of her priority list. A box of red hair dye and a Victorian corset cannot save Graham from being poorly cast in a role too far over her head. Depp, with his piercing eyes and oozing sensuality does a fine job with his character but even he can't save this movie from hell.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A beautiful piece of cinematographic work,"From Hell is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie.Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting.

It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good).

A story of Victorian London told without empathy,"Unfortunately I found this film a real chore to watch. Perhaps the directors, coming from Detroit, do not have enough connection with England and have not recognised this and obtained the assistance they need, but their portrayal of Victorian London is very much a cliché. The outside scenes look studio bound, with the sky always blood red, not at all typical of England's Gray skies. In one scene a drunk is dragged across the ground, drawing attention to the ground being far too clean to be realistic. In one scene there is a break-in, with a hand reaching in through a window to open a highly polished brass lock. So much for the image of Victorian London as a dirty place where the population is more interested in drinking, prostitutes and other vices than in good housekeeping! There are a large number of identical characters - stunning looking prostitutes in bright dresses often giving an articulate discourse on how hard done by they are, and evil men in sober suits slashing them in dark alleyways. The film is shot from a 21st century liberal perspective, not with the values of the time.It is a few weeks since I watched this movie and I cannot say that I recollect the plot.

Visually a great movie but the storytelling is lacking.,"This is a beautiful movie to look at.

The story is brought a bit too vaguely and not everything seems always to make sense. Basically the fact that Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has psychic abilities in the movie is pointless and never ever really serves a purpose. Yes, it does provide the movie with some visual nice looking weird scene's but it doesn't really add anything to the story. The story itself of Jack The Ripper is quite tense and mysterious but this movie never truly becomes tense.The movie gives a pretty good view of 1888 London and has some excellent looking sets and uses perfect lighting for the scene's, to create the right atmosphere.The cast is well filled with some impressive names. Having Johnny Depp in a movie is never a bad thing and the other most important characters are played by the other well known actors; Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm.If you like eye candy this is a perfect movie for you to watch. If you like a tense mysterious crime movie this is probably not the best movie for you to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
??????,"No No No.....what have the Hughes Brothers done to this factual historical story, it`s awful....there are so many bad points, l think it is dreadful that a story like this can maline people so much...The good points...the atmosphere was good, the sets were good, the acting (apart from Johnny Depp-mind you his accent was superb)...The BAD points...(l have studied the Ripper Case-this is the known truth)Fred Aberline was not a drug addict, he did like his drink though... Fred Aberline was not a psychic...Rober Lees was the Queens Medium and had dreams that he imparted that information to Fred Aberline... Fred Aberline did not fall in love with a prostitute...(this was a silly side of the film) Johnny Depp was totally the wrong age...Fred Aberline was an much older person....Johnny Depps age in this film would mean that he would not be in such a high position...I think it is completely wrong from directors/writers to take some factual character and bend it to their way just to make money, my advice to anyone wanting to watch a good film about Jack the Ripper should see Michael Caine in ""Jack the Ripper"" or Chris Plummer in ""Murder by Decree""My mark out of 10....3",,Anonymous,Horror
who is Jack the Ripper,"i've always been fascinated by jack the ripper ever since i was a kid whether it was movies or TV programs about him. the story takes place in London 1888, where Jack is slaying prostitutes in a wealthy area of London. there has always been a great mystery as to who is jack the ripper was it someone connected to the prince for his indiscretions, was it a commoner,, or a laborer, tradesmen,, maybe a doctor,, well i'll guess we'll never know. Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Aberline trying to figure out just who is Jack the Ripper,, although it is a fairly decent tale, the movie yet seems to be so convoluted with needless scenes , sometimes i didn't know which way to turn, there should have been a few scenes taken out cause they really didn't need to be there in the first place. i think maybe Depp was a little over his head on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gory and not very believable,"If you don't care for gore then you probably won't like this movie. What happened to the days when they could make a scary movie without making you want to throw up?

FROM HELL,"First of all, it is worth mentioning the skillfully written original source in the form of a graphic novel, which served as the basis for the drama of the film in question. The creators of the picture should thank all the persons involved in the writing of the graphic novel, depicting an unusually charming and horrible story of brutal murders, further complicated investigations and secret semi-mystical conspiracies. All this, not without changes, and with varying success, was transferred to the screen, people, as can be assumed after watching the film, interested not only in the practical success of their work, but also in the artistic value of their work.
All the gestures in the film, as if the gestures of heroes or gestures expressed by filmmakers in the methods of visualization of the story, are extremely conditional, but they are filled with magnificent elegance of visual media, the stylistic solution of which brightly reflects the genre of the picture and the gloomy tone of the history as a whole.
Nevertheless, not all the scenes and dialogues in the film are able to retain the necessary attention, because of the obvious, purely informational nature of such moments, which represent a form of necessary evil, in the form of mandatory points for the further development of the dramaturgical component of the unfolding events, in this sad history, without which the already fragile integrity of the line of the plot, runs the risk of inevitably falling apart.
Separately, I would like to note the inspiring charisma of the Sergeant, whose interaction with the main character, performed in a restrained ironic manner, deservedly draws attention to himself, but, importantly, does not pull him over, but only complements the image of the latter and, in all senses, helps him.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Though a bit gruesome it was still an excellent film.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Though it was a tad gruesome for my taste the cinematography itself made up for it. I loved the cast. I'm always amused when you can take actors who have played characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow, Bilbo Baggins, Hagrid, and the older daughter from Lost in Space and create an excellent thriller. I would call it a thriller and not a horror. To me a thriller will always be a horror with a plot. From Hell had a good plot that kept you intrigued and guessing the whole way through. Of course the fact that Johnny Depp is one of the most attractive men on earth always helps bump the ratings. This movie is great to watch with a group of friends.

The whole theory exposed here about the identity of Jack the ripper is fascinating and all. But I can't help asking myself what on earth Heather Graham was doing in this film?

It was brutal for women who were forced to become prostitutes just to live if they were on their own, there were no other jobs for them.

"Um, a nice victorian horror film","First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I didn't really liked it and I didn't had high expectations about it, but I decided to watch it because the concept of the movie was very interesting. Eventually, it was better than I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The movie synopsis was very interesting and mysterious, but it wasn't innovative because there are many movies similar to this one about Jack the ripper. The storyline was kinda well-written, but it wasn't well-explained (especially, the last 20 minutes). Regarding the characters, they weren't interesting, nor well-developed. The filming location of the movie was only one, England in 1800's and the 19th century was very well portrayed (especially, the outfits and the whole vibe of the movie). The casting choices were nice and their performances were descent. The killcount of the movie was very bloody, brutal and gory, even though the first three death scenes were done off-screen (only the aftermath was shown). At least, it was an intense movie, even though there weren't any chase scenes before the victim's death. In my opinion, the first 30 minutes was probably the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, the 3rd act wasn't well-explained and it was kinda complicated. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done. Last but not least, it wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares. Overall, ""From Hell"" was a nice horror film, intense, bloody, dark and I would probably recommend it to my friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This has been the best movie I've seen in ages! *it might somehow contain spoilers*,"I think all of the actors did extremely well in this movie and that it was perfectly cast. In fact,this movie was almost perfect. If I state why it was ALMOST perfect,the site owners will discount my comment. So go watch the movie and find out what rips it away from utter perfection. I bet you'll know why by the end of it. I'd recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach and and a fancy for Johnny Depp. Personally, that's the only movie type I can truly get into. They keep you guessing until the very end, so even during boring parts of those movies, you're still tightly clasping your chair, wondering in suspense what's going to happen next.

Very well-done but...,"... First of all I think it is a film that in maybe 20 or 30 years it will not be forgotten. It has a very scary style and I am very impressed that the Hughes Brother made this film. They have before made films like Dead Presidents(Which I haven't seen) and Menace to Society(Which is actually good). The acting was originally why I saw this film, I like Johnny Depp very much and he is very good in this one. I mostly see him in this pretty strange roles and he does them very well. Heather Graham was not bad either but nothing special at all.It is a very entertaining film even if I thought the story was a bit complicated and everything was not perfect.

Merchant Ivory Could Have Done It Better,"A major disappointment for viewers anticipating a taut, suspenseful historical mystery. Nothing in this film comes remotely close to evoking a sense of period or place. It's settings have all the atmosphere of a back lot in Burbank.

I think this is why the film is receiving praise.  As far as the story goes, it's somewhat bland and extremely graphic.  The film was hard to enjoy because it was so dark and gory, and some of the death scenes were quite brutal.  I heard numerous gasps of displeasure in my theatre.

From Hell (2001),"Directed by Albert Hughes & Allen Hughes. Starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, Annabelle Apsion, Samantha Spiro, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Ian McNiece, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Skornik, Joanna Page. (R)Dull, dreary variation on Jack the Ripper's Victorian-era murder spree, with Depp playing an inspector on the case who gets clairvoyant visions in opium dreams (and that's not even the silliest thing going on here). He comes to the aid of Graham (hysterically miscast as a supposedly bedraggled Whitechapel street prostitute) amid a series of gruesome murders while uncovering a bizarre conspiracy involving shadowy, privileged circles of power--anything else the filmmakers wanted to nick from Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow""? Depp seems listless enough for the audience to assume he was ingesting real opium while performing, and his sentimental romance with Graham is all the more creaky and unconvincing surrounded by the grim, Gothic trappings. Said scenery and atmosphere are among the film's few virtues, though the directors can't even get that quite right, as their showy, stylized touches don't embellish mood so much as befuddle motivation. Hardly a thrill in sight, all the way to the anti-climactic, unsatisfying conclusion; call it a penny dreadful lacking the lurid entertainment value. Based on a graphic novel of the same name.33/100",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
From Hollywood,"An account of the Jack the Ripper case of 1888, ""From Hell"" is not a credible film for true crime buffs. The film's script contains too many major inaccuracies, and its conclusions are preposterous. Aside from false presentation of various real people, including Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), the film proceeds to ""solve"" the case with a solution that has been discredited for decades. Indeed, among serious ""ripperologists"", there still is no consensus on who Jack the Ripper was. A recently published book lists no fewer than 27 possible suspects, the surnames of which include: Druitt, Ostrog, Chapman, Cohen, Sickert, Gibson, Dodgson, Deeming, Thompson, and Williams.As a fictional whodunit, with suitable red herrings, the film offers a little more, but it still contains problems. Characters are not adequately defined by name early on. The Abberline / Sergeant Godley relationship is a formulaic continuation of the Holmes / Watson relationship. And the film identifies the killer too soon; after which, the plot trends anticlimactic.This film can be described most accurately as a fictional period piece thriller, with an emphasis on the lives of poor London prostitutes, known as ""unfortunates"", a social class counterpoint to the rich and privileged. In this context the story's theme would pertain to the inherent hypocrisy of the rich, amid strict, 19th century Victorian values.Visually, the film looks good, as we would expect for a big-budget Hollywood production. Sets and period costumes seem realistic. Highly saturated colors convey a dingy, sooty London, again probably accurate. But ambient sounds are unrealistic. And the background music is horrible. Not only is it too loud and manipulative, it's too synthesized and modern. It's the kind of music we would expect in some modern dark zombie movie. Casting is acceptable. Robbie Coltrane gives a fine performance as Sergeant Godley. But Depp seems bored.Melodramatic in tone, ""From Hell"" offers viewers an interesting, and reasonably accurate, interpretation of prostitutes and their environment in London's Whitechapel district of the late 19th century. But as a viable, authoritative account of Jack the Ripper and his crimes, the film, typical of Hollywood, cannot be taken seriously.",,Anonymous,Horror
Ripping his way into the pages of history,"(There are Spoilers)The film ""From Hell"" is not as far out as you may have at first thought in who the infamous ""Jack the Ripper"" really was. As Scotland Yard Inspector Fredrick Abberline, Johnny Depp, at first suspected the ""Ripper"" was not just your garden verity psycho killer but a man highly educated in both medicine and the human anatomy: A highly trained and respected doctor surgeon! It's this theory alone that's to eventually lead Inspector Abberline straight to the very base of power of the mighty 19th Century British Empire! Queen Victoria's, Liz Moscrop, Buckingham Palace!High on opium, that was legal at the time, Inspector Abberline could sense things as a police detective that his fellow members of Scotland Yard couldn't. It was that extrasensory perception on Abberline's part that had him see the real reasons for the notorious ""Ripper"" murders. It was also his addiction to opium that in the end did Abberline in before he could brake the ""Ripper"" case wide open.Classic Gothic Horror movie that takes a number of real historical as well as mysterious incidents, the ""Jack the Ripper murders"", and makes some sense of them. We do get to see,like Inspector Abberline, the real clues to the ""Ripper"" identity and, which are far more important, who he was actually working for. The ""Ripper"", in what the movie brought out, was not an ordinary killer emigrant and illiterate, in the English language, Jew from Czarist Russia or even an escaped lunatic from a mental institution. He was a very highly educated man who did his ghastly job of murder and dismemberment with a skill that would have taken years of practice at a major big city medical facility to achieve!Starting out with a blood-red sunset over the city of London's-circa 1888-crime ridden Whitechapel and Kensington Districts the film ""From Hell"" accurately chronicles the murderous ""Jack the Ripper"" rampage that terrorized London that fateful late summer and fall of 1888. We get to see how the ""Ripper's"" murder of local prostitutes was not an act of murderous insanity but a well thought out plan, by those who controlled him, to rid any evidence connecting his victims, or one of them, to the British Royal Family.***SPOILERS*** In the end it was Inspector Abberline's bulldog-like determination that turned his superior at Scotland Yard Sir. Charles Warner, Ian Richardson, against him. Not that Abberline wasn't doing his job but, in exposing the reasons for the ""Ripper"" killing, doing it far too well then he, and the power behind the British Throne, would have liked him to! Even though Mary Kelly, Heather Graham, is shown at the end of the film to have survived ""Jack the Ripper's"" reign of terror she in fact was, as we saw earlier, the ""Ripper's"" last and most shockingly dismembered murder victim! I couldn't figure out what the movie was trying to tell us in showing Mary back and alive and well in her native Ireland unless it was her soul not body who we were supposed to be seeing?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't know what it's trying to do...,"From Hell has its moments as a movie. However, it is also an opportunity lost because people wanted to take a safe option instead of the one that was offered to them.The plot revolves around Fred Abberline ( Johnny Depp ), a London investigator who is on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he leaves a trail of mutilated bodies through the Whitechapel district of London. High up on his list seems to be a group of prostitutes- one of which is Mary Kelly ( Heather Graham )- who confides in Abberline in the hope that the Ripper case may be solved. However, soon, both the inspector and Kelly, along with the trusty sergeant ( Robbie Coltrane ), see that the trail may lead to echelons of society far higher than they could possibly imagine.This, in itself, does seem like a good plot for a movie. However there are a couple of big problems that stop it from working. One is that Abberline has 'visions' when under the influence of opium which seem to be a half-baked excuse by the Hughes Brothers to show London in a different light and it doesn't really work. This compounds the second problem, which is that there is no real mystery element to the plot, instead he comes up with a vision which helps him figure it out.The performances are varied with Depp good as Abberline and Graham average as Kelly but it is the English supporting cast of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson as his police chief and most strongly, Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, which makes the atmosphere come alive. To add to that is an amazingly dark score and a great set in Prague which makes Victorian London seem as real and malevolent as ever.From Hell is a sort of a halfway house between a brilliant Alan Moore graphic novel which portrayed things from the view of Jack the Ripper and a straight out period murder mystery and it's this compromise that sees it fail. One wonders if the plot was changed just so they could get someone like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham into the star credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Ripper,"Jack the Ripper is a perfect story for a film, and the result is quite creepy. Actually a little too creepy. There is some gore and a few really disturbing scenes in this film and it gets a little speculative. I have no idea what the Elephant Man had a cameo for. It seems as The Hughes Brothers are more interested in shocking the audience than to stick to the story.This is only a theory of who The Ripper was, as no one really knows. The film is very stylish, painting 19th Century London blood red. Johnny Depp is solid with his usual melancholy.   From Hell is a very good thriller but it could have been stripped down a little, actually adding to the chilliness. Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best thriller I've seen in long time,"Set in 1988 in whitechappel, London, this film follows the story of Jack the Ripper, and the detective that is assigned to the case, inspector Albiline (johnny Depp). The whole film is incredibly stylistic, using a mix of filming techniques, including dreams, hallucinations and the more common types. The sound track is great, and the plot is good and easy to understand, even a child could understand this film! The length is fine, some think it is too long but if it had been shorter then they would have had to miss stuff out, which is what can spoil a good film (think Harry potter).This film is shot in a similar style to Baz Luhrmann's moulin rouge, its is full of color, with great detail given to the style and color of each scene. The only think that really lets this film down is the end credits, they are done in a style that makes a film look dated even 4 years after it is made. The actors try their best, depp is great, as is Coltrane, who plays depps sidekick. Heather Graham is average, but the accent isn't fooling anyone! A great film with a great twist, a lovely insight into Victorian London, whilst the style it was shot in will keep film students going for years! Definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
From Hell,"Johnny Depp (or, at least the clairvoyant, haunted and troubled Inspector Frederick Abberline) gets his shot at solving the Jack the Ripper killings.What a fantastic and moody piece of filmmaking. Whitechapel in London in 1899 has never looked dirtier, seedier or more dangerous. No punches are pulled in what is a graphically violent movie, but it was, by all accounts, a violent time. Whoever was in charge of sets and costumes has earned their money and then some.Aside from Depp (who, once again, was fantastic, aside from his somewhat sketchy accent), Heather Graham and Robbie Coltrane have major roles in a film most definitely not for the squeamish.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Busy and Distracted, From Hell Tries Too Much and Accomplishes Too Little","Coal-soaked skies and grime-caked slums serve as backdrop to this dark, grisly nineteenth century chase; Johnny Depp, unconventional police detective, in tireless pursuit of Jack the Ripper through Victorian London's back alleys. Frolicking in filth, From Hell takes delight in sharing as much century-old depravity as it can dream up. Unkempt taverns, dimly-lit opium dens, malevolent secret societies, illicit after-hours transactions, morally-dubious medical experiments... we're constantly drenched in dirty material. Which sets quite a mood, fitting for the proximity of one so notorious as Jack, but also straps the viewer with a heavily crowded plot. There's just too much going on, too many surface-scratched subplots that don't amount to much of anything, while the hook (oh yes, we're hunting a faceless mass-murderer) gets bogged down and overlooked, kicked like a tin can down the road.Depp's role is rather reserved by his usual standards: a hazy, somnambulant drug addict who desperately lopes from one bloody crime scene to the next. While our detective trips, in a series of tonally discordant hallucination scenes that smack of late '90s film trends, he catches foggy premonitions that prod him toward his next big break. It's all rather silly, really, a shoehorned mystical slant that is (somewhat ironically) addressed, scoffed at and discarded in Alan Moore's phone book-sized original graphic novel.There's something good buried here, between the accurate reproduction of essential locales and the eternally-intriguing subject matter, but it's ultimately left unearthed. The extra-slow second act nearly put me down and out, and I don't think I'd have missed anything if it had.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great film......excellent acting, one for your home library!","Great film, excellent acting, one for your home library -- one of Johnny Depp's best performances.

Murder scenes as purportedly committed by The Ripper were somewhat gruesome, but after all, isn't that what happened? Still, I would follow the age limit rating due to scenes of violence and some of sexual connotation as well as drug use. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the clairvoyant/police inspector/opium addict was well-played and convincing. Supporting cast, (especially actress who portrayed Mary Kelly) was also well-chosen.

A disappointment,"To the defense of the makers of the movie 'From Hell' it must be said, that no one could have followed the material written by Alan Moore to the graphical novel drawn by Eddie Campbell: there just is too much plot for a single movie. If by the other hand they would have decided to make a TV-series out of the novel, the result would have been entirely different.The most constructive difference between the graphical novel and the movie is, that the novel is about Jack The Ripper: who he is and why he does what he does. The movie is a film about Abberline and his personality and his mission to stop the monster. And some fool decided to add these mystical foresight abilities to Abberline, who in fact was described as rather normal fellow in the novel.Jhonny Depp plays the part of Abberline, and that was a bit disappointment for all, who actually have read the novel, as Abberline is no where near Depp's appearance: he's shorter and more rounder. Best role of the film is given to Ian Holm, who play Dr. Sir William Gull, the official doctor of the royal family. The rest of the cast is good, tough I question of the cast of the prostitutes, or does Heather Graham really strike anyone as 19'th century harlot?From some reason or another all movies based on Alan Moore's brilliant writing fail to capture the essence and the spirit of his works. The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was same kind of disappointment from the same reason. Moore's characterisations are far too bold for typical Hollywood films. They will always fail to portray them right.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Neverending Story,"I guess we'll continue to get ever more implausible solutions to the mystery of Jack the Ripper. We don't seem to be getting any about Dr. Palmer, but Jack soldiers on. Maybe it's the name -- ""Jack the Ripper,"" or his location, ""from hell."" It must also be the sex and the gore. Here's a guy slicing and dicing, and poisoning isn't a patch on butchery. It's probably also because, after all, the crimes were never explained. And the human mind has a tendency to recall uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. (In psychology it's called somewhat grandly, ""the Zeigarnik effect."") Anyway, if we don't know the real answer, then ANY answer can be proffered.This one's fairly routine in its general outline -- something to do with syphilis and marriage beneath one's station among the Royals -- but to tell the truth, I got some of the characters a little mixed up. The hookers, for instance, were hard to tell apart except for Mary Kelly (Graham) with her mane of gloriously curly Irish red hair. The others didn't seem well differentiated, possibly because so much of the movie takes place in the dark.The elaborate set that represents Whitechapel in 1888 was built on the outskirts of Prague. The art direction is quite good, as far as a viewer can tell, but again, the sets might have been half as well done without most people realizing it because the shooting doesn't give us much in the way of grand sweep. There isn't enough fog, either. Or -- let's call a spade a spade -- not enough industrial smoke because that's what it was. I wish the director had taken more care to give us a sense of place. The murder scenes, including the positions of the bodies, are accurately reconstructed, but -- well, take for instance victim number three, I think it was, the one who died in the back yard of a scruffy tenement, positioned next to a fence made of boards. This barren tiny yard was reached through a passageway that ran under a crummy building. Several windows opened onto that back yard. A door led from the tenement to the outhouse at the yard's far end. (I feel I know this place well because it's the stuff my nightmares are made of, and it's always tinted a dull orange for some reason.) But none of this dismal atmosphere is brought on screen. We aren't prompted to wonder why none of the windows were opened by the tenants, or why there were no screams heard, or why on earth the Ripper would entice his victim to stand against a fence that anyone wanting to visit the loo would have to walk past.Part of the popular appeal of Jack the Ripper goes beyond the homicidal maniac and his victims. It includes all of Victorian London as well, especially the East End, its delapidated brick buildings, its toxic air, its blurry streetlights, its rain, its gin-soaked whores, its ordinary pedestrians, its entire physicality, its eidos as well as its ethos. And that's what's missing. Most of the scenes are shot from middle distance, and a lot of the circumstances are lost for this reason. The setting isn't really SCARY enough.As if to compensate for this, there are many cuts to dripping blood, scintillating knife blades, and gurgling cut throats. There are several blazing frames of women screaming. And when a knife is shown you can be sure there is the ""slinkkk"" of blade against blade even when there is no other knife in sight. (What a cliché.) Inspector Aberlinne's use of opium and booze gives the director and editor a chance for yet more confusing fuzzy quick shots of events which may or may not have happened, be happening, or will happen. There is quite a bit of blood on screen without the murders being all that graphic. The producers didn't seem to mind the blood but they insisted that the horse manure be cleared from the cobblestone streets so the family audience wouldn't be offended. Note: you can show throats being cut, but you can't show horse s**t.While we're at it, the movie is based on what is now called a ""graphic novel"" but which we used to call comic books. (Actually, it was ""funny books"" where I grew up.) When ""The Man Who Would Be King"" was released thirty years ago, it was accompanied by the release of a ""novelization"" of the film -- as if the original story by Kipling were too demanding. I thought that was pretty insulting. Now, with dozens of books in print on Jack the Ripper, we have a movie for adults based on a comic book. The speech balloons are limited to a few words in each panel. Sometimes just one word -- a shriek or imprecation. A generation ago it seemed that a story by Kipling might be too demanding. Now it's prose itself that is endangered. And I can see the logic behind the trend. Why demand more effort of the consumer than he is prepared to offer? Why ask him, for instance, to walk a few blocks to a store when he can harness the three thousand horsepower engine in his SUV and DRIVE back and forth? Why ask him to learn that the expression ""a lot"" consists of two words, an indefinite article and a common noun, instead of just one word, ""alot""?

Unexpectedly cerebral,"A novel twist on the story of Jack the Ripper (if you haven't read the novel that is) that weaves an intricate explanation that is chillingly convincing.

Conspiracy Theory,"The Hughes brothers have again infused social commentary into their innovative filmmaking. The theme is familiar: The affluent turning a blind eye to the impoverished of 19th century British society echoes much about today's world. Like virtually any period film, ""From Hell"" is intended to reflect something about the present times, demonstrating that no matter how much things change, history repeats itself in different forms.""From Hell"" deals with social issues in its own way. Normally I'd say that art peddled as entertainment should stay off the soapbox unless it's prepared to be serious. ""From Hell"" tries to do both and misses most of the time. Still, it's a decent thriller/murder mystery with a definite horror film structure, but still passes as a historical piece.The script is where the film runs into its biggest problems.  Foremost of them is that it may take itself too seriously. The slayings are certainly nothing to chuckle about, but some humor would have provided some much-needed balance. They could easily have sacrificed the love story between Abberline (Johnny Depp) and Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), which never finds its feet.Even in the late 19th century, these ritual killings seemed ancient; they were hideous and barbaric, like something out of some long forgotten age, committed by someone whose state of mind should not still exist in a modern society. The killer's savagery woke people up to the enduring possibility of such acts, just when civilization really started to seem civil.""From Hell"" takes liberties with the truth, following closely to the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. It stays faithful to the details of the murders, based on the actual police and coroner's reports. Mary Kelly's post-mortem for instance, is re-enacted verbatim by the examiner. Kelly's murder was the last and by far the most gruesome. Little is actually shown but it's true that your imagination can come up with far worse images than a make-up effects person can.No one ever figured out for certain who the Ripper was, which affords comic book artists and filmmakers the opportunity to romanticize the character for profit--here done at the expense of the royal family (always an easy target) and the freemasons. But at least these artists offer a reasonable, original revelation of the Ripper's identity that just happens to make good cinema.Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A Satisfying Consideration of the ""Ripper"" Case","The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than `From Hell,' directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed `unsolvable.'  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results.Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the `girls,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard. But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery. It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a `fable-noir.'Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow.'  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in `Hollow.'  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a `lady of the night.'  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story.Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, `Harry Potter's' Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in `Nora,' opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the `Ripper' movies, `From Hell' is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"How long have you been chasing the dragon, Inspector?","There is no shortage of theories on Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders in 188.

"Probably my favorite performance from Johnny Depp,","I just watched this movie a little bit ago and I think I was able to confirm this as my favorite Johnny Depp film. He's always been hit and miss for me. I tend to like him in his more serious roles(Secret Window,Sleepy Hollow,From Hell) and I do have a fondness for Edward Scissorhands. But you can't pay me to try and sit through Benny and Joon or Cry Baby.Mr. Depp really hit the spot for me on this one. I believed in his character who albeit in a constant depressive state, or just plain jacked on opium, he was on his game in his hunt for the legendary Jack the Ripper.But he also had a good supporting cast,however, Ill omit Heather Graham. I don't know, I just didn't think she brought much to the movie and quite frankly I just thought she was just the whore with the most lines. But one of the final scenes took it home just based on sheer acting as Johnny Depp finally confronted who he believed was the madman.The scares are there people and so is the gore so if you want a fine-tuned re-telling of the most famous serial killer known, plus being led by a veteran who can do it all, then go grab the nachos and watch From Hell.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice mixing between history and romance,"Notwithstanding Johnny Depp is one of my favourite actors, I think he might not be the best character for this part. He has not the""physique du role"" for playing an addicted middle age inspector in the 19th century. How could I say, he looks too healthy !! Also Heather Graham is definitively too pretty to play a 19th century street whore. The best thing in this movie is the atmosphere that only a city like Prague can give for a 19th century large city reconstruction. It really looks like you're living for a couple of hours in those days. The mixing between history and romance is very well crafted and acting is quite good.

Apparently written and directed by high schoolers,"Has some of the cleanest and prettiest prostitutes ever found in a movie about 19th century English prostitutes.

Only problem was, it was the wrong accent!  He was playing a police Inspector, but instead of having a middle or upper class accent like his peers, superiors and underlings, Johnny sported a lower-class street accent like the prostitutes had. Both the writing and direction were sophmoric and showed a complete lack of understanding of any of the subject matters.  It was obvious that the filmmakers had paid plenty of attention to other movies set in that time and place, but they had no feel whatsoever for how it might actually have been. The entire movie felt like that - shallow.  When they tried for atmosphere, they got the look, but not the mood. A complete waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Compelling Cinema, but is it art?","The Hughes Brothers version of the Jack The Ripper story is compelling cinema. From the opening credits to the blood red clouds hanging over the city a strong sense of doom prevails and pulls us in.  It's tough to turn away from the screen thanks to the stylized Victorian England look and dark, eerie streets, not to mention the well-known mystery of the Ripper, himself! I own this movie on DVD and have watched it a couple of times, but recently I saw it on Cable and I was still pulled right in.  Is it Johnny Depp's performance that pulls me in? No. Is it the fresh-faced look of Heather Graham as a low-rent prostitute? No. I watch this movie for two reasons: one the story of Jack the Ripper is always intriguing; and two I love the way the Hughes brothers made everything sooooo dark!To begin with, the story is very dark and gruesome so the heavily shadowed scenes, the damp, gloomy, streets, and the dimly lit rooms all add to further the murky ambience of the story.  There are brief moments in some scenes where everything is so black that the viewer has to strain to see and guess what is going on. This isn't cheap film making, this is powerful direction that is seldom attempted in movies today.  While the violence is there, at the same time, it's not there. We see a shiny knife blade, a slash and we hear the rip of the skin and then we see blood, but with the exception of one very visual murder, we don't really see the victims get cut.  The Hughes brothers take a risk with this movie.  In a typical serial killer movie we would see the knife cut into the victim. We would see organs ripped out and limbs chopped off, but this movie leaves much of the actual violence to our imagination.  Don't get me wrong, there's enough blood and gore in this to cause some to lose their lunch.  But truth be known (and the Hughes brothers understand this) the viewer's imagination is usually stronger than any visual that can be put into a scene.   That's the magic of this film.  The Hughes brothers focus on the drama, the conspiracy and the character interaction more than they do the violence of the story.In 1888 Jack the Ripper brutally murdered five prostitutes, but that's only half the story according to this movie.  Many theories have been suggested as to the identity of the Ripper over the years.  The story provides numerous Ripper suspects from a villainous and slimy gang member all the way up to Prince Albert; thus covering most of the typical Ripper candidates that have ever been mentioned.  `From Hell' promotes a theory on the Ripper story that includes the Masons, the Royal family and a police cover up. Overall, we focus more on Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) and a band of prostitutes who appear to be the Ripper's targets than the actual murders themselves.Johnny Depp is a little too handsome and young looking to be the over-worked, (in this movie  opium/laudanum user and clairvoyant) career constable Inspector Abberline.  Though I like Depp as an actor, it seems to me that he typically adds a certain modern feel to his roles (Chocolat and Pirates of the Caribbean are perfect examples of this).   Heather Graham dresses the part of a prostitute, but otherwise, she acts and looks more like a rough and edgy Mary Poppins.  Her stunning red hair is nearly a character in itself.  The romance that blooms in the story is a bit forced, but it does create an interesting-albeit purely fictional-subplot.  The surrounding actors, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, and Ian Richardson are all excellent choices whose presence adds to the style and richness of the film.The Hughes Brothers have shown their style and talent in every film they've made (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp), but this movie takes their abilities to the next level.  From strange camera angles, and the effective use of color that separates the slums from the upper class world, to dreary lighting, and the period costumes and settings the Hughes brothers provide a visual feast for the viewer to devour. While the story, based on the graphic novel `From Hell', is a bit contrived at times, the viewer cannot pull away.  The characters and the fast pacing of the film will keep most viewers from noticing miscast actors and fictionalized events.   Is it art?  No.  Is it good film making. Yes.  This is a movie that should be seen.  Just don't see it alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reminiscent of the Hammer films of the 60's,An enormously entertaining and atmospheric thriller. It reminded me of some of the better products from Hammer films of the late 50's and 60's.

Johnny Depp and Heather Graham do well with British Cockney accents. The movie is entertaining and has a plot or storyline that is literate.I would like to see more movies like this.

Prejudiced,A film which uses a noble world wide Fraternity consisted from the best of men trying to better themselves as a pity-full excuse for some satanic (demonic) plot belongs to the past and not in the 21st century.

"Though slightly sleepy and hollow at times, ""From Hell"" is a slice of movie heaven","You may have noticed that I've played the comparison game a lot in 2001.While it's had its benefits, it's also resulted in my watching of failures such as ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Shrek"" (yes, I considered ""Shrek"" a disappointment), in order to compare them to the likes of the far superior ""Tomb Raider"" (which I wanted to compare to 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"") and ""Chicken Run,"" respectively.It may sound unfair, but at the same time it's led me to watch movies that I originally wouldn't have plunked the money down for in the first place.""From Hell"" is no exception. I first heard of it after reading an article i n a British film magazine, of all places. The plot, characters and setting quickly had me believing that this was going to be ""Sleepy Hollow Redux,"" which is never a bad thing.As with the aforementioned 1999 Tim Burton masterpiece, Johnny Depp plays a Brit-accented police detective who tries to solve a series of grisly murders. Whereas ""Sleepy Hollow"" retells the legend of the Headless Horseman, ""From Hell,"" directed by the Hughes Brothers, does likewise with the legend of Jack The Ripper, who, unfortunately, was never apprehended for his crimes.However, that's where the similarities end.While ""From Hell"" is by no means a letdown, I found that ""Tomb Raider"" had more in common with ""Sleepy Hollow"" than this did, but that's another story. It doesn't mean, though, that it's not entertaining. And yes, it has an engaging plot, though I had to see the film twice to fully get the gist of it.As always, the ever-versatile Depp steals the show. He stars as Fred Abberline, a drug-addicted inspector who sees visions of brutally murdered women in his narcotic-hazed dreams that ultimately come true. One thing leads to another and he is soon saddled with a serial murder case in which a group of gravely down-and-out prostitutes inhabiting London's sleazy, unpleasant Whitechapel District circa 1888 are being murdered one by one by a killer who is bedecked in a top hat and billowing cape and whom the public has nicknamed Jack The Ripper. He then takes his madness a step further and removes his victims' organs postmortem.To put it bluntly, this ain't Mary Poppins, folks. There are no homogenized visions of merry old England to be found here.Heather Graham plays alongside Depp as Mary Kelly, one of the circle of dirt-poor hookers who, while not being slaughtered, are constantly harassed and hounded by a seedy gang  call them Victorian-age pimps, if you will  for whatever small change they can scrounge up.The killer's ""surgeries"" cause Abberline to seek help from Dr. William Gull (Ian Holm), who just happens to be the physician to the royal family (and who has developed a skin-crawling medical treatment known as a `prefrontal lobotomy'). Their partnership ultimately reveals an exciting twist in the plot.Ian Richardson is effective as Abberline's pompous, anti-Semitic superior (he immediately believes a Jew is responsible for the killings), as is Robbie Coltrane as the inspector's sidekick, confidante and sounding board.I'm always in the mood for a good murder mystery film, and ""From Hell"" fits the bill nicely. I liked how little clues were peppered around the crime scenes, ranging from how the hookers' throats were slashed (""The cut goes from left to right; the killer is right handed,"" Dr. Gull surmises early on), to Abberline finding an empty sprig of grapes and detecting the scent of a potent alcoholic drink laced with laudanum on the victims' breaths.Plot and acting aside, the real standout of the film is Martin Childs' production design. The backgrounds and sets are so believable that one would never guess that the film was entirely shot in the Czech Republic, which it indeed was. The cinematography by Peter Deming brings viewers up close and personal to the action; it's almost as if you're part of the movie yourself as the characters stroll through Buckingham Palace or a dark alley. The exterior master shots of London are so beautiful that they look more like paintings borrowed from an art gallery.There are no real negatives about this film; my only gripes were that the scenes involving Dr. Gull's medical procedures and John Merrick (the Elephant Man) served only to shock the audience and did little to advance the plot, and it also seemed rather odd that Jack The Ripper would have a partner in crime (a nervous, bottle-swigging carriage driver played by Jason Flemyng), which, as a result, doesn't make him as imposing as he should have been. The flow of the movie is distracted in the third act when another woman, passed off as a French friend of one of the prostitutes, is suddenly thrown into the pot from out of nowhere for no known reason other than to apparently add to the body count.Yes, the term has become cliché, but ""From Hell"" is definitely not for the faint of heart. While the blood and gore is censored to some extent in the first act, more full-bleed (no pun intended) shots of the carnage are seen as the film progresses, and everything goes whole hog in the ending.What attracted the brothers Hughes to this film was the opportunity to make a period movie about street violence (a genre that hasn't been beaten to death enough already), which is a thin motive in itself. While it's not groundbreaking for the genre by any means - it lacks what made ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Seven"" so spellbinding  it holds its own, though my mother noted that it was like watching ""Murder By Decree"" all over again.All comparisons aside, ""From Hell"" is a nice, if sometimes grisly, little piece of cinematic heaven. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Johnny Depp as a Cockney!,"The rather scarily-titled 'From Hell' is an entertaining piece of Hollywood hokum about Jack the Ripper. Without giving too much away, it offers a new spin on old material (although seasoned 'Ripperologists' will find little to surprise them). Johnny Depp works surprisingly well as cockney detective Inspector Abberline, and the cast is uniformly strong - although some might think that casting Heather Graham as an Irish/Cockney prostitute is pushing credibility a bit! Still, this is an enjoyable romp and there's no need to let realism get in the way of the fun. Frankly a lot of the characters seem to have stepped straight out of 'Oliver', but it hardly seems to matter. That said, the atmosphere is genuinely chilling at times, and it's interestingly filmed in a style reminiscent of comic books (the script was based on a graphic novel).

The movie sells these peoples' suffering to us as entertainment, yet does not even show the respect of caring what really happened.

Women without means or skill. No family, or none with any bit of wealth at least. So in order to survive these women turn to selling themselves on the street.One such unfortunate catches the eye of a man one day. A very important man who takes
her under his wing, and falls for her. They eventually become wed in secret and have a baby together.To the young unfortunate it seems as though she won the lottery in love. To have a wealthy man take care of her and their child. She could never have imagined this for herself. Her unfortunate friends, who stood at her secret wedding as witnesses, couldn't have imagined this life for her either.Yet,, why the secrecy? Who is this important man? Why is he keeping his marriage and fatherhood secret?During this time, murders begin happening on the streets of London. At night. In the darkness of alleys. Being ritualistic in nature, this murderer not only kills these unfortunates,
but he also collects trophies from them
(parts, that is).The Inspector (Depp) in charge of finding this homicidal maniac inspects the deceased bodies, and determines that these deplorable acts must have been committed by either a butcher, hunter,, or an educated man. An educated man with at least a passing knowledge of human anatomy.So, the Inspector continues his investigation, and the more he discovers about these grisly murders, the more he realizes how deep the treachery behind these acts goes.As far as gothic horror/suspense goes, I think this movie is underrated. Not that it would've won academy awardsbor anything,, but imo it's really good. The great casting of Depp, Coltrane, and Holms (not to mention the countless other names idk) really brings the story to life. Graham does more than a fair job at her performance as well (although I can't see her as more than a pretty face with decent acting skills. Not great, but decent), although I would've loved to have seen her part go to someone like Uma Thurman, or Gwyneth Paltrow.So, if you want to watch something gothic/macabre,, this'll certainly do 👍",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frustrating,"Much like The Mothman Prophecies, From Hell is a movie full of promise that it never fulfills. The basic idea is neat - a police inspector tracks the notorious Jack the Ripper before he kills again. This is all very well and fine, but in true Hollywood style they couldn't leave it there. We get a gold-hearted prostitute whom the inspector falls in love with. We get the secret love child of the Prince of Wales and another gold-hearted prostitute. We get a ridiculous conspiracy and we're supposed to believe it's all historically accurate? Give me a break. Johnny Depp, as usual, is excellent, Heather Graham is indifferent. Possibly an entertaining movie for those who haven't studied the Ripper case much or don't care about the glaring historical errors and omissions.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A far-fetched but stylish 'Hell',"From Hell turns the mystery of Jack the Ripper, that late 19th century murderer of prostitutes, into a double political and religious conspiracy. A bit too far-fetched because this pseudo-conspiracy includes the British royal family and a fanatic Masonic sect'. Nevertheless, the movie does a fine job at hinting to the ridiculousness of religious and ethnic discrimination, and it succeeds in portraying the oppression of low-class women.Johnny Depp returns as the serious investigator (as last seen in Sleepy Hollow, notice the similarities?); he portrays Inspector Abberline, who follows his intuition and visions to solve his cases, and is appointed to solve this particular mystery. Depp's performance is genuine because he obviously takes his role very seriously. Abberline is clever, melancholic, psychoanalytical, clairvoyant, and, above all as opposed to his superiors, moral, even human. He is troubled of course, having lost his family in tragic circumstances, and is addicted to opium and laudanum, which aid him in his visions'. In the end, he sacrifices his relationship with Mary Kelly (and consequently his only chance for happiness) out of fear for her safety. An epic 'hero', more or less.The presence of his assistant (Robbie Coltrane, Hagrid in Harry Potter) is fortunate. I say fortunate because his character prevents the movie from taking itself too seriously. His sarcasm is tinted with genuine compassion towards the murderer's victims and a respectful affection towards Abberline. Coltrane gives a truly fine performance there, though it doesn't compare to Ian Holm's.Ian Holm (Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring) plays a double-role in the movie, and the transition from the poised physician to the devilish fanatic was remarkably done in terms of facial expression, voice tone, elocution, and, symbolically, size and makeup. In its own way, this movie is expressionistic.The prostitutes, or unfortunates' as they would rather call them, look and sound exactly as they're supposed to. They are worn-out, cynical, foulmouthed, but, in their own way, they look after each other. The odd one out here is the female lead, Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham (argh!). She is too clean, too pure, and too elegant to be the companion of the other women. She is supposed to be of Irish decent, and naturally, the filmmakers made her a red-head. And a flamboyant one at that, with obviously dyed hair. Her so-called Irish accent sounds as convincing as my Swahili. If you should ever want to cast Heather Graham for your film, make sure you never show a close-up of her face; she's got the most inexpressive pair of painted ping-pong balls, er, eyes, I've ever seen.And now for the visuals: the only description that would fit here is psychedelic'. London has never looked foggier, with a smoky red sky and overall reddish ambiance. Abberline's visions of the murders are somewhat unsettling and gory (blood, flies on body parts, hazy photography etc...), but it's never cheap horror. Even the murder scenes are cleverly choreographed' so that we experience the act more through sound and feel rather than explicit violence. The whole mood of the movie is more graphically melancholic and dark than cheap and gory, really.Though not quite from hell', it's the survival of the fittest in the gloomy streets of Victorian London, where corruption rules till the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An effective Gothic horror piece of speculative fiction...,"For those who don't know, From Hell is an adaptation of the graphic novel by the same name, written by comics-god Alan Moore and with art by Eddie Campbell. Now, I've never read the graphic novel, so I won't be commenting on how well The Hughes Brothers adapted Moore's work. I will say this though, the movie certainly looks like a graphic novel, with its creepy rendition of late nineteenth century London, and its red painted skies.This graphic novel stuff is important to note because one must realise that From Hell the movie isn't trying to be an accurate depiction of the history of Jack the Ripper, but rather an adaptation of a book that was a heavily-researched, but ultimately speculative fictional account on the story of Jack the Ripper. The movie isn't trying to be historically-accurate, but rather uses history as a context for its fictional narrative. Which doesn't mean that one can't be bothered when police officers carry flashlights or when they screw up a historical figure's actual title given the year of the story (1888), these are anachronisms that should've been correct. However, if someone is upset by the film's suggestions on the identity of Jack the Ripper or the fate of Mary Kelly, then they're missing the point of the fiction. The film isn't trying to be the definitive account of Jack the Ripper, but rather the telling of a theory, a ""what if"" tale as it were.On to the film itself, From Hell is a gruesome telling of the Jack the Ripper story. Due to the nature of the story, it is gruesome and grim, and visually dynamic. I'd describe it as a moderately scary semi-horror movie for people (like myself) who don't watch horror movies. In watching the special features, it appears that the Hughes Brothers did a pretty good job matching scenes to the actual locations of the crimes in question, which makes the film a little more chilling in retrospect.In terms of acting, Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Fred Abberline, the chief investigator in the Ripper killings in White Chapel. He creates a character interesting enough that the audience is compelled to follow throughout the film, but nothing too spectacular. His co-star Heather Graham, playing prostitute and potential-Ripper victim Mary Kelly, is the weak link of the film, with a horrible accent and a useless romance sub-plot. It is obvious that she was cast to help open the film, and the character was fleshed out to humanise the victims. However, she is horribly out of place amongst the otherwise English cast (that being the actors not named Depp and Graham) and does little for the film than look good (which, I don't mind, since she does look good. Perhaps a little too good for a nineteenth century prostitute). Joining Depp and Graham are Ian Holm as the Royal Family's physician-in-ordinary Sir William Gull and Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley.I found the flick to be a fairly effective Gothic horror movie, and enjoyed the theoretical explanation of Jack the Ripper's true identity and motives. The film has some genuinely creepy and horrifying moments, chief among them is the carriage the Ripper uses to bring himself to his victims, which is made at the same time ordinary and other-worldly through the use of shadows and sound. It has a very Sleepy Hollow-feel to it, which is always a little creepy.However, the film is merely above average, as it does a few things very well, but nothing extraordinarily well. A good movie to check it if you're in the mood for some late 1800's England creepiness, but aren't expecting high art.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jack 'n the Hood,"7 out of 10Whatever happened to movies about little kids and their animals?  You know-`Black Beauty,' `Free Willy,' `My Dog Skip'-that sort of thing.  I remember coming home from school as a kid to my little sister watching `My Little Pony: The Movie' and thinking, you know, the world's an okay place. I could leave the screen door unlocked and go sip a lemonade on the back porch without a care in the world.Now everywhere you go people are killing each other and making movies about it.  I figured at first that this was just a modern trend since, you know, the world's going to hell (or is it from hell?  No, to hell) anyway.  But apparently this sort of thing's been going on for a while.  It's just that they didn't have movies back then.So I guess a movie about Jack the Ripper has been a long time coming. Now growing up, I always just understood Jack to be someone else's dad who coached t-ball and worked at a factory and lurked around elementary school playgrounds ripping little girls' clothes off.  Hell, it made sense at the time.  Needless to say, I never included myself in Jack's exclusive victim demographic.  If anything I envied him and tried to emulate his work during my playground fare.After seeing `From Hell,' I am now much more scared of Jack the Ripper. Yeah, I know, he's dead (or is he?-I smell a sequel.  No, he's actually dead.)  But what's to stop little Tommy now from becoming Tommy the Ripper or little Susie from becoming Susie the Ripperess?  I am truly scared for all of us.I suppose that's the mark of a good film (or is it?-I smell a trick ending. Yeah, it's a good film.)  Allen and Albert Hughes (`Menace II Society,' `Dead Presidents') have taken a rather unusual spin on their usual theme of violent suburban life in `From Hell,' and for the most part it is a glorious one.  It took keen eyes to recognize that the victimization of prostitutes, or `unfortunates,' in late 19th Century England was merely a derivative form of the inner city chaos that many live with still a hundred years later.`From Hell' stars Johnny Depp (`Ed Wood,' `Dead Man,' `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas') as the laudanum/absinthe addict Inspector Frederick Abberline who has been pulled out from the opium den just in time to star in the new Hughes Brothers' film `From Hell.'  Just kidding-I love Johnny Depp. Actually they need him to fry Jack the Ripper's gourd.  And since all the drugs he takes give him magical powers and a British accent, this is not the exact same movie as `Sleepy Hollow.'Abberline is quick to fall in love with one of the unfortunates, or `sluts,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, `Boogie Nights') because she is the only one of them with box office appeal (sorry guys, no naked here-or is there?  I won't say-or will I?  Read on.) and has the least dirt applied to her face in the makeup room.  He is quick to get the help of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm, `The Sweet Hereafter,' `Brazil'), physician to the royal family, to aid in tracking a killer who appears to be an educated man with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy (Jack the Ripper).  And a budget for grapes.But Jack the Ripper is quicker at killing them all-or is he?  I won't say. As opposed to the graphic novel on which it is based, `From Hell' wisely chooses to conceal the identity of Jack until the end, so it has the same effect as Christopher Walken's appearance in `Sleepy Hollow.'  Come to think of it, just replace Walken as Jack, Christina Ricci for Heather Graham, and Johnny Depp for Johnny Depp and it's the same damn movie.  Aw man.Actually, Depp was better as Ichabod Crane, but `From Hell' is probably a better movie.  Granted, it's sort of a one note film-Jack kills a prostitute, her friends wince, Depp warms up the opium cooker, rinse and repeat.  But it's reasonably well written, even better acted (by Heather Graham of all people), and even still better filmed-it looks like something between `Moulin Rouge' and `Requiem for a Dream.' Of course, `From Hell' is strictly entertainment for all you gore- and Heather Graham (keep reading) skin- hounds.  But the restraint of the gore (compared to such recent fare as `Hannibal'), as well as the allusions to 19th Century medicine and freemasonry make this film creepy and disturbing as hell.  Or is it from hell?  Dammit, I've got to stop doing that.So, in conclusion, if you want to know if Heather Graham gets naked in this movie, you'll just have to see it for yourself.  Hahahahahaha.  (And I disappear in a flash of smoke).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

From Johnny Depp on down, the acting is solid, with special mention to Ian Holm (Sir William Gull) and Robbie Coltrane (Peter Godley), who were both magnetic on film. The grit and darkness of Victorian London is at times, stifling and oppressive, serving as a perfect backdrop to this tale. I'd recommend it to anyone intrigued by mysteries, especially those who are curious by nature and like me, went home after the film and gorged themselves on what I could find of the given topic. there's certainly no lack of information for this drama from a historic perspective..

Dark audacious thriller,"Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes.'From Hell' stars Johnny Depp as police Inspector Fred Abberline investing a series of murders in the Whitechapel area of London. His partner is Sergeant Peter Godley played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, an Irish prostitute that helps Abberline with the investigation.Abberline is an opium addict whose dreams provide a clairvoyant insight into his investigations. In fact, the movie opens and ends with Abberline in an opium den. Depp does a great job with this character, showing the viewers that his acting ability improves as he ages.The story has a number of subplots that are interconnected. The Royal family is somewhat involved due to a little problem in their family that could cause a scandal; we see a secret society that is linked to Royalty and the government - even Abberline's superior officer is a part of this group; there is also a secret police described as the Special Branch involved with the plot. To top it all off, an appearance of the 'Elephant Man' makes its way into the movie. All these subplot points make this movie sound like an 'X-Files' story.'From Hell' is dark and violent, similar to 'Se7en' and '8mm', yet the first three-quarters of the movie is quite stimulating. In my opinion the movie doesn't finish well. The alternative last scene shown on the DVD special features would have been better since it would have been less ambiguous with what happens to Abberline after the case is closed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly bad,"OK, I like Johnny Depp, I love suspense movies and don't mind a little blood. But this film left me disappointed. Let me just comment a few things:1) Johnnys accent. On the dvd version, the directors gave compliments to the fact that he was able to switch from Irish to Cockney to posh English, and they were so impressed that they didn't think he needed much coaching. What can you do but laugh. They're American, I guess everything with an intrusive R sounds English to them. Let the specialists be the judge of whether Johnny's accent was British or not, and let him get the help he really needs. I'm a native Swede, and I thought it was was terrible. And that says a lot. (I especially hated his mock Sean Connery thing, pronouncing ""s"" as ""sh"".)2) London in the 1800s was dirty and smelly. Why are the streets so clean, and especially: why is Heather so squeaky clean? And another comment: Heather's character is so obviously much more pretty than the other prostitutes. This could be credible, if only someone would have commented upon it. At least her friends should have teased her about it  or something. Or she would be making more money than the others. It doesn't make sense.3) Johnny is supposed to be investigating a murder. I understand that the methods are much more refined today, but come on... Most of the time he just wanders around looking sad, alternatively surprised.4) When I heard the directors' comments on the film, I lost whatever respect I may have had for them. Laughing, one of them said he'd cast one of the girls because she had such darn sexy collarbones. Duh. And all of you looking for nudity: on the dvd version, one scene which was cut out can be seen, where a very well shaped and beautiful female body lowers herself into a bath. I agree, she looks terrific. So why was she cut out? The answer is obvious. She was only there as a decoration, had nothing to do with the film, and I found that fact a bit offensive. Needless to say, the directors disagreed with the test audience, who wanted her out. Are we talking Hollywood directors or teenage boys here, everybody??",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good lighting, directing and acting, but the plot is horrible","This movie has good lighting, directing and acting, but the plot is horrible.  I watched Menace II Society and Dead Pres and they were both great films.  It seemed like the Hughes bros. were in their element. Unfortunately, they stepped into the the wrong arena in this movie.  You can notice flashes of brilliance in their direction, but the plot moves along at a snails pace.  Don't watch this movie if you want to see a redeemable representation of Jack the Ripper, it isn't about that at all.  It seems to me that they used the Jack the Ripper storyline as a catalyst to show late 19th Century London.  The entire movie is dark, dank and downtrodden.By the end of this film I felt ripped off.  Depp and Grahm are good, maybe even great at their jobs, but their talents are squandered in this film. The directors try and turn the story of a sadistic killer into a love story. The problem with their attempted love story is that Depp and Grahm hardly interact at all before the last few scenes.  Ahhh, why do all movies end up like this??   Can't there not be a female protagonist for Depp to fall for. I wish.  Oh well, I applaud the Hughes bros. for attempting to make a stylized movie about Jack, but they fall short in the plot, dialogue and the whole Jack the Ripper story.Bottom line, watch this movie if you A: like either Depp or Grahm, B: enjoy watching interesting dirction with little or no plot to attach itself to. or C:  enjoy watching old time London where women are treated like dirt. Don't watch this movie if you A: enjoy films where the plot and the direction correlate to create meaning.  B:  if you have a weak stomach or are a femenist.  or C:  If you expect this to be even close to as good as Meance II Society (one of my all time favorites) or Dead Presidents.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Hughes Brothers' version of the Ripper myth,"Albert and Allen Hughes are the men behind the punching debut Menace II Society and the masterpiece Dead Presidents, so I had naturally pretty high expectations on From Hell, a film about the notorious Jack The Ripper. The film is definitely not their masterpiece but it is nice to see that this kind of cinema still exists in Hollywood. It tells the story of violent murders in London of 1888, as unidentified murderer kills prostitutes without any significant reason. A young and sad-faced detective played by Johnny Depp starts to solve the case, and the deeper he gets, the more twists take place..The film looks great with all its fog, smoke and ominous lightning. The film is very dark all the time which is nice and very atmospheric. The presence of pure evil is there all the time. There are at least three unforgettable images and scenes in this film and I leave them for you to spot. All I will say is that the scenes involve red sky, a bridge and eyes over the city... The photography is very great and technically this film is magnificent. Hughes brothers are very talented and I'm glad that they directed this, as now there is enough personal touch in the film, and the film is not just another stupid entertainment flick.The murders are occasionally graphic and disturbing but for most of the time they are shown as flashbacks and with fast editing. The film is still pretty gory so some will find it too offensive, but more offensive is the motivations and the pure wickedness of the Jack. He is definitely like the Devil himself and at one point he even mentions that he lives in Hell. So this is one Hell of a movie! The fast editings and flashbacks is in fact pretty effective and stylistic element, so I think that even more demanding film lovers may like From Hell, too.The love affair between the two protagonists is a little unnecessary but doesn't go too far, fortunately. In the middle part, the film concentrates too much on the affair between these characters and it seems like they forgot the whole Jack! But as a whole, the film manages to deliver the story and not to get tiresome. I am not familiar with the graphic novels this film is based on, so fans of the original material may find (and find) many differences and faults in this film. But after all, From Hell is an okay horror/gothic experience from great directors, and as I mentioned earlier, it is great that these talents still exist among the entertainment oriented big studios.Not a masterpiece but still satisfying and atmospheric film. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

But with all these small details, such as his use of absinthe and opium, just small details, all those pieces just completes the movie as whole. It makes it all slightly more real, no one is perfect and Depp always succeeds in playing those roles - especially when it comes to roles of users on illegal substances.

"Grim, gruesome story about Jack the Ripper and the inspector who goes after him, based on a successful comic book","The film blends thriller, suspense, detective action , terror and a little gore and being quite interesting. The plot line is a fictional story and based on a fancy-schmancy graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Set in Victorian-era London, a troubled clairvoyant police detective called Abberline (Johnny Depp who gives a tipically studious acting) with his soft south London sting and predilections for absinthe and laudanum (shades of Sherlock Holmes) investigates the murders of Jack the Ripper. The latter is carrying out a crime spree of London's prostitutes on the nights in 1888. At the beginning there's a kidnapping that's soon followed by the gruesome murder of two women, and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down, one by one. Police Inspector Abberline pries into the medical community, the royal family and other less respectable areas in his search for the Ripper. Abberline proceeds the investigatition with the help of his partner Godley (Robbie Coltrane) and the cockney hooker Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) struggling wanly with an alleged Irish accent. The plot has a twisted ending and contains outstanding surprises. Only the legend will survive!. Will they be able to survive the avenging force that has been sent after them from Hell?The Hughes brothers take on the legend of Jack the Ripper in this grisly period thriller. The movie depicts a twisted scheme, uncovering a plot by the Freemasons, as well. The film displays a first-rate set design and is very atmospheric .The shady and spooky slums are pretty well designed. Some shots create extreme eerie and horror moments. Beautiful visuals and taut suspense raise this effort a notch above other adaptations of the subject matter. There's another version with similar plot: Bob Clark's Murder by Decree (1979), in which Sherlock Holmes/Christopher Plummer and Watson/James Mason have to find out the true series killer in Whitechapel; ¨James Hill's A studio in terror¨ (1965) is another film that pitted Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper. Stars Johnny Depp who gives a cool acting as fictional opium-addicted detective Abberline charged with finding the notorious killer of London. While the sympathetic Robbie Coltrane as police sidekick and the cockney hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold Mary Kelley well played by Heather Graham. And others notorious secondaries, such as: Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, David Schofield, Peter Eyre, Sophia Myles, Terence Harvey, Paul Rhys.It packs suspenseful as well as thrilling musical score fitting to action and drama stunningly composed by Trevor Jones . Dark, sinister cinematography but very colorful with peculiar atmosphere created by cameraman Peter Deming who reflects splendidly the creepy outdoors and shading interior. With the help of the producers of ¨Natural born killers¨, American ghetto blasters the Hughes Brothers directed competently this decent flick. Hughes' kinetic style heightens the script's attack on snobbery, endemic class issues, racism and sexual hypocrisy. Originally and compellingly directed by the Hughes brothers, Albert and and Allen, authors of good films as ¨Menace II Society¨, and ¨Dead Presidents¨ and of course their big hit:¨The book of Eli¨ where they blended ¨Mad Max¨ trilogy style along with ¨Farenheit 451¨ final premise. From Hell(2001) rating : Good , better than average, this is one of the first and most successful Hughes Brothers films. This remarkable detectice action movie will appeal to Johnny Depp fans. Rating : 7 , Above average. Fistfully arresting late night entertainment. Well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Criminally underrated audiovisual masterpiece.,"The Hughes Brothers did a phenomenal job crafting this gothic horror masterwork. A visual feast breathes sinister life into an already compelling work of art that was the graphic novel. Even in 2024, it still stands as my all time favorite gothic film from the Victorian era. We honestly need more films like it.Johnny Depp was clearly having the time of his life on this film his manic energy and verve was at the peak of its powers much like in the best work he's done with Tim Burton.

Could have been much better,"I rented this movie for Halloween as I was looking for something with a horror feel to it. Some parts of this movie lived up to that but I'm glad I had my remote to fast-forward through some of the slower parts. I especially liked the stylized shooting of the first murder - the flashes of the knife in the night. Very striking!What I did not like was what nearly everyone else mentioned: 1) Heather Graham - that red hair - sheesh! Even my dye jobs don't look that bad! And don't get me started on the accents - ech! And how nice that her character seems to be the only streetwalker who doesn't actually sleep with anyone?

Who'd listen to a druggy cop in any era?I did enjoy the commendable attention to detail to the Londoners and the background scenery. I could get into the feel of turn of the century London life the longer I watched the movie. Some scenes were humorous - like poor people having to sleep sitting up (and tied up) instead of sleeping in beds. Side note - the women couldn't find enough money to pay the gang but they found enough to bury their friend? Unlikely.The photography is what makes this film worth watching.

"Don't Panic, It's Just Hollywood Hell","I enjoyed the movie, but I think that the opportunity of a great movie was missed. It has logic all over, it is not badly acted, and succeeds to recreate something of the London Victorian atmosphere. A quite sophisticated explanation of the Ripper cases bought me in, and I am sure many will be in my situation. There are some tough scenes, but it is about Jack the Ripper after all. Word is out that the film authors will join the Cohens and the Tavianis in the gallery of great brother directing couples. I think that it is too early to say - there was a big subject our there, but the general outcome is too conventional. Almost each 'surprise' could be anticipated one scene earlier, the red and black cinematography and the sets smelled Hollywood, there is good acting but no unforgettable act.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A un-involving, mildly predictable who-dunnit.","The movie From Hell seemed high on visuals, but it did not grip me on the edge of my seat through any part of the film.  I guess it was a mostly follow the trail type of movie instead of a murder mystery/suspense.The who dunnit part was mildly interesting, but the intersection of the perpetrator and inspector made the assumption that he was the one somewhat obvious because there were so few other character's personalities or traits revealed that it's as if there was a neon sign pointing to him in the whole scene.  We were lead to believe it was constantly somebody else, but when the murderer was revealed, the thought of ""I don't know why, but I had a feeling it was him"" keeps popping up.Maybe the hallucinations should have been more intertwined with the investigation as opposed to a after the fact confirmation of what the inspector imagined in his mind.Hether Grahm should stick to her usual happy spacy roles, since she seems out of place compared to the other hoarse prostitutes, acting and character-wise.  The rest of the British casts seems to fit right in.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another movie about the discounted Royal Theory?,"I remember reading the original book by Stephen Knight and wondering if it was true, but then I read all I could about the Ripper, and after reading the files (opened in '88 - the Knight's book came out in '76) I could see that it could not be true.  When this movie came out, I wanted to see it, but a friend told me the solution and I was disgusted.  ANOTHER movie based on this tired theory?  Aren't movies based on historical events supposed to try and work in the known facts?  I finally got the movie (free) and was appalled.  They worked in enough facts to prove to me they did some research, but then ignored things like what these women did prior to their deaths, who they were, what their lives were like.  These women were not a clique of ""unfortunates"" who hung around together, though they might have known one another.  I mean, they did the same thing and lived in the same area!  But are we supposed to believe the police were stupid enough to miss something like a group of friends being killed off one by one?  If there had been that connection, wouldn't that be the MAIN thing known about the Ripper?It just bothers me that they are still doing Ripper movies with the same tired solution in this day and age.  This looks it was done just to take advantage of the ability to show blood and gore.  Why can't we start with the Ripper Files and fit the story around it? If you keep harping on the Royal solution, people will believe it that is what happened, because not everyone can read Jack the Ripper A to Z (great book!)  I am sure that if you ask anyone they will swear the Royal solution is the truth, because that is all they ever see.Johnny Depp is eye candy and they might have impressed some with the blood and gore, but I'd be far more impressed by a serious attempt to tell it like it *might* have happened.  This theory has been discounted LONG ago; it's time for something else, please! I know they were going to do a Maybrick movie, then suddenly they didn't - I assumed it was because they decided the diary was a fake.  Hey, fake or not, it would have made an interesting story, and something DIFFERENT.  Are they afraid someone might have taken it seriously?  If that's the case, then why are they still promoting this obvious fiction?  I don't see how it is any different.  Except this one's already been done.  Do it too much, and it becomes accepted as being true.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting....the story of Jack The Ripper brought to full life..,"One word can sum up this film....haunting. From the opening scenes in this film, to the finish, I was on the edge of my seat. Although the story is not historically accurate (I have never read the graphic novel, but have read alot of books about the Ripper), it was a genuinely entertaining film, one that seriously scared the hell out of me. There are not many films that have had this sort of impact on me.There were certain aspects that were based on fact, such as the Prince of England being linked to the murders after a bout with syphillis, however, most of it is Hollywood fiction. I will not complain however, as I stated above, it was the first movie since the Wickerman and The Exorcist that left me in a state of awe and shock. Johnny Depp was hypnotic as the inspector assigned to the case of the Ripper, while Heather Graham was simply fantastic as the whore that he tries to protect, and Ian Holm was spectacular as usual. Some may think that this movie is alittle too violent, however, it does get the point across as to how brutal a killer Jack the Ripper actually was. The first real horror film of the year is definately one that you should not miss. Rip yourself away from that computer, and go and see...From Hell.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good direction of a lame script,"""From Hell"" is certainly a stylish exercise in gruesome horror/mystery, but the Hughes Brothers' direction is wasted on a script that turns ridiculous by film's end.Jack the Ripper is a killer defending the British throne (currently occupied by Queen Victoria) from an illegitimate child born to a Catholic prostitute (the movie makes it seem like being a Catholic is worse than being a prostitute) who could be heir. His goal is to 'eliminate' all those who are aware of the child's existence. The Inspector Abaline character (Johnny Depp) works well, as does the role of the Watson-like Seargent Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and even the nonsense of the Queen Victoria conspiracy has a certain charming mystique to it.However, Jack The Ripper is not satisfied with just killing, but insists on performing brutal mutilations and the removal of organs. Why does he do this, when he could just throw them off a building or toss them in a lake? I guess because the writers think that gruesome violence will help sell their movie. The explanation is some ridiculous and desperate story of Jack being so insane, that he thinks thoroughly butchering his victims will somehow represent Jewish struggle, or Jewish oppression, or something. I couldn't really tell, and I didn't really care. It didn't seem like the writers did either.That said, the Hughes brothers definitely created a haunting atmosphere through the first act, and although anyone who has seen enough movies and knows enough actors won't take long to figure out who the killer is, the suspense is still real, and will make you eager to see the story unwrap, when you're not dreading a closeup of the victim.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Have mercy on the children and creatures of the night.,"Graphic and potent crime thriller from the Hughes Brothers. Fantasy and speculation provides entertainment on the edge. Versatile Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted police inspector who uses his clairvoyant powers to try and track down Jack the Ripper. While investigating the gruesome murders in 1888 London inspector Abberline(Depp)finds himself falling in love with an intended victim Mary Kelly(Heather Graham). Just over two hours and sometimes a little choppy plotwise. Depp is intense and affable. Even the chalky looking Graham makes for a winsome prostitute. Supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Paul Rhys. It is probably a good idea to watch on an empty stomach.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ripper!,"Legendary bewhiskered comic creator Alan Moore has famously distanced himself from all cinematic adaptations of his work, never happy with the end results. It's a pattern that started in 2001 with From Hell, a speculative account of the infamous Jack The Ripper case, directed by The Hughes Brothers and starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. In bringing the graphic novel to life, alterations were made by the film-makers to both characters and plot—changes that were substantial enough to incur the wrath of Mr. Moore.However, while I can fully appreciate how Moore feels (no artist likes to have their work messed around with), I believe that the film is still a very accomplished and entertaining piece that more than warrants merit. A wonderfully realised, bold and bloody take on an oft-told tale, From Hell benefits from confident direction, great production values, and solid performances from a terrific cast, with Hollywood stars Depp and Graham both taking a good stab (pun intended) at the London accent (while they're not perfect, they're more than serviceable) while Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng and a whole raft of other talented players do their utmost to ensure an authentic East End flavour overall.The plot, although heavily revised, holds together very nicely and remains utterly fascinating, pointing the finger of suspicion at both the Freemasons and the Royal Family, making the whole thing a blast for conspiracy theorists and republicans alike. To Moore, I say 'so what if this isn't exactly what you had in mind—at least it's not as bad as what Snyder did to 300'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark Depp,YoI agree with all the ambiance comments I've read.  I think the atmosphere created made up for a weak script and plot.  I liked the ending.  It made the whole movie seem like one long opium induced dream.  Depp again lead us subtly forward staying back enough for us to see the other characters for what they are.  I thought the whole class snobbery of the time and how the poor and less educated were treated little better than animals was well documented.  Definitely worth viewing.  7 out of 10.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What the hell (TV),"I watched it on screen at its release and remember having troubles to follow the story and explain the motive behind the murders.Now, I decided to have a second look because I just finished to read the big comics of Moore and Campbell. And I realized how this movie sucks!It's absolutely not an adaptation of the comics but a failed variation on it. So exit some brilliant ideas (the mystic London, the ingenious plot, the royal family scandal, the scapegoat, the false clairvoyant, ...) and welcome stupid innovations (the stoned detective, the Spanish doctor, ). I am sure that if they could, they would have changed London for New York and replaced the ripper by a butcher!Now, the beginning of the movie and the murders appear more stupid than my first viewing!In addition, the sets look cheap and really pasteboard and the cast is really funny: all the hookers are ugly except Heather Graham who wears a ridiculous red hairstyle!

This period-piece adaptation of Alan Moore's work better than I expected!,"I went into this having only seen 'The Book of Eli' by these directors, The Hughes Brothers. I quite liked that film, although I did feel their vivacious stylizations interfered with the telling of the story. Seeing this earlier film of theirs confirmed that suspicion, though it's still a fine film. Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two). It has a fine supporting cast, is beautiful to look at and is consistently intriguing. I especially liked Heather Graham (I think this is solidly amongst her best work), Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and, most significantly, Katlin Cartlidge. Boy, do I ever miss her in films made ever since.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A positive review!,"I never expect much from movies made by Hollywood about events in the UK but with this title I was pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp's ""Mockney"" accent leaves a lot to be desired but his acting, as usual, is flawless. Based largely on fact this film makes interesting viewing, particularly as a somewhat new and untested ""theory"" as to the identity of the Ripper was chosen. The portrayal of Fred Abberline as a drug addict is somewhat unusual and frankly somewhat ridiculous but it lends a certain atmosphere to the proceedings, giving the whole movie that ""nightmare"" feel. If you can stomach some incredibly accurate, anatomically correct ""gore"" then you're in for a treat.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining enough...,"The 'Jack the Ripper' murders endure for no other reason than that the man himself was never identified. There have been equally as brutal murders the world over, but these are different because not having anyone to finger, we can finger anyone. And that is exactly what writers, playwrights and movie-makers have done ever since. Actually, 'Jack the Ripper' was as much an invention of the then nascent tabloid Press as anything else. The name is supposedly derived from a letter the murderer is said to have sent to the Press, but the received wisdom is that it was, in fact, dreamed up by some sub-editor with one eye on a good headline to a cracking story. (One of the first and most useful pieces of advice I and more or less every young reporter is given when starting out on our careers of discovering and unearthing the truth wherever it might lurk is: 'Don't let a couple of facts stand in the way of a good story.' I am pleased to report that I haven't, ever.) There is even very credible doubt that there even was a Jack the Ripper. Around the time his alleged victims were butchered, another six or seven other working girls in the neighbourhood were also murdered. The Ripper murders were attributed to the one killer merely because of the particularly gruesome manner five of the victims were mutilated and disembowelled. So these deaths have always been a fertile ground for artists of most kind (and one artist, the celebrated Walter Sickert, has also been named as the 'definitive Jack the Ripper). Here 'the Hughes Brothers' of whom I had never heard until tonight — are they, too, perhaps the invention of some overwrought sub-editor's imagination? — rework the story and interweave the gruesome end of the five prostitutes with a conspiracy which, as we subs are apt to proclaim in our sub-heads, 'goes right to the very top'. As stories and conspiracies go, it isn't half bad. Unfortunately, a previous Ripper film got in there first more than 20 years earlier, but From Hell is none the worse for that. The cast plays it rather well, especially Johnny Depp, whose lower-class London accent has been criticised by some, but it didn't offend me, and if that is the worst criticism that could be aimed at From Hell, the fabled 'Hughes Brothers' have little to worry about. Depp, as usual (well, in these viewers eyes, at least) again seems to ham it up, but very subtly, that is, not so you'd notice. In fact, the man can play this kind of part with his eyes closed, and I, for one, would like to see him in a far more challenging role where real acting is demanded rather than simply not forgetting his lines and not bumping into the furniture. I like to think we wouldn't be disappointed. I wasn't particularly convinced by Heather Graham who must be one of the cleanest whores working the streets in Whitechapel. Apart from these two Yanks, each more or less successfully adopting English accents — which rather begs the question: why cast Yanks? — the rest of the cast are all old familiar faces, lead from the front by the ever dependable Ian Holm and Ian Richardson, who can also both turn in the required performance with their eyes shut and still be home in good time for supper. Prague doubled up as East London, and a rather clean and sanitised East London it was, too. But I mustn't grumble: From Hell provides an entertaining two hours of rather good hokum, doesn't descend to the rather cheap depths of a slasher movie and will get you and your friends discussing the identity of the Ripper and the conspiracy behind it for, oh, at least six minutes before you find something better to do. Oh, and the usual caveat: elsewhere in these member's reviews you will find the standard hyperbole of From Hell being the best film ever made ever. Why do they bother?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Why do film makers have to change the facts?,"""From Hell"" is a wonderfully evocative movie and, as the identity of the Ripper will never be known, the makers are at liberty to speculate.  But why do they have to alter the facts and add pointless embellishments when the real facts of the case are so dramatic?Grape stalks were not found by the bodies of any of the victims.  The women killed by the Ripper did not need the incentive of a few grapes - they were so desperately poor that they had to earn a few pence for a bed in a cheap lodging house.What dramatic point is served by making Inspector Abberline an opium addict, who dies young from his addiction?  The real Abberline lived to 86!  And, while Johnny Depp does a reasonable cockney accent (for an American), Abberline was born and brought up in Dorset and would have had a very distinctive accent, far removed from cockney.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting movie...,"""From Hell"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch an inspector in Victorian-era London trying to fight his own demons and at the same time trying to solve the mysterious murders of Jack the Ripper. Every step he makes he is getting closer to the murderer but always something is missing or something happens and escapes. He will have to take into consideration many parameters and many witnesses in order to succeed in his goal.I liked this movie because is a good average movie with an interesting plot nothing more than this. If you have high expectations then you are going to be disappointed by it. I also liked the interpretations of Johnny Depp's who played as Inspector Frederick Abberline and he was very good at it, Robbie Coltrane's who played as Sergeant Peter Godley and Ian Holm who played as Sir William Gull and he was simply amazing. Another thing that has to be mentioned is the direction which was made by Albert and Allen Hughes (as The Hughes Brothers) and I believe they did an excellent job.To sum up, I have to say that ""From Hell"" is a good movie with an interesting plot and some clever plot twists, it has also many good scenes that combine mystery and make you feel that you are there too. I recommend everyone to watch this movie and especially if you are a fan of mystery movies because I believe that you are going to enjoy it very much.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"I found this movie so disappointing that it inspired me to write this, my first review. The only genre appropriate for this movie is Horror because of possible shock factor at the type of murders committed. However, considering the repetitive nature of this film, only the first murder could really be considered ""shocking"".I find myself shying away from horror movies because I scare easy, however, even I did not find this movie scary. There was no suspense. The movie was merely disgusting. You could not even really classify it as ""gore"" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.The ""romance"" part of this movie was laughable. Heather Graham's character was poorly developed, and I was not convinced that Inspector Abberline would fall in love with her. I suppose the fact that Mary Kelly didn't once solicit men, despite being a whore, like all the other women was an attempt to soften her character and make their love more believable. It didn't work on me.This movie was extremely predictable - you knew what was going to happen next throughout the entire film. I am of the opinion that the potential for a good movie was there, but the execution failed in producing it. I confess, I have not read the novel it was based on.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than I Was Led To Believe,"Having only seen this movie after hearing critics trash it for 2 years, I was surprised by how much I liked it.  I was expecting to be impressed with Depp's performance, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was also impressed by the execution of the story and the attention to detail by the directors. I haven't read the graphic novel (I plan to) but from what I heard about the deviations from it made for the movie, I think they were done to good effect.  I think adding the death of Abberline's wife and baby, and his opium addiction, made his character that much more compelling, as a flawed and unhappy man who nevertheless forces himself to pursue justice.  The opium and absinthe seem to be a natural response to the burden of clairvoyance that he must bear.  The re-creation of the lower underbelly of Victorian London was well done, I thought.  Not too squalid as to be distracting, but definitely not romanticized.  Altogether, a very solid movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A silly film with very little appeal beyond three good performances by supporting actors.,"Where to start? To begin with, the plot has already been filmed in an adequate (and vastly more entertaining) manner in the 1979 film with Christopher Plummer and James Mason 'Murder by decree'. Secondly, Johnny Depp's 'English' accent must be well up there for the Dick Van Dyke 'cod-English, 'gor, blimey, govn'r'' Award - it is so abysmal that you LONG for another of the 'opium den'/'vision' scenes because one knows that at least he will keep his mouth shut and spare one's ears. The 'opium den' scenes themselves, and the role they 'play' in the script, are also themselves the height of silliness, even if they play the 'key' role in the final scenes and the 'saving' of Depp's sweet-heart. The whole role and everything about the latter ('Mary Kelly') is also virtually 'off the silliness scale'. As usual with films about Jack the Ripper, the producers want it both ways; revelling in the filth, poverty, gore, diseases and total cheapness of and disregard for human life prevalent in the slum areas of London in the 1880s, whilst, of course, portraying the lead, especially female, characters, as if they had actually nothing to do with such surroundings. The police photographs and crime scene sketches of the time, to which the film refers at many stages, show the real Mary Kelly (as with all of the other victims of the Ripper) for what they actually were - wasted, emaciated, disease-ridden and broken women, decades old before their time. The 'Mary Kelly' of this film, with her fresh complexion, beautiful 'Pre-Raphaelite' auburn hair, spotless clothes and bright, assertive expression is a travesty of the reality. If, however, 'Kelly's' general appearance and demeanour are shams, wait until the final scene when she escapes to a 'designer' cottage directly on the coast of Ireland with her 'rescued daughter' and decides to devote her life to bringing up the latter in healthy,clean and invigorating surroundings rather than the rat-infested slums of the East End of London - I say, what a terrific idea! A VERY silly ending to an extremely silly film which deserves to be totally forgotten and left to the type of murk and dark obscurity in which most of it is shot and which even makes the physical act of simply watching almost as disagreeable as waiting for the 'plot' to unfold. The ONLY saving graces were the performances of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson (the latter's appearances, though, being far too brief).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Okay,"Gothic trappings and dreamy visuals try desperately to cover the stench of exploitation in this violent, speculative retelling of the Jack the Ripper incidents. Johnny Depp, who plays the clairvoyant detective on the trail of the murderer, is a wonderfully intuitive actor but has always lacked a certain screen presence/charisma, an attribute that works in his favor in films like Dead Man or Nick of Time but detracts from performances in, say, Blow from last year, films where we need to believe he has the magnetism and deep motivations the script is telling us he has. His ethereality, for lack of a better word, is a mixed bag here, as the murders and intrigue behind the killer's identity far overshadow and out-interest whatever internal conflicts the Depp character carries. On the plus side, the love story, between him and a potentially doomed prostitute(Heather Graham) makes sense and adds needed poignancy to balance out the carnage the directors(Hughes Brothers) are so eager to wallow in. The murders are inventively, brutally shot, and as the camera lingers unsympathetically on the grisly aftermaths the connection is eloquently, methodically made between the polite economic violence of the London elite and the cold brutality of being on the bottom rung. Nifty piece of work there. The fact that the Hughes are good at what they do(exploitation) doesn't get them a pass but it does lead them into some interesting territory almost in spite of themselves. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent effort with a weak script.,I had high hopes for this film. I very much enjoyed Sleepy Hollow and Murder By Decree so this one looked like a lock. Depp's bleak protagonist and his sidekick Coltrane worked well but could not rise above the material. A few breaths of the real London of the time-the dosshouse where the women slept against a rope and the Ten Bells tavern(still around today almost as it was then)but the conspiracy angle was handled better in Murder By Decree. I am not saying wait for the rental but most will agree this film was not all it could have been.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different Jack the Ripper Film,"This is definitely a great horror film which gives in great detail the actual facts of what Jack the Ripper did to his victims back in the Year 1888 which terrified all of London. This story of Jack the Ripper is different in many ways because it involves an Inspector Frederick Abberline, (Johnny Depp) who is in charge of the investigation of the Ripper and centers his attention to four London prostitutes who are being eliminated by the cruel knife of the Ripper. Mary Kelley, (Heather Graham) is one of these prostitutes and the Inspector Abberline begins to fall in love with her and does everything he can to protect her. You will never be able to figure out who the Ripper is until almost the very end of this film and the ending could never be any better.

Our local newspaper, for example, gave the movie a pretty good review.From Hell is actually quite similar to Tim Burton´s gothic masterpiece Sleepy Hollow which also starred Johnny Depp. Both movies are dark and old-fashioned horror movies.

Eminently watchable crime thriller,"This movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel which itself was loosely based on the Jack the Ripper crime spree which took place in late 19th century London. Production values are quite high; it does a wonderful job of attempting to recreate the feel of both the place and era. The acting likewise is above par, with solid performances by a gifted cast. Because of the subject, the movie is filmed almost entirely at night, ala The Crow or Darkman, which may be slightly disturbing to some.The movie encompasses conflict on many levels, which in itself is a valid description of Victorian England. Perhaps that's why it succeeds, by not getting bogged down into the somewhat gruesome basic plot-line. The gore itself is held to a minimum and the movie simultaneously goes on to explore many aspects of the class relationships of the time, while never getting far afield of the story.

Okay Drama from What I Saw of it,"Perhaps it's because I didn't catch the whole film, but there didn't seem to be a whole heckuva lot new in this film that hasn't been said in other movies, and in better ways.  I like Depp, Holm, Coltrane and the other major performers for the most part, but I found Heather Graham too pretty to be playing a prostitute in Victorian England.  The thought that they were beautiful, relatively naive women is rather misleading.The film I found that handled many of the same theories, and in a lot better fashion, was Murder By Decree with Christopher Plummer and James Mason.  The whole angle of the Freemasons was pursued there, as well as the theory that the Royal Physician was the real Ripper.  The comments about the ""Juwes"" was also given, connecting them directly to the Masons.  The thing is, Freemasonry was not (and still isn't) as well known as it appears to be in From Hell--it's preposterous that in that day, without the amount of knowledge and information as available as it is now, that every cop on the beat would know about it. Also, the film seems to have also read most of the same source material as Murder By Decree with Annie Crook and the illegitimate child fathered by the Royal family member.The ending was confusing, though perhaps as I said it was because I didn't see the beginning.Overall, I suppose I need to see the film from the start, but if there wasn't any significant revelations in the 2/3 of the film that I saw, I would say that seeing Murder By Decree again would be preferable.",,Anonymous,Horror
The beauty crudeness and true story of Jack the ripper,"The Hughes brothers have really surprised me whit this small masterpiece.Jack the ripper I think is the most famous serial killer ever known in the history of murderers. This excellent film recreates a poor Victorian London area: Whitechapel with a detail precision that only a genius good do. The story is known but in this film there is an interesting side story, which is the personality of the commissar, giantly acted by Johnny Depp, and also the prostitutes environment with the Royal complot and the role of the masonry which enhance the interest of this film. The noisy and scary sound track fits just perfect with all the scenes and with the disturbed mind of a ""junky"" commissar who has ""shining"" experiences under the opium effect that help to solve the case.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite nice Victorian drama although the ending is quite tragic,"I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit ""splattery"" but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's Okay,"This is one of those movies I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, but here's some quick thoughts:1. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but they cast an actor with a very identifiable voice as Jack the Ripper and then the next 75% of the movie continues as if it's still a mystery. I suppose knowing who doesn't answer why, which IS drip fed across the movie, so whatever.2. I'm not really sure what the whole opium plot is about. It's established that Depp's character is the best at his job because he gets so cooked on opium that he sees visions of the future. This is basically the only supernatural element to the whole movie and they never engage with it beyond some characters thinking it's weird. Otherwise, they are 100% committed to ""no, yeah, this is a real thing he does and it works somehow.""3. The cartoonish reactions from the coroners over the dead bodies is a little funny? Like, my dudes, you work with dead bodies all day, every day. I know Jack the Ripper did a particularly nasty job on these girls, but come on. This is your job. Especially with the lip service they pay to how Jack's work is so clean, it shouldn't even necessarily be that yucky to a coroner that does autopsies.Ultimately I don't know if I find it very satisfying. Especially when you remember that real history states they never caught Jack the Ripper. ""From Hell"" dangles the ideas of a happy ending in our faces but you know it's never going to commit.Tolerable, but ultimately not something I'll ever watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dodgy Accents and Plot Holes,"My expectations were high for this and early word suggested better. The fake `Cockney' accents were so distracting it became difficult to  involve yourself with, or care about the central characters. I was unpleasantly reminded of the `Dick Van Dyke' Mary Poppins school of acting where all Londoners seem to come from Australia via Peckham via Texas. However special mention should go to Ian Holm who was absolute genius (as usual) and also to Robbie Coltraine who skillfully managed to make one of the few interesting characters out of a fairly un-pivotal part. But aside from these two, overall the film was a bit dull with plot holes and un-settled questions everywhere and it was also the very first time I have not been totally convinced by Johnny Depp in a film. The whole film felt like it was about to step into a higher gear but regretfully never found it, even towards the end.  There have already been more intriguing `conspiracy' Ripper films and TV adaptions, so to see these very gifted film makers turn in something so empty was a bitter disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vibrant, gorgeous horror","The Hugh's Brothers From Hell may play havoc with the facts of the actual Jack the Ripper case, and sometimes veers into syrupy sentiment, but for the most part it's a sumptuous, wonderfully spooky shocker with an austere, gloom and doom vibe and some genuinely horrifying murder scenes. I consider it a companion piece to Sleepy Hollow, as they both positively drip with atmosphere, and share the same star in Johnny Depp, as a troubled Inspector attempting to solve equally chilling homicides. Granted Sleepy Hollow is the fun one, while From Hell has almost no sense of humour and a sense of grave danger from right out of the gate. Johnny Depp plays Frederick Abberline, an opium addicted Scotland Yard inspector who's roped into an obsessive search for Jack The Ripper, aided by his sergeant Peter Godley (always nice to see Hagrid- I mean Robbie Coltrane). He gets embroiled in aristocratic corruption, and attempts to protect beautiful prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham with red hair!) who fears she may be next on old Jack's list. He begins to suspect that his opium induced nightmares may provide a conduit to the killers actions, and give him something to go on. Is he losing it? Or are the drugs actually giving him metaphysical clues? Depp plays him with a forlorn, world weary malaise that's a nice front for the razor sharp intellect that made Abberline famous (he also took down the Wolfman earlier in life). Bilbo Bagg- I mean Ian Holm shows up as a renowned doctor who assists him, and Jason Flemyng as a no good coach driver, with Sophia Myles, Katrin Kartlidge and David Schofield as a grinning, evil east end pimp rounding out the roster. Now, because in real life it's an unsolved case, the Brother's Hugh's feel like they have to complete full circle, and give us a nice tidy resolution. I feel like the film should have left it open ended and never given us a who in the whodunit. It would have made the film so much more effective and eerie, but alas the studio heads must be babysat through a generic narrative to appease their financial anxiety. No matter, it's still a rich, gorgeous, bloody genre piece with an evocative, smoky London palette for this ghostly predator to stalk and slay, and for hard nosed law dogs to pursue him through the fog. Definitely a piece to check out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ugly beautiful,"Adapted from a comic book, The Hughes' brothers film 'From Hell' is arguably more faithful to its origins than any other of its type. That is to say, the whole movie unfolds like a series of storyboards, the scenes may technically be animated but you can mentally crystallise each one into a handful of definitive images. Darkly Gothic, ultra-violent yet also quiet, the film has also a very well defined aesthetic sense, one arguably more pervasive than that in any of the movies of Tim Burton (with which some stylistic comparison can be made, although 'From Hell', unlike Burton's movies, is utterly lacking in whimsy). It also has a stellar British cast (Ian Holm is especially good value) supporting its leading (American) actors; who, sadly, cannot quite manage the cockney accent as required. Moreover, the usually charismatic Johnny Depp for once fails to leave sufficient impression, and his double act with sidekick Robbie Coltrane is surprisingly lacking in fire on both sides. Additionally, a little of the dialogue is anachronistic or just plain odd. Overall, 'From Hell' doesn't really add up to more than series of pictures, some are individually horrific but there's no wider sense of terror beyond the individual moments of gore. Perhaps it should have stayed as a comic book (as such, it would have at least the elegance of economy); but no-one can deny that the translation is beautifully done.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Well done, if not too memorable.","""From Hell"" is very grim and ultra stylish filmmaking, most impressive for the way it depicts late 19th century London. It's a bleak image of Hell on Earth, an environment in which a maniac dubbed Jack the Ripper is able to flourish. Bloody Jack is carving up prostitutes in horrific fashion, and the weary inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is on the case. A haunted individual who uses drugs and experiences psychic visions, Abberline develops an attraction to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the Whitechapel whores whom he encounters. He soon discovers that there are secrets that important people want to keep secret, and that Jacks' motive might be more complex than he believes.Depp delivers a particularly solid, if somewhat eccentric, performance as Abberline, and receives excellent support from a mostly British cast. Graham manages to be somewhat convincing and not stick out too much. Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Terence Harvey, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, and Lesley Sharp co-star. Holm and Flemyng have particularly interesting roles. The story, adapted by Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is intricately plotted and involving, and it keeps the viewer guessing and on their toes, wondering who will be revealed as the Ripper and it may even catch them off guard when the end does come. Technically, the film is a marvel, with top notch direction by Allen and Albert Hughes, and eye catching production design (by Martin Childs) and cinematography (by Peter Deming). The period recreation is strong, with location filming done in the Czech Republic. There's also a wonderfully ominous score composed by Trevor Jones.The film doesn't really trend on unfamiliar ground, at least not to ""Ripperphiles"", but it's quite good and entertaining, and a worthy viewing for horror fans.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
a bad nine inch nails video,"what a piece of crap this movie was.  i love horror movies and gore, but this movie had nothing to offer.  it was slow, boring, and tried to make up for its slowness and boringness with a lot of blood and slasher effects.  i don't understand how it is the #1 movie in the country.  are movies that bad these days?  anyway when the movie got really disturbing i swear i could hear trent rezner's voice sing ""i wanna..you like an animal""  it was really my friend who said this movie was a like a bad nine inch nails video.  but that's a pretty redundant thing to say i think.  not to mention this movie is extremely stupid.  there is one part when they expose the killer, and the movie spends 5 minutes trying to convince you that the killer is crazy. right, like i didn't know.  and you're crazy if you liked this.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A bit boring, to be honest","I watched a superb documentary on BBC (or maybe Channel4) about the true identity of ""Jack the Ripper"", where it made it clear (he wrote letters to a friend revealing his inclinations etc) that he was a frustrated homosexual doctor from America, who collected body parts from prostitutes to revenge his frustration. After he went back to America, then the police in England were so embarrassed that they had basically let him get away that they didn't pursue him.After watching that, I was biased against this film from the word go.The accusations about the Royal Family/Freemasons being involved seemed farfetched when I first read them, and even more ridiculous when you look at the evidence.Having said that, and if you ignore the fact that the plot is spurious at best, then this is a moderately effective shocker. Nothing to write home about though....Cheers, Will",,Anonymous,Horror
Greater than the sum of its parts,"There are some films that have a certain 'x factor' that lifts them above the ordinary.  For some it's a cunning plot (say, Twelve Monkeys), others it's great performances (take Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets).  For From Hell it's the casting.The key elements of the production are all competently done - late Victorian London is nicely and darkly reproduced, the plot just about stands up (depending on how bothered you are by the visions experienced by Depp's Inspector) and there are plenty of sound supporting appearances by some talented British actors (Ians Holm and Richardson to name but two).What I really enjoyed about this film was the chemistry in the two principal relationships - Johnny Depp and Heather Graham (who plays one of the group of prostitutes targetted by The Ripper) and Depp and Robbie Coltrane (who plays the Sergeant assisting the Inspector).  The relationship that grows between Depp and Graham is believable and the contrast of Coltrane's straight-forward approach with Depp's drug addiction and foresight is nicely played.It's not the best dark thriller ever made (it's certainly not a Horror film), but I'll wager it will be judged better than most everything else launched in Halloween season.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fine, up until the end","I much prefer the TV movie with Michael Caine.  That one was more based in fact.  This film just went winging off into the ozone near the finale with messianic Freemasons and a convoluted ""solution"" that had me shaking my head and wishing for a more straightforward mystery, which is what The Ripper is. The Hughes Brothers were in love with the freaky dream sequences and imagery (which were interesting visually), but left the plot hanging.  The gore was a bit overdone and almost became a fetish, in fact a bit comical in places.  Having the Ripper speak was a bad move because anyone with half an ear would know who it was.The best thing about this movie was the ultra-real atmosphere of Victorian skid rows and Johnny Depp.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A boring series of murders,"In a past London, inspector Frederick is assigned to investigate a series of very gruesome but also complex murders, which seemed to target a group of prostitutes. He has to analyze each murder in detail as the killer is a person with high expertise regarding dissections and human anatomy, making him even harder to get. Using his ""visions"", he must get to the bottom of the case fast, facing gangsters and corruption, before the woman he recently fell for is going to be the next victim.Although it had every ingredient to be a great movie, from actors to an interesting idea, it showed how not to make such a movie. It is boring as hell, while Depp's characters leaves us waiting a long time in the beginning for him to appear, and when he does, he does little to raise the tempo to a more enjoyable one, only providing some intelligent dialogue and replies now and then. Besides being boring, it has a group of characters who are as dull as they are annoying, some of them seeming to beg to be killed, deliberately ignoring strict and precise orders. Its finale is another big disappointment in my opinion, finishing the story without any style or even sense. As an upside, it managed to keep a dark and spooky atmosphere, in which the identity of the mysterious killer could remain unknown till late.Honestly, I wasn't expecting such a result from a movie which had a very good lead actor and an interesting sounding story line, fact which makes it even more disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great adaptation/depiction of events, which needs to be seen more than once!","I have to admit, from the outset, I found it very hard to adjust to this film's rhythm and style, but after a good half hour I was settled and in for a great ride. The Hughes brothers have created a very dark, bleak, infested London here. It is shockingly realistic.Almost immediately, the film offers many suspects as to who the real Jack the Ripper might be. Not trying to sound clever here, but, I knew who the killer was very early on, as I also believe, after many conversations with people, that Jack the Ripper was indeed who this film makes him out to be! And the motive? Ah, the motive is pure gold! I hadn't thought of it like that before, but my God, it makes every bit of sense!London looks like some kind of ghetto here, and the mood is set for a thriller that will indeed shock many of it's viewers. The brothers do very well not to completely step into the 'slasher' genre - thank God! But the murders, or what we see of them , are very realistic.Johnny Depp, always a favourite actor of mine, does well in his role as a detective who is fighting, well not really, coming to terms with really, his addiction to opium. Poor sod. As far as performance goes, he is solid, but his accent does, at times, waver between cockney and Australian, but he stays with it, and we believe his performance. Heather Graham on the other hand, is slightly less convincing as Mary Kelly, one of the five prostitutes who have information that is worth their lives. Irish is she? Whatever you say guv'nor. Beautiful though!The story, if your not concentrating, is kinda complex. You don't need a degree in Ripperology to 'get' this film though, it's a stand alone depiction of one of many theories that surround the Ripper murders. It's gruesome to think that this actually went on.At one point though, I was so caught up in the film, that I forgot the theory that I had clutched to throughout and created a new one to coincide with the film's narrative...Johnny Depp's 'visions' might not have been visions, it could have been him that committed the murders, in an opium induced state. At the time it made sense, and it still does now, it was a 'Fight Club' type twist that I had conceived. Interesting though!The supporting cast are great, Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane do remarkably well in their roles respectively.The ending is welcome. It makes a change from the Hollywood ending's that are churned out nowadays.This film didn't live upto my expectations though, but it didn't dissapoint on the whole.7/10Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Stylish Thriller,"David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky and Quentin Tarantino are all well-known for their intentive and creative visual style. Perhaps, it is time to add the Hughes brothers to this list of impressive visual stylists. Obviously, they already had a gritty realistic film (""Menace II Society"") to their credit. ""From Hell"" is an equally terrific film in terms of camerawork and colors. The 1880 redish skyline of London is as dark, gritty and realistic in this film as any other film I can remember. It is not just the art and set direction which make this production so realistic and interesting; the editing and camera movement is intense and helps glue the viewer's eyes to the screen. Proof of the powerful mise en scene and editing of ""From Hell"" are in the murder sequences. These scenes are more creative and disturbing, yet gripping than anything in most the horror films made in the last few years. The performances are solid, but not all that memorable in comparison to the overall style of this film. A 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting take on the Jack the Ripper case.,"The story is a pretty good mystery on the murders of Jack the Ripper. The movie does a good job on building up the whole mystery of it and the murders. I really like the visions that Frederick has in the movie that is both unique and disturbing. I also think it's interesting to theorize on who is Jack the Ripper is and his motive. The characters are pretty interesting to get to know them.Frederick is the main character who has a good development about his past and has visions of the murders. He's a likeable character who wants to solve the case of the murders. Mary is a young prostitute who builds up a relationship with the main character. She doesn't appear a lot in the movie. The other characters don't have that much to offered. The revealed and the ending I have mix thoughts about.

Real life Ripped off,From Hell takes a genuine theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper and dramatises it. We follow opium addicted inspector Abberline played by Johnny Depp as he tried to discover exactly who is stalking Londons East End. It had better not be Phil Mitchell again.The film is stylishly shot and really brings grimy victorian London to life. The story is interesting and well known. However the film is just far too long. I felt it would be far better and more gripping had it been a good half an hour shorter. It was littered with useless scenes which dragged on leaving you bored as much as you tried to get into the story. It was like the director just couldn't make up his mind what to cut and said to hell with it.The character of Jack the Ripper needing a carriage driver to get around London (with no one noticing a huge black carriage at every murder scene) reduced the impact of the character. He just didn't feel as evil or as vile when you knew without his lackey he'd be waiting for the bus like the rest of us.Just a few niggles like this prevents me from giving it my highest scores. It had potential to be a fantastic murder mystery but instead ends up too long winded for its own good. As a result is not a film you would like to see too many times.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish and visually striking version of fabricated events.,"So let's get this straight, the African-American directing team the Hughes Brothers - fresh off a hot streak including Menace II Society and Dead Presidents decide that their follow up would be an English period dramatic thriller? Well yes it was folks, and to prepare for making their Jack the Ripper flick they watched Bram Stoker's Dracula about a million times, and ripped off almost everything but the plot.There is much poetic license taken here, apparently it is based upon a fictionalised comic book version that I have never heard of, but then realistically I haven't heard about any comic that hasn't already been made into a movie.What I like is that it opens with a quote from good ole Jack himself, considering no-one knows who he is that seems a huge leap of faith.So to summarise The Hughes Brothers' version, Jack is not a random hack'n'slash guy roaming the back streets, but a calculated intelligent and skilled surgeon hell-bent on killing specific targets. In this case a sextet of hookers led by Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, yup good 'ole Rollergirl herself.Now I've heard that Heather absolutely butchers the English accent in this, but as I am not especially familiar with the particulars of the dialect I can't be sure. As an Australian I can definitely tell when someone is massacring the Oz accent, so I guess the best people to ask would be British locals.Now these hookers owe some seedy guys from the Nicholls Street gang some cash, and more than 6 scrags can make in reasonable time at their trade. The boss of the gang McQueen is hanging around in menacing fashion, basically providing a nice red herring suspect for the early stages.This is sorta the first 10 minutes of the flick, and is real confusing, especially if you aren't paying attention, but in reality it matters not a zack, as aside from showing that the hookers are buddies it means nothing.Shortly after we have the first kill, one of the hookers is found minus some vital lady bits and a fair bit of blood. So we finally get to meet Johnny Depp as Inspector Abaline, and his Sergeant played by Robbie Coltrane.Now a digression: I should hate Johnny Depp, he is pretty, bangs supermodels, is rich, and was famous and cocky when very young. I should hate and boycott Johnny Depp movies just like I hate Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and Hugh Grant. But I don't.Why? I tried to find out why by looking at his IMDb page, and what I came up with was that over his whole career he has never once made a film that was obviously just for the cash. Beside this he has latched on to Tim Burton, one of the most consistently interesting directors over the last 20 odd years, which means every few years he will have a film released that I will likely see.Back to Hell. Aberline is a little bit of an opium addict, and dabbles with other nasties too, so much so that he has visions of what is likely to happen in the future regarding the hookers. Now I drink - often to excess - and even though I am not fortunate enough to have visions (if anything I lose memories I already have) I would think it extremely fortunate to have visions of people I have never met, but will soon.More kills ensue and it's 3 down, 3 to go. Turns out that the hookers, being poor and unfortunate, cannot afford luxuries like fruit, so they are lured to their doom with the temptation of grapes. This works apparently on almost every occasion, so it is obvious too that they are poor, unfortunate and stupid.So Aberline, working on a hunch, goes to meet some noted surgeons in the hope that they could enlighten his theory that an educated and trained man is doing the killing further. There he meets Bilbo Baggins, I mean the Royal surgeon and physician Dr Gull, who confirms and supports his theory.Without delving further and giving away too much there is a key subplot which eventually somewhat clumsily becomes intertwined with the key story, there are cover ups, secret orders and societies, red herrings and short-term suspects and corruption at the highest level. Basically everything a grown boy needs.Ultimately the film unmasks the ""real"" killer, or at least this version's killer, and while it is at least ballsy that they decide to name one guy and come up with a motive and backstory, it does feel very much like a flimsy attempt at a plausible story. There must have been hundreds of leaps of faith taken to piece the thing together from scratch, and if one or two of those aren't in fact true which is likely the case the whole house of cards falls.But did I like it? Not really, it was OK and vaguely interesting from start to finish, but I never really cared who lived or died, and there was no scene that was especially memorable over the whole 2 odd hours.Except That I watched Bram Stoker's Dracula a few months back, and I tell ya From Hell has so many similarities in feel, tone and vision that if you watched them back to back you might think they were part of a series.Seriously, that's all I can remember, is someone asks me next week I'll say: ""It reminds me of Bram Stoker's Dracula.""

2nd Best Film of 2001,"Just got in from seeing From Hell, and, while I was expecting good things, I came away incredibly impressed.  Everything about this movie gelled wonderfully, from the tightly knit story based on the graphic novel of the same name, to the beautiful cinematography (the image of the blood red skies over London is not easily forgotten), to the acting was pitch perfect for the film.  The acting especially was a pleasant surprise, as Heather Graham gave a fine performance despite normally having the acting range of stucco. Johnny Depp basically resumed his part from Sleepy Hollow, but added to it nicely to create a much more realistic character.

Wonderfully done!!  Some parts a little hazy though.,"When going to see this movie I was set up to be disappointed.  I usually like Johnny Depp, but then I thought about The 9th Gate, which was a horrible movie.  Some of the trailers I had seen made the two look similar. Also, the time and place was given at the start of the movie, which led me to believe that some would take place in the past, but then shift to the present, which is a cheap trick some movies use.  Man, was I wrong.  I was taken on thrill ride that few movies take me on.  The plot is extremely deep and complicated and I was never able to correctly guess the outcome.  The movie is very film noire and is shot in a style similar to Se7en and Fight Club, specifically the way the film flashes between images quickly during some scenes.  The only thing I found lacking with the film is that it did not give very much background detail as to why Jack the Ripper was killing people.  There was some, but not enough to explain why those specific people were being killed.  All in all, though, it is at the top of my list of favorite movies and I can't wait for the DVD!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a very tough, realistic and unflinching tale","I wasn´t expecting this to be very good, in fact I expected an over-stylized Hollywood version of Alan Moore´s great and horrific Ripper-tale. The Hughes brothers previous DEAD PRESIDENTS, I found to be overlong, overexplicit and illogic. So I was (un)pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very tough, realistic and unflinching tale. Not since SE7EN, have I squirmed in my seat so much. What´s impressive is among other things, Peter Demings cinematography and the brilliant sets which really transports you back in time. The stylized visions and scene transitions work very well and never become overly flashy. I also didn´t find Johnny Depps Cockney-accent irritating, which I also was expecting, he´s done another great role here. As for Heather Graham, she´s been criticized of being too pretty for this part, and maybe that´s true, but on the other hand, wouldn´t it have been just as unrealistic if every prostitute of that time was ugly-lookin´? Very effective score and sound design also. This is the best work of the Hughes Brothers thus far. A nice touch was also the very ""unflashy"" main titles.",,Anonymous,Horror

From Hell stands out as an exceptional thriller and a captivating portrayal of the Jack the Ripper tale,"I recently revisited From Hell (2001) on Tubi. The film unravels the emergence of a serial killer in 1888 London. The local law enforcement become desperate and seek the aid of an eccentric detective who employs unique methods to crack the case. Venturing into the underworld of drugs, prostitution, and politics, he uncovers a web of lies, deceit, and manipulation, all pointing to a potential core: the killer.Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes (The Book of Eli) and featuring Johnny Depp (Blow), Heather Graham (The Hangover), Sir Ian Holm (The Lord of the Rings), and Jason Flemyng (Deep Rising), the film brilliantly captures the era with its meticulous attention to settings, props, and outfits. The dark and gloomy London backdrop sets the perfect tone, complemented by a fascinating array of characters superbly portrayed. While Depp delivers a stellar performance, the supporting cast is equally captivating.The film's portrayal of underground prostitution is both entertaining and well-executed. The intricate ties to the government add another layer of fascination, culminating in a brilliant ending that masterfully ties everything together.In conclusion, From Hell stands out as an exceptional thriller and a captivating portrayal of the Jack the Ripper tale. I would give it a score of 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylistic and empty,"Let me start off by saying _From Hell_ is not a bad film. It is stylistically very striking, and the Hughes Brothers have done a great job in getting London dirty in recreating Victorian times. The atmosphere, the characters (with the exception of the luminous Heather Graham, the cleanest whore in all of London!) are all consistent with a dank, dirty city. The murders are well shot, all the actors are hit their marks, and the film doesn't sensationalise the violence to a great extent.But... having read the graphic novel the movie is based on, I was disappointed. Alan Moore's tale sought to humanize a group of people preyed upon by the Ripper while bringing some motivation to the Ripper murders. The murderer is known from the outset, and it is the character interplay and the metaphysics of the story that provide the fiction's flavour.The Hughes Brothers have instead chose to make a whodunnit of the tale, and have cut out a lot of the story away. I could see the trails of the original narrative trailing throughout the movie, but that only left me disappointed when I saw other bits left out. Mr Moore's narrative would I have been very difficult to film, and would have lasted for hours. Even so, I felt more could have been done. In chaptering the style of _From Hell_, I feel the Hughes Brothers have left out the heart.And I feel for those confused by the end of the movie. It makes some sense in the graphic novel, but really seems dropped out of nowhere in the film.Overall, not a bad film, but it was unable to live up to the source material.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

just wanted everyone to know,"i haven't found anyone's mention of this, so i thought i might make one. anyone who has a problem with this movie's script, and especially those who have naysayed it due to knowledge of its genesis in comic book form, you're all considered to me numb from the neck up unless you actually read the comic before uttering such statements.  the comic itself, though, grantedly, nothing altogether new, is a brilliant meditation on the ripper murders. the concept that held the comic strong, for some reason, was lost in the transition to film, namely William Gull's hallucinations of our society, and Abberline was not an absinthe addict.  watching the movie, you can tell they threw a lot of what's in there simply to create an eyepleasing nineteenth century gothic video shawl.  the actual people (remember, these are actually supposed to be real people, not fictional characters) don't look two clicks like depp or graham.  holm is class, but the character's a miss.  if filmmakers who were more devoted to the story had actually spearheaded this effort, they would have had something special.as the film was, it was mostly decent.  i remember leaving the theater entertained but hardly impressed.  but again, you all should read the comic before you mock it.  if you do, you'll find a challenging tale, often too practical to be mere mythwriting.  the worthwhile Alan Moore penned it, and fellow brit Eddie Campbell laid down some clean, methodical artwork, that at times turns grisly and disconcerting.  it's really a fine example of contemporary literature.  basically, what all this gabbing is trying to say, is don't knock it till you try it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Avoid like Jack the Ripper,"There's artistic licence, and there's make-believe. This production picked out a dozen facts and then passed it over to the fiction team to create their own Jack the Ripper parody. Unfortunately, this team seems never to have stepped foot in London and relied on their postcard knowledge of the city to include the likes of Big Ben and St Pauls Cathedral as background images for Whitechapel. So too have they taken endless liberties to misrepresent the historical facts concerning real people in order to establish some semblance of a plot.Despite all these flaws and errors, the result is still a fictional failure. I was hard-pressed to keep myself awake and endure the childish script, weak direction and poor acting (Depp). I do love the era and nuances of East End, so for that reason alone I raise my rating to 3 stars out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Se7en meets Sleepy Hallow,"If you've seen and liked ""Se7en"" or ""Sleepy Hallow"" you most likely will enjoy ""From Hell"". I viewed it on it's region 1 DVD with the DTS sound track. The first thing I noticed was the sound. It puts you right in the middle of an eerie environment that can only get more creepy. It really gives your surround speakers something to play with. Then there is the film. The scenes that stuck out to me best were the flickers of grainy, distorted flashbacks that i can best describe as ""Something out of a Marlin Manson Video"". The whole ambience fits both the story of a serial killer and the slums of old London. The makers of this ""almost epic"" did a good job making it hard for the viewer to figure out who was Jack the Ripper. It was a relief to me since in the past couple years most crime stories end up being predictable. I've been told that this movie is based on a book. I haven't read it so i can't judge the film based on how well it fallows the book.I give it 9/10 I was looking for a good old' crime story and it ended up killing more then just a couple of hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish and suspenseful,"I loved it.  I thought it was a great mix of Victorian era whodunnit, horror, and a little bit of the paranormal.  The time and place are presented more convincingly than many other films set in the same era.  The mystery is well-plotted and paced, and matches the real life events with a more than plausible explanation for their occurrence.  There is a paranormal aspect to this interpretation, but it does not detract from the plot or stray off needlessly into either laborious exposition or lala-land new agey stoner mysticism.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole film, and the payoff was worth it.  Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Moderate 'Jack the Ripper' horror.,"Atmospheric Jack the Ripper flick that not only provided plenty of gore, but food for thought too, about the role the Masons and the Royal Family had to play in the Ripper's brutal killings in Victorian London.Johnny Depp's cockney accent made me wince at times, (it's much improved in 'Pirates of the Caribbean'!). But the sets were realistic enough and I got a 'feel' of how the poorer areas of London might have been in that era. But the characters weren't developed enough for me to empathize with any of them in any capacity. Any film featuring Johnny Depp is always worth a look in my opinion <g> but I wouldn't bother watching it twice.",,Anonymous,Horror
Shoddy direction,"This was not a well crafted film. I kept thinking I was watching some made for TV movie of the week. It was supposed to be a mystery, but you would have to be a total dunce to not figure out who the Ripper was. I will give you a hint, it is the obvious choice that the filmmakers attempt to shy you away from. Then there was Heather Graham, the great actress from Austin Powers (do you sense some sarcasm?) Heather Graham's accent kept reminding me of the Gilligan's Island episode where Mary Ann played the cockneyed flower girl. You know the one, where Gilligan was Mr. Hyde? Come to think of it, that episode was scarier than this film. Depp was pretty good, he usually is. However, the story was just not very convincing and full of holes. There were many gadgets and tricks that you have seen a hundred times before and the climax was so predictable. If you don't have an interest in Jack the Ripper, you are not likely to gain one after watching this film. These two brothers made a name for themselves directing gangsta films and I think that is where there strength lies, if they have a strength. Leave the historical based films to better story tellers. This was  ABC & MTV ""go to the movies"" and the result is a film that will leave you wandering what is on TBS later that night. Perhaps I am being too harsh, but as student of the Jack the Ripper case, I felt letdown.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting take on history...,"This film was done in class. It could have been done with much more visceral decorations since it was not done that way, it is much better for it.

**** out of 5,"Before Manson and before Gein and before Burkowitz there was Jack the Ripper. There is something about serial killers that fascinate me but there is something about this film that sits horribly unwell with me, maybe that's half the fun of it. Where Helter Skelter and Summer of Sam gave us a biographical accout (although fictionalized in Summer of Sam) of our well known killers, this film puts us into a time frame where these events happened and tells us not what actually happened but what could have happened. For all those who have not followed the story of Jack the Ripper should know that the case never got the proper explanation it deserved and has gone unsolved all these years. It is 1888 and a madman is killing off prostitutes in a ritualistic fashion. It is up to Scotland Yard inspector, Fred Abberline (a riviting Johnny Depp) who is sent to track down the killer because he posses a power to visualize the crimes in his dreams before they happen. The killers methods are that of an educated man as he always pursuades the girls with grapes and something to drink, then he slits their throat and steals some of their intestines. Heather Graham is the uninteresting, yet important Mary Kelly, on of the whores who seems to be marked for death and also begins a romance with Abberline that is probably unlikly considering the time frame but thats debatable. Ripper followers won't get anything new from the film but is still interesting to watch nevertheless. It is clear that the Hughes Brothers have directional talent. The remind me here of a cross between Tim Burton and David Lynch and must be given credit for not reducing the film to a mindless slasher flick. The film playes more like a dense, atmospheric character study rather than the tense thriller the trailer suggested even though there is no lack of violence and and plenty of gore and did I mention several are very chilling. Where most films like this try to hard to provide vibrent costumes and elegant landscapes this film delievers both but never strays away from the task at hand, it's not out to proove a point, but trying to at least get one across. The only flaw I can visably point out is that the most effective scenes are the ones that feature Jack the Ripper himself, just to bad the film tries harder to portray Depp's drug problems and relationship with Graham that the Ripper seems to be put on a side note than a major plot point like one would expect, loosing a bit of the overall power and effect, but with strong scripting and psychidelic direction this one, although very hard to stomach, is well worth the while.",,Anonymous,Horror
It hurts to think about this one,"After watching half an hour or so of From Hell I felt as if the Hughes Brothers had strapped me down and performed some impromptu butchery on my brain.  As soon as I saw that opening shot of London's blood-red skyline (after a promising into that does for opium what Pulp Fiction did for heroin) I knew that this movie was going to be an unrestrained and unsubtle Hollywood dream of Victorian England.What is it about pre-twentieth century Britain that makes American filmmakers froth at the mouth and scream ""More blood! More filters!  More simple-minded exposition!""?  1992's Dracula at least had the excuse of basing its extravagant visuals on an equally lurid literary source, but From Hell's betters are, well, better than that.  I loved the original graphic novel for its black and white images that looked like swiftly executed but amazingly skilful sketches.  There was a subtlety of artifice that made the story all the more terrifying.So much for that.  The Hughes Brothers pour on every daft trick they can think of to conceal the fact that a) they have no feeling for late-1800s London, except as a Cockney version of inner-city Washington; and b) the screenwriters Hayes and Yglesias didn't know to condense the wealth of information and paranoid plot detail from the original into a working screenplay.  The pacing of From Hell is, as another commentator noticed, bizarre.  The first act, before Depp's character begins to take an interest in the movie, is unbelievable clunky and awkward.  The early moments seem drained of drama, as if they were tentative character improvisations in the first days of shooting rather than actual scripted scenes.  Characters step into frame to announce their plot significance and motivation and then step off again; if they're not played by Depp, Graham, or Holm, they're onscreen only to talk desperately or menacingly, show cleavage or knives, and kill or be killed.In case you're wondering, Heather Graham does not make a convincing Victorian prostitute.  After five seconds of screen time, even before she opened her mouth to attempt a Cockney accent, it is immediately apparent that a casting mistake has been made.  The real horror of From Hell comes from the suspense between Graham's scenes; you never know when she's going to pop up next and whine out a line about being hungry and impoverished. It is like being lied to by someone who has stolen your jacket and wears it in front of you; you admire the audacity but you are not convinced.The rest of the cast stands up to the overbearing directorial style with a campy resistance that produces some enjoyment.  I liked Depp's thuggish London accent, which has him saying things like ""Fank you"" and ""I fink there's somefing going on here"".  Ian Holm jumps around in the birdbath of his own cultural folklore and makes all the other performances seem amateurish.This movie, like a whole schwack of others, is a kind of film soup: part inner-city police procedural, part period piece, part slasher flick.  Other generic elements surface occasionally, but the Hughes Brothers wield such a furious spoon that it's hard to see the ingredients.  The conflicting requirements of genre sometimes produce anachronisms and unlikelihoods that strain the limits of credibility.  Heather Graham's character Mary Kelly is an Irish peasant who left at the age of eight to take up an exciting career in Whitechapel as a prostitute, but she can read and write - and has beautiful penmanship.  Say what you like about the institution of schools in Victorian England; it's still ridiculous.More ridiculous still are scenes in which Kelly suggests that she left Ireland and came to England because ""it seemed too small a place to live the rest of my life in"".  Never mind the crushing poverty, the potato blight, and the stigma of being an Irish Catholic in Victorian England.  It's all about that restless feeling that makes you want to leave your dead-end town, get on that ferry and take your hopes and dreams to glitzy glamorous Whitechapel.  And all at the age of eight, apparently.  I can only hope that I misheard something.  A bit more forgiveable (but no less stupid) is the uncomfortable resemblance between the London constabulary of 1888 and the NYPD circa 1988.  Inspector Abberline, when he's not having opium-induced visions, acts like a renegade American cop with an infusion of British politeness.  As the movie progresses, examinations of the corpses begin to sound more and more like the autopsy scenes from ""Silence of the Lambs"".The really anachronistic, or perhaps historically blind, elements of From Hell would involve giving away the whodunnit modular unit of the film, so you'll have to see it yourself. But don't.  Unless you like blood (there's lots), or Johnny Depp's cheekbones (does this man never age?), or if you enjoy the spectator sport of watching lesser-known British actors steal scene after scene from hapless American stars.  There's also some really really bad continuity errors.  Jason Flemyng plays a tormented coachman with one of his ears partially lopped off.  Watch for the scene in the film that explains his torments and explores his psyche. It consists almost entirely of a close-up on his face. Take a look at his ears.  Then leave the theatre: tell people you've just come from hell.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Engaging, dark, and will keep your attention...","Johnny Depp, as Inspector Abberline has the daunting task of finding Jack the Ripper, who has killed five or more females who live in the impoverished Whitechapel District of London in 1885.Victorian England is believably well-constructed here. The film evinces the streets, dark and dank 'doss houses', and the wretched lives on the East End of Whitechapel. It's not glamorized, it was a slum (I have visited London and Mitre Square, while now surrounded by business and banks, is indeed a sad parking area,and a tourist sign still demarcates the victim who was found there.There are several theories hinted at here, Sir William Gull (excellently portrayed by Ian Holm) the physician to Queen Victoria and her grandson, who was afflicted with a social disease. Sir William was an experienced surgeon and also a Freemason. The Masonic Lodge plays into theories here as well, as the area where several female victims were found mutilated was close by.However, there are other theories also.The visuals of this film are noteworthy. The red sky and Westminter Chapel, the cold brutality of winters in an era of workhouses and little options for the impoverished.While not a solution to the mystery (we may never have one), Depp , Holm and the performance of Heather Graham as Irish street walker and victim ""Mary Kelly"" is worth watching. You will get a feel for the era.Sir Ian Holm, as he teaches an anatomy class and states : ""the heart is a stubborn muscle, like mahogany, it is almost impossible to burn"", as we see the visual in his mind of throwing a victims heart into the boiling kettle in his fireplace.It is a pastiche of events, but does give one a sense of the murders, and what life must have felt like for those who were not born into royalty in Victorian England.

Aptly titled,"There's a couple of sources from which movies can be adapted from,with varying results,but one entertainment medium that never fails to equal in poor films are graphic novels. From Hell is an adaptation of one that is based off of The Ripper killings. There's certainly been a number of films based on Jack The Ripper almost all of which are of inferior quality.
A very good actor can raise a mediocre film but likewise an atrocious film,like From Hell,can drag down an actor as skilled as Johnny Depp. Perhaps this picture would only have been half as bad if it was directed by one person instead of two. Or maybe it would have been twice as worse. Either way the director(s) of the film are a dangerous combination of being sapient and talentless;trying to create an atmosphere of terror and mystique but leaving a disaster of a finished product.

"Good, but not great...","There are many things wrong with this take on the Ripper legend, but many things that are right too. First I'll start with the things that are wrong...The most obvious component of the movie that lets it down is Heather Graham. Her performance is below par at best and downright terrible at worst. Her accent is all over the place and she never seems at ease with the material or her role in the film. She's also far too clean and well scrubbed when compared to the other prostitutes in the film. She doesn't look like a streetwalker. I wish they would have got Samantha Morton to play the role instead...The film's other major problem is another accent; Johhny Depp's. To be honest, I think his performance is pretty good. He certainly conveys the weary, tired emotions that Abberline feels, but the cockney accent is more mockney than anything else. I'm not sure what it's meant to be. However, apart from that, he's excellent in the role...To the film's strengths though. The sense of atmosphere is superb. The production design, costumes and photography give the film tangible quality. It is truly, despite the horrid events that take place, a beautiful film to look at. It's also to the Hughes brothers' credit that the visual stylings that could have ended up as excessive indulgencies really add to the film. Lapse time photography is used, colours are changed, underwater shots are used, short flashes are spliced in, and all of them work. They give the film a vibrancy and energy.The rest of the cast also add greatly to the film. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm in particular are superb. Both give performances that eclipse the leads and both appear to be working effortlessly...The script is also pretty good. It's a fictionalised take on the events, so there's no question of squabbling about authenticity. All that matters is that as a story, in my opinion, it works. It twists, it turns, and it provides a few surprises along the way. It certainly could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse too...All in all, I think From Hell is a pretty decent attempt. It doesn't indulge in the vacuous blood letting of teenage slasher films and provides the viewer with a decent interpretation of the Ripper myth.",,Anonymous,Horror
Displaying the social relevance the remarkable move From Hell deserves in a review.,"It Was Indeed Along Those Lines(Displaying the social relevance the remarkable movie, From Hell, deserves in a review)Perhaps few episodes in history have had more entwining attempts at interpretation than the carnage practiced upon London's underworld by the ignoble ""Jack the Ripper"". This writer can think of one at present, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Be as it may, though differences are stark, these two events are both ignoble, made much more so, by the complicity of authorities, in both the progress towards their culmination and the cover-up of evidence, even to the extent of the murder of witnesses. Again, the ramifications go much further, even deep within the social fabric. For they touch upon the use of secrecy to hide misdeed and secret societies to commit them.The movie, From Hell is excellent, venturing into areas of high probability to weave a likely scenario with the established facts at hand, making sense of the puzzling anomalies so carefully avoided historically. So well does it succeed, we might wonder when the JFK assassination will be visited in similar fashion. The significance becomes imperative when society's own prerogatives are becoming more and more constrained to the privileged few.Excellent use of casting talent, the best job I've seen Depp perform, sets and camera work exquisitely utilized. Hope this exceptional film reaches the clarity threshold with you it did with this reviewer.JCH",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's been done!,"From Hell is a stylish, visually pleasing film but it's actually nothing more than a remake of Murder By Decree.

The performances and look of the film were great, but unfortunately there wasn't an iota of an original idea in the story.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Well made, but strangely un-involving (and a lesser copy of ""Murder by decree"")","I approached this movie with great expectations. But only in one field was I rewarded: the technical credits are impeccible. Victorian London is atmospherically recreated and cinematography is above reproach. However, basically this is a remake of the 1979 film ""Murder by decree"" with minor alterations (mostly concerning the Mary Kelly/Heather Graham-part). And in a comparison this movie is the lesser one almost in every aspect. Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed ""From Hell"" and thought it was quite a good movie.But somehow it never moved me at all. I admired it to be sure, but never really liked it. First of all, the casting has it flaws. Heather Graham is a good actress, but is totally wrong here, looking like a whore who spends all her sparetime at Vidal Sassoon. The other ""girls"" looked more the part and I thought Geena Davis-lookalike Susan Lynch did a good job.Johnny Depp is quite good actually but doesn't compare to Christopher Plummer in ""Murder by decree"". The only parts I really liked was Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm. Especially Holm manages to be very convincing and deliver a surprise or two. The story tries to get away with some surprises and twists also, but you spot them a mile away unfortunately. You get some of the advantages from a big budget here, but also a lot of the disadvantages. The scenery looks just like a scenery and I was never once convinced about the dirt and filth in Victorian Whitechapel.And, finally, this film didn't have Genevieve Bujold who in ""Murder by decree"", despite very limited screentime, alone managed to bring more pathos and emotion into that picture than every castmember in this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Orright Meery Pappins?"" - return of the fake Mockney accent.","The movie was enjoyable enough. Good atmosphere, not a bad plot (making the Ripper a political murder was certainly a new twist), good set design, good lighting, plenty of gore and so on.There was however one person involved with this film who completely ruined it for me. That person should be buried in sand at least a cable's length from the shore. Who was this person?  Johnny Depp's voice coach, that's who. That accent was just plain wrong in several respects.Firstly it wasn't a London accent - presumably it was meant to be a Cockney accent but they didn't even try for generic ""London"". It was an ""Estuary"" accent - a sort of mishmash generalised ""South East England"" accent which has become widespread on TV over the past 15-20 years . In US terms, let's say they'd taken a Trenton, NJ accent and said ""OK, that's close enough to a Brooklyn accent; they're both in the north-eastern US"" when it MATTERED that the speaker was from Brooklyn.Secondly an accent like that would not (even in the 21st century) denote ""middle-class"" (as Depps character was described); it's a very working class accent. Nothing in the least wrong with that, but it simply doesn't work (and it's simply not conceivable that someone would have made his way up from the ""working classes"" to become a police Inspector in the 1880s). Thirdly, and what wrecked it for me completely, was that Depp's voice coach had Depp doing a more-than-workmanlike impression of David Beckham (English soccer player and alleged style icon). The impression was so accurate that I have to believe he did it on purpose. I kept waiting for the Inspector to start discussing England's chances of qualifying for the European Soccer Championships!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable but already done before,"I've read a lot of negative comments about ""From Hell"".  I guess they were expecting a lot more bloodletting then they received.

Having once taken the ""Jack the Ripper"" tour of Whitechappel their film agreed pretty much with what I was told.The overall acting was pretty good.  Johnny Depp did his usual job of performing on the stage much like he did in ""Ed Woods"" and other films. Heather Graham and the others made for great window dressing.I won't get into the other details of the film except to say that it reminded me of a much earlier film which starred Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Dr. Watson.

Victorian London via Hollywood,"Going into this film, I had to realize that I am a great fan of the graphic novel; I consider it to be one of the great works of graphic storytelling, along with ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Watchmen"".  It is, therefore, somewhat difficult to put aside any bias I might have had toward this film from the beginning.  I did try, but it certainly didn't make it easy.First, just to start off light, for the good points: the film is visually quite arresting.  The sets, the cinematography, the camera work, all work together to create a very interesting vision of 1880's London.  It isn't what you'd call a realistic vision, but it is interesting nonetheless. Unfortunately, visually stylistic films are a dime a dozen these days.  It takes more than that to impress.Sadly, the film doesn't have much else.  The Hughes brothers are obviously quite familiar with the novel, but sadly, they've only picked out the seedy trappings of it, and left out what really made it work.  Where the novel extensively examined the world in which Jack went about his work, the film ditches all of that and settles instead on a standard murder mystery.  We've seen this story a hundred times in countless modern serial killer thrillers. By keeping the identity of Jack a mystery, and following the investigations of Inspector Abberline, they have reduced the story to something very drab and unoriginal.Among the worst touches is Abberline's psychic ability.  The ""vision"" sequences are more annoyingly modern than creepy, and really don't seem to help him much in his investigations, or aid the story in its journey.  They simply add an unwelcome supernatural element to events based (however loosely) on reality.  I can only imagine that the film-makers' intention was to combine two characters from the novel.  However, the novel's ""psychic"" admitted to being a fraud.  So why is this here?A Hollywood product mentality is found throughout the production.  While the supporting whore roles are filled out very believably, Heather Graham is instead cast in the role of the ""Friday The 13th"" virgin who is immune to harm because we never see her engaging in sex.  She stands out like a sore thumb among the grime with her colorful dress and pretty hair and makeup. They've done away with Abberline's marriage in order to make way for a romance with Heather Graham's ""whore"".  And the mistaken-identity ending sets up a conclusion so saccharine as to belong in a Shirley Temple movie.In the end ""From Hell"" turns out to be nothing more than a standard Hollywood serial killer movie with the words ""Jack the Ripper"" inserted into it.  5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes, London looks miserable and morosely unpleasant, but it adds a degree of mystique and squalor to the tale.Using Americans as main characters and expecting them to master the cockney accent is a bridge too far, and if you pay attention you'll figure out the plot twist fairly early, but I enjoyed this film immensely, and if you suspend your disbelief, I'm certain that you will too!

"Spectacular film, but remember: FICTION.","""From Hell"" is an adaptation of the royal conspiracy theory that came into existence in the 1970's.  As a work of fiction, it's great; it is full of political intrigue and makes for a great story.  Depp and Holm really carry it well, and the directors show us a part of victorian england without sugar coating it- the poverty-stricken east end, the drunk, starving people: the working class.  It's here that the Ripper committed his gruesome murders.The only catch is that this is strictly a work of fiction.  There is absolutely nothing to back up the royal conspiracy except bits of heresay. Sure, it could have been covered up well, but it's by far one of the least likely possibilities.  It's tempting to romanticize the story in the hope that these killings had a motive; when in fact they very well might have been random.As a film, A+.  But a film only; not a documentary.",,Anonymous,Horror
Had potential...,"This movie started out in a very promising way. It used some very intersting direction and cinematography to illustrate the ""dreams"" that Johnny Depp's character has while smoking opium. It was very effective and gripping film work. I was very excited when these scenes were shown. Unfortunately, those scenes turned out to be few and far between. From a director's point of view, I believe they were used as an instrument to catch the audience's attention.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow up with with that momentum. Instead, the plot gets rather murky and dark. Although this is understandable considering the subject matter, it produces some very boring and long scenes. By the end of the movie, I found myself often looking at my watch...not a good sign.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Depp Is On Top Form But Graham Is Too Attractive,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to From Hell.I have always liked this one, and find it enjoyable. Depp is in top form, Robbie Coltrane is always reliable, Ian Holm hams it up brilliantly and the under rated Paul Rhys is as solid as ever. That man should have had a much bigger career.If there is one criticism of the cast it is Heather Graham. Ignoring her accent, she is simply too attractive!! I can't imagine a single punter who would pay for sex with any of the other prostitutes, when Graham's Mary Kelly was about!!Dark, brooding and full of intense atmosphere, I usually revisit this every couple of years.From Hell grossed $31 million the domestic box office to end 2001 as the 75th highest grossing movie of the year.Following the high of Sleepy Hollow $101 mill (21st) Depp's more mainstream movies were headed in the wrong direction.

take dark to the next level,"""From Hell"" presents something not seen in movies since the old Sherlock Holmes movies. It tells the story of an inspector (Johnny Depp) investigating the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888 London, but it suggests that the decadent aristocrats in a way aren't much better than the murderer himself. Of course, the setting is like a star on its own: eerie, dismal streets that look like they could be hiding almost anything...ANYTHING. As for the question of historical accuracy, that doesn't really seem to be an issue. You have to focus on the bleak, evil surroundings to really get the feeling.Depp is great in his role, as can be expected. Also starring is Heather Graham as prostitute Mary Kelly; let me tell you, this is a role very far removed from her comedic ones. Robbie Coltrane plays a sergeant; because of this movie's grim nature, you probably will be able to forget that he plays Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies. Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng and Katrin Cartlidge also star. Maybe the most surprising thing about ""From Hell"" is that it was directed by Albert and Allen Hughes (known for movies like ""Dead Presidents"").Overall, this is not a movie to be missed. It just goes to show that real horror entails that which we don't know. Very well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rose from hell, halfway to heaven!","Review Four: From HellA five out of ten is by no means bad, From Hell isn't filmed badly, nor has it bad characterization, writing or acting. The special effects are average, too. Everything is just average in this film. It's not memorable, nor does leave ones mind instantly. From Hell is the definition of average, and with that it's not easy to say the film is recommended.The Gothic scape's are visually appealing, and much as one would expect. With the addition of Johnny Depp, one could easily think it was an early, toned down Tim Burton film, albeit not quite as absurd, fun or well directed. Released in 2001, the film has aged well over the last 10 years. One may be surprised it is that old.Yes, essentially this story of Jack The Ripper is a dramatized retelling, and all the better for it. Finding myself almost falling asleep throughout some scenes (when not even tired), the pacing isn't quite the best, either. Some scenes are unnecessary, some are over-drawn and some of the more exciting scenes aren't long enough.What was a fine film, however, has an ending so largely disappointing. This, again, isn't due to a script, nor the acting. it is purely from the directing style. It's, in text, satisfying ending, but it's just poorly executed. Possibly the issue with this film is that it takes itself 100% seriously, attempting to surprise with answers an audience is already familiar with. Essentially it spends so long building questions (and giving away the answers far too soon) that it detracts from the experience.For those a fan of the Jack The Ripper tale; this is a 5 out of 10 film, it's far from the best and you've seen it all before. Still, with it's own charm it is worth viewing. For those expecting a 'who did it' thriller, you'll leave severely disappointed with a 3/10. Anyone hoping for anything more akin to the Sherlock Holmes (2010) style model, loaded with dark humor, acting and a thrilling narrative, this film is far from it.A SOLID 5 OUT OF 10. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it, but for $5 when no other options are out there, grab it for a rent. Buying it isn't advised, as it doesn't seem to hold up as a repeat viewing material.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An excellent movie of a ""great"" killer.","This film, directed by The Hughes Brothers, has Johnny Depp in the main role and deals with the story of Jack the Ripper, probably one of the most successful killers of all time, as not only was never caught and tried as, even today, we don't know what their true identity. The film plays with this situation to show us one of the most famous theories about the killer's identity: that would be a figure of British royalty or someone close to the ruling circles. The film also shows us the misery and poverty in which the lower classes of London lived, in a time when being poor often meant to live in the limits of the law to survive, and numb the pain of life in abuse of drugs or alcohol. Depp plays one of the inspectors highlighted by Scotland Yard to investigate and arrest the mysterious killer, who only kills prostitutes but that is so fierce and so meticulously bloody that quickly spread terror through the streets of Whitechapell. The actor shone in the role, managing to give the character a contradictory personality, spread in their desire to do justice, in the way he falls in love and in the addictions he feeds.A film recommended for all who enjoy a good cop movie, with a minimum expenditure of bullets and bloodshed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
From Absinthe-Are-Us,"""From Hell"" proves that no matter how much money you throw at a crappy script and amateur direction, you don't get a good movie.See, it isn't just enough to pick one of the most sensationally gory police blotter stories of the past century, throw buckets of money at costumers & set folks, and pick two or three good actors. You have to motivate them to act with good writing. Or *something*.The story is such old hat that it needed a really good angle. Implicating the royal family isn't new. The Whitechapel wannabes wandering the very well-scrubbed sets are all well-scrubbed and their clothing is meticulously clean. AS IF! Late 19th century London was DIRTY, PEOPLE! How is it all of these whores, too poor to have a place to live, are running around in NEW clothes that look like they just got out of the dry cleaners? (Read that last line like Sam Kinnison would have, screaming ""just got out..."")There are a few shots of squeamish gore. After all, that's what we paid to see, right? ICHOR! ICHOR! But the reactions of the police actors and public onlookers? I'd expect better reactions from actors in a high school play. They look more like they stepped in dogcrap. (Hmmm.)Inspector Depp spends much of his screen-time doing free advertising for absinthe.

great alternative reality of the jack the ripper story,"if you want to see real facts about Jack the ripper then you should better see a documentation. but I feel that fictional movies don't always have to correspond with the facts that are known. they can be an altogether alternative reality to what we know so far. and that is what From Hell is. around a legend a fictional account of what happened is created, and this results in a beautiful mystery film that kept me on the edge of my seat for the full 117 minutes. the plot is somewhat complex, but worthwile the effort. the imagery is very powerful,dark and atmospheric and creates a wonderful, romantic and sometimes surreal setting of london around the turn of the century. the sequences where Johnny Depp 'chases the dragon' are very intense and beautifully done. great camerawork, nice cutting, and strong acting. if you don't like a complex plot, or get annoyed when facts don't correspond to life, you simply won't get what this film is about, and probably hate it.

As Illuminating As The Victorian Gas Lamp,"Inspector Fred Abberline (Depp) is thrust into the middle of his (nee' England's) most serious crime wave: Jack The Ripper.  He's a capable officer with a loyal assistant (Coltrane) but it's going to take more than guess work and intuition to crack this evil-nut.  Fortunately, Abberline is also gifted with special sight.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help prevent the murders.  Unbelievably, he falls in love with the prostitute at the head of the group seemingly on the Ripper's slash list:  Mary Kelly (Graham).  Can he prevent her demise?!  Are the Royal Family REALLY involved?!  Are the Juwes the ones who will not be blamed for nothing?!If you know nothing about the life and times of history's most celebrated serial killer then you will probably appreciate this well made, atmospheric thriller for the brooding fantasy feature it is.  Unfortunately, the more you know about the period of the Ripper, the less - proportionally - you will like about this film.  For starters, the theory at the heart of the plot has almost universally been either discretited or, at the very least, presented as unrectifiably flawed.  Secondly, Abberline's penchant for narcotics is (and always has been) highly debatable.  A difficult point to reconcile oneself with when it forms a rock-solid tenet of the movie's story.  And then there's the prostitutes:  Graham as Mary Kelly suffers from being at least a league prettier than the next whore (until Estelle Skornik's belated appearance), a red-head (when in reality blonde) and being burdened with a hybrid London/English accent bearing no element of her native Irish or her adopted Welsh (she lived in Cardiff until her early twenties)?  Likewise, 'Long' Liz Stride displays not a jot of her native Swedish accent despite only locating to England well into her mid twenties.There are several other flaws which will niggle away at most viewers who possess even a slight knowledge of the murders.  But, so what?  It's a film. A piece of cinema.  It's not supposed to be true.  It's quite well made and (for the most part) reigns in it's cliches.  Depp invests a certain acting integrity and is supported, ably, by a stong British cast allowed to spout reasonably believable dialogue.  But it's not any greater than that.  And it DOES purport to be true.  All the characters existed and virtually all of them did what they did in the film.  So picking up on easily rectifiable flaws IS valid.  There are few things worse than lazy film making and - despite some tangible plus points - there is a veneer of sloppiness here which is sometimes difficult to see beyond.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent theory on Jack the Ripper,"This is definitely another great performance by Johnny Depp. He reminded me of Sleepy Hollow (of course) but in this case, his character has serious flaws and he never appears overly confident of himself or in solving the case.

You don't know Jack.until you've seen this movie.,"I suppose it's a curse to all of us ""Ripperologists,"" who are familiar with the history and theories surrounding the Jack-the-Ripper murders. Whenever a new ""Jack the Ripper"" movie or TV show comes out, we always look for one single character, John Netley, the coach driver who takes the Ripper to his victims.  Once Netley appears, we don't have to wait until the end of the movie to find out the Ripper's true identity.  Years of conspiracy theories surrounding the case have linked John Netley to one historical figure, identified by numerous theorists as the true identity of Jack the Ripper.But for those of you who don't know Jack, who have been spared the gory details of the unsolved murders that took place in London's East End in 1888, the movie ""From Hell"" will be an excellent introduction to the history of the Ripper case.  Even if you do know the details, ""From Hell"" is a terrific thriller.  It is that rarity of rarities, a well-done horror movie. Jack is not presented as a simple chase-'em-down-chop-'em-up slasher slicer dicer a la Freddy Kreuger.  There's a method to this killer's madness.Just remember this:  Like most Hollywood histories, ""From Hell"" is fiction from fact.This much is true:  In the fall of 1888, five prostitutes were brutally murdered in London's Whitechapel district.  The killer seemed to possess an intricate knowledge of anatomy, and removed some of his victims' internal organs.  The first four victims--Mary Ann ""Polly"" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, and Catherine Eddows--were found lying in the streets. The final victim, Mary Jane Kelly, was dissected in her own room, her body so brutally cut to pieces that she could barely be identified.  (Whether Martha Tabram--the first woman killed in the movie--was a sixth Ripper victim is a matter of  debate.)The murders threw London into a panic.  Letters signed ""Jack the Ripper,"" claiming responsibility for the crimes, were sent to local newspapers. The letters were probably fake, but a name like ""Jack the Ripper"" was one the newspapers couldn't resist.  One letter seemed to be genuine.  It was addressed ""From Hell,"" and contained part of a kidney from one of the Ripper's victims (The movie makes a mistake here.  The ""kidney letter"" is sent following the murder of Annie Chapman, the Ripper's second victim. In real life, the ""kidney letter"" arrived after the murder of Catherine Eddows, the Ripper's fourth victim, and was matched to her.)Public outrage over the Ripper murders was so great that Scotland Yard commissioner Charles Warren was forced to resign.  Queen Victoria herself expressed concern over the murders, and offered a Queen's pardon to anyone who could provide information leading to the killer's arrest.  But the murders suddenly stopped after Mary Kelly.  Jack the Ripper was never caught and he haunts us still today.Like most unsolved mysteries, a number of theories have sprung up through the years concerning the true identity of Jack the Ripper.  One of the more imaginative theories is the ""Annie Crook/Prince Eddy"" theory, which ""From Hell"" uses as its basis.  I won't give away the details for those who haven't watched the movie, but it's a great ""conspiracy theory.""  It's also, to put it mildly, bull manure.Historically, Annie Crook, while she did exist, was not Catholic.  No historic link has been found between her and her supposed husband, Prince Eddy.  Furthermore, the man identified as the Ripper in the ""Annie Crook"" theory, was not, in real life, a Freemason.  Take these facts together and the theory, as presented in ""From Hell,"" falls apart.That aside, who cares if its fiction.  It's still a great conspiracy theory. It makes for a great story.  And in ""From Hell,"" it makes for a great movie.  We have great performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane, and especially Ian Holm.  Ian Richardson--who played the creepily corrupt Prime Minister Francis Urquardt in PBS's ""House of Cards"" mini-series""--is on hand as Sir Charles Warren.  And the screenplay is intelligent and engrossing, with numerous plot twists and red herrings to follow as we join in the search for the Ripper.The Hughes Brothers have recreated the world of the Ripper, London's teeming East End, with meticulous shadowy style.  It's always a thrill to follow Jack down the maze of dark alleys, to watch the knife-wielding phantom slip in and out of foggy, gaslit shadows as he stalks his victims.  And of course, there's always that wonderful moment, in the darkened movie theater, when the Ripper's true identity is revealed, and we hear the rest of the audience gasp in acknowledgement.  But ""From Hell"" provides an additional twist at the end concerning the fate of one of the Ripper's victims--and it's a twist that even die-hard Ripperologists like myself will not see coming.The ""Annie Crook"" theory has been used in other ""Ripper"" films, with great success.  If you like ""From Hell,"" look around at your local library for a video copy of ""Murder By Decree,"" one of the best Sherlock Holmes films of all time, in which Christopher Plummer, as Holmes, tracks down the Ripper. Also, check your late-night TV listings for ""Jack the Ripper,"" the 1988 TV mini-series, starring Michael Caine as an alcoholic Inspector Abberline, which chronicles Scotland Yard's investigation of the case.  (The real Abberline, by the way, lived well into the 20th century, and died in 1929.)""From Hell"" departs from these two in that, for the first time, it shows us the murders as seen from the Ripper's point of view.  We see the madness that occupies the Ripper's mind, the visions that he sees, as he commits his terrible crimes.  We see what drives this madman to commit such extreme murders, to butcher his victims in such ghastly fashion.  That's why I say, even if you know the facts of the case, you don't really know Jack until you meet him in ""From Hell.""",,Anonymous,Horror
From Hell = Murder By Decree,"""From Hell"" is an excellent Jack the Ripper film, really well produced with good solid acting. For me the most disturbing fact was that the idea of why the Ripper murders happened is extremely close to the film ""Murder By Decree"" in which Sherlock Holmes goes after old Jack. It is a plausible idea and one that could easily be the answer to the whole puzzle.Johnny Depp's Abberline, while using the name of the real detective, is not what the actual Abberline was. In one of the many books devoted to this first serial killer, Abberline is quoted as stating that they did know who the Ripper was but could do nothing because of who he was. This certainly fits the solution in both ""Murder By Decree"" and ""From Hell"".The producers are to be commended for not turning this into a ""slasher"" film. Yes, there are some disturbing sections, but they are shown quickly and not in graphic detail. The bodies are shown in brief shots that give the idea of the mutilations, but now great detail. The reactions of the coroner, his assistants and the detectives give the idea of how horrible the situation is better than any picture.The bittersweet ending is perfect for the film, but what happens to Abberline is far from the history of the actual man.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bizarre View of the Ripper Tale,"The classic ""Jack the Ripper"" story has evolved to incorporate clairvoyant inspectors, heavy laudenaum usage, prostitution as prolific as religion, and sacred orders and sects.  This is, in a sense, what this movie is about.The serial-killer story is delivered well in London with great  visuals of the times (late 19th century).  And the street life, while horrible, is plausible enough.  But the mysticism that was intended to be created in a psychic inspector's (Johnny Depp) pursuit of the enigmatic ""Ripper"" falls short.  The director should have given Depp a ""Sherlock Holmes"" role and cut the whole visionary bit out, although Depp did play his role well.I won't ruin the biggest part of the movie for you, the ""Who dunnit"".  But I must say while the film does good at keeping you guessing, the discovery appears lame and perhaps far-fetched.  The film then really starts to head south as cult-ish intimations develop and later deadlock into a depressing ending that has nowhere to run but down the tubes. 4/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hollywood of course is allowed to put their own ""dramatic"" spin on real life events, but what ""From Hell"" brings is the biggest fairy tale possible.

Each scene is stylish but the movie lacks soul,"From Hell is the story of Jack The Ripper, an infamous serial killer who committed his crimes in the late 19th century London. He is allegedly the first serial killer who killed his victims with sexually related desires. The movie is based upon the comic book by Alan Moore which, probably, is the most reliable source on Jack The Ripper who allegedly selected his victims from prostitutes who witnessed a secret wedding between one of their friends and a prince from the Royal Palace in order to prevent this scandal to be known by the public. This mere fact is enough to suggest that Jack The Ripper, along with orders to kill were from the Royal Family. However, the way he kills victims in a ritualistic way suggests that there were other motives involved other than merely getting rid of the witnesses.I have to admit that ""From Hell"" didn't turn out to be as good as I hoped it would be. This is a kind of movie where each scene is nicely done but when you put them together they lack soul. Hughes brothers have done everything right, the camera angles, locations, decoration, costumes, acting is good but when all put together, the movie still doesn't have a soul. One of the reasons for my dislike is that the characters don't seem very real. For example, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) doesn't have the look of 19th century prostitute. Directors didn't even bother using some make up effects to make her look like a prostitute. However, all her friends  have more realistic prostitute look, which makes Marry Kelly look even more incongruous. Her relationship with Inspector Frederick George Abberline (Johny Depp) is unnaturally hurried and lacks soul. Inspector Abberline's visions of the murders are haphazard. Does he see them when they are happening or after they've happened? Does he see them when he ""chases the dragon"" (when he is high on opium) or anytime when he feels like it? In one scene, he touches the wall near the crime scene and picks up some visions. I have found his visions to be very chaotic and not adding any excitement to the story at all. They just create some visuals but that's all. The victims are not introduced to the audience in a way that will make them likable. That's why, you don't feel any sympathy when they are murdered. I have found a lack of excitement there too. I have also noticed one technical mistake: in one scene (I guess it was right after the second murder), a cop turns the corner and sees the dead body lying on the sidewalk. You see him right before he turns the corner and after he turns the corner and sees the dead body. There is not one single visible reaction in his movement. He doesn't pace up to rush to the dead body, he doesn't seem to stop for a moment in surprise. From the beginning of the scene to its end, his speed and movements are unnaturally unvarying.What I liked: From Hell is a highly stylish movie with a quite realistic depiction of 19th century London. Costumes, locations, set decoration  and the way the scenes are shot are stylish. It is always nice to watch Johny Depp although this is not one of his best acting performances. The story is very true to the original book in the sense that it grows on all of the characters who were, in reality, accused of being Jack The Ripper. The story, at the end, remains to be loyal to the widely accepted theory.If you like horror movies and enjoy serial killer themes, there is a great chance you might enjoy From Hell. But if you are expecting a serious movie with a strong plot, rhythm and soul ""From Hell"" is likely to disappoint you.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Take ""Ringu"" ( the original, Japanese version of ""The Ring"") it is shot in a low resolution, sometimes with a blurry filter, and that fits just perfect to the movies ""groove"". From hell has no groove, you are aware each second that you are indeed watching a movie. Where is the illusion? Furthermore the movies speed is way to fast. Most cuts would fit in an action movie rather than in this one.Besides, the graphic novel is revisited very poorly. A mainstream-plot replaces the novels, highly interesting, psychological and philosophical storytelling. Just take Jonny Depp, mix it with a poor love story, use a action movie pace, and you'll have your perfect block(=blood)buster.Just another forgettable movie, done completely in a wrong way I'm sick of Hollywood ruining genuine and interesting plots stolen from evry media imaginable, cutting and amputating them... and what's worse: without letting people know the original even exists.4 of 10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good grossing movie,"""From Hell"" is probably one of the most grossing/gory movies I've ever seen. It was really graphic and was quit disturbing at some scenes of the film. Either than that, the movie was really well done, with a good story and good actors like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. This film was kind of like ""Sleepy Hollow"", around the same period of time and had the same kind of clothing. But I would say that this was just a littler bit better than ""Sleepy Hollow"" I give this movie a A-",,Anonymous,Horror
From Hell,"This is so much different from the usual hack-and-slash kind of serial killer movies. This movie contains a fine balance between horror, action and suspense.

Graham's performance isn't bad either and I absolutely adored her hair.

Through Hell If You Have To Sit Through This,"This movie was thoroughly disappointing.  As somebody that's been somewhat morbidly obsessed with Jack the Ripper, I had high hopes that the Hughes brothers would deliver a riveting and original film on the murders.  And with Johnny Depp in it, who has picked so many good art house flicks in the past, my hopes were even higher.  Sadly to say, my hopes were dashed almost from the outset.  There was nothing new to the story, there was nothing that drew me in and if anything I kept wondering while in the midst of watching the film, ""Why did the directors even make this movie?""  They seemed to have no grasp or feel for the subject matter and it was actually a really difficult task to follow through and watch the whole movie.This is definitely not a movie that I would recommend to anyone at all.

"Those Bums, They Made Hagrid Cry!!","Hey guess what, this crime is officially still UNSOLVED. You did not just watch a documentary, but a fairy tale. Got it? I sure hope so. Let me back up and start with the good elements. It's a triumph of atmosphere that really put the polish on the Michael Caine TV movie, which is quite similar to a point, especially in naming the same culprit as this bomb does. The suspense and the murders are done without going overboard on the red red krovvy. And for a movie I hate, I did love the scene in Mary Kelly's room, showing the Ripper composing himself just before he strikes his final and most brutally butchered victim. If you haven't yet had a chance, go to your local library and take a look at the actual police photograph of the crime scene. It will haunt your slumbers! Slick and thought provoking visually, but oh how terribly Stupid story and otherwise. Once again, the British Empire plays whipping boy to the Hollywood loonies, who know full well the Brits will just sit and take it. The only thing factual is that there really was a Jack the Ripper, and a Queen of England named Victoria. The rest, straight out of a heroin daze. The topper, the scene with Victoria showing she had full knowledge of the crimes. Right out of Python, sans the humor. Eventually we'll see a version where Victoria herself actually does the killing.

Solid Adapation from Graphic Novel with Historical Accuracy,"This was a movie that I remember when it came out, but at the time I wasn't the biggest fan of Johnny Depp. This is one that did intrigue me to see. It wasn't until being on the people's council for the Podcast Under the Stairs that I finally saw it. Jaime and I watched it together. I had read the graphic novel ahead of time. We've also sat down for a second watch as part of Depp Dive: A Depper look at Johnny's Feature Filmography. It doubled as an Odyssey through the Ones watch as well.Synopsis: Victorian-era London, a troubled clairvoyant police detective investigates the murders of Jack the Ripper.We're in London in the year 1888. The movie presents us with a group of prostitutes of Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Dark Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) and Martha Tabram (Samantha Spiro). Something I want to point out here is that this is a rough life. There weren't a lot of prospects and these women are doing what they can to survive.To make it more difficult, McQueen (David Schofield) along with one of his men from the Nichols Street Gang tell the women they owe each owe a pound for protection. This group has another friend, Ann Crook (Joanna Page). She has a newborn baby and asks them to watch her so she can see her husband, Albert Sickert (Mark Dexter). They tell her about their run-in and they can't today. Ann tells them if they do, she will get Albert to pay what is owed.Things take a turn though when Albert and she are making love, they're interrupted. Benjamin Kidney (Terence Harvey) along with his secret police takes the two into custody. Mary sees them being taken away. She and her crew don't understand what is going on. They just know it can't be good. They decide to take her child to Ann's parents as they regroup.Martha is then murdered that night. It is a brutal one where her labia are removed. This causes Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to seek out Inspector Frederick Abberline (Depp) in an opium den. After getting him sobered up as best as he can, they go to the crime scene. Frederick is known to have visions that help him solve cases. Other officers are skeptical, but he does get results.Soon after, Polly is murdered. The imagery is great as she is staring at an obelisk and we hear someone speaking softly in verse. Frederick picks up almost at once that this killer isn't working alone. His investigation brings him and Sgt Godley to Mary and her friends. At first, they don't want to talk, but they tell them about the Nichols Gang along with their threat. Sgt Godley doesn't necessarily believe it. There is a much bigger plot of what is going on here. It would cause a scandal as it leads Frederick to Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician to the monarch, Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys) who is a young promising surgeon that was accepted into the Freemasons and the true identity of Albert. The question though, who is Jack the Ripper and why is he targeting these specific prostitutes?That's where I want to leave my recap of the movie as I'm trying to give as much background to get you up to speed if you've not seen this or it has been a while. I brought up again that I've read the graphic novel and much like this movie, there's a lot of information that is given to us.While watching this, I tried my best to not spoil things for Jaime while giving her insight that I had into the case. That is something that I want to credit Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias in bringing to life the source material from Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. I should also mention The Hughes Brothers as the directors. Let me then shift that there is factual information that was put into the graphic novel to the point where it is historically accurate. It is said there are liberties taken to make it more interesting though. This movie does good at bringing that to life. I read that the crime scenes were made to match and I recall a sequence at the climax straight from the book. There is time and care taken into this, I have to give credit for.Something else this does an excellent job of is the setting of Victorian-era London. It feels and looks dirty. How hard of a life it is for these women to survive is another aspect. Going along with this, we see that everyone looks down on the prostitutes who are just trying to survive, even though many will frequent them when their needs aren't met. Something else that struck me as well is that it isn't surprising that there would be cover-ups involving the police or that body snatching was a profession. It makes it even more believable when you have a group like the Freemasons that find their roots from the Knights Templar. I'm not saying that's the truth of what really happened here, but the conspiracy theorist in me could see it.Before I go down a rabbit hole, let me shift to discuss the interesting characters. I don't remember Frederick being psychic in the book. Depp plays the role spot on though. He just has that charismatic nature and quirky enough that I could see him using the drugs that he is. On top of that, he's hurting and masking it. There have been bad cards dealt his way and he just wants to help these women. Graham is attractive, despite women in this profession in this era not being that way. Her performance is good. Holm is in his role as well. There is also a solid cast of actors around them like Coltrane, Rhys and Jason Flemyng as the coachman Netley. The acting is solid across the board.I'll then finish with filmmaking. I've touched on how well this does at bringing the time period to life. Starting with the effects. What surprised me is how brutal this movie gets. There is a cutting of a throat scene that I remember and just hearing about how these women are killed is horrific as well. The deaths are off-screen for the most part, which is something to keep in mind, but we do get glimpses of the aftermath. It works in a way where my imagination fills things in. I've already spoken about the setting of the movie so aside from that, the cinematography does interesting things. I give credit there and they did an excellent job on top of that making this feel like London of the era. It isn't as good at making it character, but I could believe we are seeing events from then.In conclusion, this is an excellent adaptation of the source material. I wanted to be vague so as not to spoil things. It is also tough in that we truly don't know who Jack the Ripper is. There's an interesting mystery in this movie and I think it moves at a good pace. I never get bored despite its two hour runtime which is good. The acting brings these characters to life, shout-outs to Depp and Holm. The effects were good and I think that soundtrack fit what was needed. If I did have issues, it would be hard to differentiate certain characters. Other than that, this is a great take on the true events.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why did I bother watching this garbage??,"I guess being from England and having been reading about Jack the Ripper for 12 years from books to movies I finally saw the right movie here in Denmark a few years ago where everything seemed to make sense and it was the mini series with Michael Caine. So my friends and I had to choose between Shallow Hal and From Hell. We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises. 27 minutes of the movie and we are in total suspense and something happened and they had to restart the movie once again! So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first ½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on! WE WERE WRONG!!! The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction. If they had to base a film on something like that they shouldn't have made a Jack the Ripper film it was almost an insult to what Michael Caine had preformed so perfectly as Abberline. Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there. The real Inspector Abberline was in his late 40's, did Johnny even look past 30? This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good! Other than that don't bother it unless you have some extra cash in your pockets and nothing else to do.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
seductive,"old theme. and wise manner to use it. fascinating science of detail. and one of the great roles of Johnny Depp. after many novels and studies and movies, the case Jack the Rippen could not give surprises. but From Hell propose a different side. and does that in a delicate- convincing manner. because the victims are more than shadows. because the detective is more than a clever guy front to the evil. because the love becomes one of important pieces of a puzzle about justice and about deep secrets. because the cinematography is great and the Victorian atmosphere is recreated in realistic manner. a seductive film about a fascinating subject.",,Anonymous,Horror

"We left the theater yelling, ""This was the movie from Hell!""","As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for ""From Hell"" when first I heard of its production. As its release date neared, though, and details of the film began to leak out, I became distressed by the broad changes the film's writers had made to Moore's original story, apparently with the consent of the Hugheses. Moore's story is not a mystery; neither, of course, is it a documentary of the case. He admits the novel is a work of fiction and has said that his choice for the identity of the Ripper is most unlikely. The Ripper case, its drama, and its continuing fascination was a hook on which to hang a social commentary -- and this, along with much of the historical research Moore and Campbell put into the book -- is what is missing from the Hughes Brothers' movie. The brothers are working with some very talented people these days, and they've made a very good-looking an good-sounding film, but at its heart, it's empty. Pretty as the cinematography is, talented as most of the actors are, ""From Hell"" is dull. It hasn't the thrills to qualify as a decent thriller, the chills to make a satisfying horror movie, the emotionally involving characters to draw us into a human drama. ""From Hell"" is a mess, and you'd do well to spend your money elsewhere.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Classy Chiller...,"What makes ""From Hell"" a classy chiller that's 'a cut above' the rest? Well, a decent script and a handful of fine performances certainly helps. What is actually crucial about the script is not that it is particularly Oscar worthy, but that it never jars the viewer from the timezone that the film is supposed to be set in.  Several other details about Victorian London are very convincing as well.  So, that takes care of the setting, what about the actual mechanics of the story?It definitely held the interest, but I can't help feeling that the whole experience would have been slightly more satisfying had the makers dealt separately with the two stories of the 'inspired copper' and the 'tart with a heart'.  Leaving aside such pedantic quibbles as these not actually being faithful renderings of real people, the feeble attempt at creating a romance between the two leads does not work.  That said, both are interesting enough to keep the film running smoothly when we encounter them each on their own.It's definitely 'artistic license' to cast an actress as beautiful as Heather Graham as a 19th century English prostitute, but she does OK, without once threatening to steal the thunder of her more established co-stars.  Depp is as convincing as usual, proving a reliably intense performer on which to hang the bones of the story.  Give the man a part in ""Eastenders""!  Robbie Coltrane is good as usual, playing advisor to Abberline; and Ian Holm can always be relied upon to give good value.So each member of the cast (whether American or not) seems quite at home in the 'grimy' capital depicted.  Much credit though, must also go to directors The Hughes brothers for making this a thoroughly interesting watch.  They handle their first foray into horror territory well, suggesting a return may not be out of the question.If you have an idea of what to expect when you sit down to watch, I struggle to see how you could be disappointed.  There are minor flaws to be sure, but not enough to really ruin the 'mood'; and it is the skillfully created atmosphere - contributed to by all - which goes a long way towards making ""From Hell"" one of the best unsettling thrillers to come out in quite a while...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Oh, the darkness... oh, the pain...","""From Hell"" is not a pleasant film. I tried to watch it with my usual shields against the ""horror movie stuff"" fully deployed - it didn't help. It got to me. To the very core of my fears and my deepest emotions. And that's it's success: It is effective.First thing about ""From Hell"": Don't let it get you off guard - you'll feel sorry about it later, when the film is over and the lights are on. Frightening? Yes, of course. But not in the way acomplished by other films of the recent philmography (""The Others"", come in mind, filled with cheap ghost tricks and ""door opens - Booo!"" frauds - despite the very interesting general theme and the great performance of Nicole Kidman).No, it is more... subtle. The real terror is not the murders, the way they are being carried out, the beating heart in the hand of Jack or the (scarce, anyway) gore. Nope. The real terror is the fact that you can't escape. That malady is not a state of mind, it's a whole world.The fact that for one to find hope, another must vanish. The fact that there is no action without reaction.Dep delivers another excellent performance - might be his best so far. Despite the baby-face. The Hughes brothers do a great work with the light on their star - they use the light (or the absence of it) to wake inner feelings and make more point than other directors make with the whole film.The semi-happy end is really a work of art (I haven't seen the comix so I don't know if it is taken from there or is genuine).  And it only drags the helpless viewer even deeper into the abyss of this world.Yes, it is not a *happy* movie. It ain't a ""who done it"" movie either - the basic storyline is used as the mean, not the goal. And it certainly ain't no *horror* movie - there are no ghosts, no supernatural beings, not walking dead, no gross details, very little gore, no detailed autopsies, no cataclysmic events.I think I should give out an advice to those not seen ""From Hell"" yet: Do not go to watch a ""horror movie"". Or a thriller. Or whatever. Prepare yourself for a different experience.It is a great movie and one I am happy to have seen. And at the same time I am very unhappy. Because I can't let that depressing feeling go away. I can't look at my world as I used to. Thousands of little details capture my attention. Previously innocent moves and words are not innocent any more. The world has a totally different meaning for me now. And four little words are in my mind 24 hours a day:There is no escape",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neither good nor bad,"The movies i find most difficult to write a review about are the ones that are neither good nor bad but rather somewhere in between. This is definitely one of those movies.I saw ""From Hell"" in the theater back when it was released. And i left the screening not really knowing what to think. While there are a lot of things to like about the movie, it still didn't give me a lasting impression and the story quickly faded from my memory. What i definitely liked was Johnny Depp's doped out investigator, i also liked the very beautiful sceneries and the fact that several of the surrounding actors were very good. No, the problem was neither in the production nor in the acting department. Nor was it due to a boring subject-matter, there is definitely something that's still enticing and curious about Jack the Ripper.So what was it? Well, i don't know really but my best guess is the script. Because despite all this scenery, these good actors and this interesting real-life story, the end-result is actually rather dull and uninteresting. The movie didn't leave a mark, didn't make me want to learn more about Jack the Ripper, and worst of all it didn't really entertain me much. There was simply no nerve, no excitement, present. And for a thriller that's not good.So i guess the grade is... difficult to give. While it was decently entertaining during it's running time, and there was much nice scenery and images to watch, it faded immediately after the movie ended. And of the exciting chase for Jack the Ripper not much excitement remained (or was ever present). So i guess this is somewhere between good and bad, which means... a 5/10?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hannibal Lecter, Eat Your Heart Out (a bad pun, but I could not resist).","Well, the Hughes Bros. really have their stuff together in their latest movie, From Hell.  When I originally saw the movie at the theaters I gave it a `7'; but not that I have scoped it out on DVD I believe an `8' is more in order for what is surely the new definitive Jack The Ripper movie.  The directors (and writers, for that matter) took the least plausible `Ripper Theory' and turned into to something that is very much believable.  For what it is worth, as a child, I read up quite a bit on the Whitechapel murders, and although I espouse I different belief in what happened in London in 1888; nevertheless, From Hell, took enough turns to make me second-guess my theory. The imagery in From Hell was top-notch all the way, and while Heather Graham's Irish accent was abysmal (as well as about half of her acting), Johnny Depp was aces, as always.      If you ever get a chance to check out the deleted scenes on the DVD release, you will notice that the Hughes Brothers intended the movie to be a bit more seedier then what we saw in the theatrical release.  From Hell was pretty dark as it is, nonetheless, I wish they had kept some of the more grittier scenes and thus showed more of the underbelly of 19th Century England.  The deleted scenes are fun to watch.  For the most part, however, the Hughes Brothers did not pull any punches, and what we see in From Hell really is a parallel to our present day sub-cultures of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, thievery, and basic skullduggery. The Hughes Brothers did their research into the Jack the Ripper mystique more than any other filmmakers to date (and I have seen them all the Ripper movies).  Down to the last cobblestone of Mitre Street, and the paint on the buildings-even the way each victim was mutilated, and how they lay in the street-taking every jot and tittle from the original police and forensics reports, this movie makes the grade. I really can't say why I did not give it a higher rating.  Something was missing from the flick, but I don't know what.  Nevertheless, if you want a good, solid movie, with lots of fiends and villains, history and mystery, you can't go wrong with From Hell.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some really fine performances, very authentic looking for the time period, well written and directed.

And the story works, and the fictional (?) explanation of Jack's killings is convincing and somehow amusing.

Do we finally know who the Ripper is?,"The most striking point of the film, in the sense of its historical importance, is that we are actually getting the definitive answer who Jack the Ripper is.

Nevertheless, as a classical dark whodunnit thriller, this is definitely a must-see movie. For those who like this type of movies, of course.Heather Graham is a little bit too sophisticated for an East Side ho, but life can be tough sometimes. She gives the movie an incredible balance in the sense that the movie's darkness is absolutely tolerable and appealing. Johnny Depp is definitely one great actor, although I'm not so sure about his English accent.

"The Legend Is Reborn, and Is Simply Great!","From Hell is a great retelling of Jack the Ripper. Albert and Allen Hughes were great at directing the movie. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham were also great. Johnny Depp's character seemed to me like the one he played in Sleepy Hollow. All in all, this was a scary and great retelling of the London legend. I give From Hell a 9 out of 10! :)",,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting View....,"From Hell was an interesting movie. I LOVED the cinematography. The entire feel of the film was very dark but it worked very well. The DVD had alot of extra footage, mostly documentaries on Jack the Ripper. I found them boring but if you are really into history, you may like it. I loved the way that all of Johnny Depp's dreams and visions were shot. The murder scenes were original, i liked the little blips of images instead of long, drawn out shots. i didn't really like the ending, it left too much undone and was pretty confusing. I may have just not understanded it but oh well...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

From Hell Without Suspense,"This movie reminds me of the impact created by 'The Others'. It's difficult to fault the mood, tone, feel, and acting.(I did not have a problem with the Cockney accents). Yet, in spite of the lack of grounds for criticism, I didn't think it was as good as I was hoping. Like 'Hannibal', another suitably gory story, it lacked suspense. Even where the story is known, suspense should still be created, but I thought that the early murders were clumsily handled. The film looks good, and the music was complimentary, but somehow it lacked that vital ingredient. Mind you, what do I know - I thought the 'Glass House' was a taut thriller, whereas most critics slammed it. To me, it was almost as if Johnny Depp KNEW that it lacked a spark. As always, he was very watchable, but his performance was not as compelling as usual. I don't think his heart was in it. Did he need Christina Ricci playing the part of Mary Kelly? I'm willing to bet that if she had, 'From Hell' would have packed a bigger punch. Heather Graham is just too nice to play a salt-of-the-earth prostitute. Christina Ricci would have had that edge in the part, and Depp would then have excelled. Robbie Coltrane was underused, but helped matters when he was on screen. Overall, I enjoyed it, but if it had to be an '18' certificate, I think that the menace could have been better employed by more graphic violence, to engineer in the audience an uneasy suspense, which it definitely lacked.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Very different, very good, very atmospheric","There are many horror-mysteries which take their inspiration from historic events that are memorized as one of the most horrifying deeds man has ever done. Most of those films are so occupied with the perpetrator that everything else regarding films becomes less important and so does the film in its entirety. That is not case with this movie.The Hughes brothers made very impressive film, faithfully creating 19th century London and well build up characters and atmosphere from graphic novel. What I liked in particularly was depth that was achieved in explaining (or said better examination) motivation behind murders - madness and motivation of murderer are done in very impressive way almost trying to get inside his head. Portrait of low and high class London was presented is not less impressive way. Everything was spiced with little bit art approach that fits perfectly - European influence worked very well in this movie.Acting is on high level, starting from Johnny Depp who, as usual, gives unique touch to his character to Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm, all giving good performances and fit their roles very good, except Heather Graham. I must admit her acting wasn't so convincing, it's very hard to believe her character is a prostitute (but not because of her charming performance).There are few explicit scenes but directors mostly rely on formula ""things you don't see makes you even more scared when left to your imagination"", although I wouldn't recommend this film to children or those with really weak stomach. Without those scenes, I think, film would loose some of its ""creepiness"", and does not leave you with feeling directors put it there just so the film would be described as horror.For all those who fancy mysteries and don't mind few harsh scenes, go ahead, From Hell is more than decent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Misleading,"Considering this movie was based on a graphic novel, I was expecting a lot of blood and gore. But, there isn't much of it.  The camera pans over the crime scenes quickly and never lets you have a good view.  You do get to see a couple of throat slashings.  Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are miscast. The director really made a mistake by making all the other prostitutes trashy and filthy looking, while Heather Graham has pretty combed hair and clean looking.  Toward the end, the scene where they reveal ""Jack"" and make him have these cold, big black eyes was chilling.  But, most of this movie is slow and boring.FINAL VERDICT: Don't watch this if you are sleepy because there is not enough action to keep you awake. I do not recommend this movie unless you just want to criticize all the historical inaccuracies and the miscast actors.",,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful look at 1888 London,"To look at ""From Hell"" as a slasher or gore film is to miss the forest for the trees. The true value of this film is to gain insight into the ways of life in Victorian London. Few of us can imagine what life was like for the folks that we seeportrayed in this film and if one looks beyond the plot one can learn much. How often have any of us seen what an opium den was like or how the poor had tosleep upright in doss houses or heard what a dank, busy London streetsounded and looked like at night? No, the film wasn't 100% historicallyaccurate, taking liberties with the facts in the Ripper case, but that should be obvious to anyone viewing. Take the investigation with a grain of salt but not what the film has to say about the slice of the human experience it shows you. Further, do not discount the excellent acting that From Hell contains. Anyone who discounted Heather Graham's abilities based on what they saw in The SpyWho Shagged Me needs to eat their words. Admittedly Johnny Depp's facialexpression changed little (even when he was having his drug-induced visions), but Ian Holm always brings his all to any role he fills and Liz Moscrop'sincarnation of Queen Victoria is uncanny. Also, the direction of From Hell nicely complemented the unsettling nature of the material it was portraying. Viewers will feel as if they are a part of the disjointed mind of a serial killer. From Hell transcends being a movie and is more aptly described as anexperience. It passes the test of any good film--that it leaves you thinking and wondering about it long after you leave the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What were they thinking?,"So the film starts with a fake and also nonsensical quote that really sets the tone for how accurate and truthful this film is going to be about the real history of this period. Next we get a less than convincing establishing shot of London, the sky somehow looking like it's been soaked in blood. A cool crane shot though takes us down to the ground in one long unbroken take showing the streets of Whitechapel, the production design, the costumes all look pretty good, the streets though are just too brightly lit, I know this was shot on film so cameras back then struggled in low light the way modern ones don't today. Also there's just not enough squalor in these street scenes, there's a few people around but not enough, where's all the homeless? Several families sharing one room? Some of the darkness and alleys though are well recreated.One of the first problems you notice about the film is the casting, firstly you have two Americans playing two British characters, the accents are a bit suspect though it's obviously not an easy thing to do. We also are given Chris Finch from The Office, Stacey from Gavin and Stacey, Bilbo Baggins, I was just waiting for James Corden to show up.... Some of the production design is also unintentionally funny, since when did Whitechapel have all this gothic art design? When a woman is murdered she's grabbed and pulled into a dark space while the camera pans up to this grotesque statue thing, it's just weird.Next they introduce this Minority Style idea that Johnny Depp can dream about crimes before they happen. This really belongs in a sci-fi story, not a period costume crime thriller. The thriller aspect is badly done too, we're given far too much information early on.Most journalists didn't bother taking photographs either in 1888 because there was no way back then of putting a photo into a newspaper, they could only put pictures or wood engravings into newspapers. The film was a bit too surreal for me. I'm not sure Deep was even right for the role. Nor did the police leave a body in full public view in the street for half a day.Again I liked some of the production design, the drinking fountains the poor bathed in, the straw everywhere, things ironically look their best when the weather is grey and rainy. The actual story is complete tosh and revolves around a royal conspiracy, failing to notice that a man who walked around the streets of Whitechapel in a top hat, frock coat and rode in a carriage in the poorest slums of 1888 London would have stuck out a mile. Never mind logic though...The film has it's fair share of cliches, nasty pimps, plodding policemen, corrupt officials. Again though how was a 70 year old man and a stroke victim committing these crimes, racing through the streets of Whitechapel pursued by the police? The film makes little sense, back then bodies were quickly moved to a mortuary not left outside for 12 hours for the whole of London to gawp at. Crimes scenes were not usually photographed and often reopened to the public once the body had been moved.Even the soundtrack I'm not really a fan of and like I said the mystery isn't very well told. Back to the logic of the film again though, several women now know that someone is out to murder them and seems to know where they are. Instead of fleeing London though they stay. The women though remain on edge and of course naturally cautious and their guard is up when a mysterious stranger tries to get them alone. Their fear for their lives though is overcome by....grapes of all things. Again it's so bad it's almost comical. Slasher films are often attacked for the bad choices the characters make in them, like why don't they ever turn on the light when they're afraid? But what about this? A woman killed because of some grapes, what did she think she was doing? Yeah, not too smart....
When Jack the Ripper goes out he of course wears all black and talks in a creepy voice, he's even got black horses too. This ghoulish green light starts appearing everywhere towards the end, where's it coming from? There's a lot flashing images, a fair bit of blood and so on.There's moments when everything looks far too clean, polished and bright though. Daytime scenes of our two heroes wondering the streets of London, all the fog, the smog, it's all gone. Everyone's got better teeth than most Brits do today, their clothes look like they're brand new. Also the Mary Jane character is oddly portrayed as being pretty saintly, despite the fact we're told she's a prostitute we never see her being one, she doesn't drink, she doesn't use bad language, it's almost comical, like a slasher film where the final girl abstains from all the vices her friends don't. Other bits are equally ahistorical, the real inspector Aberline was actually married in 1888 but of course he's single in this to increase his appeal and troubled nature. Also why drag poor Joseph Merrick into this sad affair, he had nothing to do with the case.If you want a really good scary thriller then the film Signs is much better. It's got an actually really effective soundtrack, it knows how to quietly build tension and the characters and themes are far more interesting.In the end I can't recommend this film, it's full of historical howlers, bad casting, illogical moments and not much else despite some nicely done cinematography and art design.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"From Hell not a documentary, and also not a bad movie","For those who moan and whine that the movie does not follow the ACTUAL trail of events that Jack The Ripper left behind for us to follow, nobody ever said this was a documentary, and boy it sure isn't. Remember, this is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL (i.e. A COMIC), not history. That being said, it's not a bad film at all. Johnny Depp is pretty darn good, Ian Holm and the guy from the Brit series Cracker are excellent, the recreation of Vicotiran England is without peer, and the story is passable (though an exact recreation of the Sherlock Holmes Vs. Jack The Ripper movie called ""Murder By Decree"" starring Christopher Plumber as Holmes. I swear if you ever see it it's the EXACT same story). Graham is indeed miscast here and stands out garishly compared to her fellow prostitutes who actually look the part while she just looks like Felcity Shagwell on a bad hair day. All in all, if you're not expecting much more than to be entertained, I thought it was pretty good and recommend it.

Jack the Ripper Strikes Again!,"Albert and Allen Hughes have given us yet another retelling of the saga of Jack the Ripper.

He is an unusual sort who has ""visions"" while under the influence of opium. In fact we first meet him when his assistant Sgt. Godley (Robbie Coltrane) fetches him out of an opium den.

An admirable piece of art...,"I have to admit that this is the first film I've seen directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. The twin brothers directed ""Menace II Society"" and various other street crime dramas. Their latest film, ""From Hell"" -- starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm -- is a street drama of a different sort.Set on the streets of London in 1888, ""From Hell"" focuses on Jack the Ripper, and his infamous serial-murdering spree of innocent prostitutes. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Fred Abberline, who is sent to investigate these most gruesome killings, along with his partner Peter Godley, played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute suspected of being one of Jack the Ripper's victims, who helps the two detectives search the murderer.In reality, nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was. This is what makes the film so interesting. There are so many people in the movie who are suspected of being a serial killer, and this keeps you guessing until the film reveals the killer's true [fictional] identity. There are often times where you hear the killer's voice, and even times where you're actually seeing the contents in his home. But you never really figure his identity until the story tells you whom.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, ""From Hell"" is so well-directed, contains such lavish sets, and great costume design, that you actually believe you're roaming the streets of London during 1888. There are times where the sky is even painted red, possibly to indicate bloodshed, as the film has a lot of that. This is all what helps the picture seem more disturbing.""From Hell"" is a film in which the characters are likeable, and where you're absolutely disturbed when witnessing prostitutes get their organs torn out. It's actually an incredible experience. The murders are so accurate, the filmmakers even did research on how exactly the corpses were positioned, and where the wounds were. You actually believe the film came from Hell. B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as good as the book.

It does do a damn fine job though and gets as much of the details in as possible. The only problem I had was that it tries to turn the film into a whodunnit kind of thriller with the stories idea of the killers identity being revealed at the end. In the book we know from the beginning who it's supposed to be and we follow him around as he commits the murders and we hear his thoughts and his ponderings. This approach that the film takes cheapens the artistic value a little bit but having said that it does make up for it in other areas.The horror is actually horrible and the thrills are actually thrilling and Johnny Depp's cockney accent is pretty good, it just sounds weird because its coming from his mouth which is something we are not use to.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cool ""Hell""","FROM HELL (2001) *** Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane,  Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng, Ian Richardson,  Lesley Sharp, Susan Lynch, Terence Harvey, Katrin Cartlidge.

Graham is one of a small clutch of ladies of the evening on Saucy Jack's menu to dispatch with gruesome elan and Coltane lends comic support as the Shakespeare quoting aide de campe. Atmospherically enriched by cinematographer's glimmeringly dank photography (check out the cool dreams' entries that Depp experiences of the murders occurring) and detailed Victorian era production design by the gifted Martin Childs filmed on location in Prague.  The film's final act seems abrupt and wanting more than is given but why quibble when the body count culminates in a battle of wits in this Sherlock Holmes meets ""Se7en"" interpretation of the old chestnut of the notorious madman.

Other than Heather Graham falling in and out of her accent a few times the entire plot worked. The movie gave off a ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel without having to throw the gore in your face.

No-one knows who killed the girls, so how do we know the same person killed them all? The thing that comes across most strongly when reading about the murders, is the incompetence of the police. Was a huge 'cover up' in operation? Again, no-one knows. For me, the film would have benefited from better editing, more character development,and less of them.

This film is more than a slasher flick set London during the Victorian era. It contains phenomenal acting by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham who have an unusual chemistry in this movie that works. She was a little too pretty to be an ""unfortuante"" or prostitute in my mind, but it's only a movie afterall. I thought the suspense faded after the first hour but nevertheless explains the Jack the Ripper case in a comic bookish way that is not based on facts but opinion.

One of the biggest disappointments of the year,"This movie joins ALONG CAME A SPIDER (5/10) and DON'T SAY A WORD (4/10) in the category of movies this year that looked great in the previews and that I was really looking forward too, and then turned out to suck. What a horrible disappointment this movie was to me.First, the good points. Johnny Depp is an incredible actor and he gives an excellent performance in this movie. Also, the death scenes were well done, and the gore gave me the ""ewwwww.......cool"" reaction I was hoping for. Good costumes and scenery.But those are the only good points as far as I'm concerned. This is probably Heather Graham at her worst, and the chemistry between she and Johnny Depp was poor. Not that it matters, because the romance between the two was barely developed. The ""bad guys"" confused me, and yet I was able to predict who Jack the Ripper HIMSELF was right from the very beginning of the movie. The ending was also very predictable.Worst of all, I found myself bored with the whole thing near the end. (Around the time when Jack the Ripper's identity is revealed. But, again, I had predicted who he was much earlier in the movie.) I was just waiting for it to end.And why were the ""visions"" even in this movie? They weren't used very often anyway, and if they were eliminated completely from the movie it would have been at least as good or better.To me, this movie looked like a darker, better, and more gory version of SLEEPY HOLLOW (8/10).

From Hell's Jack the Ripper is as obvious as can possibly be because he speaks several times and does very little to disguise his voice.

Her Irish accent is terrible and her presence causes all female viewers to groan and roll their eyes. Fortunately not a lot of hanky-panky happens between the two leads. Robbie Coltrane is happy spouting Shakespeare and shouting at constables left, right and centre. Ian Holm is clearly having fun with being evil.

(Prince Albert, Catholic girl, child, Freemasons etc.) I don't know anything about the comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell; but I would love to know what they say their sources are.Apart from the ending (far too hollywood-esque), the events behind this story are all included in Mr Knight's investigations.  What people fail to realise is that most of the events depicted in the movie are actually based on fact.

"Sleek, Stylish, but at Times Familiar Thriller","You enter a world where the sky is dark, and the streets of cobblestone match. The streets are crawling with late-night walkers and hookers at work. A streak of murder has been striking these prostitutes, with their bodies being slashed and their organs being removed. You have entered the world of ""From Hell"", a decently crafted thriller about Jack the Ripper.Set in 1888 London, prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her friends (also prostitutes, of course) aren't exactly in the best of the times. Their boss is demanding a pay of 4 pounds a week, and in a much bigger problem, a mysterious killer, who the residents merely call Jack the Ripper, is sweeping through the streets of London, slashing specific prostitutes in a pattern. The police force, along with working on the case themselves, decide to call on the help of Detective Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), an opium-addict who, while under the influence, sees visions of how prostitutes will be murdered by Jack the Ripper...and which prostitute is next (insert suspense music here).This was not your typical hack 'em up, kill everyone, gore and blood all over the place movie. Yes, the movie had lots of gore (this movie is NOT for sensitive stomachs) and lots of blood, but it also contained substance amidst all the killings and violence. Many (too many) thrillers rely on slashing and murder and gore to support the movie fully, without containing a story, but ""From Hell"" provided a good script, a good and followable story, and...well, the filler needed to make a good movie a good movie.The one thing I would've preferred to be left from the story were the cliche`s. The script contained familiar territory that I've seen before, many times. The best example I can give without spoiling anything is the distinguishing of Mary Kelly from the rest of her prostitute friends. The movie took the tired route of making Mary Kelly prettier, well-kept, wearing makeup, and well-dressed, while her friends...well, looked like poor streetwalkers: no makeup, tattered dresses, etc. I'm tired of movies making the lead girl look more well-bred than her friends, because it seems unrealistic. Why not just make Mary Kelly actually look like a prostitute, and not like a rich, pretty girl who finds herself amongst a bunch of lesser-looking friends? Or if Mary Kelly looks like this, why not make her friends look the same? It might seem more realistic this way.The pacing in the movie was good, but the movie dragged. The movie  actually felt like it was two hours long, and that was a little exhausting. Don't think I have a short attention span-I've been able to sit through movies like ""Traffic"", ""Magnolia"", and ""AI"", all of which are longer than ""From Hell"", and I didn't have any trouble doing so. Those movies didn't feel like their lengths, and ""From Hell"" did.The acting was good. Johnny Depp delivered a great performance as Detective Abberline, making his character believable. I wouldn't say Oscar-caliber, but performances don't have to be Oscar-worthy to be good. Heather Graham was pretty good too-at times she seemed a little wooden, and I think her character would've been more believable if she seemed more scared about Jack the Ripper. I knew she was concerned, but she sometimes seemed too mello about her life being in danger, like, ""Oh, well, Jack the Ripper is sweeping through London and killing my friends, and I may be next...la dee da dee da!""The movie was cinematically brilliant. The murder scenes were well-filmed; one murder was seen as merely darkness with slashes of light being the only thing seen. The best moments cinematically were during Detective Abberline's Opium dreams-you can't even go into description about how great they really were.Overall the movie was very chic and very enjoyable. Take away the cliche`s, and make the movie move quicker, and it would've received those two extra points from me.8/10, B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent one time watch,From Hell is a strange movie by the Hughes brothers. Loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel which itself is based on the Jack the Ripper murders this is a beautiful looking film. The production design and atmosphere is eerily reminiscent of the actual period and the acting is also good from everyone involved. But I felt the pacing was an issue or more importantly I felt there was no structure to the film.

The Victorian age was recreated perfectly and also the story about the FREEMASON was very impressive even though so fanciful; You have to watch it because it explains a lot of things about the era in which Jack the Ripper lived and ""worked"",in fact this is a real story,don't forget it.Bye",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
GROSSED-OUT ANATOMY,"Pretty standard costumer with a mystery motif, and tons o' gore to keep the adolescents enthralled. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, FROM HELL has much going for it, however the writing tended to be poor and the plot really held no surprises.Johnny Depp rose above the material more than once, and he usually does. Robbie Coltrane was wasted as not much more than a flunky for Depp. Anyone who has seen Coltrane in the British series CRACKER knows this man can act. Heather Graham did a great job, and was wholly believable. Those ""oh so terrible"" British actors, naturally play the baddies. Ian Holm, a mesmerizing actor, takes center stage here and clearly relishes the role.The script really sinks the ship. The unsustained and at times, complete lack of suspense brings FROM HELL down to the level of a ""game show,"" in terms of tension. Gratuitous violence never takes the place of suspense, but that doesn't stop screenwriters and directors from trying. Nice try...no cookie. Yes, the crimes of Jack the Ripper were indeed grotesque, however more was spent on faithfully rendering these scenes out, than the effort to peel away the layers of the story and where it was going.The conclusion bordered on the silly and camp (HM Queen Victoria makes a couple of cameos...good grief!), making the preceding time spent not really worth the while. My conclusion is that FROM HELL is a good costumer, but the overall effect is razzle-dazzle to disguise a stilted and clumsy script.NOT RECOMMENDED.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good thriller loosely based on a graphic novel!,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It isn't historically accurate, but it doesn't need to be. It's fun and enjoyable movie from start to finish. Author of the graphic novel wasn't really amazed by Johnny Depp performance, but I find it charming, because it's a portrayal of a relatively normal man. Later Depp really lost it and shown us he cannot really act normal, and that turned him from my most beloved actor to... Well, what he is now. Anyway, the movie is very well executed, characters are fun and the plot is interesting and makes you care. Costumes and scenes are great, as well as the atmosphere. However, don't expect a horror, because you won't find it. It's more of a crime thriller. Movie also manages to make you hate Jack the Ripper, so that's a plus. He really is despicable, killing poor women in a way like that. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent thriller. It's charming and won't make you regret your choice. 8/10 from me :) ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mundane,"From Hell is based on the true life crime story of Jack the Ripper which took place in 1888 in East London. And it's the screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.When the prostitutes on street are getting murdered in a brutal and violent manner, the investigation is given to a young Scotland Yard detective Fred Abberline. Abberline who is already a trouble gentleman with the loss of his wife and child sometime back tries to catch this ruthless killer but finds little luck. The ritualistic manner of the murders and the mutilations seems to be done by someone who is quite experienced in human anatomy.In the mean time Abberline gets to know a set of prostitutes who are in the risk zone and particularly gets friendly with Mary Kelly who agrees to support him with his investigation. And soon he realizes that the murders are not just a work of a mad man but something more than he can personally bring down. As he and Mary starts to get emotionally involved he tries to keep her protected from the killer as she becomes the final prostitute left out of the target bunch.There is nothing new in this flick. It's a mix of horror scenes with a matching score. Other than that it doesn't offer much of a twists or mysteries to go along with. And it's quite predictable.But for a crime and horror fan it is not so boring. The flow of the story is good. There are no lagging or unwanted scenes. And there is a serious work of set creation and representation of London which is perfectly noticeable from the very first scene.Johnny Depp is mundane and Heather Graham is pretty. Other than that the script does not offer any actor to be special or memorable.Check more at flickshout.tk",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
just plain bad,"i saw the trailers and all that good stuff that promoted the film and i was like ""hell yeah, i gotta see this."" so i see it. and i was so dissapointed that i almost left the theater. i like to give all movies a chance you know? so i did. i sat there and hoped that the movie would get better. i was hoping maybe it was a joke. it wasnt. here's the things that i found REALLY wrong with this movie.johnny depp smoking opium. heather graham being the only attractive prostitute in the movie. all scene's with jack the ripper. the fact that they actually showed his face! big no no! he's supposed to remain elusive, right? when johnny depp kissed heather graham's character, and even fell for her! Her character had to have some sort of STD. I cringed. the hughes brothers used alot of white people, theres nothing wrong with this but it just screamed odd, because of the hughe's previous movie history. whatever happened to the baby of that one prostitute that got put in the hospital? i saw the other wenches carrying him but thats all. i didnt like the dyke scene later in the movie.The one thing i did like about this movie was when they looked at the bodies in the morgue and everybody puked. It was REALLY REAL! lol. I thought this was funny. I laughed. I liked when johnny was in the tub and made that toxic drink. That was cool. Oh, yea, i also liked when the movie ended.",,Anonymous,Horror
Queen Victoria was NOT a nice lady!!!,"So don't expect truth from this movie.  I didn't, so was quite 'entertained' -- if watching a heart spurt it's blood geyserlike into a fireplace is entertaining. Not knowing any of the history, I could accept it for what it was, a movie with some excellent acting from Johnny Depp and those wonderful English actors.  Thank God there is still the class-consciousness and upraised finger to the 'posh' that I love about my hypocritical country, shown by the incompetent head inspector over-ruling the smart young if addicted detective.  (Follow the money, to find out about social class in the United States.  But at least we PRETEND to be class-less, and come to think of it, we often are!!!).Interesting perspective on the FreeMasons, about whom I'm now inspired to find out.  Did they really have human sacrifices, and were they in collusion to do horrible things, an upper-class lynch mob?  My step-father was all set to go through initiation into the Masons and discovered at the last moment their segregation rules, so sacrificed the paid dues and the bonhomie of their companionship (during the 60s).If you think of the movie as a better-than-average thriller, you'll like it, with some good acting to boot.  The carriage of DEATH with the heavy-footed black horses set the mood, nicely.  In fact, have a ""Jack the Ripper"" home film festival and watch Michael Caine's version after this one.  Many similar touches.Someday someone will give us a dramatic movie that shows us the forces that drive a woman into prostitution and it's horrible degradation.  And I think I've got a hideous humiliating job, working for a monster!!!!!!!  Who knows? You may even feel better about your job after seeing this movie.  I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Convincing and Chilling Conjecture,"Let me start with the look of this film because that is what lures one into being catapulted into the era when these events took place.  Kubrick with ""Barry Lydon"" really inspired filmmakers to use classic painting as a basis for production design and many of the scenes could be framed as fine art. Johnny Depp turns in another very potent character study and this film is very convincing in its premise which isn't just based on the material credited.   There have been many theories that have credence, linking the murders to those portrayed in the film.  No matter whether you want to believe it but the way the film is put together (with some peerless editing), you come to believe that the mystery has been solved.  A gripping and terrifying film, not for the weak hearted.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a hot film, not a cold one.... From Limbo","A clarvoyant inspector works on the famed Jack the Ripper murder cases in Victorian era London. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) can best be described as troubled, as he is haunted both by his own psychic abilities and his dependence on absinthe. As destitute prostitutes are murdered and eviscerated, disemboweled, and worse on the streets of the extremely poor Whitechapel section of the city, Abberline tries to discern the culprit - it's a learned man, he concludes, one with a distinct knowledge of medicine. Smart lad, that.As Abberline becomes more and more involved with the case, he also becomes more involved with one prostitute in particular whose group seems to have been targeted, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). From the start, one can tell that Mary and Abberline will hook up, because she is the only prostitute who does not look downtrodden and, well, like a bucket of mud. (As a point of fact, love interests never look like buckets of mud, unless the story is about a cure for looking like a bucket of mud, or something.)At any rate, as Abberline investigates further, he runs into his ultraconservative, image-conscious boss, who even asks him to destroy evidence and suspends him (how come so few police chiefs and the like actually act in concert with their detectives and officers on the screen? How come the cop has to go beyond regulations to get at the truth?). Abberline does have the help of his colleague Peter Godley (the always-reliable Robbie Coltrane), but in general he's on his own. Can he solve the crimes?Depp attempts to disappear into the role, and for the most part he succeeds, right down to what sounds to me like an authentic Cockney accent (but what do I know?). The problem is, the story's weak, and when the lead actor's just trying to blend in, the movie comes off as rather pedestrian. In other words, folks, you've already seen this movie in one form or another. There are some twists, but they're minor ones. It's a rainy, cold, dark, dreary movie, much like I imagine London itself was back then (and perhaps still is, at times). There's simply not much unique with this movie, and it could have been just as well done with lesser-known stars. Graham, in particular, is wasted here - she's a fine actress, but she's left to do little more than be a victim.  In addition, the ending is pretty unsatisfying, although the killer is named.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ending Makes No Sense,"The most frightening thing about this film is that there are so many people who believe that the conspiracy theory presented in this film could be the truth.  But it makes no sense if you actually think about it.  If you were enormously wealthy and powerful, and you wanted to hush something up, would you ask a NON-PROFESSIONAL to kill those in the know?   Would you allow the amateur to continue after he demonstrated he was completely insane?  Would you allow him to continue to jeopardize your secret by taking OVER A MONTH to kill off all the people you wanted him to silence?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely incredible,"From Hell is quite the work of art. When the ideas of infusing artinto cinema were produced, From Hell is obviously what wasthought of. But the question is whether From Hell's grandiosebeauty translates into the genius of Salvador Dali or the overblownfluff of Jackson Pollock.On the one hand, the photography is simply stunning. The realismis amazing. The depiction of the London of Jack the Ripper,Charles Dickens and Sherlock Holmes is stunningly realistic. Thesociety created by the film makers is amazing to watch in of itself.Also, Johnny Depp shows that he is one of the best actors of ourtime. Granted, his role as the police inspector trying to find theRipper is not dissimilar from his role in Sleepy Hollow, but whyshould that matter? From Hell is an excellent movie to watchimmediately after taking in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas andBlow to realize what an incredible actor he is.The movie contains vast amounts of violence, yet it is portrayedtastefully and seems necessary to the movie, even if it's not all thatimportant to show the blood and guts. It almost strips From Hell ofits horror label because the brothers Hughes found ways to showgutted prostitutes and still raise the movie above the slasher-goregenre.The plot works like a modern-day version of an Agatha Christiebook. We're given the parts fairly soon, and we watch the inspectortry to figure it out. This is much different from the other intelligentcrime-horror flicks of late: Se7en, Kiss the Girls and In Dreamsfeatured loonies we never met until late in the movie. The Watchertold us who it was the whole time. But From Hell shows us thekiller, as well as several clues throughout the movie, but theending is still a surprise when Depp reveals it. How refreshing!The plot also runs on several levels, adding in seeminglydisjointed pieces (Anne and the Masons, for example) yet putting itall together at the end.The ending of the movie is probably the most non-climactic endingto a horror movie the last ten years. Strange that this movie buildstoward a climax that never happens, yet the ending still leavesviewers satisfied.But not all is well with From Hell:Heather Graham isn't dirty enough. If she's a prostitute, then sheshould be a dirty whore. But she's not. She's the clean-faced,red-haired, smiling one that stays out of the fray while her friendsare slaughtered in unspeakable ways. After all the effort to makethe surroundings realistic, would a little charcoal on the cheekshave been too much to ask?Besides which, Heather Graham couldn't even act in AustinPowers, what ever made the film makers believe she could act ina horror-thriller based on semi-historical events and acontroversial novel? Sorry. Heather Graham joins Mira Sorvino infailing the ""first major serious role"" test.Someone in the editing room got a little too happy at the beginningof the movie. At some point in the middle of a string of murders,did someone not think to stop and say, ""Hey but do you thinkanyone would mind if we showed more than two uninterruptedseconds of a single viewpoint?"" In some cases, the splicing anddicing of the film works, but it gets old pretty fast, and horror fansmay be wishing they could play some scenes in slow motion.The ending is also a potential weak point. The nega-climacticending leaves the possibility for the audience to walk out of thetheatre with no lasting impression of the film, except a lot of dark.This is dangerous. Bold and gutsy, and I subtract no points for itsince I found it appealing, but it is dangerous, none the less.Overall, From Hell is the third excellent horror movie released thisyear (Hannibal, The Others, sorry haven't seen Joy Ride orJeepers Creepers yet). It is dark and disturbing. The horror doesn'twork on a shock/scare factor, but rather on a psychological/fundamental level. Audiences won't scream in terror,but many will find the movie horrifying. And in that  sense, theHughes Brothers have created a rousing success.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A poor adaption of great source material,"I watched From Hell as a preview at my local cinema a while back. I thought it was an above average thriller that had a few problems in the story and casting areas (Heather Graham as an Irish prostitute somehow just doesn't convince me, maybe because she didn't have a spec of dirt on her or a decent accent). Afterwards I got around to reading the Alan Moore + Eddie Campbell brilliant graphic novel and realised that as an adaptation of that story, this film is really awful. Just because comics are words and pictures, doesn't mean they're all going to work as movies. I hope that Don Murphy, the guy behind this effort, can make a better job of the forthcoming 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Return to Sender,"I was really looking forward to this film.  Johnny Depp in another gothic thriller, what's not to like? Unfortunately, this is no Sleepy Hollow or Ninth Gate.  I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with the story.  It was intelligent and detailed. I for one didn't guess who the Ripper was, though that probably says more about me than about the screenwriter's skill.  For some reason I just didn't get involved.  Neither couls Depp since he was acting on autopilot here (though a Depp on autopilot is still better then a lot of today's actors in top form).  His romance with graham feels forced, these two are together because the script says so, not because they belonged. On the upside, there was some great looking Art direction and nice music, but that couldn't make up for the fact that From Hell feels empty and soulless, probably much like the Ripper himself.

Pointless gut dreary tale about Jack The Ripper. Again we are made grateful that we weren't poor in London in the 1880's. Not one of Depp's best. One Fly Out Of Five,"Jack the Ripper murdered 5 prostitutes in ten weeks in 1888 London and like Dracula has entered the realm of legend. Dracula was invented only a few years later in England by an English civil servant called Bram Stoker. England of the late 19th Century would seem to have been a fervent source of nasty tales.The Whitechapel area of East London at that time was a horribly destitute area with an estimated 1200 prostitutes, gleaned from the hoards of desperately poor women forced to live there by their desperate circumstances.That the murder of only 5 of them would have engendered such interest nearly 100 years later is remarkable, probably one of the first instances of a media frenzy over a serial killer.It helped of course that the ripper took delight in dissecting his victims, sometimes carefully placing their organs beside the bodies. Those sorts of lurid details tend to grab reader's attention! The Ripper was never found which also adds to the mystery.From Hell is based on a comic book written by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Campbell apparently lives in Paddington Sydney. Moore wrote the famous Watchmen series. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes have previously directed Menace II Society.From Hell is what is called in the trade richly atmospheric. It's full of gore, rain, prostitutes rutting with their clients up against fences and puzzled policemen. Nearly everyone is either destitute, mad, bad or drugged.Johnny Depp plays Abberline, an opium soaked detective who has the ability to suss out crimes by dreaming their details. Robbie Coltrane plays the straight Watson like policeman to Depp's Holmes. He who drags Abberline our of opium dens to do his job. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly one of the prostitutes and she's the best thing going for the film.But what's the point! From Hell seems to be something of a gothic film without the Goths, aimed perhaps at a more adult audience, but should they or would they be bothered. This is a slasher film without much in the way of slashes. Depp doesn't help. He plays Abberline so flat he looks like he's sleepwalking. And so will you. Get the comic book. It would probably be better.One Drowsy Fly Out Of Five",,Anonymous,Horror
Not for People With Weak Stomachs,I thought that From Hell was a pretty good movie even though I would have for Albert and Allen Hughes to be less graphic with the murders but overall I liked the movie.  I especially liked Robbie Coltrane and Johnny Depp.  The second DVD disk is what I really like because it talks about the history of Jack the Ripper and the suspects that police had around the times of the murders.  I give the movie 8/10 just because I didn't especially like the gruesome murder scenes.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Know Jack,"Hoping to uncover the motives of Jack the Ripper, a London policeman enlists the help of a prostitute of this fanciful take on the historical murderer whose identity remains a mystery still today. The film is atmospherically shot by the reliable Peter Deming and there are some neat stylistic touches such as time lapse night to day sequence as the police discover one victim's body. Generally speaking though, this is a bit of a lacklustre affair. The film's explanation of the Ripper murders as a part of an elaborate conspiracy to hush local prostitutes never quite rings true. It is almost fascinatingly twisted enough for the lack of credibility not to matter, however, the fact that Johnny Depp's protagonist uncovers the conspiracy through clairvoyance and intuition rather than actual detective work makes it hard to buy into. Imagine if Kevin Costner's character in 'JFK' used his dreams to argue against Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone and you would not be far off. The film is additionally cheapened by a romance developing between Depp and Heather Graham, cast as the prostitute who helps him. Not only does their romance do little to further the tale, the pair have few sparks between them, with each balancing Victorian accents not helping matters in the slightest. Small moments of 'From Hell' certainly work, such as Joseph Merrick making an unexpected appearance and the coins on the eyes myth, but as far as Jack the Ripper stories are concerned, 'Time After Time' and 'Murder by Decree' are far preferable motion pictures.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid,"FROM HELL has a solid story, is visually exciting and is genuinely entertaining.  Depp is good as the Inspector on the case.  I was afraid it might be a retread of his SLEEPY HOLLOW character, but it wasn't.All the acting was top rate, except for Heather Graham.I don't know if this was a ""studio"" decision or the Hughes Bros. decision to cast Ms. Graham in this film, but whomever's decision it was, it was a mistake.  Graham is gorgeous, which is a problem.  She looked nothing like a 19th century, poor London whore.  All the other prostitutes were fat, ugly and had brown teeth - except for Graham who was her gorgeous self with dyed red hair.  I don't think they even had that color hair in London at that time.  It sounds like I'm picking on her look too much, but it was incredibly distracting throughout the film and constantly ""took me out of the film.""  Her performance was passable, but far from up to par with Depp, Holm & the rest.  I am a big fan of Graham in films such as DRUGSTORE COWBOY & BOOGIE NIGHTS, but not here, not in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A beautiful picture, a powerful plot, a disappointing film","""From Hell"" is another Jack the ripper movie. It is the 4th movie of the Hughes brothers (after Menace II Society in 93, Dead President in 95 and American Pimp in 99). It is also the most accomplished one from a technical stand point. Finally it is a fairly good adaptation of the novel by Alan Moore. The movie match the pace, the atmosphere and the style of the novel. The only good difference is that in the movie, you follow the investigation through inspector Frederick George Abberline's eyes (Johnny Depp), meaning you don't know who Jack the ripper is until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The picture of ""From Hell"" is very well set. The lightning and the shadows of London streets (even though it was filmed in Prague) are a piece of work. The realization is almost perfect: from the authenticity of this White Chapel district down to the very detail of the costumes, the work achieved here is truly impressive. The overall atmosphere is tainted with Gothic effects which ad to the power of some scenes. The sound of the movie is also very well worked, from the carriages wheels to the sound of the footstep over London's pavement. However the movie remain disappointing. The acting and the dynamic of the characters are superficially done. If Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, 1999)was pretty descent and Ian Holm (remember him as Ash in Alien 1979 or in the Chariots of Fire in 1981) gave (almost as usual) a great performance, Heather Graham (Austin Powers, 1999) never emerged from the plot. She should have become the obsession of both Jack the ripper and inspector Abberline. Unfortunately most of this dynamic is underplayed. As a result the movie suffers from a lack of suspense (you just never get scared). There is almost no tension and little by little the movie becomes a pure artistic exercise leaving the cinematographic experience being a minor objectives (it should be the other way around!!!). The Hughes brothers managed to make a beautiful movie, unfortunately they also manage to make a scary movie non-scary and a powerful story unpowerful. I guess it is just another Jack the ripper movie, not the best one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Stylish and Suspenseful Look at the World of Jack the Ripper,"The world of Jack the Ripper is a dreadful place.  London of 1888 is grimy, gloomy, and labyrinthine, and the skies are tinted the color of blood. This London is a desolate place, and From Hell doesn't succeed merely as a thriller, but also as an astonishing glimpse of ugly, polluted, and overpopulated London after the initial boom of the Industrial Revolution. From Hell makes an outstanding point by demonstrating the declining morale of the public during the reign of prudish Queen Victoria.  The use of trains is an especially great thing; at least two of the murders take place while a locomotive can be heard in the background.Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp: Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) is the detective put in charge of the case.  Along with a deductive mind and a loyal partner (Robbie Coltrane: Goldeneye), Abberline is able to see the murders actually occur while under the influence of opium, his drug of choice.  These dream sequences are probably the most poignant and powerful scenes within the entire movie.  While unraveling a vast conspiracy involving the throne and the Freemasons, he becomes acquainted with the only good-looking prostitute in London, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham: Bowfinger, Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), who inevitably becomes the center of an entirely unnecessary romance.What From Hell fails in is becoming too obsessed with the identity of the infamous killer.  While the first hour of the film sculpt the anti-industrialist themes and build up a suspenseful thriller, the last half of the movie turns into a predictable, if slightly above-average, murder mystery.  Suspense has built up a considerable amount by the third act, and the easiest route is taken when the elaborate scheme is clumsily unveiled by just a small series of dialogues, which leads to an undeservedly short and simple resolution.  If only the finale had lived up to its preceding acts and had the filmmakers not have had such an obsessive devotion to unveiling the killer, then From Hell could receive a full-fledged recommendation, and would have undoubtedly would have become known as a masterpiece of the thriller genre.  It's a shame it just doesn't live up to its own potential.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Convincing and Chilling Conjecture,"Let me start with the look of this film because that is what lures one into being catapulted into the era when these events took place.  Kubrick with ""Barry Lydon"" really inspired filmmakers to use classic painting as a basis for production design and many of the scenes could be framed as fine art. Johnny Depp turns in another very potent character study and this film is very convincing in its premise which isn't just based on the material credited.   There have been many theories that have credence, linking the murders to those portrayed in the film.  No matter whether you want to believe it but they way the film is put together (with some peerless editing), you come to believe that the mystery has been solved.  A gripping and terrifying film, not for the weak hearted.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good; great detail.,"I really believe that viewing a ""making of"" for a film can enhance the enjoyment of the actual movie.  This is definitely one of those cases.  The movie, without knowing anything at all about the history, is very well done. If you like Depp films (Sleepy Hollow, Blow, etc.), you will like this one. It reminds me a lot of Sleepy Hollow if done by the Hughes Bros.  It's dark and violent, obviously, with the conditions in the 'ghetto' of London in the late 1800's really done up well.  As I said before, though, if you know some of the history and see the making of afterward (I saw the one on HBO) it really enhances the experience.  The best thing about the movie is the level of detail.  Most of the sets where built from scratch using photos and writings from the period.  When you see the movie, you'll realize just how big these sets had to be.  Quite impressive for this day and age.  All of the killings were portrayed using crime scene analysis and details about how they were done, where they were done and even the position the bodies were found in!  Of course, since this is an unsolved crime, there had to be liberties taken with the plot line but I think it was still done very well and could possibly accurate as well.  The acting was not the best ever but it did serve it's purpose, it was believable.  Overall I'd give the movie a 7.5/10 before seeing the making of special and a 9/10 after.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish thriller,"A stylish take on the ""Jack the Ripper"" storyline with drug addicted Inspector Johnny Depp attempting to find out who is murdering the prostitutes before they finish off the object of his affection, Heather Graham.

A gorgeous gothic horror film with a little ideological meat,"Okay, so it's not as complex as the book by a long shot (but ifyou've read Moore's 600-page, heavily researched masterpiecewith its 40 or so pages of historical notes in back, you weren'texpecting that). But the acting varies between decent and excellent(the latter on the part of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm), the script issolid (structured, unlike the book, as a mystery where you don'tfind out the killer's identity until the end), and the visuals aregorgeous -- a bleak Victorian landscape under a smoky red sky.Particularly nice are Abberline (Depp)'s green-tinted opium visionsof the murders. The gore is also appropriately restrained for thefirst two-thirds or so of the film, such that when we finally see oneof the women's throats being slashed (it opens up like a mouth),the sight is truly shocking. I was also glad to see that despitelacking the novel's depth, the film retained a strong focus on themurders as the act of a man embodying the violence of adominator society. The film successfully associates that society'sracism with its oppression of women -- a significant ideologicalstatement. The ripper's vision at the climax of the film (the lastmurder) has him being applauded by the all-male members of therich, educated upper class, making his vision of himself asserving his class clear.Finally, kudos to Robbie Coltrane as the sergeant -- his earthy,practical character made an excellent contrast with Depp'sintuitive, emotional Abberline.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An excellent telling of one of the many theories...,"Jack the Ripper appeared and disappeared after a relatively short killing spree.  However, as he was never caught and the gruesome nature of his killings, the Ripper legend still has steam after 100+ years.It's been told and examined in many films, most notably the ""Time After Time"" film with Malcom McDowell, David Warner, and Annie Steenburgen.""From Hell"" takes its name from one of the notes presumed to be written by the Ripper and delivered to investigating authorities.  The story of ""From Hell"" addresses the details of the legend and a quite entertaining and mostly logical way.  Depp, as usual, offers quite a turn as Inspector Abberline, the chief investigator.  This is definitely a must-see film.Be warned.  Most of the gore is kept to a minimum, seen indirectly.  This makes it even more shocking when a few graphic scenes take hold of your mind and refuse to let go.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Hughes brothers have stepped outside their boundaries.....,"The Hughes brothers have stepped outside their boundaries.....and they made it work!!!!After making some half-way decent movies...(i.e. Dead Presidents, Menace II Society)...the Hughes brothers have seemed to tack or change directions, just a lil' bit.   Ok well a lot.  Thinking that they would be another african-american set of directors bent on exploiting situations that are kind of unique to the african-american public, this movie has crossed over in all senses of the word.  And this was a welcomed change.  The movie was refreshing in a grotesque kind of way, the images and camera work was completely dark and delightful.  The story line was impeccably unique, seeing how all the previous ripper movies tended to focus on either the victims or the rippers point of view, and to add to that a conspiracy, possibly from the queen using an elite organization to protect her kingdom, definitely put a twist on the already engrossing tale.  Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Robbie Coltranes performances were shining, as was all the cast. The movie actually made you feel you were there.  I actually think I caught a buzz watching Inspector Abberline chase the dragon.  All and all I think the film was excellent, and it just goes to show that excellence is possible when someone completely steps over their boundaries.  My complaints....well a couple....the ""bodies"" of the victims could have been made to look more real.  And the showing of actual disemboweled bodies would have made the movie even more engrossing, it appeared that the camera man himself was too scared to look at them!!  But despite that, the movie was excellent!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fabulous! Great graphic novel adaptation.,"We all know that adaptations from novels sometimes suffer greatly from the change of media from page to screen. 'From Hell' is not only one of the best adaptations that I have ever seen, but managed to surprise me. It is of course, an adaptation from a graphic novel which is the best situation, since the storyboarding is already done to some extent.The sheer creepiness of the movie was wonderful.

Intriguing twist to the mystery of Jack the Ripper.,"The movie started off slow and I wondered why I was watching it.  Then it got into the action of investigating the Jack the Ripper mystery and, no pun intended, came alive.

One follows Johnny Depp's role as the inspector investigating those multiple murders as well as his love for one.

Modern Classic,"I was disappointed when I learned this movie did so poorly at the box office. It certainly had nothing to do with the movie. I can't think of anything I'd change about it. Which I can only say about maybe a few dozen movies, and I've seen at least 500 if not more.Depp and Graham both nail the accents at least from an American's perspective, no keanu reeve Dracula gaffs here, and we actually care about the characters which is refreshing in a who-done-it where the tendency is to let your characters serve as simplistic symbols.The production design should have won an Oscar, and the scoring likewise was splendid. I couldn't believe the hughes brothers directed this, Dead presidents was at best a tepid experience, Menace to Society better but still basically just an above average genre pic. This on the other hand is a classic, better than anything spike lee or singleton ever even thought about making. Their use of hip hop montage against the backdrop of a history piece was truly genius.Of all the mystery horror films I've seen from hell is tied with Jaws for number 1 in visual innovation and ranks in the top 5 over all.

You can practically smell Whitechapel,"I have not read the Alan Moore graphic novel, though since I am a fan of his work, I may very well do so. However, I understand that it is dramatically different from this. In case you are not aware, no, this is not a completely factual account of the infamous case of Jack the Ripper. The FAQ has all the details. What this does do is go into one or two of the more interesting theories, the juiciest of them, and end up with an entertaining, exciting and pretty engaging mystery-thriller that will at the very least be a fun two hours, even if some people will be able to figure out what's going on before it is revealed. The editing and cinematography are utterly gorgeous, and I'd definitely give another film directed by the Hughes brothers a chance. Visually, this never lets the audience down. And it does well as far as substance goes, as well. This builds atmosphere quite effectively, and in spite of the varying degrees of stylization that this indulges in at points, the sombre mood is constant from the first frame to the very last. Acting is solid, and the parts are well-cast. There are a couple of gold nuggets here and there in the dialog. The music is fitting and great. This holds a lot of authenticity, and the production values leave nothing to be desired. There is moderately frequent strong language, brief full frontal nudity, plenty of sensuality and sexuality in this, as well as disturbing content, bloody violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genres this falls into, and/or is fascinated with the subject matter. Just make sure you've got the stomach for it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fantastic!,"This is an amazing adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore. They managed to keep the story pretty much intact, as well as the style and pacing of the book. I was repeatedly amazed at how much of the book got into the movie, which I was expecting to be similar in name and subject matter only.There is one major difference between novel and the movie: in the novel, you know exactly who Jack is pretty much from the start, as well as the reasons he has for the murders. In the movie they flip it around to make it more of a mystery (and this is an appropriate change for a movie version).The crux of this change is that if you've not read the graphic novel, DON'T --  not until you've seen the movie. It gives away too much, and will reduce your enjoyment of the movie.(in case you're wondering, I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival's Gala Premiere, which is why I've seen it and you haven't! :-) )",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

From Hell,"After recently reading the graphic novel I decided to see the movie adaptation and it turned out to be a surprising treat. Based on the comic by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, ""From Hell"" is a stylish and opulent adaptation that semi-fictionalizes the ghastly and nightmarish events that occurred in the Whitechapel Area of London in 1888. Featuring the star-led cast of Johnny Depp and Heather Graham the film probes on history, conspiracy and madness.Johnny Depp is a youthful opium-sniffing, absinthe-imbibing chief inspector Frederick Abberline who leads the London Metropolitan Police in the case of the infamous Jack the Ripper, the psychopathic serial killer who unleashed a reign of terror on a terrified nation after gruesomely murdering five prostitutes deep in the bowels of Victorian London. Methodical, competent and supposedly psychic despite his mental haze Abberline step by step solves the case only to slam head-on into a conspiracy that's beyond his capacity to handle. With a varied cast of nobles, doctors, freemasons, prostitutes, cab drivers, police, street urchins and what have you late 19th Century London comes to life in all its complexity. The narrow, filthy and grimy streets of Whitechapel and its motley array of downtrodden inhabitants are colorfully depicted in all their smelly and impoverished states. The film doesn't shy away from the gore highlighting a clinical display of human organs and blood painting a portrait of the mind of a madman. While the cliched anti-rich and corny love story tropes snag a well-done film the movie overall is a highly watchable visual treat.Perhaps the best film on Jack the Ripper, ""From Hell"" is a must watch for fans of history, true crime and well-made flicks. A decent commercial and critical success upon release and a lead-up to Johnny Depp's career-revival this is one not to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good take on Jack, the Ripper, events. Warning: it's a movie!","People need to get things straight from the beginning: From Hell (2001) is not a documentary by any means. It takes a well known series of unfortunate events and gives its own take on it. Of course, to spice things up, it adds some known theories into the mix to add thrill and drama.It has a slow pace, as for many great police thrillers. It's a movie about watching a series of events and a finale; there're little to no action scenes or whatnot.I have to say I kinda dislike Abberline's take on this movie. It has way too many Johnny Depp thrown into it and maybe over the top re-imagination into his persona.Overall, good movie if you're into some slow paced police investigation thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gritty and violent thriller,"From Hell is a gritty and violent thriller revolving around the famed Jack the Ripper murders. The clandestine plot as to who the Ripper actually is probably far removed from the real case, but within the universe this film establishes it fits like a glove. You really don't have any idea who it could be until the last 15 minutes. And none of the red herrings feel like the filmmakers are just pulling your chain.As always, Depp delivers a great character in the mumbling, opium addicted, hallucinating Detective Abberdine. Heather Gramm is mere window dressing as his hooker-girlfriend, but far less annoying here than in most of her performances.The real star of From Hell however has to be the scenery. 19th century London is depicted so convincingly in it's grime and depravity, you'll marvel at its sheer ugliness.

"Tense and Eerie, as ever Depp is excellent!","I am not a big fan of the horrer genre at all basically becuase most are bad and the fact is I don't get scared by what happens in movies. I don't mind mystery chillers or the more pyschological horrer like this film, the sort of film that substitutes attractive, screaming, 18 year old girls with clearly visible nipples(Rose Mcgowen, Scream) for a developing plot and atmospheric build up. I particularly find little enjoyment from the slasher genre especially teen slashers. Supposed classics like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street I think are so overated. The first Scream I found good though but still over-rated. Anyway this film is a horrer mystery that builds up atmospheric tension and neat plot twists and developments. The lighting and sets in this movie are fantastic. The cast are made up of a host of British thespiens and of course the two hollywood film stars Johnny Depp and the gorgeous Heather Graham. Of course Depp and Graham are there purely to sell the film ahead of their acting talents which are considerable. Johnny Depp in the last three years has stared in three excellent horrer flicks of various styles, this, Sleepy Hollow and the Ninth Gate. All with him featuring a different style character with a different accent. Depp has proven himself as a brilliant character actor. In ""From Hell"" he stars as a detective who has visions and is a drug addict. He is on the case of Jack the Ripper with the help of the equally good Robbie Coltrane. The Ripper is killing prostitutes and has targeted five working girls in particular for his ritualistic murders. They include Grahams characters as well as Lesley Sharp and Annabelle Apison as two of the other Whores, the remaining two I know by face from other films but cannot think of their names. The film is very effective, it has its tense moments and towards the end of the film we get more gore as the ripper starts to rampage. Both the American leads do very good cockney accents as do the British luvvies. As for the plot well it nears the point of losing the audience with plot twists and conspiracy theories but the big twists of the film are generally surprising. I was sitting in my seat and half an hour in I thought I'd worked it out, I was well proud of myself and had a grin like a cheshire cat until the Rippers identity was made clear and frankly I was way off. Some moments are quite obvious but that is the case of any movie in history. Overall this was a very good chiller, the story was good and the plot twists were also surpising. I loved the recreation of 19th century London and the lighting effects the film really takes you to another time and place (unless your from london then its just another time). Although the film is good it is one of those that is rather forgettable, I won't remember much in a few weeks except for the plot twist. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best modern Gothic horror films ever made.  An overlooked masterpiece.,"My oh my, if ever there was a film overlooked last year, this was it. Not since David Lynch's ""Elephant Man"" has there been such a hauntingly unique and creative artistic vision of Victorian England. And not since ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" has there been such an enjoyably disturbing onslaught of blood and guts. This surely is one of the most gory and shocking horror films ever produced. Add in a delightfully witty performance from rotund British character actor Robbie Coltrane, some fantastic theories on Jack the Ripper, marvelously imaginative and literate direction from a pair of ghetto-raised black brothers, a wonderful script spun from a graphic comic-book (!), a suitably off-kilter turn by Johnny Depp, conspiracy theories, political intrigue, scantily clad women, cool costumes, a wonderfully bad Irish accent from Heather Graham, some wild dream sequences and low and behold, you have one of the greatest Gothic-horror-gory-murder mysteries ever produced.

Saucy Jacky's Bloody Good Time,"""From Hell"" is not really a horror movie, though it has some gruesome and disturbing moments, but rather a modern serial-killer movie given an unusual setting, delving into our fascination with the first truly famous serial killer in history.One of the nice things about making a Jack the Ripper movie is that it is a historical story, which lends it a certain gravitas and a built-in interest factor, but since history doesn't know for sure who the guy really was, you get to make up your own ending.  ""From Hell"" seizes on one of the more far-out (and frankly, historically implausible) conspiracy theories surrounding the mysterious stalker of Whitechapel.  Still, in Ripper lore there is plenty of ""evidence"" that can be construed to support just about any theory you can think of, and while the movie takes a few liberties with the historical record, a great many details are rooted in established fact. While I wouldn't view this movie as a conclusive examination of the case, it gives the story enough credibility that it functions quite well as a thriller.The story follows Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp), the detective charged with catching the killer (oddly, they consistently refer to him as ""Jack the Ripper"", even while the movie acknowledges that the letter bearing that name was probably a fake), while he navigates the seamy alleys of the East End, trying to protect the streetwalkers that seem to attract homicidal wrath (among them Heather Graham, as ""Black Mary"" Kelly; interesting casting choice, that) and contending with the interference of Scotland Yard's shadowy and muscular Special Branch.One irritating thing about the movie is in the character of Abberline. Understandably, the movie makes him younger and sleeker so he can be played by Johnny Depp (the real-life Abberline was forty-five and married with children while investigating the Ripper case), but it also subscribes to the annoying convention of mythologizing the ""profiler"".  I swear if I see one more psychic detective who gets otherworldly ""vibes"" about a case, I'm going to hurl my copy of ""Journey into Darkness"" through the screen.  Hollywood seems uncomfortable dealing with profilers for what they are: experienced detectives who are able to detect patterns in a crime and extrapolate what kind of person they are looking for.  Isn't that impressive enough? Abberline was, by most accounts, a dedicated and methodical investigator, but here he is a slightly dissolute dope fiend who gets flashes of the future and ""sees"" the Ripper's future victims while in an absinthe or opium-induced daze.  Often, the ""psychic detective"" thing is used as a cheap springboard for a lazy screenwriter to avoid having to think about how the pieces of a puzzle might fit together; in this movie the ""visions"" are not only distracting, they're really unnecessary: they reveal little that a sharp guy like Abberline couldn't figure out from available evidence.  They must have been interesting to film, though; I guess that's why they're in the movie.Twin directors Albert and Allen Hughes made their mark in the 90s with the acclaimed ""Menace II Society"", one of the raft of inner-city neo-gangster opuses that were in vogue at the time.  It seems the Hugheses made a deliberate attempt to make a movie as different from that as they could, and it would seem a shrewd move.  After all, it took John Singleton a couple of movies to escape from the 'hood; and, remember what happened to Matty Rich? Yeah, me neither.  Though ""From Hell"" is a story of another blighted urban landscape, there's not a drive-by in sight.  Well, maybe by hansom cab.The Hugheses make good use of the fetid, dire streets of 1880s London (actually, the movie was filmed primarily in the Czech Republic; apparently, London just ain't seedy enough anymore).  They play with light in interesting ways, silhouetting the spires of London's palaces and cathedrals against a roiling red sky, suggesting that if we aren't actually in Hell, we're at least in a pretty close suburb with bus service there.  The Ripper's hansom cab has twin lanterns that sputter with bilious green light; it looks like a primordial monster slithering through the night, which is a neat visual (useful, too; hansom cabs all look pretty much alike otherwise).The cast is good, although more so in supporting roles than lead ones.  Depp is fine, though his accent is weird.  Heather Graham is better than I expected her to be, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn't have been too hard to find a better actress (probably for less money).  Ian Holm does well as a retired surgeon who advises Abberline on the investigation, an old man with an infirm arm and a few too many secrets to keep.  Also standing out is Robbie Coltrane, as Abberline's loyal, over-literate sergeant.  Fans of ""The Elephant Man"" will take special interest in a certain historical cameo.The movie is well-paced, well-filmed, and delivers the thriller goods in fine style.  It doesn't hold up to too much scrutiny, especially among those familiar with the real case, unless they're willing to be good sports. There are a few spots where, eager to fit in as many authentic details as possible, the characters do things that don't make much sense, and the exact motivations for some of the Ripper's actions are not made clear.  I suppose you shouldn't expect too much clarity form a movie about an unsolved case. Ripperologists and aspiring forensic historians should not so much suspend their disbelief as zip it in a bag and leave it at the box office for a claim stub; you can pick it up when you leave.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Effective,"At first, the Hughes Brothers might seem like an odd choice to direct this exceedingly graphic re-imagining of the Jack the Ripper case: two African Americans whose previous films (`Menace II Society' among them) dealt exclusively with current American social issues. But as the film goes on, you begin to be aware of a sympathy the filmmakers have for the Ripper's downtrodden victims that relates full well to their current concerns. Here, the victims are the desperate prostitutes struggling to survive in a ghetto where they are regularly persecuted and violently shaken down; and the Jews, whom the London police use as scapegoats for the murders in order to divert suspicion from a possible royal plot. The effect is subtle and very effective. There's also a great attention to period detail (everything about nineteenth-century London is presented convincingly--the production design is by Martin Childs who also did `Quills') and the added benefits of another excellent performance from Johnny Depp (perhaps today's most daring actor) and a fine one from Heather Graham. They're aided by a fine supporting cast including Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and Katrin Cartlidge (from Mike Leigh's ensemble). All in all, this is a distinguished film with its topics compelling and controversial. Be forewarned, though--this is a stomach-churning experience with many disturbing images and definitely not for the squeamish.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An Extravagantly Dark Grand Guignol Period Graphic Novel Adaptation, Unrestrained By Any Particular Target Audience","The story of Jack the Ripper, working in the depraved and underprivileged Whitechapel district of London in 1888, shocking even by any Whitechapel benchmark of the time, has been feed for myriad movies and books, both fiction and non, and even recurring news that the case has been closed have not satisfied our curiosity. This anamorphically shot Victorian- era serial killer drama is a vivid, atmospheric work by the talented Hughes Brothers, who certainly made quite a departure from their prior string of films which included Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp.Though maybe not quite as enthralling in this as Ian Holm, Johnny Depp is creative and becoming as an opium-addicted widowed inspector whose drug-induced dreams generate clairvoyant insights into investigations. The resonance of Sherlock Holmes, another fan of the pipe, is instantly recognizable, and Al and Allen Hughes's drastic departure from 'hood tragedies provides its hero with a pushy assistant in played by Robbie Coltraine, a policeman sent to heave Depp out of the opium dens and jog his memory of his duty.Drawing a fairly dark performance even from Heather Graham, this movie is murky, dank and exhilaratingly so. The movie almost feels devious or illicit. There's a remarkable shot that begins with the city of London, cranks down past towers and trains, and plummets into a cavernous cellar where a Masonic group is sitting in judgment of one of its affiliates. You are stricken with the conception of the vigorous physical evolution of the historical metropolitan area, and the underground mechanisms of the Establishment. In an era when social morals were severe and pitiless, mischief behind closed doors was a flourishing, hot-blooded activity. Countless, maybe all, wealthy and respectable men took part in secret sin.The Hughes Brothers dive headlong into this universe, so far from their native roots and previous subject matter, embellishing and invigorating everything they depict. Their source material is graphic novel by Alan Moore, and some of their extravagant black-and-red cinematography feels influenced by modern comic book illustration, with its angry slants and angles and overstated vantage points. The production design targets garish settings, dripping wet color schemes, bottomless shadows, all painting a lavish picture of an 1880s world of subterranean corners and locales protected by the utmost evil of power and corruption.Watching the movie, I am astounded by how reliably it takes you surprise. Its charm is that it doesn't seem to cater to any particular target audience. Its comic book origins may suggest a younger male audience, but its history, as well as its use of drama much more than violence, doesn't seem made for the same folks, though its gushing blood and, literally, guts, certainly do. It is its own beast, perhaps more in the tradition of HushHush, Sweet Charlotte with a touch of surreality about a side view of an utterly nasty society, dishonored with a trickle- down effect of debauchery and ruthless self-preservation.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great depiction...,"The Hughes brothers did an excellent job of capturing the smallest of details in a story that still leaves people bewildered as to ""who did it?""

Fantastic Representation of the Atmosphere and Era - Just Ignore the Innacuracies,"A fine representation of the attitudes and the atmosphere of Victorian Era circa 1888.
The identified Ripper suspect and the motives for the crimes were discounted decades ago.
Numerous historical innaccuracies also, but entertaining if taken as a work of fiction rather than a true representation of the Ripper Crimes and History.Eg. Aberline relaxing whilst listening to a gramophone. The Gramaphone was patented in 1887, therefore it would have existed at the time, however, obtaining one would have been prohibitively expensive, reserved for Royalty and Aristocracy. Well out of the price range of a humble Police Inspector with an Opium habit.The real Aberline was an alcoholic, not an opium addict and lived to middle age.

Praise for a very good movie :),"From Hell - A great movie for anyone who enjoys a bit of gore and a very creative take on an historical figure ;)I really enjoyed the level of gore included in this movie - it wasn't too little (as to be expected with this particular story) and it wasn't overboard unrealistic - although there was definitely a fair amount :)The character development for Depp's character was quite interesting - I really enjoyed the point of view taken throughout the course of the movie. The 'character' of characters (if you know what I mean) was a bit of a surprise to me. In other words, they did a very good job in keeping the suspense!The creative 'techniques' implemented in the movie (you'll see what I mean :) ) were very cool!I have to comment on the technical aspects (as they are incredibly important to any and every movie) - excellent! The camera work was fantastic, the special effects, and the music.....well, in the viewing of this movie at the theater I went to we had a bit of a ""disturbance"" in more than one way while watching - the audio stopped working on the film for some reason in the middle for a couple minutes, yet they continued to show the video, but *chills* they played NSYNC music to replace the actual audio blahhhh!The actual part of the movie that I saw, however, receives some of my highest praise - I've always enjoyed the original story of the movie and loved their take on it, but there's almost always room for improvement and the ending for me.....it just didn't add to the movie what it could have.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jack Is Back!,"""From Hell"" is quite a departure for the Hughes Brothers.  One almost wouldn't expect something like this from the twins who directed ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents.""  But they did a wonderful job in this examination of the Jack the Ripper murders.  The Victorian city of London is presented in its dismal, eerie splendor.  Johnny Depp seems to fit in as Inspector Abberline, the latest in his long list of oddball movie roles. And the story is rather well-written, taking an in-depth look at the murders, all the suspects, and thought-provoking theories involving Buckingham Palace scandals and secret societies.  This movie may not have solved the mystery of Jack the Ripper once and for all.  But it adds to the legacy of a legend that will haunt us all.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

lack maturity and therein lies consistency,"""From Hell "". Hughes Brothers Direction..well, the movie has visuals that are influenced by the modern surrealism that movies have created,especially from the west coast like the ones "" The Cell"" slant angles and some flouroscent colors, Depp is the constable that is required to solve the case of murders in the whitechapel neighbourhood in London during the late  1880 's, the mood is gloomy when the camera captures the red sky and the stinking streets, there is murder and blood of the unfortunate ones whilst prostitutes on the streets and the cobbles gleam well in in the moonlight, The murders do seem to have a calming effect on the characters ,. How can we expect 29 year olds from CA that have done music videos of hiphop to understand the gross subtleties of british accent, to the pot smoking brothers the american accents and the british is subtle. Depp with a deep italian accent seems british when every once in a while like the mole out of the hole jumps the awareness of the period and thereby the british , Heather tries much harder and she would have visited a local american language specialist on accent  to straighten it to suit american movies after the schedule From Hell, visuals lack maturity and therein lies consistency, the movies good vibes are present in the consistency of the brothers, the brothers do a good job within their realm of technical choice. Depp is never done better in any movie before, that is if you consider the best to be a tree doing a role of micheal caine in ""Jack the Ripper:"" the earlier version. The movie is a pleasent watch and for those that want to have boyfriends jump into thier arms this will be a dissapointment.

Good premise...Not-so good outcome.,"This film adaptation by the Hughes Brothers, though cinematically stylish and darkly brooding, runs immediately into predictable territory within the first 10 minutes.  The casting itself is passable with Heather Graham, and Depp and Holm have good chemistry together; however, the only truly believable characters were the whores themselves...disgusting, pathetic, derelicts of society who use their womanhood as their livelihood- constantly striving for absolution from their sentences to poverty, and only receiving it in horrific deaths.Overall, it's too much of a ""whodunit"" pipe-dream.  Ol' Jack would have turned his nose up at a tale that is so uninspired.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, not great.","I like this movie, but it missed an awful lot of marks. The cinematography and setting are just dark enough to remain acceptable, but not nearly dark enough for the story. The actors are all pretty good, with the exception of Coltrane and Holme who're terrific. Heather Graham had to act against the dewy-fresh and scrubbed-clean way they costumed her and set her lighting and camera angles, and both she and Depp had to deal with someone telling them to affect ridiculous, not to mention, uneven accents and speech patterns.I don't think the Hughes Bros. were nearly brave or thoughtful enough to take on this project. They took very few risks and missed most of the visual and story characteristics that made the novel great. They ended up turning a very intellectual work into something more of an entertainment, and on the entertainment level, I thought the movie works. Just don't think too hard when you watch it, or expect anything approximating the novel. If that's the underlying message - that the Victorian era ushered in the age of entertainment over intellectual substance - then they came a bit close to making some sort of point.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I remember...,"So, I saw this movie right when it came out on video which was a couple of years ago (maybe only one), and I remember turning it off after the first thirty minutes, 'cause I thought it was really boring.  However, I watched it again today all the way through and really enjoyed it.  As bloody as some might think it is, it's really not that bad and I thought it portrayed the 1800s really well.Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual and you never think of him as Johnny Depp but as the role he's playing. I was surprised by Heather Grahamm just because she's usually playing the ditzy blond, but she was very believable and good in this role.Jack The Ripper did a fine job, and I'm sure the script stayed true to the book (although I have not yet read it.).I give the film an 8 out of 10 (10 being the highest).

A hellishly good film,"I decided the other day that i wanted to see a film so, i ambled into my local Blockies and browsed for something i hadn't seen. My basic guideline, however, was it needed to have Johnny Depp in it. I adore him! He is a fantastic actor and i knew any film that i chose that had him in it would be worth while. Boy was I right. there it was sitting on the bottom shelf tucked behind classics like the Abyss and Lock Stock but i thought, Meh, what the hell I'll give it a try, i didn't even know what it was about.Now normally i hate horror movies but this was so good. The story line though loosely based on the history involving Jack the Rippper was very engaging and had twists and turns in it that i had not expected, the only way i figured out who the killer was was the fact that the actor has a very distinct voice, apart from that i was guessing until the end. Sometimes acting left a lot to be desired, it was quite like a school play in some parts where the actors were just hanging around to say their lines there was no real feeling in it and i feel that Heather Graham could have been put to better use. Even though she is good actress i didn't feel that she worked in this film. However the pairing of Robby Coltrane and JD was inspired they worked very well off of each other and made the film that much more worth while. JD seems to be a chameleon when it comes to parts, he just becomes that person and his Cockney was spot on. Johnny Depp will forever be my favorite. To end, I recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are unpredictable.Love from Hell",,Anonymous,Horror
A waste of time and money! Completely disappointing!,"Well I saw this movie yesterday and I expected a lot, since I saw the trailer and thought it would be amazing.

I certainly regret to have seen this movie, because I wasted my time and money; nevertheless I'm glad I didn't pay much for the ticket. That was good! I'm going to give you some reasons not to see this film:1 It's quite slow and unnecessary murders happen. 2 The acting isn't convincing. 3 The story isn't neither gripping nor interesting. 4 It wasn't really scary to me, it was just disturbing.The ending is very disappointing as well as its beginning.

With his credit in Sleepy Hollow, and now this, Johnny Depp is on his way in following in the footsteps of Peter Cushing.    Warning, From Hell does not discriminate in the blood and guts category. However, while watching the movie, viewers should be able to look beyond that and into the ""criminology"" aspect of the film. The science of this picture clearly demonstrates how crimes of the early centuries were looked upon, processed, investigated and solved.

A Shame,"Speaking as a one who has researched Jack The Ripper for some time I was disappointed with this Film. Although it does not make out to be an accurate retelling of the events it did leave a lot to be desired in the way of facts. For example Abberline played by Jonny Depp was portrayed as a Cockney who was addicted to opium in reality Abberline was from Dorset and retired to Bournemouth after he left The Police Force. This is just one of many flaws in the script. Although superbly acted by the entire cast, I felt more could've been gleamed from the Graphic Novel on which the film is based. Alan Moore's and Eddie Campbell's work was far superior in providing Background, Reason for Conspiracy and Motivation of the Villain. Instead the film left us with many questions unanswered.",,Anonymous,Horror

Some other characters are not that good, some things unbelievable. But the movie has atmosphere. That is important. It succeeds un fields, where many other movies were doomed to failure. It takes us on a ride through the streets of gas-lit London.

Its All In The Wrist Action.,"One of the greatest murder mysteries of all time, a timeless whodunit, necessitates the big screen interpretation thereof to be of high caliber. From Hell' is certainly well done and most interesting to watch. When the subject matter is so well known and it's history has been meticulously pieced together accessible to millions the world over, a significant challenge is presented to the moviemakers. How do you inspire interest in a story that has been heard many times over? One way would be to look for a novel that takes one of the theories and adds unique qualities to the big players of the time through which the story unfolds. Now what you have is a captivating story of interest to those in the know as well. Of course, acquiring the services of a talented cast will be of assistance too. When this is put together with surreal imagery and artistic sets, you have the formula to take up the challenge.The moviemakers do much to exploit the audience perception of the time which is evident from the opening statement that the Ripper sees himself as the one who will be credited with giving birth to the Twentieth century. Although this illustrated the mind  set of the character that they had chosen for the Ripper, that is, one of a man who had lost all appreciation for humanity for the mastery of his trade, he is an iconic figure of the 19th century and the boldness of his statement serves to accentuate the gravity of his evil presence.Audience perception is largely due to the rise of media at the time which achieved mass production and the story of the murders spread like fire. Whitechapel was in a grip of terror since gruesome details were of the present rather than a stale story. The rest of London read with fearful interest. His will  o  the wisp nature and methodical brutality was quickly immortalized and even today new documents are rising to the fore further titillating public interest.The opening sequence reminds one of The Crow' where we are shown a cruel, inhospitable part of London where people are expendable commodities and civil society would have nothing to do with them. The blood red sky relayed a message to the audience of the bloodshed that lay ahead. We then descend into the city and witness the degradation in the form of drunkenness and street women being exploited. A problem that some may have is that the characters are not realistic enough since they are too pleasing to the eye. However, we are not dealing with a realistic account, but a movie that must identify with the audiences perception of the times which has been molded by countless movies and novels. The Hughes Brothers would do well not to deviate from this and they did not.The use of this kind of imagery was presumably taken from the graphic novel. Not necessarily a direct excerpt, but its use helped to tie in the world of the graphic novel with that of the big screen. In that sense the movie should appeal to readers of the novel as well as presenting a new fictional interpretation of these events to other members of the audience. Current CGI technology certainly has the ability to enable a transition of this type. As with The Crow' the moviemakers have successfully brought to life the pages of the graphic novel.An impression of the medical fraternity of the time was given as being social beings above all others who were specimens for their diagnosis. The scenes with the Elephant man illustrated this. They were devoid of empathy and utilized the tools of the trade to achieve the required ends of the clan. This was the crux of the Ripper's actions and was the object of a few mesmerizing montages. What was noticeable here was that the gore was limited to suggestion and the savage attacks were indicated by the flash of a sharp blade. This was a cinematically acceptable way of capturing these gruesome scenes and most of the movie rides on the ominous presence of the Ripper rather than on the extremities of his crimes.His overbearing presence was also achieved by scenes where we see the back of the Ripper and hear his voice as a hissing, malevolent evil. When we discover his identity and his eyes turn to pitch black, we are given an image of the dark, raging evil entity that resides within. The eyes rather than his actions are used to better describe his nature. This is done again in one of the final scenes where we see him in confinement with milky eyes  no longer a threat, devoid of means to do anything.The cast was full of notables and all aptly contributed to the movie. Johnny Depp was a good choice for the lead role of Detective Abberline. His natural and genuine sense of empathy was an entertaining stark contrast to that of the Ripper and the members of the clan. He is also a staunch individualist who will do things on inspiration rather than to the book thus fitting snugly into the shell of his character. Ian Holme got the transition from being the physician at the twilight of his career (a harmless old man), to the demonic, twisted Doctor with an evil purpose in the confrontation scene with Depp without hamming it up and was utterly convincing. Depp's sidekick, Robbie Coltrane, is an outstanding character actor and is always memorable. Ian Richardson has a strong penchant for playing powerful people with dark ulterior motives and delivers once more. Heather Graham perhaps did not do enough with her role, but did not pale too badly in comparison to the strong cast.The fear of the stalker who strikes without warning and leaves his gruesome acts for all to see has a special place deep in the sub  conscious of society. He attacks our sense of security and rekindles our ancient fear of the unknown. Jack The Ripper was such a being and his heinous acts seemed to be not of man, but of an evil entity. Horror will always be a walking ground for the man who got away. Even if they do solve the case, which I doubt, the continued deliberation as to his true identity will continue to inspire future tales of the world's most infamous night stalker.",,Anonymous,Horror

A Ripping Yarn,"This Hughes Bros. film opens upon a nightmarish London - a sort of Victorian Gotham in this - awash amidst a tide of prostitutes and sleaze. At times, however, the movie seems almost on the point of drowning amidst 19th century cliché. I was half-expecting to see a few child chimney sweeps, Count Dracula sloping past or a farmer tolling a bell and shouting 'Wives for sale!' to complete the somewhat overblown dystopian portraitUltimately 'From Hell' is passable entertainment but falls dramatically short of classic status. The underlying conspiracy theory: that the Whitechapel murders were a grandiose conspiracy concocted (I simplify) by a combination of Queen Victoria, the Freemasons and the Elephant Man takes some swallowing as does Heather Graham's cockney accent which makes her sound like the missing link between Dick Van Dyke and the dodgy Australian guys who used to play Daphne Moon's 'English' boyfriends on Frasier.That said, hers is not a bad performance and there is good acting aplenty to be seen here notably Ian Richardson as a particularly moronic bastion of the Mafia of the Mediocre, Coltrane as a Victorian Cracker and Depp himself who is as decent as always as the junkie. His accent is actually pretty spot on (speaking as a limey myself) though as some have noted a bit 'below stairs' for a middle class officer of the law.Adapted from the 'graphic novel' written by the Great Bearded Ayatollah of British comics Alan Moore, 'From Hell' is ultimately something of a disappointment. Despite a French cameo UK TV audiences will recognise, it all ends fairly corny and I left feeling I'd learnt nothing reliable about the Ripper case. But until Halo Jones, V for Vendetta  or D.R. and Quinch hit the silver screen (unlikely) Moore fans will just have to make the most of this decidedly average picture.",,Anonymous,Horror
Mary Poppins with ultraviolence,"Do you remember that scene from 'Time Bandits' which was set in Sherwood Forest? In keeping with an accurate portrayal of the era, everyone is dressed in muslin sacks and covered in filth. Suddenly Robin Hood, played by John Cleese, appears in full Pantomime regalia. Right down to the bright green tights... and that's exactly what Heather Graham looks like in this film. While all the other whores have bad complexions, bad hair and have dirty sex in the corners of dark alleys, Heather swans through the film like..well, John Cleese in a pair of green tights.It seems that the only source of information about Victorian history that the two young American directors had came from comic books.

Enjoy From Hell as a fictional romp....but what a shame it offers us nothing new on the murders,"Not since Michael Caine donned the garb of a Victorian police inspector for a 1988 mini-series has there been a decent stab at a Jack the Ripper film.So quite why the Hughes brothers decided to remake the old ITV version is a mystery to me.While From Hell successfully creates the requisite dark and foreboding atmosphere, it lazily relies on the generation old and long-discredited Stephen Knight theory as to the killer's identity.Anyone with a passing familiarity with the case has heard whodoneit according to this legend, so it would have been a refreshing change to see the production team plump for a different suspect altogether, preferably one whose candidacy wasn't disproved nearly thirty years ago.Because lest anyone leave the cinema thinking that the Ripper might indeed have been the tall-hatted, caped figure who descends elegantly from a coach in From Hell, be assured that Stephen Knight was found to have fabricated the only, tenuous evidence for his fantasies the moment serious researchers starting investigating his work.And although fairly credible suspects such as Tumblety and William Bury have been identified, our best guess as to the killer's identity is still that he was a nameless, psychotic misfit who lived somewhere in the East of London, though not necessarily on the doorstep of the murders, and who managed to escape the attentions of the contemporary police, who were not used to dealing with the modern serial killer: the murderer of strangers.Nevertheless, there are some strong things in the favour of this movie. The performances of Depp, and indeed Heather Graham, for one. (I only noticed one brief moment when Graham's accent faltered, although it is interesting to think that the real Mary Kelly was brought up in Wales - try wrapping your tongue round that accent, Heather.) I also enjoyed Robbie Coltrane's turn as the phlegmatic Sergeant Godley, and each of the circle of ""unfortunates"" picked off by the Ripper gives us an acting masterclass. The relationship between the whores (as they refer to themselves) seems genuine and warm, even if the characters they play did not in fact know one another, and I also really believed that Inspector Abberline and his Sergeant had a solid relationship and cared about each other, making for a poignant moment at the close of events.The effort to recreate the actual sites of the murders is another thing From Hell has going for it, and it would be churlish to note that the brothers have taken certain liberties when it comes to the details of the killings.Take From Hell for what it is, then, and enjoy it as a fictional romp. But what a shame then the careful attention displayed in the production values of this film could not have been lavished on a script that offered the cinema-going public something new to excite them about this curious chapter of criminal history.Three stars out of five.",,Anonymous,Horror
Jack the Ripper - A good film,"Jack the Ripper continues to allude people, even to this day. First and foremost, the suspect list is very extensive. However, this version from the film, From Hell, goes with the popular theory of a Royal/Freemason conspiracy.From Hell, is a film that captures late 1880s London very successfully. The technical and production skills that provide the haunting slum appearance of East London is superb.As for the film, many liberties were indeed taken. Johnny Depp was magnificent as Frederick Aberline...but Aberline cannot be said to be a drug-addict and the ending is fanciful. I understand artistic license, but when a film embarks upon a non-fictional event, the truth or facts, should still be used as the fixture and fitting of a film's direction.I enjoyed the film, and the actors and actresses were extremely good. The story and caveats were interesting, but its the omissions of the case that confused me. For example, Jack the Ripper was identified, not facially, but his clothes were identified. I believe it was a deer stalkers hat and tweed clothing and a small suitcase, which was obviously used for his surgical apparatus. The mystery of the Ripper rests on how the hell, no-one noticed anything and the lack of witnesses. London during the late 1880s was a very over-crowded place, especially the East End, with arrivals from Eastern Jews escaping the pogroms and also Chinese immigrants.The film could've projected the social and political pressures more, as it was these issues, that made the Police work even more daunting, as it was an area that was afflicted with radicalism and communities in perpetual transit. This would mean, many false leads and greater pressure as a result.However as a film, the atmosphere, the production and acting, all combine to make a great film....but not a factual film!",,Anonymous,Horror
Memo to Hughes Brothers' analyst: Discuss woman problem,"The Hughes brothers' adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novelabout Jack the Ripper is crudely compelling but hard to respect.Even seemingly-misogynistic directors like Dario Argento andBrian DePalma build into their thrillers an awareness of thetaboo-breaking power held by images of vulnerable women beingphysically harmed. Their set pieces are not just displays ofvirtuosity, but have seismic emotional power. For Albert and AllanHughes, the slicing-up of prostitutes is just an opportunity foranother effect, a stick-on decal, an expensive sound cue. Thesound of surgical instruments on raw bone waltzes with strobe-cutflashes of bloody flesh, staring dead eyeballs, flies rubbing theirhands before dipping into a human feast. The total effect is thesame as that of the brothers' last movie, AMERICAN PIMP--there isno directorial point of view save that of, ""Wow, cool!"" The pictureoften suggests the souped-up dopiness of Francis Coppola'sDRACULA--though the dialogue often plunges to the level of abottom-drawer TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE. Heather Graham,as the Main Hooker, and Johnny Depp, as a coolio, absinthe-sipping Sherlock Holmes, are made to look like two ofthe most beautiful people in the world, which no doubt they are. IanHolm, as Queen Victoria's ""ordinary physician,"" gives aperformance of dazzling accomplishment, especially when youconsider he's given lines that would disgrace a Hammer horrormovie.

the atmosphere,"the atmosphere is the first virtue of film. than - the performances of actors - Johnny Depp as George Abberline , Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, Heather Graham as Mary Kelly. but it is not a surprise . and that detail does it only remind of an old story without new elements. because it is nothing to say new. and the desire to present, in careful manner, each part of case, the costumes, the lights, the details who becomes more than small pieces of story are bones for a real good film who, far to be original or great, it is an interesting thriller for science to build the story. it could be, in same measure, a thriller and a dramatic love story. each as good one.",,Anonymous,Horror
atrocious.,"Apparently, Whitechapel prostitutes were all pretty, clear-skinned young women with hearts of gold.  Apparently, Fred Abberline was an opium addict who committed suicide after the Ripper murders (NB: he wasn't, and he didn't - he lived until 1929).  Johnny Depp, fine actor though he is, was hilariously miscast in this film - about 20 years too young for a start. Also, why do all American actors playing British characters feel they need to put on awful cockney accents?  The real Abberline was born in Dorset and would almost certainly not have spoken with an ""'ullo guvnor"" accent.  Mary Kelly (Heather Graham's character) was born in Ireland, raised in Wales and did not move to London until the age of 21.  Leaving aside the constellation of factual errors, this was a really poor, and quite dull, film.  Far too long, overly melodramatic, and quite ridiculous in parts (the romance between Abberline and Mary Kelly, for example).  It's also interesting that the filmmakers based their work on Alan Moore's graphic novel, but did not bother to go back to the original source: Stephen Knight's speculative, but well-researched, ""Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution"".",,Anonymous,Horror
Not what it could be,"I figured I would be seeing a watered down version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, but instead I was disappointed to see that they completely changed characters,relationships, and tacked on a happy ending. Even worse, it was essential in the novel to know who Jack the Ripper was from the beginning in order for the action to work as an examination of the criminal - here it is turned into a cheap whodunnit. Furthermore, psychic phenomenon is dispensed of in the graphic novel - here, it is a cheap plot device. It seems obvious to me that the screenwriters did not understand what they were adapting.",,Anonymous,Horror
'Style over substance' is not a great way to create a film...,"'Style over substance'. For those not aware of this ever-important catch-phrase in the Hollywood industry; allow me to explain. This relates to a film's cinematic 'style' in which the film's outlandish visuals' outweigh the poor plot and weak storytelling ( a.k.a.substance). This terminology can apply to such recent films as 'The Cell' to a disturbing little film from Terry Gilliam called 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' . The concept of 'Style over substance' was my main worry in the Hughes' brothers' latest film From Hell'. After an almost 6 year break from their last major Hollywood film; 'Dead Presidents', the brothers who burst onto the scene with their first  film 'Menace II Society' create a crafty film set around the classic tale of Jack the Ripper.      My main concern as aforementioned would be how these young filmmakers would balance the visuals of the film with its' heavy content. As previews started to roll in theatres months ago, the film's gothic London look resembled Tim Burton's set pieces drastically. And so my mind started to wonder, questioning the craftiness of the film.      It is apparent that while these filmmakers have only made a documentary on pimps during their hiatus, it is evident that these filmmakers have studied the art of cinema and have put a lot of thought into the film. From nifty dissolves (an editing technique) to a dark look, these Brother Directors try to earn respect from the film going industry and partially have. Yet, they should have concentrated equally between the film's archaic set pieces and production values to what ultimately 'makes or breaks' a film. In a nutshell, the film's lacklustre pace that fades out after a entertaining first act makes this film seem longer than its' two hour running time. 'From Hell' stars the incredibly talented Johnny Depp who seems to completely reinvent himself after every role. He bites into his characters and allows himself to be deeply immersed in this role as Inspector Abberline who is assigned to solve these mysterious strings of murders. Yet, the same cannot be said for Heather Graham who plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute working the streets of London who seems to be the next victim on the killer's list. In my opinion, it is evident that Graham is miscast as she wanders astray in the film with the help of a wasted English accent that serves more as a detriment than an aid in setting the film's tone. Set in the gothic town of early London, this film puts a spin on the classic Jack the Ripper tale. The film's composition is quite simple yet complex at the same time. The Hughes brothers open the film with an entertaining yet congested first act. After all, this is a murder mystery and the suspects are thrown at you within the film's first 10 minutes. Following this display, the motives are thrown at you opening up the forum for educated guesses from the very beginning of the film.And of course, the murder sequences. Quite simply - stunning. They maintain a certain sense of calmness while displaying the evil maliciousness the 'Ripper' character possesses. In watching these graphic scenes, it can be thoroughly observed that every one of the murderous sequences has been explicitly deconstructed in order to be filmed on the screen in a stylish and subtle violent manner. The interesting detail about these scenes is that the violence displayed escalates and develops with each murderous sequence. Witness the bloodless first murderous sequence in which the audience is surprised and terrified as all we see is the glare of the knife slowly being tainted with blood as it appears then disappears repeatedly into the glint of the light as it pierces the body outside of the frame. Perhaps an homage to Hitchcock with the 'less is more' angle, yet in the end it is absolutely a treat to watch.      What is not so great is as the blood and the victims increase, the film's pacing and storytelling decreases in a slow yet diminutive manner that the film never seems to recover from. The Hughes Brothers' work so hard to establish a crafty and surprisingly effective opening only to see it go to waste as the courting of Mary Kelly and Inspector Abberline bog down the film's pacing and set up the depressing and awkward ending. While the film's visuals are outstanding and the foggy London backdrop add a trait of creepiness to the film. The film's ultimate weakness is the imbalance of plot, storytelling and its' look.  Yet all this cannot hide the fact that while the Hughes Brothers have displayed their cinematic maturity at creating a bloody, dark and entertaining piece, it does not hide the fact that they could have created a real treat, yet stalled at turning a good film into a great film.Giancarlo's Rating:  **",,Anonymous,Horror
Now where have I seen this kind of thing before...,"I didn't know at the time that ""From Hell"" is based on a comic book, but in retrospect, it's obvious.  It's imbued throughout with what I call ""comicbook darkness"".You know the kind of thing I mean.  Whenever you pick up a modern comic book (which, admittedly, isn't often in my case) it turns out to have been written by someone obsessed with trying to capture the same rich characterisations one encounters in literature and cinema.  But rich characters are only possible in literature because of such things as internal monologues, and because the author is free to simply TELL us - taking as much time about it as he needs to - whatever it is he wants us to know.  Rich characters are possible in cinema because we get to see actual actors with actual human faces, and because directors have almost continuous control over the degree to which any given detail may be stressed.These devices aren't available to comic book artists, who, as it happens, CAN'T create rich characters, by ANY means.  It's just one of the limitations of their craft.  It's a limitation they share with oral storytellers, librettists, animators, composers and choreographers, so there's no reason whatever for them to be ashamed of it - but for some reason, they ARE ashamed, and so while they continue to draw clear, flat, action characters, they make a ghastly attempt to ape Dostoyevsky by having these characters brood all the time.  In an attempt to create ""depth"" they give their heroes artificial flaws and cover their world with artificial grime.That's what we have here.  The hero is addicted to opium not because he would be but because it's the kind of comicbook detail designed to let us know that the authors are being all adult and sophisticated.  Characters are cynical not because it's in their nature but because it's not - because when a character acts or speaks against his or her nature, it is (so the theory goes) ""layered"".  I'll admit I'm having a hard time coming up with instances.  You've either noticed the kind of phoney, unearned darkness of modern comic books, or you haven't.  If you've noticed it you'll find the film is saturated with it.  But it's in the spirit in which the story is told rather than in any particular detail.No complaints about the plot, and in the final half hour or so, it actually starts to work as a film.  The trouble is it hadn't done so AT ALL until then.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not mind blowing but good.,"This really is a well done film, the 'graphic novel' its based on is certainly superior, but that is to be expected. i'm writing this to set something straight. This movie is not a 'theory' about jack the ripper. it's a story. No more, No less. I was not overly impressed but not altogether disapointed. i would definately spend the money to see it again. i also though that the end was great. my not so humble opinion.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent film, good acting but maybe lack of research","As a younger person only 15 i read the reviews yestarday from all the older viewers, and recieving my copy on VCD on friday night i thought it would be good to view the film and put a younger persons view towards it.The film i thought is NOT really a horror, but maybe more of a thriller, non the less it is very well made and also very well acted by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Also the co stars Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm.Many people said that in the film they all guessed Jack from the start and i also guessed from early on, BUT they would be lying if they did not admit they were thrown off the killer on numerous occasions.I have read to ripper books in the last 6 months 'The Diary of Jack the Ripper' and The Diary of Jack the Ripper the concluding chapter'. I have also read Jack the Ripper in the very popular Murder in Mind series. From reading these books i am very convinced who the Ripper is and even though the person who i suspect is the ripper does not appear at all in the film, it is still very entertaining to watch.A very big downfall this film might have is that if you have little or no knowledge of Jack the Ripper you will fall for this story hook, line and sinker, you must not be fooled. I thought the film was good and had a decent twist at the end. Unfortunately there was a few hollywood-esque parts that are pretty hard to imagine actually happening in the 1890's.This film can work on 2 levels. You can go to it wanting to see a dramatic thriller with no intention of taking it seriously, or you can go and see it to find out if it builds on evidence and to find a conclusion. I think the film is designed more for entertainment than fact. I feel that you need a certain degree of intelligence to understand the film and it is only to be watched when you are prepared to concentrate and follow the story.I stayed glued to my widescreen television and only got a little confused at the end but once i thought about it it wasn't to hard. I would not recommend this film to a hardcore horror fan but more to a thriller fan. This film can make your imagination run wild if your not careful but i found it entertaining.Overall i give 'From Hell' 7.5/10How to improve would be to keep it more factual and maybe stick to nobody discovering the ripper in the film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good but ...,"Generally the film is good but it just combines all existing theories in a really big one, in a great conspiracy involving many people. This is the only problem i think because this way the film becomes unbelievable and maybe unrealistic. Johnny Depp is really great (as always i think) and the whole atmosphere  is very good. The representation of the Victorian London is effective but ""Sleepy Hollow"" was much better in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Horror
Scary,"All I can and will say was that, as a female, I could not sleep the night I saw it.  Jack the Ripper is scary and gross, and his big black animal eyes will haunt me for the rest of my life.  This is one of those cover-your-eyes movies.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor, even in this slightly predictable movie.JanP.S.  The ending was really dumb.",,Anonymous,Horror
