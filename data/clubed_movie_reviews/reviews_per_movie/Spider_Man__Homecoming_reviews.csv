Hugely disappointing,"As a lifelong Spidey fan I was expecting good things of Homecoming. Sadly - and I appreciate that I seem to be in the minority - it did not deliver for me.Let's start with the positives: Michael Keaton's Vulture was everything a villain should be with an added layer of charm and depth. The high school setting and our youngest Peter so far was definitely a step in the right direction (Tom Holland is a very capable actor although though his voice did grate after a while). Even the menacing Mac Gargan, a potential 'Scorpion', was a great addition.Now the negatives. I think the casting for Flash Thompson, Liz Allen and Ned Leeds was absolutely ridiculous. Flash is supposed to be a jock who bullies Peter - not a smaller Asian guy who is also a member of the same quiz team! And that throwaway 'M J' comment at the end - unforgivable!!!The costume AI also didn't work for me. I appreciate that this is a tool to integrate Spidey into the MCU - but for me he works better when he is on his own, a guy in a cloth suit overcoming the odds with a mixture of bravery and science.I can appreciate that Homecoming had some issues to get over, especially as the other movie incarnations covered his unique origin in such depth. Was it brave to avoid the origin altogether - or did it detract from really getting us onside? Maybe a 20 minute opening section with Peter narrating, recapping his origin might have helped...I've no doubt that younger viewers would have enjoyed this movie (and maybe that was the aim), but fans of the 60's, 70's or 80's Spidey might have wondered what had happened to their favourite wallcrawler.For me, the first 45 minutes of Raimi's 'Spider-Man' nailed it and SM2 was equally as good. My GF, who has no knowledge of the Spider- Man lore, left the cinema with me and remarked 'that was the worst one'.Though I don't necessarily agree with that comment, I certainly wasn't ready to hail SM:Homecoming as an all conquering triumph, instead a rather weak chapter in the MCU series.Sorry Spidey, I so wanted to love this movie! Maybe better next time...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Raimi's Spidey is still the best (not including Part 3).,"I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A 'spectacular' Spider-Man movie that proves that Spider-Man's still got it.,"Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not bad but not great,"If you are a true fan of spider-man, this movie isn't for you but if you can keep an open mind you might actually enjoy it.
It's predictable, like most super heroes movies, it's not a great movie but it's a good one!
Even though Tom Holland performs a teenager that talks to much I kind of enjoy his performance.
I would say it's a movie to watch when you want something light with a little bit of action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Top tier MCU movie,"SpiderMan Homecoming is one of the most fun, exciting, and easily rewatchable films in the entire MCU. Tom Holland has a great performance as a young, inexperienced adaptation of Peter Parker. And that's a great new direction for the character. I've always thought that SpiderMan shouldn't be great at being SpiderMan at first. Tobey Maguires adaptation gets bitten by a spider and within a day or two masters all of his powers. But this movie hinges on the fact that Peter is still learning how to be a hero. That's perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMIG (2017),"An American feature film of 2017 directed by John Watts with Tom Holland and Michael Keaton in the lead roles. The script is based on comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko of Marvel Comics. World premiere of the picture took place on June 28, 2017 in Hollywood.
The action takes place a few months after the events described in the film ""The First Avenger: Confrontation."" According to the story, Peter Parker is trying to find a balance between school life and to be a Spider-Man, while facing the Vulture.
The best thing about the film is the script (written by John Watts), which is fast and funny. The music's cool. The performances are great.
Would I recommended the film? Yes, I would. It's one of the most interesting comedies I've seen in recent years!

Good points. Not so good points....,"Let me start with the not so good points:1.) Marissa Tomei is much too hot to play Aunt May.2.) Ned, his character is about as useful as mammary glands on a male hog.3.) Michael Keaton was a poor choice as the Vulture. John Turturro would have made a better choice.4.) Zendaya great character but not my choice for Mary Jane Watson.5.) Flash Thompson or is it Harry Osborne? The original Flash Thompson was a waspish muscle head not some spoiled ethnic rich punk.Good plot and nice inter-action between Peter Parker and Tony Stark. Good FX.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I feel like it's missing something,"First of all I had to say I really have high expectations to this film, but the trailers did really ruin it for me, the trailers did almost show the whole movie itself. But for me it didn't feel like a Spider-man/Iron-man movie.Lets start first with the character, Tom Holland portray Spider-man and Peter Parker really well he's probably the best Spider-man yet, Michael Keaton did a good job on portraying the Vulture, and the other characters were also good, they did a good job on casting.The Film is kinda boring, the pacing slow but its not that bad, the film is more of a lighthearted movie than the others its more of a movie for teens but has fun moments for the adults specially for comic books fans, its has a teenage-ish feel but its okaythe action was not that bad but its not as exciting as the action in Sam Raimi's Spiderman 1 & 2, i thought it there will be more action scenes, but what you see in the trailers is what you getIt also didn't feel like a Marvel movie, it's so different from the others, it feel like more of a Disney TV movie with a taste of marvel in it (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION) but hey it's Fun and visually appealing movie, this movie is basically introducing Peter Parker on how he became the spider-MAN and introducing him in the avengersoverall this was above average movie, its GREAT!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Painfully Generic,"Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Another Spidey?,"Another try to show us the same angsty story about power and great responsibility? Wrong! Peter stuck in the middle of the teenage drama? Not quite! Spider-man as an Avenger? Well.... let me stop you there. My first impression when the trailer came out was, well I had a lot of doubts. For instance why there is no Uncle Ben, why Peter's best friend knows his best-guarded secret (that has been reviled in the comics only to help Iron Man's team during Civil War). Aunt May who is even less aware of everything? Iron Man in the background? No 'Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-man'? But then I went to see the movie and to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We got the whole need look at Peter Parker's life. First of all, we've never got to see Peter so young, though Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire tried. He looks young and he is young. His life isn't exactly defined by his uncle's death. Sure it is implied but at the same time, it doesn't imply that this is why Peter became Spiderman. What we also got to see is Peter who learns how to be a hero. This kid really got one of the most solid moral core among the heroes. And now we can see how he learns how to do his job. It's no longer than 5 minutes of speeded process of embracing the powers, where in one moment he breaks the tap, can't control his 'sticky' powers and performs superhuman reflex and the next scene he has his suit made and his powers under control. No. And that's why it's good. It's funny, comical even, but true. Peter is true, he eats larb, builds lego Deathstar, studies for Spanish quiz, and saves the day. The other thing that surprised me was how well Tom and his real friend Jacob played the dynamic duo of Peter and his 'guy in the chair' Ned. It gives us a bit of fresh view, innocent even when it all is a game, an awesome adventure. And it also gives us A LOT of good humour. Then next we've got Aunt May, who is building a new life with Peter, starting over. She also has some kind of different innocence than we've seen before. She supports Peter and is just a bit more than an episodical character needed for the plot. Another character that has been rebooted is Flash Thompson, Peter's bully. Of course, he still is a bully, but the writers decided to expose the other side of him. For me, it gives a glimpse at the future where after all Peter and Flash became friends and Spider-man's ex- bully becomes a hero, Venom. Additionally, we had a chance to witness Happy's great return, yay!? And finally RJ, we are here. He did good, what did you expect. But he didn't steal the show, oh no. it was A Spider-man movie from the very end. Another pro of the movie is that there is no romance-centric plot. It's not always about getting a girl people! Moving on, that scene! You know which one! You didn't see that coming? Because I didn't. Simple yet great plot twist. But enough about the plot. Then again, the marvellous Marvel logo that constantly gets better and SPIDER-MAN THEME! That's right! The music was good, even though I was hoping to get another catch and a great soundtrack like we had in GoTG and GoTG vol2. Another thing that got me surprised was the camera. We've been served with a whole lot of scenes from new, and different angles. We got lots of different perspectives. General, big, from point of view and the best of all Peter's vlog from Germany. Last but not least brilliance of the credits. It really makes you want to sit there and wait for the credits to end, not like we wouldn't do this anyway. ;) I heard someone saying that they were disappointed with Peter. He was making a fool of himself. He was constantly saying: ""I'm sorry but I gotta go"" and couldn't get the job done right from the take one. But isn't it just how his life goes? because from what I know it is. Peter is one of the most relatable and at the same time tragic (ok, maybe not that tragic) comic characters. Because of he always, always does what is right. No matter what. he sacrifices his personal life, his love his happiness to make the world a better place. This is the reboot. This is the beginning. This is young Peter learning to be a hero. Him learning about power and responsibility. Learning to stay closer to the ground. And even though teenage Peter being pulled into high schools drama does sound cliché it paradoxically isn't. It's good. It's funny and it's just simply Peter Parker's life.PS. Don't miss the extra Cap's message, straight from Middletown High.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good But One Thing Missing...,"Needs more naked brothers band. For instance, while Peter is at school the naked brothers band's hit song I Don't Wanna Go To School could be playing in the background. Or Peter could be making a banana smoothie to go with his dinner one night and their other hit song Banana Smoothie could be playing. While these are only two examples I feel Jon Watts overlooked the naked brothers band while making this movie and that wrong needs to be made right. Other than that 10/10 would recommend.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What I've Always Wanted!,"This movie is what I've always wanted from a Spider-Man movie.
Focus on him being an awkward teenager at high school, and have him being treated as such by his peers.The directing, editing, and cinematography is great. It certainly feels like a coming-of-age high school comedy, with some added superhero fun, and as expected, Tom Holland continues to deliver the best performance in this role to date. He is so charming, and I can't think of anyone better right now.
Michael Keaton also delivered an amazing performance as this movies villain, especially in the last act.SpiderMan movies have had their fair share of problems over the years, but I feel like I finally it.

Very entertaining Spider-Man movie and good addition to the MCU,"I enjoy most of the Marvel MCU and was interested what they would do with Spider-Man after he showed up briefly in Civil War. The previous Spider-man movies were 'okay' for me (or even awful), so it could only get better!The movie starts with showing the aftermath of the 'Battle for New York' that was the epic final of the first Avenger movie. We meet salvage worker Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) who leads a team to take apart the alien invaders machinery. After some experiments, Adrian and hit teams learns how to create powerful weapons from the alien wreckage to sell to criminals. But shortly after this discovery, his team is shutdown and the salvage is taken over by a company hired by Tony Stark. We then fast forward 8 years in time were we see the videos Peter Parker made on his trip to Berlin to help Iron Man fight off Captain America. We learn that after Berlin, Peter was allowed to keep the suit which he puts on every day after school to fight (light) crime in New York. He desperately wants to fight with the other Avengers and spams the phone of Happy (Tony Stark's assistant) everyday, but he hears nothing in response. When Peter gets in contact with criminals that bought the alien weapons from 'the Vulture' Adrian Toomes, things start to get more interesting for Peter. But will he be able to stop the Vulture without messing up his high school life to much? And is he truly ready to become part of the Avengers?I really enjoyed this interpretation of Spider-Man, it was light with a lot of humor and good action sequences. I liked that the whole 'origin story' was skipped because we have seen that two times already, it just focuses on how Peter deals with combining high-school and his aspirations to become a super hero. In my opinion Tom Holland is a much better choice for Spider-Man then Toby McQuire or Andrew Garfield. Toby looked like a whiny little kid to me and Andrew is a way to serious actor to play in a comic-book movie. Tom fits this role as a glove, both his portrayal of Spider-Man and Peter Parker are excellent. Michael Keaton is also excellent in his role as the Vulture villain. Unlike other villains in Marvel movies, he's not pure evil for evil's sake but is just a guy that wants to make loads of money. Robert Downey Jr. is always a pleasure to see on screen and this movie is no exception.Another good thing this movie does is how it ties in with the MCU. They did a good job in this movie by not involving the whole superhero but keeping the focus on Spider-Man. Also cool to see how high school people live in a world where the Avengers actually do exist. (the Captain America instructional videos are hilarious) There is however a little bit to much high school stuff in it for my taste. Showing Peter asking a girl out for the big dance and showing him in school doing high school things could have left out or toned down a bit. The actors playing the 'high school cast' are mediocre and do not really feel like real people to me.But the main focus of the movie is still action oriented with amazing effects. Like all Marvel movies it gets a bit CGI heavy and Spider-Man looks a bit to much like a computer game character but overall it's very well done. The movie never bogs down and there are a few surprises to that I didn't see coming.Spider-Man: Homecoming is another nice addition to the MCU with lots of humor and some good action scenes. It's not the greatest coming book movie but definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Why am in the minority saying this movie was not at all as good as people think it was?,"First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh.

Overrated Garbage! Worst Spiderman Movie EVER!,"Spideman: Homecoming was TERRIBLE and by far the worst spider-man film. This movie was a HUGE set back for Spiderman but sadly we live in a very tight lip controlled marvel press that have told us this is ""great movie"" because it came from another soulless product cake factory from marvel. This is the same Spiderman/Peter Parker from Civil War??? They severely dumbed him down for his solo movie and turned him into whiny clumsy idiot who screwed up constantly. Despite that Tom Holland is the best on screen Peter Parker and Spiderman to date. He deserved a MUCH better movie.I like Michael Keaton but his performance felt phoned in only to find that Keaton turned down this role twice before excepting it. Not his fault, am I'm the only one who thought the Vulture was lame? He was so hollow and them tying it up with the whole Damage Control thing felt forced and rushed.The high school stuff in this movie is awful. This movie was trying to so hard to be a John Hughes movie and it failed miserably. Homecoming was nothing like those movies. The teens in those movies were real, they smoked, drinked, swore, and acted like real teens. The supporting teen cast in Homecoming are nothing but terrible caricatures. Liz is a stock love interest with all the personality of a dry brick. She's useless and Laura Harrier and Tom Holland have zero chemistry. I never bought that these two liked each other. All they're very few scenes together are awkward. Flash was turned from a big jock bully bully into a annoying little doucebag who's about as threatening as a newborn kitten. Ned is stock fat friend comic relief who's not funny at all. Michelle was some wannabe hipster Daria type girl who hate everything. She served no purpose and the twist with character at the end was so forced and stupid. Aunt May's transformation into an object of male gaze/desire (and nothing more). No mention of Uncle Ben which is ridiculous. I didn't need to see him die again, but replacing Tony Stark as Uncle Ben's place as a father figure is absolutely ludicrous!Dull washed out cinematography. This looked like a TV movie. Michael Giacchino's uninspired score. Bad CGI on Spiderman, it looked WAY too cartoon. The action scenes were forgettable and had zero stakes. The Rubble scene had potential but it was poorly done, rushed, and ruined by water reflection with Tony's voice over. It's sucks because Holland acted his but off in that scene. All the Avengers/MCU references were forced and shoehorned it was eye rolling. The worst was the F, Marry, Kill game with Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man during the gym class. Really??? Speaking of gym class, those Captain America PSA segments were unfunny pointless filler. Jon Watts was a poor pick to direct this movie. His direction is bland and uncreative. He also doesn't know how to direct action scenes. At least the Raimi movie had their own distinctive zany kooky style. Homecoming looks like every other MCU movie. This movie also had 6, yes SIX writers and it's shows.The The forced diversity is so in your face. His best friends is Filipino, love interest is biracial, his bully is Guatemalan, weird girl is black, the Chinese and African kid on the decathlon team. No story-line progression. The movie is Peter wants to impress Mr. Stark to become an Avenger. That's.... it. The terrible childish comedy. ""Hur duh penis parker"", ""I was watching porn"", ""your aunt is so hot"". This is the comedy were supposed to laugh at? What was with the cringe built by slaves comment in the Washington scene? That has no place in a spider-man movie.Bottom line! Spiderman: Homecoming is another over-hyped Summer blockbuster that will be forgotten about after a month which is exactly what happened. These MCU movies have no staying power. I already forgot Guardians 2 came out 3 months ago. By the way that movie also sucked too!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Teenage Spidey.,"A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Let's stomp The Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2 this is the best Spider-Man reboot ever.,"This is a good reboot like I'm not saying this film is better than Sam Raimi Spider-Man films like I still like them movies. I think Tom Holland did a good job as Peter Parker / Spider Man just like Tobey Maguire. At least we didn't need another origin story like we have one like 15 years ago so we already know what happen. At least they have the Vulter just like what Sam Raimi want since Spider-Man 3 (2007) and the Shocker is on the big screen like it sucks he didn't get a lot of screen time but his acting is good. I think the one YouTube Poop video like what Flash Thopson said to Parker when he said to him (I don't know of the word is O.K to say so I'm censoring it) P***s Parker because it's funny to the writers. At least the villains in this film didn't suck like The Amazing Spider- Man (I'm not going to be talking about how this film is better than TASM films).

Spiderman's Solo Debut in the MCU,"Spiderman Homecoming is the long-awaited Spiderman movie from Marvel Studios. This is the sixth Spiderman film and the third Spiderman continuity in the last fifteen years. That's crazy! After the disappointment that was the Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony was finally desperate enough to share the rights to Spiderman with Marvel Studios. Many have been waiting for Spiderman's big solo debut in the MCU. Was it worth the wait? In my opinion it was.Is Homecoming the best Spiderman film to date? In my honest opinion, no. I think Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is still the best Spiderman film we've gotten so far. I might even enjoy the first Spiderman movie by Raimi more, even though Homecoming is objectively a better film. Homecoming is still a good movie though. It's definitely better than Spiderman 3 and TASM films.With that being said, I think Tom Holland is the best portrayal of Spiderman we've seen yet. I like Tobey McGuire alright, didn't care for Andrew Garfield, but really like Holland. He embodies Peter's shy insecure side and his confident witty side as Spiderman perfectly.The plot is very simple. A villain who calls himself the vulture is stealing and building alien tech, left behind from the Avengers, to sell on the black market. Spiderman must stop him while dealing with the trials of high school life and try to prove himself to his mentor Tony Stark.It hits all the beats of a typical MCU film. It's lighthearted and fun, but gets serious when it needs to. It's your typical stop the bad guy shtick. If you've gotten sick of the Marvel formula you might be bored by this film, but if it's a formula that works there's no need to fix it. Plus, Spiderman, more than any other marvel character, fits with this formula. This is very much how the classic Spiderman stories were told.What works about this movie, besides Tom Holland's performance, was the villain played by Michael Keaton. As MCU villains go he's really good. He's not my favorite. I still think Loki and Zemo are the best MCU villains so far, but Vulture is still fun. This is to be expected, as Spiderman has one of the best rogues gallery in all of comics, along with Batman. I also like this film's version of Mary Jane. It's a very unique take on the character, and she was fun.The effects naturally were great. You can always expect above average effects in an MCU property. The action was also fun. I still think the action Spiderman 2 and the first Spiderman was the best, but the action here was definitely on par, if not better than the fight scenes in TASM movies.Now we get to my personal gripes with the movie. First of all, with the exception of MJ, I felt the supporting cast was weak. I did not care for Peter's best friend, who was the obvious comic relief. Occasionally he got a laugh, but mostly I found him irritating. The love interest is generic and forgettable. The other supporting characters aren't even worth mentioning.The film was a bit too long as well, and felt very padded in places. Not to mention the story is entirely predictable. You know pretty much how everything will play out. The music was there, but it was not that memorable at all. I had the same issue with the score in TASM movies. The music in the Raimi films was amazing and you could easily listen to it by itself.Overall, if you were excited for Spiderman's solo outing in the MCU this film should give you what you were expecting. Tom Holland is the best Spiderman yet, the villain is fun, and the action and effects are above average. The supporting cast is weak, and the film can drag, but the film is still a really solid Spiderman and MCU film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider man Homecoming Review,"So, I had wanted Spider man in the MCU for a long time and when I saw an article that said, ""spider man makes his MCU debut in Captain America Civil War"" and it had a link for the trailer so I clicked on the link and watched the trailer, I was waiting the entire trailer and i was so excited to see spider man in the MCU but as soon a the title card showed up i gave up hope and was a bit dissapointed until i heard that line at the end of the trailer "" Alright i've run out of patience, Underoos!"" i was like ""wait what?' and then i see captain america sheild get stolen by a web and i started freaking out and i see spider man full costume and say ""Hey everyone."" I went full fanboy mode. I was so excited for a new movie with spider man and the possibility of a new spider man movie and when i heard that they were making a Spider man movie for the MCU the fanboy within me came out and started to freak out. I didnt see Spider man Homecoming in theaters though due to my local theater not keeping movies for over a month unless there was nothing new. But to get into the review, I.LOVE.THIS.MOVIE. even though i didnt get that awesome feeling of being in a theater with some butter popcorn, a large soda, and a box or bag of candy and watch a movie, i still love it. It gives us a new POV, a POV of a 15 year old kid with super powers trying to find his place as a super hero. Can i just say that Tom Holland is the best spider man yet? I mean Toby and Andrew tried but they didnt look the part or even have that funny aspect of spider man. Tom Holland captures it perfectly with plenty of the humor and charisma of spider man. And the vulture played by Micheal Keaton was a pleasure to have on screen. I cant say how long i waited for a spider man movie like this, but my god it feels good to have a spider man movie like this. i'm giving Spider man Homecoming a 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Well made movie but it was missing the heart,"Marvel without a doubt, knows the formula to make an visually appealing, fun and well paced superhero movie. There's a lot to love about Spiderman Homecoming, from Tom Holland's take on a teenage Peter Parker (although the tone of his voice grated from time to time) to a solid villain in Vulture, played to perfection by Michael Keaton. There were also some awesome action sequences, my favs being the ferry and the final battle against The Vulture. Sadly, the emotional connection I needed, to make this a truly awesome version of Spidey never came (for me) Raimi's Spiderman 2 hit every note perfectly, and is still in my humble opinion the best Spidey movie out there. While this one looks good, the depth is sorely lacking and with the way Wonder Woman left me feeling so fresh in my head, it was just more obvious to me, that they played it safe and pandered to the easiest base to appease, the Spidey fans, with this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

More like a Spider-man SPOOF.,"Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is AWESOME.,"I'm a huge fan of SpiderMan. I was grown up with this hero's movies, animated television, etc. I'm the one who always likes Peter's invention. I think many of you might think like me about his suit. It seemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn't helping Peter with his tech support but if you watch this movie and open your mind. you'll understand what he wants to prove himself like as Tony said ""If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."" So In my opinion it's this version that finally puts a truly portrayal of #PeterParker. Tom did great job. I love it.I've watched it in three projection systems. In my personal opinion 4DX is kind of exhausting.. but it would be more fun if you see it in the normal screen or IMAX first. I always prefer #IMAX as it enhances my movie going experience. Moreover, I've seen Peter's face on big screen with full of my eye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Watch Spiderman Homecoming You Review,"Watch Spiderman Homecoming You Reviewlove this movie. Best movie how Young Peter Parker Started out.Spider-Man for the past 15 years. First there was Tobey Maguire, who under the direction of Sam Raimi for three films ushered in the modern superhero era, and then there was Andrew Garfield whose two films with Marc Webb were immediately forgettable. And now, like all obedient franchises, they're trying to start all over again, this time with the much more age-appropriate Tom Holland in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""And you know what? Superhero cynicism aside, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is really fun. Director Jon Watts, whose only previous feature film credit is the indie thriller ""Cop Car,"" has confidently put his stamp on the friendly neighborhood web slinger by making one bold move: actually casting teenagers to play teenagers.Yes, after two films with late 20-somethings donning the Spidey suit and getting bitten by that pesky spider, Spider-Man finally gets to be a kid (and we get to skip over the whole origin/ Uncle Ben story). Instead, Watts' film, which is upsettingly credited to six screenwriters, picks up with Peter Parker (Holland) right before, during and after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which introduced Holland's Spider-Man in that epic airport Avengers battle.Instead of a ""last week in Marvel"" segment to catch up, we're given a refresher via Peter's perspective. He's just an excited kid who filmed the whole adventure and ever since has been thirsting for more Avengers action. He tries, endearingly, to prove his mettle on his own as he waits idly in Queens for a call from Tony Stark — giving directions to the elderly, retrieving stolen bikes and doing flips on command.What he doesn't know is that for eight years, there has been a supervillain emerging in his town in the form of a wronged construction worker, Adrian (Michael Keaton), who decided to break bad after losing a job to a government crew that clears post- superhero fight disaster areas. Peter, with his true-blue heart and naivete and eagerness to prove himself, of course takes on more than he can handle, while also trying to navigate high school, homework, crushes and the awkwardness of just being a teenager. Time passes easily and just when you might worry that you don't actually care about any of the characters, the story throws a great curveball that carries interest to the end.The film is overflowing with stellar talent, even in the smallest of roles and not counting the Marvel loaners in Robert Downey Jr. (who oozes charisma and charm even when phoning it in for a handful of scenes) and Jon Favreau. In the high school alone, there's the too- cool Michelle (Zendaya), the crush Liz (Laura Harrier) and the adorable breakout best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Hannibal Buress and Martin Starr are there, too, to add reliable laughs. Adrian's bad-guy crew includes Logan Marshall-Green and Michael Cernus. Even Spider-Man's suit has an Oscar winner behind its voice (Jennifer Connelly).Then of course there is Holland, a terrific actor since ""The Impossible,"" who is the perfect amount of empathetic, excitable and clueless to make Peter Parker work now and for years to come. For the most part, ""Homecoming"" is a joy. It's light-hearted, smart, a little meta and the first Marvel film to really consider what it might be like for kids living in a world where superheroes are real.My only quibble with ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is that for all of its charming and infectious realism about race, high school life and class issues, it has a bit of a woman problem. Simply: every significant and semi-significant female character looks like a model. It wouldn't be an issue of the film not so spot-on with casting such a realistic variety of men and teenage boys, or if it were less concerned with hammering down on the ""Aunt May is hot"" bit that goes a little too far, but when taken together you start to wonder if maybe things would have been different if just one of the six screenwriters was a woman. But just as Peter has some growing up to do, so does this young franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, but flawed, reboot.","First of all, let me get this out of the way: no. It is in no way, shape or form better than the Raimi films. However, it is not really fair to compare it to those films since this is completely different. Homecoming decides to wisely skip the origin story and give us more of a coming of age or high school flick, which is was very refreshing since one of my biggest fears was that it was going to rehash the Raimi films like the first Mark Webb film. Tom Holland is amazing as Spider-Man, as he perfectly captures how difficult it is to be both an average high school student as a superhero at the same time. Michael Keaton is fantastic as always as the Vulture, as he is very repeatable in a way that makes his different than the usual mediocre MCU villains.In fact, a lot of the supporting cast were really good in their roles. However, some big problems is that there are parts of the film where I feel like Marvel was playing it safe, as their are no real risks to action scenes. And while I was OK with most of the changes to the Spider-Man lore, there were some that felt forced or there just for the sake of change. Overall, I felt like this was a very solid start for Spider-Man in the MCU franchise. I feel that in the sequel they could expand upon the strengths of this film and make a great movie. Overall, this is a pretty solid summer popcorn blockbuster. It's no Logan or Civil War, but for a Spider-Man movie, it is just what I wanted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man: Homecoming,"FINALLY!!!! This is the version of Spider-Man that I've been waiting YEARS for. Tom Holland nails both Peter Parker, and Spider-Man so perfectly, giving each of them a distinct personality. Robert Downey Jr. is used sparingly and never intrudes on Spider- Man's movie and even feels like a father figure at some points. Michael Keaton KILLS as the Vulture and gives Marvel one of its greatest villains to date. Everyone else gives there A-game in Marvel's top 5 best movies to date. Yes, there are some jokes that don't land and yes, this does feel like a John Hughes movie with Spider-Man perfectly stuffed in rather than a super-hero movie, but writing is perfect, the story is AMAZING (wink, wink), and overall, it's a well directed, well made movie. Everyone involved should be proud of themselves. So in all, watch it, then watch it again. SIDE NOTE/SPOILER: STAY TIL THE END OF THE CREDITS IF YOU WANT MARVEL TO GIVE YOU THE FINGER.

One of the better Marvel verse ones for kids.,"Its not great.. its not in the top ten out of the PHASE movies, but its better then some of the more recent spider man flicks.Spider man is hard anyways, frankly, not 100% sure why they push so hard to re-release a new spider man every 2-3 years.. its mostly the same story retold over and over..(like DCs batman.. jeepers creepers.. how many batman movies do you need to make.. cant even wait 15 years between.. just push push push push.)Overall though, this is way more kid friendly, which I do appreciate then some of the other films. The humor is friendly enough for most pre-teens to get and the action isn't anywhere as dark and foreboding as the some of the latest other Marvel verse films (age of ultron, winter soldier) both of which was too much for younger viewers.While I think those films have their place, I do appreciate something a bit lighter as a opposite.Worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Superhero Movie Fatigue,"Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.Thanks for reading!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Another harmless entertaining flick in the MCU that Sony should be happy with,"See Sony you get to have your cake and eat it by giving Spider-Man back to Marvel. I haven't done a review in a while because I get really defeated with typing my thoughts out and there ends up being a lot to say. But this film was a pretty shallow entertaining flick brought to again by Marvel.And like an MCU film it hits those same beats, frenetic action sequences, a rich colour palate (a huge step up from the Webb films by the way), tons of cgi, and ohh the incessant humour.Overall I liked this film, but I wasn't so excited about this like I was as an 11-year old back in 2002 seeing my favourite superhero come on screen for the first time. I liked the fact that they didn't rehash the origin story. This time Spider-Man is a small player in a much bigger Avengers laden world and he's figuring out what his purpose is. The villain in this film is actually interesting which is a rarity in Marvel. There is very little setup for future films and it actually is pretty self contained. And they actually goofed on the fact that him swinging around to transport himself is hardly possible outside Manhattan.Now onto gripes, which are there but it didn't take me out of the film like the Webb films did. Spider-Man's suit is way too tricked out with Tony Stark's gizmos, which makes him too much like Iron-Man and not really himself, which is a plot point but still. And it occurred to me: where's his Spider sense? Isn't that a key component to this character?Anyways just watch this. Have fun. It's a huge step up from the Amazing Spider-Man films but still doesn't stir the emotions of the first two Raimi films. I think I'm done here. It's good. Have a watch. Or don't. Up to you. I made a review. Hope you found it useful.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A movie for teens that's fun for adults if you don't think about it too much (Minor spoilers),"Marvel's first movie exclusively for teens still has its fun moments for adults, though it can sour upon further reflection.Let's start with the good stuff. Tom Holland is probably the best Spider-Man yet. His best friend provides great comic relief and the two have terrific chemistry. Marisa Tomei adds a breathe of fresh air to the role of Aunt May. Michael Keaton provides Marvel with its first memorable villain in a while. The action scenes flow smoothly, and the humor mostly works (again, this is a teen movie).Those are the things that stand out after immediately leaving the theater, and for that reason it gets high marks in my book.But the adult in me started thinking about what I just watched, and there's some stuff that bugs me. The following contains minor spoilers.""With great power comes great responsibility"" is the famous line from the first Spider-Man, which neatly summarizes the core theme of the film, and Peter Parker's internal conflict with being Spider-Man.This film also has a one-liner like that, spoken to Peter by Tony Stark: ""If you're nothing without this suit, you don't deserve to wear it."" And it's actually quite illustrative of what's wrong with this film.The fist Spider-Man movie in 2002 emphasized taking responsibility for your actions. The amount of responsibility this Spider-Man takes for his actions is, well, none. A list of the damage this ""friendly neighborhood"" Spider-Man directly/indirectly inflicts includes: - Swinging through a neighborhood destroying roofs, fences, tree houses, etc. - Blowing up a bodega - Setting a bomb off in the Washington Monument nearly killing all his friends - Blowing up a boat, nearly drowning everyone on board - Nearly crashing a plane into a cityNow it's not like Spider-Man is trying to stop some ticking time bomb or rescue a loved one from imminent death, and all these destructive acts are the consequence. No, he's simply chasing down thieves, led by The Vulture.However, his recklessness eventually forces Tony Stark to take back the advanced suit, delivering the impactful line. And yet, Peter Parker dons his homemade Spider-Man costume a couple scenes later when he learns the Vulture has another heist planned, which results in the aforementioned plane scene.But Tony isn't mad about that one, cause Spider-Man got the bad guy this time. Ends justify the means I guess. I don't want to extrapolate without ruining the whole movie, but suffice to say, it's inexplicable that Tony is okay with Peter's actions, especially considering the events of the Civil War movie.Thus thematically, there really is no arch. Peter doesn't learn about taking responsibility for his actions - he simply accomplishes a task without wearing the high tech suit Tony gave him. Peter's only real lesson in the movie is that he'd rather be a regular kid than an Avenger.And then there's the nitpicking.Let's start with Flash Gordon, the classic ""cool jock"" who's a major asshole and bullies Peter throughout high school.Well now he's not a jock at all. He's a ""nerd"" (in fact, literally every high school character in this film falls into the modern day millennial ""nerd"" category) who is still a major asshole and bullies Peter. He calls him ""Penis Parker"" and, well, that's about it. His character's sole purpose seems to be to remind the audience ""hey, bullies can be smart academically- minded kids too!"" Um, okay. Someone let me know if you know a kid on the Science Debate Team who leads chants of ""Penis"" as he DJs a house party to mock a classmate. I'm genuinely curious.Then there's the girl Peter likes, who mostly ignores him but is on the same trivia team as Peter (Flash is also on this team, as is every other student you meet). Peter ditches her all the time, but for some reason he musters the courage to ask her out, and inexplicably she says yes.There's another girl named Michelle who's the resident loner (again, on the trivia team) who refuses to tour the Washington Monument in order to remind the audience that slaves built it. However, this completely contradicts with the ""Make America Great Again!"" sticker on her backpack.That's a joke.So to summarize: it's a movie for kids, don't think about it too much and you'll enjoy it too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Stellar movie...but what about Spider-man?,"Oh Spider-Man, we meet again. It's been a long time since we saw tantalizing Tobey Maguire in the suit. Spidey was in need of a comeback- oh wait, I forgot that already happened...Andrew Garfield this one is for you!Okay but for real, this movie was great. It hit on every truthful aspect of Peter Parker. Geeky high school teen with great angst, a need to prove himself and get the girl he supposedly loves. I would 10/10 recommend it to anyone as one of the greatest Marvel movies every made (it definitely lived up to it's reputation), but what about the greatest Spidey movie every made?I agree that there has to be major differences between this movie and the other two heart-throb tales because Spider-Man is now official in league with the Avengers. But caught in the crossfires of the Marvel Legacy, was the movie even about Peter Parker? I mean, did they even have to try to make it about him? Everybody already knew the story so why bother retelling it? I believe a better title for the movie may have been Iron Man 4-Tony Stark's Coming of Age.The Marvel makers seemed to have realized that they already created a vast empire so adding in Peter Parker shouldn't be difficult at all; if we remember to keep the main stars close behind...I may still be a little too attached to the previous web of spidey movies to believe that Spider-Man is now part of something more than just himself, but it may have been nice to stick a little closer to the reality of Spider-Man's true nature. He is a lonely, angsty teen from queens, but he seemed to be still on the back burner to the bigger starts cameo-ed in his own film. Maybe that was the point though...right?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best MCU film since Ant-Man.,"I;'m not gonna lie, MCU films have really disappointed me since Cival War. Cival war was just boring and underwhelming.

This movie was a very 'refreshing' take on my favoute comic book character. Comapred to the other two incarnations of spider-man (Tobey Magiure and Andrew Garfield) this him is, much, much light hearted and funny to the other two. The light, bright tone to this film is what makes it so great. i love the high school vibe they were going with. I loved the characters. I also love the father, son bond between Stark and Parker.

While it may seem unfit for this movie hear me out, it is quite simple to incorporate their songs into the soundtrack. For example since Peter Parker is a high school student he of course spends a large portion of the film at school. The Naked Brothers Band's song ""I Don't Wanna Go to School"" would be very suitable background music for any of those scenes in that setting, because really what high school wants to go to school?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""A Web of Adolescent Awkwardness and Heroism""","!!

Tom Holland's portrayal of a young, inexperienced Spider-Man is a breath of fresh air, perfectly balancing the awkwardness of adolescence with the thrill of superheroics.The film's narrative is cleverly structured, exploring Peter Parker's dual life as both a high school student and a crime-fighting superhero. His interactions with classmates, particularly Ned Leeds and Michelle Jones, provide a grounded and relatable portrayal of teenage life. The film effectively captures the challenges and triumphs of this age, making Peter an endearing and relatable protagonist.A pivotal plot point involves the revelation of Peter's identity to Ned, marking a significant step in their friendship. This development adds a layer of complexity to their relationship, as Ned becomes both Peter's best friend and his most trusted confidant.The film's climax sees Peter confronting his mentor, Tony Stark, after making a series of reckless decisions. This confrontation leads to a painful realization for Peter, as he understands the consequences of his actions and the importance of responsibility. The final battle against the Vulture, where Peter proves his worth as a hero, is both thrilling and emotionally satisfying.*Spider-Man: Homecoming* is a coming-of-age story wrapped in a superhero suit.

Good but whiny,"Overall, it is good, but I found it a bit too stuck in the adolescent ""coming of age"" experience.

Tom Holland is excellent as Peter Parker, but unfortunately, this film's characterization takes the inept and insecure to a new high.I liked many aspects of this film, but I was a bit confused with the looseness of structure of the plot. I guess they were setting the stage for what's to come. But, it felt unorganized as it was trying to manage too many aspects of Peter's life.I wanted to like this more. It was enough for a film. I just wish it was coherent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Tom Holland the Man,"You will enjoy every single minute of this movie, Tom Holland is definitely the best peter Parker and Spider-Man we have ever seen. Marvel studios really did deliver with this one great action, humor, comedy, and much more. The villain in this movie who is the vulture is probably the best marvel movie villain ever, Michael Keaton gives his best portrayal of the role. This is not a iron man movie this is a straight Spider-Man movie that tells us his life before and after civil war and it all sums up very good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Nice fresh Spider man,Good movie for a Spider man. We already know the big events of Peter Parker and its still nice to see new faces. Some moments are pretty great and have some dramatic tension. Its pretty good but classic for Spider-man story.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Perfect.,"I know this is going to anger some people, but I hated toby McGuire as Spiderman. He was a whiny, scrawny little baby. I don't hate those movies but he's just not a good Spiderman. Tom Holland on the other hand, is probably the only Spiderman actor that I will ever rate is completely and utterly perfect. I like the addition of the smart suit and other things that are linked Iron Man, because the connection between Peter and Stark is full of heart.

Highly Entertaining Action Film,"Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)*** (out of 4)Another highly entertaining entry into the Marvel universe has Peter Parker (Tom Holland) trying to find a balance between his high school years and wanting to join The Avengers as Spider-Man. While all of this is going on Vulture (Michael Keaton) is creating some high tech and dangerous weapons to sell on the streets.SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING seemed to get a lot of mixed reviews but I personally thought it was very entertaining and in fact I thought it was much better than WONDER WOMAN. What's amazing is that this is the third reboot of this series going back to the Sam Raimi films and it's really amazing that the studio keeps managing to get the perfect casts to pull the stories off. This film not only works as a very good action movie but I thought the teenage drama stuff worked quite nicely as well.As I stated, the performances here really help make the film as entertaining as it is. The performance by Holland was excellent and I thought he was perfect during the scenes where the character is actually being a nerd and conflicted with various emotions. Keaton was also wonderful in his role as he perfectly played the villain. Robert Downey, Jr. could sleepwalk in his role as Tony Stark but he's always fun as is Jon Favreau in his part. Donald Glover and Bokeem Woodbine were also very good as was Laura Harrier as the love interest. Marisa Tomei looks great but she's a bit too young for her role as Aunt May. Even Jacob Batalon adds nice comic relief.The action scenes are all highly exciting and it's the perfect use of CGI. I'm not a CGI fan but there's no question that it mixes in perfectly well with the rest of the footage. I'd also argue that the story itself was quite good in regards to everything going wrong in Parker's personal life and I thought the screenplay perfectly handled his emotions of trying to balance everything. Technically the film is very impressive from start to finish and there are some truly great scenes scattered throughout the picture.SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING is certainly one of the better action pictures of recent years and it's highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It didn't feel complete,"I had high expectations for this film. Wonder Woman raised the bar, and I thought this would top that, based on the trailers alone. Little did I know that the trailers contained the best parts of the movie anyone. Therefore the movie never got better than what I'd already seen.I'm not sure what to make of the pacing. The film felt slow and boring (I'm sorry, but this surprised and confused me too). It was not until later in the film that the story started to come together, and the pace picked up. Also, it felt like a Spiderman and Iron Man movie, as opposed to a purely stand-alone Spidey feature. That wasn't so bad, but I think the whole Stark Enterprises angle could have been handled very differently. Did Iron Man need to be in the film? No. Not as far as I'm concerned. Maybe the studio(s) were worried that without a big name, they might not get the crowd they were hoping for. That illustrates that they don't understand the meaning Spiderman has to Marvel fans, and to his wider fanbase.Spiderman's school-friend starts off as lovely and funny, but I soon was wishing that he would die in the movie. What an irritating guy! From the trailers you learn that he sees Spidey doing his thing in his own home, and then has to keep a secret. However, he so nearly can't keep it, that he just comes across as a buffoon. In the next movie, I hope they replace him with someone else.I didn't find enough in the film to engage me, and fatally, it didn't feel filmic. It felt like a TV movie. I'm not sure why, but you'll see for yourself. This film should have been more than just filler, as we wait for the Infinity Stones saga to be fully unleashed. But it ended up feeling just that....padding, while we wait for the really good stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man's Legacy,"I must say that, as a Marvel Fan, I am deeply impressed with this new movie. I know that this Spidey is not really in line with the classical comics but I have to admit that this movie has an outstanding story plot. Even the Spiderman's suit, that Tony Stark has made for him, is really impressive with all these high tech features and web combinations and Jennifer Connelly was really talented when she played the A.I. for it (Similar to F.R.I.D.A.Y in the Iron Man suit). Michael Keaton played a BAD-ASS Super-villain and that has scored a lot of points as well. As a huge Iron Man fan, I admired the support and motivation that Stark has given to Peter Parker as an Inspirational and Charismatic Mentor (Hoping that Robert Downey Jr. can win an Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"" in this movie). Overall I believe that Tom Holland has played a cool and hip Spider-Man similar to Ryan Reynold's Deadpool except with more comical but juvenile humor. I know that people say that he is too young to play the Spidey role but I think that we should give him a chance to continue to do so since he has produced promising results form this Hollywood Masterpiece. Who knows, he might even stun millions of viewers in the upcoming Avengers Movies. Good Job ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
the spider-man we all deserve at last,this was the best spider-man movie i have seen in a long time but why is it the best because it is grounded in the why it tells of peter struggles with being spider-man and how he trying to cope with it plus it is not about the iron man at all yes he is key to the plot but it mainly focuses on spidy plus the cast is amazing and make this a much watch summer blockbuster.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good introduction,Yet another new Spider-Man reboot? I'm still quite attached to the Tobey Maguire series but this one was pretty good. It has a good sense of humour and the story is engaging. I do enjoy Tom Holland's portrayal of a goofy teenage Spider-Man. This film has the essential Spider-Man DNA but has its own spin on it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Refreshing Spider-Man,"Considering this is the sixth Spider-Man film since the start of the noughties. It is really positive the fact Marvel was able to successfully bring in so many fresh ideas. It is also worth noting how many good jokes they were able to get into the film that had not been covered in the previous five. Obviously, one thing that was an advantage to this film is it went into an already established cinematic universe when the others didn't have that advantage. Tom Holland portrayal was witty and linked all the other characters really well. It was also nice to see Gwenyth Paltrow make a cameo as Pepper Potts. Nice to see the appearances of two new villains on the big screen but at this point, I would be curious to see the green goblin return. So overall I would definitely recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What a Spider-Man movie should always be,"Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It's everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did a fantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable Peter Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him. This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies, this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2 and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they are also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flick for the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best MCU and Spider-Man film to date,I'm glad to see my favorite superhero and character of all time in the MCU where he finally belongs.this is the spider-man movie that me and I'm pretty sure a lot of fans as well have been waiting for the last decade! this is everything you could ever want or ask in a spider-man movie! definitely the best superhero summer blockbuster of the year for me personally and my favorite film of the year so far.Go see it web heads you will not be disappointed!,,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Oh joy, another Spider-Man movie...","Right, well another year and another superhero movie, seems about the turn of the mill these recent years. Was I thrilled when this movie was announced? No. Did I stand in line to watch it in the cinema? No.Well, I watched ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" solely because I had the chance, not because it was a pressing matter on my 'movies-to-watch' list.So did the world really need another Spider-Man movie? Well, not really, not if you ask me. And all this rebooting is just to the point of being ridiculous. Did we need a new actor to play Spider-Man? Hardly so.That being said, then I will say that Tom Holland actually fared well enough in the role as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. However, it was such a thrill and a blast to watch Michael Keaton in the movie, he was really so well-cast for the villain role and did so magnificently. His character was rather fun and interesting, and wore a cool outfit. However, I can't claim to be much fan of the high-tech Spider-Man outfit, however.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" turned out to be fun and entertaining, but at the same time it was just another run of the mill superhero movie in my opinion. There was a little bit too much focus on how much destruction Spider-Man could muster in this movie, which made the movie feel a bit campy and corny.Being a Marvel movie, you know that you are in for a treat in the special effects department. And sure enough, the Marvel camp delivered a movie cramped with amazing special effects and superb CGI.Hardly a movie that I will watch a second time around, but then again that is how I feel about all superhero movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Go watch it, Webheads!","Finally! The movie that Spider-man truly deserves. While other Spider-man movies have plenty of merit (and others don't), Homecoming is by far the greatest rendition of Spider-man movies ever created for the silver screen! It had everything that encompasses Spider-man, but in smaller doses so that they are easier to digest and enjoy.The inside jokes came at a great pace, and the comedy traveled far and wide for all kinds of humor. Even the darker humor was not too dark, and still suited Spider-man to a T. Tom Holland was great with his reactions to the humor going on around him, while also giving off his own jokes the way a spider can. His friend, Ned was not over done, he was given, once again, in small doses, and never got annoying, which is really hard for a comic relief character. The only thing I think they could have really done without was Flash. While Flash Thompson was good for a few laughs, he just didn't contribute a whole lot to the overall quality of the film itself. That, however, is the tiniest of nitpicks, and does not at all affect its score.It gets triumphant echoes of joy with the action scenes. They are fast pace, high octane, and show that Spider-man has a lot to learn before he reaches his prime. You truly feel like this is how Spider- man would act were he put into these situations. He gets his butt kicked as much as he kicks tail himself, but that's more from his inexperience, and again, it is not shoved into your face, it is delivered in a moderate quantity for maximum efficiency.Characters have their roles, and all of them play them off to their utmost and pull their own weight. The character Michelle is a quiet giant in her field of comedy, and is one of the funniest characters in her own rite. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is fantastic! He is not really evil, he has his own motivations, they just happen to be outside of the law. Peter's crush, Liz, plays a far bigger role than expected, but a necessary one in the long run. The moment we are introduced to her, I figured she may be the thorn in the movie's side, but, once again, small doses prevail.The story is rather small potatoes in the spectrum of the M.C.U., but that is perfect for a beginner super hero movie, which is where Suicide Squad's biggest failure can be observed. Homecoming stays within its bounds, and is as big as it needs to be for when it needs it the most.Flaws in this movie are hard to find, beyond nitpicking it to death (which some will, it's inevitable). It is more than welcome in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is a must-own for hardcore fans and casual fans of Spider-man (and Marvel) alike. Do not miss this movie, it is well worth the full price of admission, even if it is the 3-D price! Yes! It is that good! Now stop reading this review and go watch it, Web heads!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Definitely fun, Tom Holland is great, didn't need the Avengers plot","This was fun! I haven't seen much of the MCU in the last 10 years (I bailed after Age of Ultron), but I've heard good things about the Tom Holland trilogy and finally got around to watching one. It's a good Spider-Man movie and a pretty good high school movie, too. I appreciate, given this is the third Spider-Man in my lifetime, that we skipped the origin story and got right to Spider-Man antics. Tom Holland was excellent in the role, I see how this movie launched him into mega stardom. I appreciated the relatively grounded stakes of this story and the MCU-brand quippy charm and visual polish. It was an enjoyable 2-hour experience.That being said: what's holding this movie back for me is the attempts to connect it into the Avengers storyline. I'm sure that if I was invested into the MCU, I would've appreciated it but this movie's stakes and storyline were successful enough as a stand-alone story that the Iron Man and Avengers connections felt more undermining to the good movie I was watching than additive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Could've been much better,"SYNOPSIS:
Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is high off his ""mission"" he had from Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and is itching to get another mission. While he doesn't get one, he notices burglars using some dangerous tech that he's unfamiliar with and decides to go on his own mission.REVIEW:
I remember being so incredibly hyped to see this film as Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I was quite disappointed and it's because there's so much potential in this film. I mean, Tom Holland is the best overall Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Michael Keaton is phenomenal as Vulture, Marisa Tomei is one of the most beautiful women on the planet even with her age and you have RDJ making appearances too?! Recipe for success, right? Not exactly.The jokes in this were so childish, that when they even tried to use adult humor, it fell so flat and was so predictable. Don't want to be too harsh, but I don't think Jacob Batalon is good as Ned. He's really there for comedic relief and his timing is not good. His acting overall could use some work. But again, the writing is quite childish in nature. Same thing with Flash. Flash is meant to be a Jock and he's just as nerdy/wimpy as Peter Parker. Really? This is the route you took? And his ongoing ""Penis Parker"" (not a typo) joke is so cringe. I don't know how that made post. They completely ruined Shocker (Bokeem Woodbine). I mean, The Shocker is one of Spider-Man's main villains and in here he's introduced as some weak side villain. Then you have the scene of Spider-Man pulling together a ship that's split in half. The problem I have with that is that it's essentially the same exact scene from Sam Reimi's Spider-Man 2. Maybe they're trying to pay homage to that incredible film, but I don't like them doing it by copying the exact scene. Personally, I believe it should be done as little things in the background that you notice. For instance, in IT: Chapter One, they pay homage to the book and old film in multiple ways like having a Tim Curry Pennywise doll in that clown scene with Richie (of course some scenes are very similar because it's based off a book).There was good to take from this film. Tom Holland is fantastic as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He's the nerdy, unpopular high school Peter Parker, but the overly talkative and witty Spider-Man. They finally got it right. Toby McGuire was a great Peter Parker, but not witty overly serious Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield was a great witty Spider-Man, but way too cool Peter Parker. Then you had the father-son connection scenes between Peter Parker and Tony Stark that I loved. I really enjoyed seeing their relationship progress a bit. Finally, Michael Keaton does it again. He's just so damn good and for whatever reason keeps taking these bird roles. It seems to work out though so I can't complain.P.S. Donald Glover was phenomenal in the two scenes he was in. Now, he performed his comedic lines to an absolute T. Funniest parts of the film.This film had potential and wasn't terrible, but definitely isn't one of my top Spider-Man films. Wish they did more with what they had. 6.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Breath of fresh air for Spiderman movies, for the MCU and for superhero movies in general !","Opening Arguments: Till Dr Strange came out, the MCU had become rather formulaic in terms of character development and plot lines. Colourful action sequences, an ensemble of great actors and a few comical tropes thrown in here and there to make the plot lines seem clever and grounded are some factors that were causing MCU movies to become hit after hit. However, it wouldn't work forever and something had to change. And, boy, did it change with Spiderman Homecoming !! Usually i am wary to call a superhero movie 'realistic', but i will use that particular term in this movie simply because the entire movie is welded together in a seamless stream of events that play out very sensibly inside the viewers head.Plot: 'Stay close to the ground', Stark tells Peter. And the movie does so too. The result is a very believable version of how a 15 year old boy on the cusp of becoming an Avenger, but also struggling with 'coming of age' issues would behave. Yes there are a couple of good action set pieces. But even those are portrayed so well that they seem to be stem more out of a series of events going out of hand rather than the movie setting us up for action just for the heck of it. And each act blends into the other in a fluid way that has been missing in superhero movies so far.Acting & Characters: Absolutely full marks to Holland and Keaton. After a long long time do we get to enjoy a fully fleshed out antagonist in the MCU! When i watched the trailers i thought 'The Vulture' is going to be another mech-suit wearing bad guy drunk on power and carnage. But no. Keaton's character actually keeps developing & evolving throughout the span of the movie so well that a discerning viewer might even question whether he is really so much of a bad guy at all. And Holland, well, you can just see that he gives his heart & soul to this performance, and i am looking forward to see more of him in future MCU movies. If he is truly the central character of phase 4, then the MCU is in good hands.Other stuff: It actually feels nice to see Peter getting used to a wicked tech-ed up suit developed by Stark which is part of why this movie feels fresh. Rather than giving 'instinct' as an excuse for all the cool stuff spiderman can do, here we are given a version of how Spidey first learns many tricks with the help of some cool Stark tech, but then also learns to look inside of himself for the best of his abilities after his suit is temporarily taken away by an angry Tony after the ferry incident depicted in the trailers.Closing arguments: Overall, the movie offers everything: a grounded plot, great characters to sympathise with, well placed yet simplistic humour and of course, cool Spidey stuff !! Spiderman comes of age and so does the MCU itself. Previous versions haven't made it beyond 3 and 2 movies respectively. Maybe the third-time reboot's a charm ? :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films.

"Good MCU film, Bad Spider-Man film","Over multiple rewatches, I've grown to learn to enjoy this film as an MCU film featuring Spider-Man rather than look for a traditional Spider-Man story. I understand it leans more into the Ultimates comic-run from the early 2000's, as does the MCU in general, but I am honestly a bigger fan of the Spider-Man characters and stories in other adaptations (Raimi's, Insomniac, & Spectacular).It has a really high rewatchability factor, and undeniably enjoyable feel-good comic book flick. Tom Holland is great as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, and is able to carry the weight of the film on his shoulders. The supporting cast are also great, and this film has one of the best adaptations of high school students in any Spider-Man media. But, two elements really hinder my overall enjoyability of the story. One is Zendaya's Michelle Jones/MJ, who is barely utilised, despite the fact that she becomes integral to the next two films, and is just not a good creative decision for the character in my opinion. Also, Liz is so one-dimensional and laughably portrayed, barely feels like a person, not a fan of the performance. Plus I don't buy Peter's feelings for her at all, the whole plot point is important to the big plot twist and Peter's arc but is a very frustrating aspect for me because of the character.Other than that, I enjoy a lot about the film. Michael Keaton's Vulture is incredible and is a highlight, and a hard character to adapt. His role and performance elevates the film and is a really underrated villain in the MCU. There are a lot of great scenes in Queens too. RDJ and Holland have great chemistry, but it is really distracting when you can obviously tell that all of RDJ's scenes were shot in a day on a green screen. Also, some really noticeable CGI makes me think that the film definitely won't age as gracefully as Raimi's visual craftsmanship has.Overall, it's a great fit to what the MCU is and this new generation, and it works on being it's own Spider-Man adaptation after two reboots in the same 15 years. Yet, the film does not feel courageous enough, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is very MCU-ey. What I mean is that there is a no discernible visual, auditory, or thematic identity to this Spider-Man film or trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Amazingly Weakest Spiderman Ever,"The movie was good. Tom Holland is an excellent actor. The plot was good enough. Not sure why they had to make Peter Parker dumb. Not sure why they made this Spiderman the weakest Spiderman ever. Not sure why Spiderman did not have Spidey Sense. Not sure why they give Tony Stank all the credit for SPiderman. If you grew up with SPiderman in the 60's and 70's, you cringed at how pathetic this Spiderman is. This is a smear campaign against Spiderman. Maybe it's because Spiderman is still the most lucrative and loved Super Hero and maybe this story line is designed to make Iron Man more popular. It is really sad what they did to my childhood hero. Shame on them.I gave it a 6 for Tom Holland being a great actor, the action and the humor. Pause for a moment of silence The ending did give a glimmer of hope, but still, Peter Parker designed his own suits and it wasn't a gift of The Stank Man. Poor reboot of the most beloved Super Hero ever, when you take into account how great Peter Parker really was and how awesome Spiderman was...before this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not good enough","I was really looking forward for this movie. I had some really high hopes for it, but unfortunately, Spider-Man Homecoming fails to deliver a satisfying, full, and substantial movie.One of the main issues of this movie is one that is shared with many MCU movies (recently being Dr. Strange and GotG Vol.2) where comedy takes center stage and casts aside a vibrant, appealing story, a memorable villain, and proper character development.Peter Parker's main goal is to become an official Avenger and for some reason, the movie treats this motive as a bad idea and instead decides that having Peter Parker, a poor youth from Queens living with his single aunt, be a mini Iron Man with a high tech suit is a great idea and definitely not against what Spider-Man is about at all!None of the central characters are taken seriously aside from Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Aunt May is treated as a joke as everyone in the movie wants to have sex with her, the Vulture's motivation for becoming a villain definitely has some potential but was poorly executed and rushed, and his sidekick Ned, while not annoying, definitely felt out of place as Spider-Man's sidekick... His sidekick!!! Since when does Spider-Man need a sidekick? Especially early on in his life. And do not get me started on the new version of Flash Thompson... A total embarrassment.The movie, however, is not all bad. Homecoming does hone in on some elements of Spider-Man where he struggles with his powers and the responsibility that comes with them. Also, Tom Holland definitely is the best Spider-Man so far.One of the main reasons why I hold Spider-Man as my favorite superhero is because of how cool the web-swinging around New York looks like and how creative the fights can be with his superpowers. Homecoming really shows how much of a rushed product it is with the lack of any creative or even well choreographed battles. The CGI looks unfinished and unpolished and Spider-Man mostly looks like a video-game character, which is unforgivable given how realistic he looked in Spider-Man 2, a movie that came out in 2004... 13 years ago!Briefly said, Homecoming is definitely not a ""bad"" or ""terrible"" movie per say but it is underwhelming and suffers from your typical MCU flaws. It does little justice to the character and his universe and without spoiling the final scene before the credits start, but let me just tell you that if you hold a shred of respect for Spider- Man and his mythos, you will be greatly disappointed, irritated even.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Keaton's work in particular was a bit underwhelming for me, but that's not his fault... it's the screenplay, which to be honest felt a bit forced and not up to standards for an MCU movie.Nevertheless, it's a great stand-alone flick you should definitely watch.

Fun for the whole family,"This is the reboot we've been waiting for! This returns one of Marvel Comics most beloved heroes to his roots. Tom Holland delivers a young and energetic Spiderman that teens can admire and even like, while longtime MCU fans can enjoy the web crawlers interaction with other Marvel greats. The film returns Spidey to his high school beginnings, and without rehashing the origin story movie goers have seen over and again, follows his growth as a teen superhero in a larger MCU where the world is changing following the events of other Marvel movies. One of the films stronger points is that it doesn't go over board trying to get Peter Parker grown up in 2 hours, but rather allows him to grow and change naturally. Previous adaptations of the wall crawling hero have pushed through the characters youth into early adulthood, but this movie has as much fun with it as can be had. This is an exciting ride through a new spider-verse, where audiences can delight in watching the youthful Jr. Avenger grow up through the course of many adventures, of which this is the first! The dynamic relationship between Peter and mentor Tony Stark (Iron Man) is real and demonstrates the reliance of mentors to young people. The appearance, all-be-it via video screen, of Steve Rogers (Captain America) offering his insights to high school students added a humorous, but very real feeling look into the greater MCU, while keeping America's favorite web shooter at the center of the story. This was a film well worth every minute. It is deep, dramatic and tops it all off with just the right amount of action packed heroics.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is not a comic book hero's movie,"This movie is more of a comedy teen movie. It's actually a movie about a kid who got some spider powers, than of a marvel super hero action movie. The movie shows how the ongoing conflict between the ""cool kids"" who make fun of Peter and the ""nerd kids"" to which Peter belongs to. The ongoing decline of the Marvel cinematic universe continue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Check out my full review on my Youtube Channel!,I loved Tom Holland as Spiderman in this film! It was so refreshing seeing a legitimately young cast portray these characters I love so much.

"Tons of Intention, Plenty of Distraction","I'm an opening weekend, see-it-before-anyone-else superhero movie fan. Apparently I'm not the only one as my theater was filled with all ages including kids. That said, this movie had all the potential to be what fans have been hoping for - a Spiderman that veteran audiences can recognize while being a hero who younger audiences can find inspiration from. From the opening scenes and credits, this film certainly aims in that direction.Unfortunately, there are plenty of distractions along the way. We're ""almost"" in on some key plot points that we never get the full information on, such as what happened to Peter's parents or where Uncle Ben is (if he even exists - this is a reboot, after all). Even 10% more information along these lines could have added another layer of depth to the plot that would have cemented everything in place for all viewers.To add to the downside, several unnecessary uses of profanity litter the movie and are yet another thing younger viewers are supposed to just endure. During one moment when a teacher questions a student about his activities on a computer, his answer made our entire theater groan.There is an upside to this movie. At least, I keep telling myself that. I want there to be. I wish it was a little clearer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's an Avengers Movie Not really a Spider-man stand alone.,"HOMECOMING continues the streak, no Marvel duds so far. It's a good story, with good acting and good special effects. It's good.Which therein lies the problem. In an attempt to make Homecoming fit into the The Avengers Universe it forgoes a lot of what makes Spider-man great. Character depth rarely goes deeper than a puddle and instead you get cameos for the other Avengers and a story whose sole purpose is to make sure it makes sense that Spider-man has a place in the INFINITY WARS.Which is sad considering Iron Man, Thor and Captain America all had great introductions to the universe with movies that worked on their own. Even the 2nd Hulk movie was great at setting up the character. The producers I guess assume we all know who Spider-man so why worry about his motivation, other than will he be in the next movie.Bottom line: good movie, but not the stand-alone story Spiderman deserves. Don't believe the hype. HOMECOMING has nowhere near the character development and emotion of the 2002 or 2004 Spider-man movies. In fact, in a head to head with Wonder Women, DC has claimed its first victory resounding victory over Marvel. This is not even the best of the Spider-man franchise and is inferior to Guardians of the Galaxy. In fact, in the Marvel Universe, it ranks at the bottom.Go see it, but adjust your expectations accordingly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best Spider Man movie since Spider Man 2,"I saw Spider-Man Homecoming on the opening night of the movie,and its my favorite Spider Man movie since the 2nd Spider Man movie from the original series.Tom Holland who plays as Spider Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe does a terrific job on being passed the mantle of playing Spider Man.Michael Keaton also does a great job as playing as the main bad guy of the movie Vulture.The new take on Spider Man of not being dark and gritty its nice to see for a change.And I have a feeling that Tom Holland will keep impressing me on his performance as Spider Man in future Marvel movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A great Spidey gets a heartless movie,"disappointed. Not in Tom Holland, he looks and feels like a true spidey.Keyton also return well as another winged creature. But I had high expectation. Its just too much MCU, too much Avenger, too much jokes, too much Tony Stark gadgets that undermines the simple but great powers of spidey.His webs feels too weak, his swinging point of view is lost, we miss a decent entry for vulture, we miss a great fight scene with vulture, every kid is a genius who can hack Iron man's security measures.I don't feel any emotional impact for peter Parker's boyhood romance or the climax fight scene(can we even call it a fight scene). whats with all the night time fight scenes, 3d makes it even darker. I wanted to see spider man (more like spider boy here) swinging from one building to another fighting vulture which never happens,we get spidey driving a stolen car to go from point A to point B for the sake of jokes.They get Peter and spidey character right, a bit of vulture right too, but they spend adding too much gadgets in the suit.still Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is best,followed by Spiderman 1.

Great come back,"The previous reboot did have some critics They had different reasons for hating the older reboot. When this one came out I thought it will be bad, looking at how young Peter was. But I think it was great.The action scenes were good although most took place at the night and the plot was well written. It makes you understand well the struggles spider man goes through. It makes you see that spider man really isn't the biggest star in the marvel world but a guy just like us. It had some twists too. Who would have thought that Spiderman's lover was the daughter of the vulture.I think this spider man reboot wasn't really bad at all as anyone can enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not wanted:  but amusing and entertaining nonetheless,"When I heard the news last year that Spider-Man was going to be rebooted yet again, I was like ""are you freaking serious""? After the successful Toby Maguire trilogy (though the less said about ""Spider- Man 3"" the better) and the mildly successful ""Amazing Spider-Man"" duo with Andrew Garfield only finishing in 2014, did we REALLY need another reboot? More dramatic spider biting? More Uncle Ben spouting then dying? The same old – same old, rewarmed in a pan with a bit of red wine added just to stop it feeling so dry and tasteless.And I still feel the same way. I understand that its more to do with rights ownership between Sony, Marvel and Disney that this got made so quickly. but in the words of Ian Malcolm ""they didn't stop to think if they should"".But actually, although I still don't really approve of it, they've done a pretty good job in rebooting in a different manner. I commented in my review for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" that that first reboot was ""much less earnest and quirkier than the original Tobey Maguire series, and reveling more in the fun to be had around a superhero's schooldays."" This latest reboot moves even further along that scale, being very much more of a high-school comedy that a pure superhero flick.Wearing the suit this time is a far more age-appropriate Tom Holland, winner of last year's BAFTA Rising Star award. And very personable he is too. The suit in question has been technoed-up by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jnr). Because here the Spider-Man story carries on from the brief cameo in ""Captain America: Civil War"" that crossed Spidey into the mainstream Marvel timeline.Within the high-school setting, Peter Parker's geeky, and almost too deliberately multi-racial, gang includes his pal Ned (Jacob Batalon), very funny with a ""chair guy"" sequence, the unattainable Liz (Laura Harrier) as the love-interest, Betty (the excellent Angourie Rice who made such a great impression in ""The Nice Guys"" but didn't really move the meter for me here I'm afraid), Flash (Tony Revolori) and best of all for me the almost horizontally laconic Michelle (Zendaya, of Shoshone heritage) – uber-cool but harbouring a secret crush on Peter.Chris Evans pops up for comic relief as Captain America doing motivational high-school videos. And older viewers might want to have fun watching out for Tyne Daly: Lacey in the old cop show ""Cagney and Lacey"".But stealing the show in the acting stakes is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes (aka ""The Vulture"") who could for all the world be auditioning for ""Birdman 2"". The well-judged thing about this villain is that he is no hyper-galactic being with superpowers, or a typical ""rule the world"" Bond villain, but just an ordinary Joe in search of financial profit to keep his family in the manner to which they are accustomed. I really liked that. The script (an army of people, but led by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who also wrote the story) also nicely counterpoints the thin-line between the ""good arms dealer"" (Tony Stark) and the ""bad arms dealer"" (Toomes).The script also very wisely leaps several months into where the reboot could have started. None of the tedious spider biting. No Uncle Ben – just a sly reference to ""what Aunt May's been through"". Now this might confuse anyone not familiar with the Spider-Man story, but the percentage of people in the Western world in that segment must be less than 2%.There are however also significant character changes that may annoy Spider-Man devotees. Aunt May herself is no longer the frail old lady of previous depictions, but a hot and attractive middle-aged woman (AILF?) played by Marisa Tomei (who does indeed look mighty fine).Many of the action scenes are well done, with a scene at the Washington Monument being particularly exciting. It all gets rather overblown though with a later scene aboard the Avenger's plane. And this scene sums up my problem with many of these films: the superhero characters are pretty well indestructible. You know they are. So the scenes of peril, that might thrill in an Indiana Jones, an M.I. or a Bond film, lack any sort of tension. Even when the protagonist does have a superhero on the ropes, they don't carry on kicking the proverbial c**p out of them until they are ""dead"". they lay off so the superhero can recover and kick their ass in a few minutes time!The director is Jon Watts in only his third directorial outing (with only the much praised ""Cop Car"" to pretty up his CV). With such a lot on his shoulders he does a good job.At 133 minutes its a tad over-long (I watched this in a double bill with ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" so my eyes afterwards were 16:9!). But it's a fun summer flick that both amuses and entertains. If you have the choice between this and Planet of the Apes though for your Saturday night at the movies, I would personally choose the latter.By the way, in terms of ""monkeys"" (end credit sequences) – yep, it's a Marvel movie, of course there are monkeys! One early on in the credits and another one at the end... which is actually very funny indeed.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Or not. Your choice!

Spidey's back & he's better than ever.,"Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late.Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone.

Not bad but not amazing,"As someone who grew up watching sam rainis Spider-Man everyday, I can appreciate what these movies are trying to do. First off, there are a lot of negative reviews and I don't understand why, and a lot of them are just pointing out the differences between this movie and Sam rainis Spider-Man. This movie wasn't trying to copy the same formula that's been done, it was trying to be different, I can understand that it can throw some people off, I felt the same why when I first watched this movie in theaters. But you have to realize that they're trying to make a more younger, fresher spider man, most comic readers say this is a spider man that's more faithful to the comics, which I extremely appreciate. Some characters are weak in this movie like flash and Liz, but I don't think they wanted to repeat the same story would've already seen. Especially since it's goes with mcu, they went for a lighter, innocent tone. Some parts can be extremely cheesy, but that's Spider-Man because in reality he is meant to be a teenager. I think this movie is great for what they were trying to accomplish and I can tell much care went into this movie. And the VULTURE!!! One of my personal favorite villains from a Spider-Man, glad he finally got his spotlight and his design in the movie is amazing he looks like some pilot from the future which is really cool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Tom Holland is great, but I miss the self-made Spider-man","I give this film a 6 because it was pretty enjoyable in the moment. Tom Holland is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-man, and it made for a good time at the movies. That being said, the creative decisions that were made to incorporate and integrate the webslinger into the Marvel Cinematic Universe really ruined Peter's backstory and really all that made Spider-man an underdog hero to root for. Tony Stark literally gives Peter everything he needs and then some. I missed the Peter Parker who sewed his suit himself and endlessly experimented (and often failed) to create his tech and hone his skills. This may seem like a small thing to gripe over, but I believe these things were essential to Spider-Man's character. Instead, we just get a clever kid who ends up getting everything he wants handed to him.If you can forgive all that, you'll likely enjoy Homecoming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Loved the plot really has revitalised Spider Man,"This seems to get to the action instead of messing around telling the same story over again and it is great that Peter is still in school who has got his eye on someone else Liz who is a nice girl, nevertheless the romance damsel in distress does not get in the way of the film like the previous Spider Man. I like the way that the have changed Mary Jane Watson to Michelle Jones as her friend call her ""MJ"" that we find that out at the end of the film draftee her starting to come out of he shell and open up to Peter A Bit. MJ is completely different character in so many ways a bit of a diva at times and a strong independent girl who keeps to herself and has a shy side and is really lovely and kind when she takes down her barrier and you get to know her, which really does build up the plot, which is instead of putting the typical MJ And Peter Parker love Story together that is just not reality. Loved the Father And Son relationship between Peter Parker And Tony Stark really shows him as a father figure and really does connote the next few films. I would strongly recommend watching this as they have done an amazing job of getting the story right after those other failed moves and the bad guy in this movie is kind of a reference to the green goblin with the green eyes but instead with wings who perter does not know that is so interesting to watch that unfold. Spider Man in the MCU as an Avenger is about time well done Tom Holland And Zendaya and the rest of the cast and crew for doing such an amazing job as all my doubts are gone now and Spider Man is one of my favourite Super Heroes out of the MCU next to Iron Man what a call duo.

"Not the best Spiderman movie, but Tom Holland is a gem!","I remember when I first saw Tom Holland in Captain America: Civil War, I knew he had a lot of charisma for the Spiderman role. The only skepticism I had for the reboot was, can the story or feeling I once had for Spiderman come back? Spider-Man(2002) and Spider-Man 2(2004) are one of the greatest superhero movies up to date. It was an awesome introduction to the superhero universe, and it utterly made me fall in love with the characters. Just for reference, Spiderman is still my favourite superhero.After watching the early screening for Spider-Man: Homecoming, I will still say that the Spiderman movies we knew 13 years ago are still unbeatable out of the 6 movies we have gotten. Don't get me wrong. I still had fun with this movie, but it didn't feel like a Spiderman movie. It felt like a side story of an Avengers movie. And that disappointed me. We are constantly reminded that Spiderman is a second class to the Avengers team or this is an introduction to the upcoming Avengers movie. I would have much preferred to see Spiderman as the standalone Spiderman. That was my main gripe.Moving along, Tom Holland is not only the youngest, but also the most charismatic, and comedic character or actor from the three Spiderman we have seen on-screen. He plays a believable high school student who is struggling to find his identity. He balances well between learning the ropes of being Spiderman, while at the same time trying to be a normal high school kid. However, there is something missing in his character. His struggles are resolved too easily and quickly. Everything comes off as comedic or gets resolved by the help of a third party. There were no consequences for his actions. Moreover, the other supporting characters lack depth. We don't get a backstory on them. Michelle played by Zendaya and Liz played by Laura Harrier could have been played by anyone. The character Flash seemed like a miscast for me. He was out of place and his physique let alone his character did not match. On the other hand, Ned was an awesome character. He really worked well with Peter Parker. Furthermore, the main antagonist played by Michael Keaton is nowhere near as in-depth as Green Goblin or Doctor Oc. I will say that he is one of the better villains we have had in superhero movies these days though. There is more to his character that might surprise you, and that was what took this movie to a higher level for me. Also, Michael Keaton does a great job because sometimes he does truly scare you with just his eyes!The story is simple, but it works well in this case. There are a lot of banters and one-liners. Some were funny, and others felt repetitive. In fact, it had all the comedy, lightheartedness, and humour that a Spiderman movie should have. Nonetheless, it lacks depth and emotions. Even though we get to experience the struggles of Peter Parker's teenage-hood as mentioned, nothing is ultimately at stake here. For all the chaos that was happening, the body count was very small.The soundtrack is nowhere near as memorable as the Danny Elfman soundtracks. I still believe that the Danny Elfman Spiderman theme song is one of the best superhero theme songs out there next to Dark Knight and Wonder Woman. Every time the theme song is playing, you know it's Spiderman! That's how memorable it is. I wish they could reuse that.The action scenes were kinda shaky. I did not see everything very well. They were not as visceral as the Sam Raimi movies. In fact, I re-watched some of the action sequences from Spider-Man 2, and they are still better choreographed than this one. However, keep in mind, that this is not an action packed movie. It is mostly about Spiderman figuring out his abilities. The movie is not an introduction to Peter Parker taking the mantle as Spiderman, but how Peter Parker transitions from not being ""Spiderboy"" anymore (slowly).I still prefer Sam Raimi's classic take on the Spiderman costume. In here it looks a bit CGI, and too much like ""Iron Man"". Another reason why it reminds me of Avengers all over again.I sound like I really hated this movie, but I don't. I enjoyed it for what it was. I was just expecting more from a Spiderman movie, so I am more critical.7.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not the same old same old. Stop loving in the past. We needed something that ties into the rest of the MCU and that is the whole point of this movie. You don't need an origin story.

An Embarrassment,"This film lacks any sort of dimension to the characters what so ever, Peter Parker was so dull and the film completely missed the idea of Spider-man. After watching this movie it almost completely ruined the Spider-man franchise for me.The political undertones are thrown at you within the first second of the film and continue annoying throughout the entire movie. The race changes of the characters are obviously only done simply so Marvel doesn't appear as ""white supremacists"". Michelle or MJ in the movie was annoying and hard to like, although she would have been fine as an angsty opinionated teen, once she was revealed to be MJ it was completely embarrassing, whoever decided that was a good idea should be imprisoned, seriously.The acting was okay but nothing amazing. Jacob Battalion who played as Ned was unhumorous and the character was unnecessary in the film. The acting by Laura Harrier (Liz) was extremely awkward and almost cringe worthy to watch, it is obvious that she is an amateur actor. Zendaya as an actor did a decent job portraying her role, but the character, in my opinion, was just so so unlikeable and whoever wrote her script and character probably has never seen MJ portrayed in a movie before. Tom Holland could have been a good actor but the script didn't do him justice, the lame jokes and trying to make him seem like a comic nerd was a horrible idea, Peter Parker was supposed to be a nerd in the sense of mathematics, and sciences but the film completely ruined that.The plot of the movie was boring and predictable, not to mention that the film didn't even show the origins of Spider-man or how he got his powers. Vulture or whatever was a sorry excuse for Green Goblin. The entire psychological aspect with the story has been completely removed, no Uncle Ben, nothing, at least in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" they had those critical scenes. I don't even have enough time to talk about how horrible and unnecessary Iron-Man was in this film.Oh and the Spidey suit in this movie was stupid, he isn't Ironman, he's Spider-man, he shouldn't have had all those gadgets and computer AI technology.As a movie in general it's forgettable. Nothing is unique about this film and it feels like another copy and pasted comic superhero movie. I feel like I've already seen this movie 10 times.In conclusion, if you are a die-hard Spider-man fan, more specifically, a die-hard fan of the original Spider-man trilogy, then please do not watch this film because you will be disappointed.Rating Overall as a film: 6.2/10Rating as a Spider-man film: 3/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Simple yet effective. Spiderman 10/10,"Honestly, getting someone to review this movie who has no understanding (from reading the review) of everything that went into making this movie, and what this movie actually has to offer is sad and a detriment to this movie by expressing opinions of something that the reviewer has no proper knowledge of.Firstly you ask what went wrong for a reboot to be made. The Amazing Spider-Man is what was wrong, the mediocre pieced together story with a dark and depressing premise for a character that's meant to be light hearted, goofy and young. Getting a 30 year old Actor of Andrew Garfield to portray a young Peter Parker didn't gel at all.Secondly Sony didn't want to continue with Andrew Garfield after the 2nd Spiderman movie and due to the licensing rights Sony made with Marvel (pre Disney Ownership) they have to make a Spiderman movie within so many years or they lose the rights which then go back to Marvel, now owned by Disney.What transpired from this was Amy Pascal from Sony and Kevin Feige from Marvel coming to agreement as quoted ""Sony has the rights, that's not changing. Have Sony pay for the movie, distribute the movie, market the movie. Just let us make the movie and incorporate him into our universe."" and in doing so a reboot of Spiderman was born. I see no issue with this due to Marvels success so far with their franchise. Marvel gets the rights to all Spiderman Merchandise which they will make quite a bit of money on, also using Spiderman in their movies in which they keep the profits, and also Spiderman Homecoming 2 (probably not the name) will lead the MCU into Phase 4, which shows the commitment and investment from both sides to make this work.In doing this Spiderman has a great mesh with the Marvel universe, and what comic book fans and Spiderman fans have always wanted since the The Amazing Spider-Man reboot wasn't that well received. In this movie there are so many Easter Eggs, from mention of Miles Morales ( Black/Latino Spiderman), brief showing of a possible Villain in Scorpion. The showing of the Prowler, Shocker, The Tinkerer and references to previous Marvel films.If you wanted to go into this movie expecting a full on action and story-less movie and lots of spider-man flying through the city and saving the world, then you wont get this here. What will you get though is a great introduction to a character of Spider-man showing his true self as portrayed by the comic books, but not told the same old way, a fresh and dynamic approach to creating the character making us feel for the character, and showing that Spider-man doesn't have to save the world but still can make a difference and save the day even if the stakes aren't that high.All in all I feel this movie has to be watched more than once to truly see and understand how brilliant a director Jon Watts is, and how he made a perfect comic book movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good Spiderman, great cameos,wonderful villain boring Movie","I think many can agree that Spider Man's shield stealing scene in Captain America Civil War II revitalized our hopes for a fresh take on the web slinger and had us (present company included)counting down the days to Homecomings release.While Tom Hollands Spider-Man is good(inspite of him getting a beating from the most mundane thugs) and Michael Keaton's Vulture(is it okay to call him that? they never did in the movie?)is an excellent villain whose origin played out well and made sense in the movie there was just entirely to much Peter Parker and school going on. His sidekick was humorous but Spider-Man never needed nor had a sidekick and this left me hoping he never does again.Better than average is fine for a character who has never had a previous on screen appearance(Ant man was a blast with no expectation)but this is Spider-Man were talking about here.I understand a different direction was needed from Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Andrew Garfield's socially awkward loner Spider-Man but I enjoyed that much more and feel that was more authentic to the characters roots. Sure there are excellent cameo's from the rest of Marvel's cinematic universe but when there's no action on screen this is a bit of a snooze. I left the theatre feeling about this ,the way I did with similar films great no. Good enough to make another one absolutely! They all cant great can they? I definitely look forward to more of Marisa Tomei's Aunt May though as well as Thor Ragnorak which should be excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider Man Homecoming,"The movie destroyed the character of Spiderman, it showed him that he could not do anything without help. The film should have been called Iron Man and Spiderman. Most of the characters in the world of Spiderman were destroyed, especially Aunt May, who does not resemble Aunt May, because of the shape or character, and the character of MJ does not resemble MJ's mother in the character at all without being MJ is not at all like a bully, and the Flash character does not look like a bully.

It was so bad that it took forever for it to end. I am SHOCKED when I see the rating of this mess. I just can't believe people rated so high - it is beyond me. Does teenagers really accept this low standard? How could Marvel accept this nonsense production is another interesting thing to meditate. Side-by-side, Iron Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man series or Batman vs Superman look like masterpieces when comparing to Homecoming.Some reviewers had the actual nerve to say this is better than Spider- Man 2. What?!

Could have used less of Tom Holland,"I'm sure most of you know that you always need to stay through the credits of a Marvel Superhero flick to catch some ""bonus scenes"".   In the latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING, I would highly recommend that you stay through the entire credits for the scene AFTER the credits - perhaps Marvel's best ""credit scene"" ever.So, it has that going for it, which is nice.SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING has a lot of things going for it.  To wit:1).  Makes good use of familiar Marvel characters and situations from previous MCU films. Most notably Jon Favreau's Happy Horgan, Gwyenth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and (especially) Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Ironman - used just right (and just enough) to be entertaining.2).  Marisa Tomei is EXCELLENT as Aunt May, fulfilling the promise that her cameo in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR promised.3).  Michael Keaton is also EXCELLENT as the villain in this film - Vulture4).  The diversity of faces in Peter Parker's High School, most notably Jacob Batalon's take on Peter Parker's friend, Ned was a welcome site - though I would have liked more of Zendaya's Michelle and Donald Glover's Aaron Davis.5).  Spiderman lived up to the ""Friendly Neighborhood"" part of his title.  It was refreshing to see a more ""down to Earth"" story and not some big intergalactic, global battle.6).  The pacing of the film - and the action scenes - were solidly directed by Jon Watts (COP CAR - I know, I hadn't heard of him either), a pleasant surprise.  It also was a welcome relief that this film didn't try to ""pile on"" the villains, keeping just with The Vulture - another pleasant surprise.All of this adds up to a strong film, right?Well...it would...if it wasn't for one small thing that bothered me...the performance of Tom Holland in the titular role.I really enjoyed Holland's take on this character when he made his extended cameo in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR and was looking forward to him in this film.  But, truth be told, his Peter Parker/Spiderman started getting on my nerves after awhile.  I think a little of his portrayal goes a long way   Kind of like eating a vending machine bag of Dorito's - it's satisfying, and leaves you wanting more.  But try to eat a full, BIG bag of Dorito's and you get sick of Dorito's pretty quickly.All in all, a good, solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and a fairly strong film.  But, in this ""year of the SuperHero"" flick, it is only my 4th favorite of this genre this year.Letter Grade:  B7 (out of 10) Stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Name drop, name drop. Cameo, cameo.","Homecoming isn't a bad movie, it's just very, very reliant on outside help.Let's start with the good:Tom Holland is a better Spider-Man, than we've seen in a while. The high school dynamic of a teenage Peter Parker really sort of works here.Michael Keaton. If there is one reason I could give to see this movie, it would be Michaels portrayal of the Vulture. At long last a ""Marvel"" movie introduces not only a good villain, played by a great actor, but they've given him an arc that makes sense. In this movie, you get Adrian Toomes, and kind of agree with him. I found myself thinking ""Hey, you know what, he's got a point!"", rather than the typical Marvel fare of the hero battling some nameless thing shooting up into the sky.The annoying thing about Homecoming is the fact that it uses the greater MCU as a crutch to make it work.

Another notch in Marvel Studios belt.,"Amazing reboot, different theme from your typical superhero as per all Marvel Studio films so far.The theme for this one is grounded, street-level and teen oriented; and wonderfully executed.The acting is superb from the cast, but Michael Keaton is the gift that keeps on giving. His presence and facial expressions stole the scenes as per his acting signature. Marissa Tomei was a delight and so were the young high school cast. Robert Downey Jr was as per his usual self, he didn't hog the scenes but he complimented Tom Holland very nicely in their scenes.In regards to the link to the other MCU films, well it was there but it wasn't over bearing, this film felt very separate and individual but with the rest of the other films lingering in the background with their impact to the universe.I would say this film is EQUAL to Wonder Woman as far as superhero films this year goes. Both are amazing and well executed.Who said Super hero films are getting stale?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Definitive Spiderman is the best Marvel of the year,"Spiderman:Homecoming is the first film with Peter Parker as a fully- fledged member of the MCU.Peter Parker, plucked from obscurity in Queens to assist 'Team Stark' in the Civil War, finds himself sidelined. Told to stand up for the little guy, our erstwhile superhero finds himself directing lost old ladies and beating up muggers, all the while feeling that he could do more. Overconfident as a superhero, he is the polar opposite at high school where he is the champion of the quiz team and shyly attracted to Liz. After Spiderman foils a bank robbery which is performed with some slightly outlandish weaponry, our hero begins to track the source of the weapons, which leads back to Adrian Toomes, a contractor who is bitter for being kicked off the lucrative Chitari cleanup contracts and lost a lot of money. Toomes now uses an elaborate flying suit and chitari technology to steal alien artefacts to continue his profitable weapon sales operation.Tom Holland as Peter Parker is quite excellent in the role. For the first time in any Spiderman film, we have a teenage Spiderman and the film does very well in making us feel that this guy is just a kid, and a somewhat weedy one at that. Looking small and uncomfortable whenever he is at school (yet curiously buff when stripping in and out of his outfit), he is frequently shown in long shot or against massive backdrops to highlight just how out of his depth he is in this world of superheroes. Charming, enthusiastic, hubristic, and flawed, Holland's Spiderman is a triumph of character and actor combining to produce a winning cinematic creation. In a Marvel film so often there is little sense of peril, but here we become genuinely concerned for Peter. We fear for his safety several times. It's great.As a foil to Spiderman we have the ever-wonderful Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture. A disaffected American worker, he's the embodiment of the American Dream laid low by big corporations stealing the contracts for themselves. At one point Keaton growls that ""the guys who created this mess now get paid to clean it up"". It's hard not to sympathise with him, and Keaton's superb performance really sells this villain as a believable creation. So long a weak point in Marvel movies, Toombs is one of the best villains the franchise has created; threatening, charming, understandable, sympathetic, psychotic, and motivated.The rest of the cast are fine, though the constant reappearances of Tony Stark starts to grate. I found myself yearning for a charismatic older actor playing the Uncle Ben/father figure role. Stark is a dick, and it is hard to see him giving life-lessons to a kid when he basically created the whole situation in the first place.You'll be pleased to know that the action sequences are all very good indeed, a sequence on the Washington Monument being a standout (and in 3D this really delivers). Whenever Spiderman is taking on multiple opponents with a flurry of web shots, punches, kicks, flips, wall hangs and sarcastic commentary from the snarky kid in red and blue it is brilliantly entertaining.There are problems, however. Firstly there film feels quite flat. Moments that are clearly meant to be humorous don't deliver. Likewise some of the action sequences seem a bit rote, like something you'd see in Agents of SHIELD rather than a mega-budget movie. There is also un- necessary sub-scenes and nods that didn't quite fit with the characters, or the story, or the tone of the film.The other major problem with the film is the existence of Kick-Ass. Michael Vaughan's film clearly owes a great debt to Spiderman, but watching Homecoming it is hard to shake the feeling of deja vu, especially when you see Spiderman walking around the neighbourhood using his powers on low- level muggers. Both films create believable teenagers, give them superpowers, have them get bored and listless, then have them get out of their depth before eventually triumphing.Unfortunately, due to the unimaginative direction mentioned above, Kick-Ass is a superior film. The slight dips that Homecoming suffers from (the nerdy best friend irritating, the love interest bland, the humour flat, some of the action cheap, and plot twists are visible a mile away) Kick-Ass doesn't.However I fully understand that this is the film that Spiderman fans have been waiting for, and it is as slick and enjoyable a film as Marvel has ever made. It is the first time Spiderman is seen as he should be: as a kid. The film is very good, the best Marvel of the year, but this reviewer enjoyed Wonder Woman more; it was also energetic, propulsive, colourful, lively and tear- jerkingly heroic. Homecoming doesn't quite engage the same emotions in this reviewer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Refreshing, but not impressive take on the character!","I honestly didn't have a lot of expectations for this movie, but it came out a bit better than I expected. Let's start with the positives that I think outweigh the negative.Putting Peter on highscool and not showing his origin story is, in my opinion a great move. It's a story we've already seen twice, and if this movie was an origin story as well we would have seen 3 Spiderman origin stories within 15 years. That would be one Spiderman origin story every 5 years! Highscool is also a new place for movie Spidey (No that one Raimi scene with the 18 year olds than look like 38 year olds doesn't count) and thank god we didn't have to see ANOTHER Uncle Ben death scene. Tom Holland is great in this. Not sure if he's as god as Tobey but he encapsulates a young Peter very nicely! I also like how Peter's suit is handed to him by Stark, how am I supposed to believe that a 15 year old boy made a suit on his own. Plus said suit looks great. The humour is ok, nothing to bring you to tears but not annoying either. I also really like the plot. I love that for once Spidey has to stop something relatively small. He doesn't have to stop a reactor from swallowing the city or an alien species that takes over people. Just a gang with high tech weapons. And that's fine. Also the twist is very well executed! Speaking of it, Michael Keatons Vulture is a great villain with some of the most realistic motivation for turning evil that I've seen in a superhero movie. Lastly some scenes like the one where Spidey rescues his friends are very fun and all in all the movie is very enjoyable.Now for the bad...By far the biggest problem here is the action, that is the worst in any Spiderman film to date. The bank scene is short, the ferry fight is meh and the final fight is nice, but not too impressive. There are a few other minor ones that aren't even worth mentioning. Very disappointing action. Plus, not a huge fan of Aunt May here, and Flash is just kinda sad to watch. I also forgot Shocker was in the movie, but it doesn't matter as he's a minor villain in the comics anyways. By the way, yes the overeliance on tech is a bit annoying, yet it's great that in the final fight he only has his web shooters, proving he's Spiderman even without the suit (unlike a certain Black Panther). Lastly, there is a slightly excessive useof cgi at times. The movie doesn't have Black Panther level bad cgi, but it's not that great either.Plot and villain elevate this movie, bit lackluster action prevents it from being great. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Finally!,"Not absolutely perfect... but so damned close, I might as well just stick the 10 on there.I agree with not regurgitating the origin story again.

FANTASTIC!! He could be totally menacing and yet understandable, and even at the end still held a slight shred of honor despite all he'd done.Say... do you all realize that every superhero fic Keaton has been in, he's had wings? Batman, Birdman, now the Vulture... I'm seeing a pattern here! It was incredibly humorous, had great heart, great characters, and it managed to tie into the developments of ""Civil War"" without that story overriding this movie's individual tale.Plus, the lesser (though still quite tense and potentially devastating) stakes were perfect for an up-and-coming superhero.Ah, I can't really say anything more without spoiling things, and this is one movie where you really don't want anything exposed before your first viewing.

This film was absolutely incredible!!!!,"I am a huge fan of Spiderman, I love the original trilogy (yes even the third one) I really liked Tobey Maguire and felt he did a great job. I think the Andrew Garfield films, while enjoyable, really lacked the tone of a Spiderman film. So I can tell you, this was easily my most anticipated movie of 2017, but I do have to remember that I can't keep my expectations as high as a drug addict. So as the film started, while pumped, I also was just praying it would be awesome. So... I AM VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The entire time watching it I had a smile on my face! ☺ First off the acting is great, Tom Holland was born to play this role. All his friends, the villains, and of course Robert Downey Jr did awesome like always. Next the action, the web swinging sequences, the high flying fighting and intensity was all handled so well, Marvel always achieves greatness with that. You can really feel the brutality and fear of the characters while watching. Let's talk about Micheal Keaton as the vulture wow! What an incredible villain! He was very intimidating with the suit on but also, a terrific character underneath the suit. While I am a fan of the MCU I do agree, a majority of their villains suck. But Keaton really was different. He had so much depth and motivation which I adored. And there is one big shocker towards the end which even put more emotional weight towards his character. This movie is not just another marvel movie. Spiderman Homecoming is very unique and special in its own way. Of course the CGI was great like always. The story was written in a way we can all adore. There are so many twists and turns and unexpected paths it chooses to take which was the right direction. And last, the humor was hilarious! Laughter is the best medicine.

Best Spider-Man Film To Date!,"'Spider-Man Homecoming' is, in my opinion, the best Spider-Man film to date and one of the best superhero films ever made. Tom Holland is the definitive on-screen Peter Parker/Spidey and perfectly embodies the personality, spirit, and youthfulness of the character. Michael Keaton is fantastic as main villain, the Vulture, and is one of Marvel Studios' best antagonists thus far. He is chilling to watch and very intimidating. The rest of the cast give stellar performances, especially Peter's best friend Ned and Aunt May. Robert Downey Jr.'s role is small, but vital to the film's captivating plot and story. The action scenes are breath-taking, and I loved seeing a less-experienced Spider-Man who is just now learning how to use and control his newfound abilities. The movie is also hilarious and probably one of the funniest comic book films so far. I also loved seeing Spidey doing good deeds and committing random acts of kindness around Queens, NY, and the film uses the NYC setting perfectly.

Spider-Man? More like Spider-Meh.,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was entertaining in the way popcorn flicks are, but I found it lacking in substance. As with most Marvel movies, the audience is apparently supposed to just play passive observer, willingly suspending not just disbelief but also suspending any impetus to actually think about what's happening on the screen. So sure, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a nice film if you want something essentially mindless, but the writing doesn't rise above the average Marvel movie.

Spidey on training wheels,"First, let me say that the concept of this Spiderman is a sort of light hearted family friendly adventure that would do well for young families. Spidey (Tom Holland) captures the geeky and generally harmless, yet sympathetic and morally driven, character that we all known and love.My issues with the movie are subtle gripes with character development, casting, and the title of the movie itself. The title of ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" shot a little off the mark, considering a mere 5-10 minutes was covered between Peter Parker and Liz Allen (Laura Harrier) out of a 2 and a 1/2 hour film, which seems a tad pointless to me. A more appropriate title for this film would be ""Spiderman: the Stark Internship"", considering that was his primary focus through the entire film. Next, I have a similar issue with casting like I had with Wonder Woman: an older actor like Michael Keaton (Vulture) could not bring the boom/energy that we have come to expect from the likes of Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin) and arguably Jamie Foxx (Electro) in the newer Andrew Garfield revision. And finally, the issue of character development... Aunt May was a side dish whereas her considerable acting talents could have played a larger role, and this could be said of other characters. I would have liked to see more time spent on character development and plot than how much time was covered with the academic championship and some of the other less integral scenes in the movie.In summation, this is a good film, but my recommendation to anyone, as my mother would say, is: ""wait until its on DVD"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Oscar Nominations,"I hope that this will be the first Marvel Movie to create history and win some classic Academy Awards for the best picture.

Michael Keaton should win one for best villain since he has made the Vulture come to life for the audience.

Best Spidey to Date,"Spider-Man, at his core, is the original kid superhero. His innocence and naivete are as important as his intellect and wit. After two previous incarnations and five movies, it's this version that finally puts together a truly faithful portrayal of Peter Parker. Fittingly, it took the MCU to do it. Tom Holland eschews the portrayals of his predecessors, and infuses Parker with a genuinely optimistic view of the world, and almost a boy crush on Tony Stark. Peter is awkward, nervous and ambitious, to the point where he nearly wrecks himself in order to show Stark how useful he can be. There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie, be it through Spidey's quips, his amusing interactions with people, or just times where he falls flat while trying to be this great superhero. Peter's classmates get a fair bit more work; this is the most complete Flash ever put to film, and Ned is a perfect best friend for Peter. It's a fast movie as well, and Michael Keaton helps keep that going as the counterbalance, his career renaissance continuing in excellent fashion. Vulture is not the most headline-grabbing Spidey villain, certainly, but neither was Obediah Stane for Iron Man, nor Abomination for Hulk. They worked well because of who portrayed them, and this is another case of that working in the favor of the story. Keaton's motivations are simple, but not the same as a typical villain, which makes him stand out, and potentially shows that the MCU can create guys who are more than one-trick ponies. This movie paces itself well, and just when you think it's safe, it pulls a sharp right on you to bring the final act into focus. There's just enough Tony Stark to bolster the bottom line, without having him take over the film. He's the dad, such as it is, who'd have thought? Iron Man is the interweaving thread in this universe, so it's appropriate he be here, and the aforementioned dad role is amusing and in a way the perfect method to bring Spidey along. Overall, a great time. The stakes aren't as high as they're going to be or have been in MCU movies, but that's okay. Spidey just needs to keep his feet on the ground.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
No. Its not that good movie,"Hi,I was looking forward to see good spiderman movie and good spidy action scenes like in civil war but i was very very disappointed after watching the movie and you will be too. There is no such action scenese. Not much story of villain. No character development. Plot is just OK. When we see first trailer we really believed that there is gonna a big fight in end with iron man in it and tony gonna give peter his suit back but no any such thing happened. and all the spidy & vulture scenes were captured in night (no day light) so you really shouldn't expect much from this movie. Half of the movie they showed only tony stark made new spidy suit features. I guess movie should have been bit more good if there was no tony & his suit. I think in infinity war spidy will swing nicely because of russo bros. Loved his work in civil war.I don't get why such company can't put emotional story line, jaw dropping action scenes, great ending etc in such big movie. and low budget & no experienced staff movies like deadpool getting created very very awesome. I can watch deadpool start to end 5 times more but can't see this crap again. Not going to even download it.No idea how this movie got so many positive reviews.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
No more remakes this should be the new spiderman movie series,"This is one of the best spidermans, way better then the amazing spider 1 and 2 i didn't really like those a whole lot. Tom Holland was amazing as spiderman. I liked that Zendaya was here. I thought there were a lot of suspenseful scenes. Loved the idea of having homecoming for this. Everything came together very well, especially having this be in the marvel universe with the avengers and iron man.

"Not your classic Spider-Man, Not only no spider sense, no sense at all","A warning should have come with this movie. You know, like they have on toys or games. Ages 6 to 14 should have been the warning for this movie. I made a huge mistake buying this movie during Black Friday sale having never seen it. It's going on eBay for sale. Anyone who reads the comics for as long as I have can't possibly like this lame interpretation. This wasn't inexperience, it was bumbling stupidity. Don Adams on the old Get Smart series had more sense. Forget all the political correctness run amok in this movie, how do I cheer for someone this incompetent. I can't believe Sony was okay with Marvel's script. Marvel made Sony's product look silly while promoting arrogant, alcoholic, playboy Tony Stark as a speaker of wisdom (Marvel's product). If you're young, silly, bumbling, inexperienced & incompetent & haven't read the comics, you may be entertained by this, even like it. I noticed the grade on IMDB is dropping fast. Rightfully so. Whose idea was it to have Tom Holland panting & breathing heavy during most scenes when he had to exert some effort? Boy is out of shape. I had heard Michael Keaton gave a great performance. Nope, wrong. It was pedestrian. It may have looked great to some compared to everyone else in this movie. If you can drive a car & read the comics, skip this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good film when....,"What he doesn't know is that for eight years, there has been a supervillain emerging in his town in the form of a wronged construction worker, Adrian (Michael Keaton), who decided to break bad after losing a job to a government crew that clears post- superhero fight disaster areas. Peter, with his true-blue heart and naivete and eagerness to prove himself, of course takes on more than he can handle, while also trying to navigate high school, homework, crushes and the awkwardness of just being a teenager. Time passes easily and just when you might worry that you don't actually care about any of the characters, the story throws a great curveball that carries interest to the end.The film is overflowing with stellar talent, even in the smallest of roles and not counting the Marvel loaners in Robert Downey Jr. (who oozes charisma and charm even when phoning it in for a handful of scenes) and Jon Favreau. In the high school alone, there's the too- cool Michelle (Zendaya), the crush Liz (Laura Harrier) and the adorable breakout best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Hannibal Buress and Martin Starr are there, too, to add reliable laughs. Adrian's bad-guy crew includes Logan Marshall-Green and Michael Cernus. Even Spider-Man's suit has an Oscar winner behind its voice (Jennifer Connelly).Then of course there is Holland, a terrific actor since ""The Impossible,"" who is the perfect amount of empathetic, excitable and clueless to make Peter Parker work now and for years to come. For the most part, ""Homecoming"" is a joy. It's light-hearted, smart, a little meta and the first Marvel film to really consider what it might be like for kids living in a world where superheroes are real.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best live-action Spider-man yet!,"The Good: Okay, let me start by saying that my husband rated this as ""The cheese is strong with this one"". And he's not wrong. It's got its fair share of campiness. Since our hero is 15-ish, he's in high school and you get the typical high school dilemmas (like whether the cute girl will notice our nerdy hero if he uses his alternate identity to smooth the way). High school drama is not my typical movie preference, but it really works well for Peter Parker. It gives him a level of innocence he wears well.This ties into the way Iron Man is inserted into this movie. I found Tony Stark's inclusion to be a good addition, overall, although for someone who isn't familiar with anything Iron Man related, it might be confusing. That might be an issue in several years as parents have kids watch superhero movies out of order, but right now, I don't find a problem with that. So I liked how adding Iron Man (and the Avengers as a whole) to this reality made several details work better than they might otherwise. It played to several different gags, plus gave Spider-man a sort-of mentor figure for him to try to impress or disappoint or just converse with over the course of the film. However, I will admit that I didn't care for Tony Stark's character here all that much. He isn't the star and comes across as a absent, neglectful parent. I mean, it stays true to his character, I think, but I still didn't like him.The villain in this story is probably the best villain in all of Super-hero movies to date and earns this movie an extra star just by itself. Finally a bad guy who isn't just a card-board cut-out ""evil dude"" trying to take over the world (or otherwise be evil for the sake of evil). The bad guy has a story arch that shows a realistic motivation and a descent into evilness that feels genuine. The actor who played him did a great job!The Bad: Probably the one character I didn't care for was Ned, Peter's best friend. He's not from the comics, and was probably created so Spider-man had someone to talk to, but I didn't care for how he constantly pushed Peter to do things he didn't want to. While not intentionally written that way, he came across to me as almost bullying with the level of peer pressure he exerted.Mom View: Overall, I really enjoyed this. If the writers had held back on the language a bit more, I'd have been even happier. As it is, it's probably appropriate for about an 11 year old and up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
an enjoyable rendition that you don't really see coming,"Following his unofficial ""tryouts"" in Germany, Peter Parker returns to his home in Queens trying, albeit not very well, to balance his responsibilities as a high school overachiever with the added dangers of being a crime-fighting superhero. When a new and well-equipped criminal enterprise emerges in New York City, Peter naturally wants to try and end the threat, but quickly gets in over his head--much to the chagrin of reluctant mentor Tony Stark. Despite being the sixth go-round, this is a surprisingly refreshing take on the titular character, wisely sidestepping the origin tale formula, and presenting a unique story with a lighthearted tone, coming-of-age themes, and just enough twists and references to weave it within the greater framework of the burgeoning MCU. Holland is wonderful, bringing a youthful ambition and naiveté that hasn't been seen in previous incarnations of the character, while veteran Keaton is a chilling antagonist. Some of the supporting characters are underused, but this is a nice job overall. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"What Marvel has done with their universe to this point is unprecedented. Nobody could have imagined the MCU would become this large and this popular, nor that two major studios would collaborate with each other. With that said, there's something about it that's starting to feel a little stale. I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming quite a bit, but I would have preferred it to not be as safe as it is.Let's start with the positives. Tom Holland is just about as good of a Spider-Man/Peter Parker as you can ask for. For the first time, it actually feels like Peter Parker is in high school, and not a grown adult playing a high school student. I'm always going to be partial to Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man for nostalgic reasons, and I definitely love Andrew Garfield's portrayal, but Holland is undeniably great as the web slinger. As is most of the cast. Michael Keaton's return to the superhero genre shouldn't be understated. He's so dang good as Vulture to the point where if it wasn't Keaton (or a really good actor), the character would be forgettable. There's a particular scene in the car where he really shines.One of the things that separates this Spider-Man from previous incarnations is the fact that he's in high school, and that particular direction they take does feel refreshing in a sense. I know some people would prefer a Spider-Man who is older and can stand alongside the other Marvel characters with age and maturity, but I think the real charm with Holland is that he's so different from the other MCU characters. Seeing his perspective pitted up against Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark is something to behold. In the same breath, it was nice having a younger and more relatable Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei, at Peter's side.I think where the film starts to get frustrating is that is just feels too safe. When I go back and re-watch Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy or even both of the Garfield films, I feel like they had more of an emotional attachment and connection. I'm not saying this film needed to film yet another heartbreaking Uncle Ben death scene, but I wish I felt more of a connection to the supporting characters. I feel like because Spider-Man is now a part of the MCU, the creativity went out the door a little bit and thus giving us what is essentially the same film as Iron Man, Ant-Man, or Doctor Strange. Of course, all of these movies deal with different characters with different powers, but the approach and execution are pretty much all the same. It's not necessarily a bad thing that MCU is consistent with how they make their movies, but I would like there to be more of an individualized feel to them.I love the fact that Spider-Man is as relatable as he is as a high school kid. I love that they didn't bombard us with Tony Stark and kept his role to a minimum. I love Tomei as Aunt May. I love Jacob Batalon as Ned (Perfect casting!). I love seeing the return of Happy Hogan and Pepper Potts. Heck, I even really like Michael Giacchino's score a whole lot more than I thought. But the one thing I keep coming back to with the MCU is how uninventive the last few films have been. With the exception of the Cap and Avengers films, it feels more like these films exist solely to set up the next one, instead of standing by themselves as singularly great stories. Perhaps that's just my two cents. Hopefully Marvel and Sony can build on what they've started and deliver a great sequel.+Holland is perfect+Good to see him back in high school+Aunt May is always a great complement to Peter+A lot of jokes hit-But some at the wrong time-Lacks uniqueness7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing and Better Than Spider-Man 2,"This movie is amazing and it is most definitely better than the first two spider-man movies made by Sam Raimi, yeah those movies were good but this movie is better, the jokes are great the story is great the characters are great, the villain was good, the action scenes are epic, the story is great , the Jokes are funny and the final fight was great and sorry did I mention the story was amazing? it is definitely my favorite movie of this year, unless Star Wars is amazing and the movie overall is very underrated, you guys might ask why and my answer is that people seem to prefer the first two Spider-Man movies, but for me those movies were good movies but the jokes aren't funny, the second movie's story felt like a Peter Parker movie instead and it should've been less than an hour cause it felt like it was trying to stretch it out but those are just small nitpick of mine and for me the first movie's origin story wasn't very accurate, as a person who read the comics the origin story was more accurate on the first Amazing Spider-Man film, sorry went side track there, so if you like Spider-Man or just Marvel in general go watch this movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I'm not a teen. This movies had plenty of obvious scientific mistakes which are (at least should be) easily recognized by an adult. But I don't think they should stop you from enjoying this fun movie.Probably the BEST movie I have EVER seen for a 13-17 year old kid. If I was 15, I'd fall in love with the movie for sure. It's fun, it's enjoyable to watch, it has great humor, it tries to show Spiderman (or Spiderteen?) dealing with the (very) insignificant teen problems that teens still find significant, and it introduces Spiderman to the MCU as smoothly as possible (was hard to imagine how he would fit in such a world). The main characters are simply amazing. It tries to make a 15-year old imagine ""What if I was to become spiderman?"", and delivers this BRILLIANTLY. Movies have a target audience, and when you walk into this movie you should expect to watch a movie with teen target audience. Don't expect to be mind-browned. Don't expect a complicated scenario. Expect a fun, simple journey of an almost 15-year old geek teen getting super-powers.If I wasn't told this before the movie, maybe I'd be a bit disappointed, and give it a rating of 7/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tom Holland played a good Peter Parker with the nerdy, awkward way and he manifested one of Spider-Man's significant traits: his sense of humor. The movie is full of Easter eggs and references to the comics, the previous Spidey movies, and the MCU as a whole.

The perfect Spider-Man experience,"Let me just say something, Spider-Man homecoming can be described in three words incredible ,funny and smart. It is a breath of fresh air and has unexpected plot twists which are really smart,and the characters are amazing there were well fleshed-out. And I thank God that we have a talented director like John Watts,he cares about making the side characters and the villain interesting which to be honest the MC failed at making me care for the side characters and villains. Speaking of the villain I'm proud to say that Michael Keaton gives on of the best performances I have ever seen doing and one of the best MC villains and one of the best comic-book movie villains. This movie has lower stakes compared to other MC movies but,this is what makes it bolder the many comic-book movies is that it's not afraid to be small-scaled and director John Watts does not compromise the small scale of the movie just for some cheap action scenes with explosions,in conclusion I would like to say that Spider-Man homecoming is the perfect Spider-Man experience and the best Spider-Man movie filled with heart and humor 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not a Marvel Fan, but enjoyed this film","Going into Spiderman: Homecoming, I was very worried for two reasons. One, I still had the terrible taste of The Amazing Spiderman 2 in my mouth making me not particularly excited for ANOTHER Spiderman movie. Two, some would call me a Marvel sceptic. I have never really liked any of their movies with a few exceptions (e.g., Iron Man), and some of the recent films, such as Age of Ultron or Captain America: Civil War, have left me fatigued with the entire superhero genre. Well with those things in mind, I went into Spiderman: Homecoming with very low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, this is still a Disney Marvel superhero movie, so it is not groundbreaking or very original, but it is better than most of Marvel's pervious work.One of the main things I think this movie does well is the depiction of Spiderman. In the film, Peter Parker is a relatable superhero who is still in high school and going through many things normal people went through during adolescence, such as dealing with bulling, trying to ask someone to homecoming, etc. This helped me build a better relationship to Spiderman since I could relate to him, more so than I could to Thor or Captain America. Spiderman acts like how a normal person who just became a superhero would act. He struggles with realistic issues such as keeping secrets from people he cares about, budgeting his time between normal life and fighting crime, and being ignored by someone he looks up to. All of these issues are much more interesting than the issues many other of the characters in the MCU deal with. Another thing that I think makes this film better than its counterparts is the storyline and villain. I am very happy we did not see a third origin story of how he got his powers. The superhero origin story has been beaten to death, so it was a good move to avoid it. Instead of an origin story, Spiderman: Homecoming tells the story of a Spiderman who is struggling to get the attention of the Avengers, a team of individuals he looks up to highly. It also shows Spiderman going up against The Vulture, an Alien removal worker turned illegal arms dealer. The plot is much more interesting and has more depth than other Marvel movies, but still feels generic and safe. All of these elements helped make this film stand out amongst the masses of superhero films being produced today.Of course, just because this film was better than many other superhero movies, it does not mean it doesn't have its flaws. As I mentioned before, the film's plot was very safe and unoriginal. It still felt calculated and created by a board of executives at Disney. It did not have a distinct style like the Sam Raimi Spidermans, and that made for a non-innovative film. Instead, the movie looks like any other of the brightly colored CGI superhero movies being released today. I also felt like the story lacked originality, but at least there weren't any giant blue beams shooting into the sky. It also felt as though many of the characters were high schooler stereotypes, such as MJ, who felt unnecessary in this film. Overall, this film felt safe but somewhat different to the other MCU movies. So, in that regard, it is a great Marvel movie, but in the big picture, it is a decent action/superhero film, nothing more nothing less.The Good
-Relatable main character
-Spiderman faces realistic issues
-Ned is hilarious
-Has some fun momentsThe Bad
-Very safe
-Original for Marvel, unoriginal for cinema
-Stereotypical characters
-Lacking style, both visually and in storytelling",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fifth live-action Spider-Man movie and the first iteration to take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making it the sixteenth film of that mega franchise. On par with popular opinions, I did not like the two Amazing films that much. I do not hate them like many others do, but I felt gone was the heart that existed in the Raimi films. To say this movie came back with just a faint pulse, is an understatement; Spider-Man: Homecoming wears its freaking heart on its sleeves! Back in 2014, Sony and Disney struck a deal to essentially share the character and allow the Web Slinger to be back in Marvel's hands where he belongs. As evidenced prior by Tom Holland's small but fantastic role in Captain America: Civil War, it was a good move. But witnessing Homecoming's excellence reaffirms it is probably the best decision the two companies ever made.I love this movie, it was simply marvelous. The film was funny, heartfelt, emotional and a visual delight. It discards the cynicism and ""grit"" found in the Marc Webb's series, and instead makes Peter Parker, a pure, innocent kid who just wants prove his worth and do the right thing. No more moody, Twilight Peter snooping around saying mean things or being angsty, instead we have a protagonist here that is likable and relatable in a genuine way. It also helps that the high school setting was well utilized with a vibe that is completely different from the previous series, as it takes a more realistic, but cheerful approach to its tone and atmosphere. I really appreciated the diversity amongst the cast, it was beautiful to see representation candidly showcase on screen.Tom Holland was excellent as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, he was funny and witty, but not sarcastic or harsh. Multiple times in the film, Peter is presented a choice to either be a regular kid, stay with his friends and perhaps get the girl or fulfill his duty as a hero and pursue the crime. You can just how torn Holland is with this choice each time through his face. A lesser actor would not have been able to portray this internal conflict this exceedingly well. Michal Keaton as the Vulture was great; he is probably my favorite MCU movie villain thus far, because I bought into his motivation on why he does what he does. I also appreciated they gave him a personal connection to the hero to further the emotional impact. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was very lovely and my eyes were glued whenever she was on screen as her motherly charm and beauty enchanted me to no ends. God she is beautiful. All the kids here actually behave like real kids and they are all hilarious, especially Peter's best friend Ned, played by Jacob Batalon. He was so natural in his performance, watching the two's relationship unfolded almost made me feel like I am part of the group as well.Most people go see a Spider-Man film for its action, and rightfully so, Spider-Man 2 has some of the best action sequences in film history to date. Homecoming is pretty exciting and great to look at, and because I did care for Peter and his friends and wanted them to be okay, the action scenes were suspenseful. However comparing it the previous movies, it definitely lags behind just a little bit. It still is visually stunning, but we just did not get a Doc Ock level of excellence here. We do get a great climatic battle on top of an aircraft that ends on an emotional note. I really appreciate this movie taking a smaller approach and not have the climax be a beam-in-the-sky, end of the world scenario like most other superhero movies nowadays. Because it just gets played out, we know the world is not going to end, so unless it really is the last film of a franchise, why keep doing it? It is nice to see the filmmaker's objective here is to display the emotions of the characters and not just trying to one-up the explosions from last big blockbuster.Homecoming is probably the heartiest MCU film to date. I am big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I have seen all sixteen films multiple times. There is one common problem amongst each movie and that is the disservice of dramatic scenes by injecting humor into them at the wrong moments; my emotionally connection with the film is greatly weakened because of this. I think the only movie that successfully avoided this tonal problem in my opinion was Ant-Man and the first Iron Man. You can now add Spider-Man: Homecoming to that list because this movie juggles the balance between humor and drama perfectly. Using the natural charm of the cast, the jokes land on target at the correct moments when they are supposed to, and because of good character development, the dramatic scenes also flourishes in genuine fashion since they are not diffused by humor.Overall Spider-Man: Homecoming is now my second favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and probably my third favorite Spider-Man movie behind the second and first one. I am glad to see it correct many of the tonal problems I had with previous movies like Doctor Strange and Amazing Spider-Man 2. Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions. No matter what happens in this universe moving forward, it will always be smaller movies like this and Ant-Man that will have the biggest impact on me because they understand it is not about the punch, but the emotion behind the punch that matters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Strong Start,"Starting off Tom Holland's trilogy, Spider-Man: Homecoming explores the Web-Slinger's journey through the MCU. Fresh from the Avenger's Civil War, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns to his life in NYC. Growing tired of simple crime-fighting, he begins investigating a mysterious arms business around the city. After getting into trouble, Parker is warned by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to let the pros handle dangerous cases such as this one. Adamant to prove himself, Peter pushes his limits and dives headfirst into the case, but quickly finds himself up against the cunning plotting of the Vulture (Michael Keaton).Adapting a younger take on Spider-Man, Holland does an excellent job of encapsulating a youthful and excited newbie hero. Like most teenagers, he balances a realistic struggle with immaturity but manages to maintain his heroic responsibility throughout. Though I am not a huge fan of Holland in the role, he seems to be having a ton of fun, and that radiates to the audience experience. The rest of the supporting cast is on par with me not loving them, but having fun watching their performances.The MCU's rich history adds a unique atmosphere to the story that previous iterations unfortunately missed out on. Landing in the midst of an ongoing saga, partnering Pete with Stark starts off as a creative idea, albeit ends up far too played out. The mentorship path both adds an interesting aspect to Spider-Man, while simultaneously taking away from his growth.As the start of a trilogy, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun and exciting beginning to a new Spidey story. Without the knowledge of the rest of the series, this is an admirable beginning and opened a lot of interesting doors. Though the story of Spider-Man has been told many times before, Homecoming finds ways for it to feel fresh and new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This was TRULY amazing!,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMMING I was very excited about this movie. I'm a big fan of spider-man in general, i'm a big fan of Tom Holland and i'm a big fan of the MCU in hole. So did ""Spider-Man: Homecomming"" deliver? Yes it did! This movie is in my opinion one of the best the MCU has delivered so far. It's a movie filled with heart, excitement and joy. Tom Holland shines in this role and portrays the struggle of living the life of Peter Parker in a very believable way. He becomes one of the best parts of the film. A issue in most Marvel films is the villain and Vulture (Michael Keaton) is by no means a perfect villain but i think he still is one of the better we have seen in the MCU. It also helps that Vulture is played by such a great actor like Michael Keaton. The story in this film is great. It's a near perfect blend of a teen comedy like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and a superhero film. This dynamic makes for a film that is so entertaining and heartfelt that you can't help but love it! 9/10⭐️",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Heart-warming and endearing reboot but one for the teenagers...,"Okay, we've had Spiderman for many years in many formats. The Saturday morning cartoon shows in various formats, the old 70s show, the various films and so on. So we all love Spidey yet with all the recent comic book successes Spidey has been usurped by some of his compatriots like Iron Man. The Andrew Garfield movies despite various good points just didn't make an impact, but this reboot might just do it.Based on the Ultimate Spiderman series, thankfully we don't have an umpteenth repeat of the same old origins story, but this restart is wrapped up in the MCU world. Our teenage Spidey has growing pains with bullies and girls, and we see him having to take on the might of a mega-villain with superior weaponry, in this case a wonderful show stealing performance by Michael Keaton.The acting is fine, the action great and it's all a bit more down to earth. Thankfully none of that great big being with lighting striking the sky big battles, but little heroes and villains.I kind of liked it, but really maybe I'm a little old for some of it. It really will hit the mark for teenagers and older geeks, which I'm neither. The wise cracking get's flogged to death. It can work in a comic or cartoon, but the length of a long movie? They could have stepped back. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May is fabulous, and a favourite for the older viewers.This is a bit of a sidewards movie in the MCU universe films, and it's fine. It will definitely find a market as it's unoffensive and enjoyable just not for me. Still, as said, it's fun and pays homage to its forebears.

Perfekt friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,"So for context I did watch many Marvel Movies out of succession, which means I saw all Avengers Movies and even the next Spider-Man before this one. And that means, you guessed it: I was already 100% sold on Tom Holland.I actually very much enjoyed Tobey Maguire and even Andrew Garfields Version of Spider-Man. They all brought him to life in their own way and got many parts right but I just love the energy that Tom Holland brings to these movies. He is so inquisitive, nerdy yet polite and pretty much a regular teenager that tries the best he can. He is indeed jumpy and that's what I hear people complain about him but for me it's his positive aura and outlook on things even if he overdoes it.To his defense: He was called to one of the coolest battles with Iron Man against Captain America and between the other avengers who wouldn't be dissapointed if that was already it. So of course he tries everything he can to get back into the more exciting stuff but still he gives his best to help out where he can being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.There are some heartfelt moments too, quite a lot actually and the bad guy is actually just a pretty regular guy who felt betrayed by the big shots and tries to fly under the radar doing the best he can to keep him and his workers employed. Vulture rocks and his actor is a great asset and his scenes together with Spider-Man towards the end are awesome. I don't wanna spoil anything but the ""car-szene"" is just extremely intense so props for that.To summarize I feel that this was the perfect starting and groing point for the new Spider-Man story after the origin. Yeah it's a little heavy on the tech but in a world where you got Tony Stark creating crazy stuff left, right and center who wouldn't wanna little help starting off ?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The worst Attempt at spiderman,"This has got to be The worst attempt at spiderman I've ever seen..I am stunned that people are giving it 10 star reviews as i would barely give it a 3..The character and writing came across as childish and silly..I could barely sit through the the whole shaky cam portion..I really miss Tobeys spiderman as there is no comparison between say spiderman 2 with Doc Oct ,the cinematography and script blow this movie out of the water.. Even the Amazing spiderman guy was light years better at nailing the character..I didn't care for this new guy in Civil War, but that movie was soo good in all other respects that even with this goofy spiderman in the silly suit, the movie pretty much carried him and totally eclipsed his minor role..But in this movie, where everything centers around the new guy, for me it just falls apart..the humor attempts are too forced and the suit design is a big step backwards from the originals.. and wayy too gimmicky... I hope they cast a new actor to do the role for future movies..for now , i will need to re watch some of the older originals just to wash this one from my memory..",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman under the shadow of ironman,"First things first, Tobey maguire will always be my favorite spidey and sam raimi's spiderman trilogy are my favorite superhero films. Due to which, I couldn't accept andrew garfield as spiderman. But I enjoyed tom holland's cameo in civil war, so I was looking forward for homecoming.
Homecoming is given a complete reboot. It doesn't focus on peter's origins and uncle ben stuff. Peter is a high school kid. Aunt may is a hot spinster and tony stark is his his mentor. After the airport battle in civil war, peter is waiting for tony stark's call on next mission. But tony instructs him to be only a friendly neighborhood spiderman. Adrian toomes known as the vulture is planning to steal essential weapons of stark tech. How peter stops him and impress stark is the rest of the film.
Tom holland fits perfectly as peter and spidey. In comics, peter was a high school kid and holland looks exactly like a teenager. His friendship with jacob battalon was a treat to watch. Michael keaton was impressive as vulture and his scene of threatening peter was worth mentioning. The typical humor in mcu films is abundant. Robert downey jr as usual was a treat in his extended cameo of tony stark. But we got to see less of action in him. The scene where peter tries to lift the wall rock gives goosebumps.
But i have three issues with the movie. First is peter's intentions. In original spiderman, peter's motive was with great power comes great responsibility. Whereas in homecoming, peter does stuff only to impress tony stark and join avengers. Second the film lacks emotions. Mcu films have comedy but also enough emotions too. Third is the unexciting action sequences which were mostly childish. Amazing spiderman series had much cool action scenes.
For 90s and early 2000s kids spiderman will be tobey maguire but for 2010s kids spiderman will be tom holland. In that case homecoming succeeds. But can't digest him being too dependent on stark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not the best Spiderman movie..,"This particular Spiderman movie is definitely not the best of the lot. The movie is a fairly good movie with all the right amounts of humour, action and explosions, but still fails in terms of the story and character development.Things I did not like were how they have reduced Peter Parker to be like a sidekick to Iron Man. Spiderman's greatest strength was his intellect, and this film does not justify it. The villain is not imposing enough and I was feeling as if the film was portrayed as a teen flick.The actors have done a good job but with a little bit of more character in the story line, this would have been a much better movie. I still think Sam Raimi's Spiderman was the best of the lot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A fresh take on a well known character that sacrifices the amazingness for a honeyed story.,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is entertaining, but lacks spectacularity and bets for a more nonchalant approach, relying on cheesy humour and a plot built around too many coincidences.

"Overrated, Boring, Unfunny, Annoying Lead Actor, Nothing Works for an Adult","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult.

I wasn't ready for another Spiderman reboot but this blew me away!,"I was a bit over Spiderman but my son lent me Spider-Man:Homecoming and Captain America: Civil War on Blu-ray. I was blown away by the new younger Spiderman, the blockbuster action and the special affects. A fast paced storyline with plenty of action and humour. I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as the somewhat evil yet sympathetic villain. Tom Holland brought a new freshness to the character of Spider-Man. I love Marisa Tomei but why did they make her look a lot hotter in Captain America: Civil War and then toned down her looks in Spider-Man: Homecoming?A very enjoyable and entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spidey's back and he's doing pretty good!,"After re-watching Spider-Man 2 after 4 years I realised that it was actually pretty good and that it was Spider-Man 3 that got me confused and made me think that both of them sucked so going in to watching this I really hoped Marvel didn't bastardise Spidey again like they did with The Amazing Spider-Man movies. And, it's pretty great! It feels more like a cartoon so it really fits well with Spider-Man's character, Tom Holland as Peter Parker is incredible, and the movie is extremely funny. Tony Stark (Iron-Man) as Spidey's, sort of, mentor is great. I've always liked Robert Downey Jr as Iron-Man so him teaching SPIDER-MAN of all people is just, just...AMAZING! Peter Parker's friend, Ned, is the best comic relief character in any movie to date because he's ACTUALLY FUNNY. I was a little disappointed after watching because I thought it would live up to the 9.2/10 Rotten Tomatoes gave it, but after re-watching it, hot damn, this movie is great and you should watch it now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Loved this,"I thought that this movie was great! In my view, Tom Holland was easily the best Spider-Man marvel have had so far. Personally, it's my favourite out of the Spider-Man films marvel have made.I thought the story line was great and Tom Holland was a convincible character and you could believe that he was a teenager, rather than some of the other Spider-Man's that didn't necessarily look the part as they looked older than what they were supposed to be. Definitely, some of the other Spider-Man's played were amazing. Let's take Toby Maguire for example. He was flawless but in my eyes, so was Tom Holland.The story line was advanced and well thought out. It was very funny and comical. In most of the Spider-Man movies, they didn't really advance on the fact that they were high school students. Spider-Man homecoming did show how Spider-Man was leading a double life and how it was difficult to keep his identity a secret.I think overall this movie was my favourite Spider-Man movie yet. I did expect a lot of it and it definitely didn't let me down. I don't think marvel would ever miss an opportunity to impress us and they did it again with Spider-Man homecoming. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest watching it. It's something I rushed to watch again and no matter how many times I watched it, there was nothing that let me down!Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The most faithful Spider-Man movie adaptation,"The latest Spider-Man movie did not surprise me at all. Just like all the superhero movies ever released, it follows the same old directions. I get that having the same structure is what makes them work and be liked, but after some time we just end up getting tired of it. And in the case of Homecoming, we were given a third version of the same story. I mean, I like Spidey and all, and don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but I just feel like Marvel could have invested their time and money on bringing a different character from the comics to the big screen.Okay, now that I got that out of my chest, I'll start talking about the movie. Like many of us know, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and gained spider-like powers. However, unlike the first Spider-Man trilogy, this movie doesn't focus on the development of these powers. It's mainly about Peter struggling to find his way as a teenager as well as a superhero. Something that I really liked was that Marvel cast appropriate actors to bring the characters to life. Unlike the other trilogies, this time we don't have 30-year-olds playing 17-year-olds. The cast is also very diverse, perhaps the most diverse cast Marvel has ever had until now. Kudos to that! Tom Holland's acting amazed me. I wasn't sure about him at first, but he certainly did a great job. His performance was remarkable, I mean, not Oscar-worthy, but for a superhero movie, it was more than enough. Peter was very likable and often relatable. Perhaps because the actors were younger, they were more convincing. Therefore, Homecoming was the most faithful adaptation from the original Spider-Man comic books.I don't remember much about the soundtrack or visual effects because, for me, it's not something that stands out, it's only OK. What captured my attention and kept me interest was the humor. Classic Marvel humor, if you ask me, but very effective. A little bit forced sometimes, but it's something you can choose to ignore, because it's better to have too much humor rather than none.Something important that I would like to add is that before I watched the movie I had formed an opinion based on the trailers and the posters: I thought this was going to be Iron Man 4, because Tony Stark was appearing too much. It's really different when you watch the movie. He has an important role in Peter's life, of course, but his screen time was basically what was shown in the trailers. Phew! So, if maybe this was a reason that was keeping you from watching Homecoming, I can say that you're good to go.Overall, it's a good, interesting movie. It's light and well-made, however it's not the kind of movie you want to watch over and over again because it's so good. I would recommend you to watch it with friends on movie night, if you do that kind of stuff. It will make you laugh – and, if you're very sensitive like me, you may shed a tear or two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's a movie for teenagers...,"If you're 12 or 13 years old then you're going to love this movie, but it doesn't feel like a Spiderman movie.I understand that the producers didn't want to tell the audience the origin story which has been told ad nauseam! However, it's still an important part of Spiderman's personality. WE NEED AN ORIGIN STORY and it doesn't need to be Uncle Ben getting shot or his famous line: ""with great power comes great responsibility"". I, for one, would have liked to have known how Peter Parker came onto Tony Stark's radar. Why would a billionaire with enough super suits to conquer a country need a fourteen-year-old boy or risk getting him killed in combat against seasoned soldiers? Right there is your origin story. All the other Marvel superheroes had their origin story by Spiderman/boy didn't.Don't get me wrong. I loved watching this film and it gave me great laughs during the comedic scenes but....... I was left with no idea as to what motivates him to want to fight crime. In this version, we just get a kid who's barely out of puberty and whose sole purpose is to please Tony Stark. The high-tech suit which was given to him was cool but it diverts attention from Spiderman's acrobatic abilities. There is too much dependence on technology and not enough on his resourcefulness. In other words, Tony Stark appears too much in this movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I recommend gently,"Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. Star in this 2017 action film based on the Marvel Comics. This picks up not long after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and Peter Parker (Holland) is starting to get the feel as web-slinging vigilante, Spider-Man. Downey Jr. Reprises his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man who is sort of a mentor to him and he tests Peter's determination to become a superhero. Soon, Peter discovers that there's hi-tech weapons being sold on the streets by salvager, Adrian Toomes (Keaton) who takes the guise of Vulture and he tries to stop him. Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) plays Peter's Aunt, May, Jon Favreau, Chris Evans and Gwyneth Paltrow also reprise their roles from ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America"" & ""The Avengers."" Creator, Stan Lee also makes an amusing cameo as usual. This is a great Spider-Man film, Holland gives the best portrayal of the character so far in my opinion, Keaton is great as usual and the rest of the cast is also good. I recommend this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spectacularly funny and definitely above your average superhero movie,"The movie straight out blew my breath away, yes I'll admit my expectation weren't high, with the 5 other average Spider-man films that came before this, I wasn't expecting anything different then interactions with the avengers.(1). Let me first start off with the beginning of the film. I think the reason that this movie was so amazing was that the fact that a lot of young teenagers could relate to being Peter Parker, the writers made an excellent choice of choosing a young Peter, this made the movie so much easier to relate to, they showed real social problems concerning the lives of high schoolers at the same time making it a little more dramatic and adding humour which probably made this movie one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, and let me tell that I've seen almost every single live action superhero adaption ever.(2). Second off was the fact that this wasn't one of the (whole world is ending, lets save it) clichés. In my personal opinion I'm tired and sick of these because they are getting way to unbearable to watch. Which Batman V Superman showed us. Anyways I loved how they kept the movie realistic ( I know I sound so Ironic right now ) in Peter having his limits of being Spider-man, they kept real as in Peter had to worry about being a student while at the same time protecting his neighborhood, and at the same time his hero level.(3). Third off the best part of the movie was the Humour. This wasn't little kids funny jokes humour, like I said before the writers made the movie easy to relate to for students, so the jokes were definitely above little kids humour, Id say around Community kind, which is the best. The jokes weren't lame like in The amazing Spider-man so I don't know a great to explain the jokes and the type of humour is the review so all I can say is go watch the movie yourself. I assure you will not be disappointed.(4). Fourthly and lastly Thank you SONY for giving my favorite superhero back to the rightful owners and not trying to screw it up, by making a third reboot with your company only. One of the big differences from the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movies was that it didn't revolve around LOVE the whole time. That was the one thing I couldn't bear, yes I think that romance definitely plays a big role in all movies, but the ones with Maguire only revolved around that, so I just couldn't put up with them. Anyways Homecoming keeps all the action, humour and romance balanced which is all thanks to Jon Watts I truly believe they picked the right director for the 3rd reboot of the Spider-man film. He was able to balance everything so that they fit in perfectly with everything else, like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm not even going to start with Andrew Garfield, I mean they should've stopped after the first movies.Anyways I highly recommend that you watch this in theaters because it just makes the experience so much better.Honestly for me this is one of the best superhero movies that's ever came out, I believe that MARVEL can now go for with Spider-man and not to mention the amazing acting from Tom Holland he nailed his role perfectly that all I can sayAnyways stop reading this and go watch it if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A breakup of heroes clichés,"""Spider-Man: Back Home"" does not disappoint, in a movie market that goes on to make up to 7 superhero movies a year, the return of the neighborhood friend is exciting, this excitement is mainly due to the fact that the film does not sin, it comes to enchant, but we have some small ruptures and the return of a hero that we all love, The small first rupture occurs in the structure of the script, because it is not a film of origin, is a film where already we have a Peter Parker established and (without a mega villain, another small break) the script takes concepts created in the world of the avengers and uses them, it enhances the world of the avengers and makes everything bigger and incredible it seems, more realistic. The film has a good direction, good editing, good sound editing, cool effects, and a great soundtrack, nothing here is exquisite, but it's a very competent direction. Tom does very well, the boy really enchants like Spider-Man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Spidey movie we all deserve,"The relationship between Sony and Marvel fans is a love-hate relationship. The Raimi trilogy is a love letter to all Marvel fans, but the Webb duo-logy is like a slap- in- your-face breakup scene mostly found in your typical romantic TV series.Now with Spidey's coming home to MCU, and Sony now collaborating with Marvel Studios, seems like this movie is a apology letter to all Marvel fans. But after dozens of trailers that was said to ""give away nearly everything"" (thank goodness I avoided it), and many TV spots, does this movie deliver what it should be?The answer: YES they delivered.Spider-Man Homecoming is easily one of the best MCU movies to date, and the best Spiderman movie in a very long time. At last, finally, our friendly neighborhood superhero has received a good movie of his own, and he deserves it.Tom Holland was born to be Spider- Man. He was very very good in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is also very good in this movie, he's like the Uncle Ben of the MCU. Also, he's not in every scene, probably had the least screen time of all the main stars in this movie (Nope, this is not Iron Man 4 ft. Spider-Man, it's the opposite). Marisa Tomei as Aunt May is also really good in this movie, and she's not acting sexy and anything, she's just a normal, everyday woman. The guy who play Ned is a great comic relief, and Liz who is Peter's crush is also really good in this movie. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is one of the best MCU villains so far (on par with The Winter Soldier). He has more depth than I thought. At battle he's merciless, ambitious guy, but when he's not the Vulture, he's a hardworking, normal, everyday guy, and that gives us more sympathy to him. The biggest surprise in this movie is Jon Favreau as Tony's bodyguard. His role is much more expanded in this movie and he did a great job. Pepper Potts is back, and despite brief it's such a great moment in this movie, and it's good to have her back, even for just a minute or so screen time. Chris Evans as Captain America is one of my favorites in this movie, and probably one of his best on screen appearance in a MCU movie so far.The story of the movie is much more light-hearted than most MCU movies right now, plus the exploration about Spidey's journey when he's in high-school (not just glimpses when he's in high-school, a mistake in The Webb duo-logy) makes it more interesting, in fact almost all the scenes in this movie is school related, and that's great. The action scenes is not as explosive as most MCU finale acts, but that's okay considering the light-hearted tone. The twist in the end is amazingly executed. The editing is also amazing, it's funny when it tries to be funny, and tense when it tries to be tense. In fact there's a scene between Holland and Keaton where I had chills on my spine because how intense it is.However, there's some things in this movie that bugged me. One, there's a lot of penis jokes and adult jokes in this movie. Is it too much? For this kind of movie it seems pretty inappropriate.Two, The side characters are ""useless"", Ned in particular. He's mostly the thing that hinders Spider-Man for his goal in this movie, to capture this particular guy (Keaton). Most of the time he screw up Peter's attempt to hide his identity, and that became repetitive and that just won't work. Even times when he's shown to be useful, he's only useful for about 5 minutes. The screenwriters should add more to his character. It's not Spider-Man and his ""useless"" friends, Spidey is human, he still needs help from his friends. There's also this Michelle character who's just a stalker like character that's kinda creepy actually, and the bully guy who makes penis jokes makes me want to yell: enough already!Three, there's no real tension in this movie. There's no life-or- death threat that many lives at stake thing. All this movie has is Spidey trying to capture Keaton's character, and that's it. There's no real danger for everyone in the city, and that disappoints me.Four, I don't know if it's just me, but this movie has the worst credits sequences of all the MCU. In ""The Winter Soldier"", the credits sequence is visually pleasing along with an amazing soundtrack by Henry Jackman. How about in ""Thor: The Dark World"" where the credits sequence is a handmade painting-like sequences, with a amazing score by Brian Tyler. Or take a look at MCU's latest example: ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". That movie has a visually impressive opening scenes, along with fourth wall breaking, and a song that's actually really good. In this movie, despite it's visually pleasing, it is accompanied by a very bad, horrible music. It's just really bad to me. The movie seemed rushed so that they had no time to make the credits sequence more ""tidy"" IMO.The last but not the least, is that's there's. so. much. product placements. Sony and Marvel probably working together with a condition that there will be no more Sony product placements, but Sony still wants to do it. So, who you gonna call? Audi! That's right! When Sony can no longer do it, let Audi do the work for you!! Yaaaayyy!!! (?)But overall, this is the Spider-Man movie we all wanted to see, and Jon Watts and his crew delivered what's promised. It's not perfect, but it's definitely Sony's best attempt so far. Hands down, the best Spidey movie yet.Now let's just hope Sony don't screw up Venom...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Spiderman, Spiderman, comes home like a spider can","Now what can I say it is the Marvel Most Moderate Spiderman movie of all, with a big ethnic different cast and I know it sounds weird because I'm a foreigner myself a bit too much. It's one of the few MCU movies that can not stand on its own, but in a few places it has too many jokes, but at least it's really funny. Spiderman Homecoming is absolutely awesome, super fun exciting and has every five minutes any things that tickle your nerves and bring your feelings to light. I also find the new style that the films take with the modernization of the optical look and, above all, the size of the film is very appealing. The old Spiderman movies by Sam Remmi will always have a special place in my heart but these are films for other times. In addition, this movie contains in what most films, not superhero films but most of the films are missing in all danger. The danger of failing to be humbled the danger etc. Rarely have I really had the feeling that the characters in a movie are in danger this film shows us the danger and delivers it to us correctly and that's best because we can take the danger seriously. Tom Holland is awesome and Michael Keaton ages like good wine. But though I like all the characters, Peter's best friend is a bit strange it does not quite fit in with the world of Spiderman. The character of Michelle (MJ) got on my nerves so hard I can put it into words like is a Lisa Simpson 2.0 and it's always a downer it's unbelievable, the pacing and up movies is just in a nutshell and it is wonderful. But why are the 50s high school drama aspects repeating? Why do all the battles take place at night? And what does the police actually film in the superheroes?The fights are super uninteresting and repeat in their moves again and again, the direction of the action is directly on MTV quality and this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the MCU. Call it ""Peter Parker: Iron Man Jr."" What the movie does best .... It's just that it was a remake, tribute, reissue or adaptation. 1. Enough nostalgia references for the old fans. 2. create enough own for the new fans. 3. enough explanations for those who have no idea but want to know why it works and 4. The most important!

"Characters with a little depth, acting of a high order","To see the number of one out ten's here, you'd think this was a total flop, on the contrary, it's a triumph! Far too many Marvel films have action without significance, main characters as shallow as a half-completed spiders web, here we have a baddie beautifully played by Michael Keaton as Vulture, who successfully tries to create a rounded character with a moral purpose, bemoaning little people like him stuffed by the elite, like latter-day midgets from Swift's brilliant satire Gullivers Travels. Swift said he wrote his book 'to vex the world rather than divert it'. We're vexed enough at the moment, this Spider-Man movie was an excellent diversion.Laura Harrier's Liz was angelic, having shown a brilliant grasp of general knowledge as a top quizzer, she might have had an inkling about her fathers real business interests, that was sadly never hinted at.Tom Holland was great as Peter Parker, he didn't have to pick a peck of pickled peppers, he showed resilience, resourcefulness and - most importantly - youthful anxiety and vulnerability.For demanding aficionados of the franchise, it may not have gelled with their previous perceptions, but a good movie ends with the audience asking 'and then what?'There were no obvious allegorical or metaphorical references to contemporary society, no delusional, power-hungry president with access to the nuclear codes, this was, nevertheless, a feelgood movie, rather better than the goodfeel adolescent films we've become used to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

And now, certified fresh from Rotten Tomatoes, Tom Holland is the new friendly neighborhood Spider-Man in Homecoming. Dealing with a threat bigger and badder than ever. Michael Keaton does an incredible job portraying a mechanical flying bird stealing from none other than Tony Stark and the Avengers. Let's rewind a bit, we were introduced to Spider-Man towards the middle of Captain America: Civil War when a battle was looming between the Avengers and the Captain and his team because of a threat to expose the existence of the superheroes for what they truly are. Now let's come back to this movie, leading an all-star cast Tom Holland is the new face of the web-slinging, crime fighting superhero who has to come to terms of his identity and how to save humanity and New York City. I wonder what's going to happen next in the new chapter of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but not great","Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) is entertaining, but not great, as a Spider-Man movie.I liked that the movie had som funny moments, good action, and not bad CGI. It was never boring. But I have to say I am not a fan of his suit. It's like the opposite of who Spider-Man is. Spider-Man is Spider-Man because he got his DNA changed which led to getting superpowers. The ideal Spider-Man, in my opinion, chooses to be a part of the responsibility of making the world a better place by using his creativity with only his mind, webs, climbing and athletic skills - not other's technology, which is a disappointing start. After all, I'm trying to accept this, because there are different ideals of who Spider-Man really is.This movie is recommending as a popcorn movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Don't do anything I would do, and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do""","This alternate look on Spider-Man's character in the MCU is pretty controversial...

I don't mind it, I find it fresh to see a new personality to Peter that still has hints of the comics in them. There's plenty to enjoy in terms of how the mcu has slightly changed the classic characters we love and cherish. I do also think it's good how they presented teenagers as well, teenagers, instead of the ol' ""sterotypical"" teenagers.Comedy is may get a bit bland after re-watching the movie a couple times, but it's still overall pretty good.

Spider-Man: Homecoming is the Casino Royale of superhero films,"There, I said it.Played by British actor Tom Holland (The Impossible), Spidey gets a fun and completely fresh reinvention from new director Jon Watts and studio boss Kevin Feige – with a little help from Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark/ Iron Man, Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan and newcomer Jacob Batalon as Ned.Like Daniel Craig's revision of James Bond, Holland's interpretation of Spider-Man has set the hero down an invigorating new path.After a failed reboot with actor Andrew Garfield and director Marc Webb – 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man and 2014's The Amazing Spider- Man 2 – Sony, the studio that owns the rights to the Marvel character, wisely decided to let Marvel Studios take creative control of the wall- crawler and add him to the MCU.Now, he gets to interact with Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers.Following the character's introduction in an epic airport battle sequence in last year's Captain America: Civil War, Homecoming picks up with a teen aged Peter Parker back in his Queens, N.Y., neighborhood living with Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) left to fight street-level crime with a cool new suit (courtesy of Tony, naturally). ""We'll call you,"" Tony tells Peter as he's dropping him back home.Eager to prove his mettle as a full-time member of the Avengers, Peter thirsts for action, taking down bike thieves, helping the elderly with directions and tackling hoodlums like Aaron (Donald Glover). Still, he wants more.But then he crosses paths with Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes (a.k.a. the Vulture) and his merry band of baddies, and decides to do something about it. It's not that Tony doesn't care; it's that Tony is too busy. And Peter sees it as an express pass to becoming an Avenger.Oh yeah, and he's still in high school dealing with crushes, girls, science class, gym and detention (the film completely skips his origin story including the spider bite and Uncle Ben).It's not only the best Spider-Man movie – it's one of the best films in Marvel's cinematic universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What happens in this movie again?,"After watching this movie once I have no intention of watching it again.

Definitely an over-rated Spiderman movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man comes home!,"More than a mere reboot, Marvel Studios have begun building Spider-Man from the ground up - starting completely from scratch! This breath of fresh air casts aside the now stale formula that began well with Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" 1, before being bleakly retooled for Webb's failed ""Amazing"" franchise.Marvel showcase their talents as masters of adaptation by drawing from the deep and rich source material from Stan Lee & Steve Ditko's run.Although not 100% accurate on the surface, every creative decision made delivers the contemporary, authentic, spirit of a young, well-meaning teenager struggling through high school, who is constantly faced with tough choices which come to define his character.The film doesn't rely on the exhausted trope of the romantic sub-plot or the love interest in peril. It doesn't need to shuffle years of comic book chronology to bring in eventual mainstays like Mary Jane or the Stacey's or the Osborn's. We have Ned Leeds, we have Liz, we have Betty and we have the Vulture and the Tinkerer (both debuted in Spidey's 2nd issue).This is that relatable, young every-man that we know Spidey to be. Tom Holland perfectly portrays the character and is well supported by the comedic tone which finally gets the humour right.Michael Keaton delivers an amazing performance, giving us a layered villain and the supporting cast bounce off one another in the best way - everyone shines.The stakes are smaller because now we're back with the inexperienced hero finding his way, just like those early books. The friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. Yet somehow the action is all the more threatening for it. This is because Spider-Man and his escapades are now relative to the other giants within the MCU, he really is just a kid and thus every threat is all the more dangerous.I feel like the reason a few people appear to be disappointed, is because at this stage they want the high stakes, the city/ world wide threat, they want Spider-Man in his prime. Before we get there we need the set up and this is the perfect set up. Give it time. There's even more from those early years to come.Also, the opening felt a little fast and perhaps one or two more emotional moments could have been drawn out slightly. Just slightly. But it's integrated into the MCU seamlessly.Some of the powerful moments in the film are pulled straight from the comics, including perhaps the most iconic Spider-Man moment of all time. I won't spoil it, but my jaw hit the floor, I teared up, it was perfect.This film holds some genuine surprises. It thrills. It's buckets of fun!Marvel show us that not every film in its tapestry has to be the best standalone film, as long as it's the best film about that character. You'll soon see why you can't really have one Marvel property exist without the other.Enjoy Spider-Man as you've never seen him before, because this really is the first time we get to meet him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Spider-Man movie audiences deserved, and the MCU needed.","Spider-Man: Homecoming was the Spider-Man movie audiences deserved, and the MCU needed. It is a refreshing take on the iconic character that audiences have grown so fond of, and is so elegantly executed in every aspect of the film. Tom Holland is Spider-Man, and the best on screen adaptation of the character to date, and his enthusiasm for the character can be see throughout his performance. Michael Keaton was a fantastic villain, and one of the best the MCU has seen, as he is humanized to the point where the audience both fears and understands him. The writing in this film is fantastic, the characters are phenomenal, and Spider-Man: Homecoming is one of (if not) the best MCU films to date.

A great Marvel film... but a so-so Spider-Man movie,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" occupies an interesting spot in the movie landscape. It's the 16th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the grand experiment of interconnected movies involving Marvel's different superheroes. Unlike his heroic counterparts, however, whose only modern blockbuster films have existed within this universe, this is the web-slinger's third different big-screen iteration in recent memory. Although a solid entry in the MCU, it's when I try to reconcile it with the Spider-Man movies that have come before, such as the Sam Raimi directed ""Spider-Man"" films or the more recent ""Into the Spider-Verse,"" that ""Homecoming"" starts to falter a bit more.Most of what works for ""Homecoming"" is that it adheres pretty closely to the proven Marvel formula for success. The focus is on its characters and tone. The characters are instantly likable and relatable. They ground us to the setting, which, in this case, features daily high school life as prominently as it does superheroics. This is a superhero movie in the vein of John Hughes. These aspects are bolstered by a great sense of humor throughout. Fortunately (in the sense that this is a more recent trend in Marvel movies), there is a great antagonist for our hero to go up against, and the whole conflict is accentuated really well by some genuinely surprising twists. Surprisingly, the action does not feel up to snuff for the kind of stuff Marvel usually churns out, with the climactic third-act showdown in particular feeling pretty muddled and unchoreogrpahed. As a film, there is nothing particularly outstanding about the shots and direction in general.The best thing this film offers is a fresh perspective in relation to the rest of the universe. This is not a film about a billionaire genius, legendary super-soldier, or literal alien god, but rather more relatable, ""everyman"" characters who are making sense of living in a world occupied by those titans. This works especially well for our hero and villain, with Peter Parker desperately wanting to live up to this monumental legacy, while Adrian Toomes rises up in villainy because he feels the threat that such beings pose to regular folks like himself.This perspective also proves to be a double-edged sword however, and the film's fatal flaw, at least if you are looking at the spirit of the ""Spider-Man"" character. It almost feels as if the film goes too small. Gone is the cinematic grandiosity that had become commonplace with Spider-Man films, no shots where we follow Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York. Similarly, Peter Parker being an ""aww shucks"" type of character whose main motivation is to become an Avenger feels like a reduction of the three-dimensionality that usually makes his character so special. That arc is explored and resolved in a satisfying way. My point is that it feels like an inconsequential story for a character whose very origin involved learning that his choices have life or death consequences.For these reasons, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" walks a strange line. It's a better Marvel movie than it is a ""Spider-Man"" one. With its sequel, ""Far From Home,"" due to release in just a few days, and a likely continued and prosperous series beyond that, I can only hope that this iteration of the character can learn to walk that line a little more evenly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More than a great Marvel,"I'd pretty much given up on the Spider-Man franchise, after the first two reboots, which I felt were predictable and hokey, with lame effects. Thankfully, ""Homecoming"" really delivers where the others missed the mark. This is a fun film, and feels like it fits right in with the new Avengers universe.Somewhere along the way (""Ant Man"" or ""Deadpool""?) it dawned Marvel that humour was key to buttressing the somewhat shallow superhero-villain formula. And this script is full of witty dialogue and deftly timed comedic moments.It also helps that Tom Holland has the perfect blend of cocky naïveté and charm to make him real and relatable. Neither Toby Maguire nor Andrew Garfield felt believable in the role, although to be fair, they didn't have a script this good and effects have come a long way. It's also good to see quality actors like Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover bringing an authenticity and complexity to roles that are normally one-dimensional.The aspect of the film that impressed me the most was the storytelling. Often in Marvel films, the action and effects overwhelm the story, leaving you lost at certain points. In ""Homecoming,"" you follow everything that's happening every step of the way. Kudos to the director and editor for a well-told story with well-drawn characters and well-timed gags.The best indication of the film's success may be the fact that it is a long film, but it never felt that way. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, perhaps even moreso than ""Spiderverse,"" which was wildly creative and certainly one of the most interesting Marvels. Certainly feels like they've breathed new life into the Spider-Man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Try your hardest even if it means that you'll fail,"Tom Holland takes the mantle from Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, but in the MCU. And it's about motherfreaking time!Peter Parker is your average but also undeniably the smartest pupil in Midtown high. He aspires to be the hero people like Tony Stark know he can be while also trying to come out of his shell and be daring, approachable and have as many experiences as possible a 17 year old high school student can acquire. He will have to face many obstacles, one of them is Michael Keaton's Vulture, the big bad of this movie.Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is what many would call a faithful adaptation and ripped straight out of the comics. He is awkward, unsure of himself and what he wants to be. He's truly a reflection of today's youth. This version of the character comes equiped with all the cool gadgets and of course has the nanotech suit that was given to him by Tony Stark (RDJ), who also makes an appearance.His cool and pretty aunt, also his role model May (Marisa Tomei) is there to guide and lift his spirits up. So does his best pal Ned (Jakob Batalon). RDJ's Tony Stark is there to ground him and remind him of things he lost along the way. Michelle Jones, ""MJ"" (Zendaya) is a cryptic, loner and distrustful smart pupil and is there to make puns and jokes at Peter. Laura Harrier is also a new addition to the cast and plays Liz, Peter's love interest.The main message of this movie intended to show its viewers that no matter how bad you are at something you should always try your hardest and never give up. It's a powerful message indeed and goes a long way to lift each of us up.All in all, this movie was a very solid and a good start to reboot, once again the character and legend himself, Spider-Man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-man 2 is still the best,"Yes. This may be a great coming of age movie, and a great superhero movie but not the greatest spider-man movie. I'm not being stubborn here about the classic. I've seen reviews saying it is the best Spider- man movie ever. I can't agree with that because the villain and some supporting characters are so underdeveloped. Tom Holland tries a ultimate spider-man style but in the end all we get is the Kung-fu Panda version of spider-man. It was fun in civil war because it was short but here he keeps whining about it almost every minute when he was Peter Parker. In overall, this is just another MCU popcorn movie. It's entertaining as hell, good to re-watch on Blu-ray and keep it in your MCU collection. BTW, Tony stark was awesome once again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fun & Breezy. The best Spider-Man yet!,"If you had told me in 2014 that there would be yet another Spider-Man reboot in 2017 I would've rolled my eyes. While I didn't hate the 2012 and 2014 movies I found them a tad bland and unnecessary so soon after the Tobey Maguire trilogy ended in 2007. But it's another day and another Spider-Man movie has his theatres and I gladly handed over my money to see what could possibly be new this time around. I'm happy to say that it was worth every penny. This was, hands down, my favorite Spider-Man movie and Tom Holland is my favorite Spider-Man. And I liked both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.Peter Parker is your typical teenager dealing with high school, friends, a crushoh and saving the city from criminals using his alter ego. What I found thoroughly refreshing was the lack of teen angst that both previous Spider-Men dealt with. While they were burdened with the weight of the world, 2017's Spider-Man (more like Spider-Teen) is past that. He's young, and at times naive, but the underlying guilt has been taken away. The movie doesn't dig up the past. Peter became Spider- Man, got discovered by Tony Stark, fought alongside the Avengers, and now struggles with his mundane life. The story is fresh and director Jon Watts keeps it light. Also, introducing the character in Captain America: Civil War was a masterstroke since you go into this movie already knowing the kid.The film's casting is spot on and wonderfully diverse, might I add. Tom Holland is simply fantastic. He's the ideal young superhero with charm, wit, and a genuine sense of fun. It's not the Spider- Man we're used to and that's a good thing. Jacob Batalon as his best friend Ned is hilarious. Zendaya, who I expected to see in a bigger role, is wonderful as is Marisa Tomei as Aunt May. Though not my favorite villain, Michael Keaton does a fair enough job. I'm excited to see where the story and characters go from here especially after certain facts come to light. Guest appearances led by Robert Downey Jr (Tony Stark) enhance the entertainment value.A happy Peter, a breezy tone, crisp writing, entertaining side characters, and the connect into the bigger Marvel world all add up to a brilliant start for a new series. The potential is tremendous. While I wait for that to be achieved I'll gladly give this movie another watch. It's that good!https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I almost left before the end!Practically every line from every character is intended to get a laugh. I'm all for some humour, but get a balance for goodness sake! No drama in this film apart from one good, short scene between Holland and Keaton. The love interest is pathetic when compared to the previous Spider-Man films. His aunt is Moreisa Tomei? Seriously? She's supposed to be old! His friend/sidekick is just an annoying child constantly asking stupid annoying questions. Keaton is very underused and do we really need Iron Man in this? The typically frantic CGI action sequences are nothing but a blur most of the time, not much to enjoy there.I suppose it's to be expected now, Marvel is all about the franchise and Phases.

An actual teenager playing a teenager... What madness,"Spider-man Homecoming: the first Spider-man movie to be involved in the larger MCU in collaboration with Sony, it stars Tom Holland as Spider-man and Michael Keaton as the Vulture.This is the best Spider-man movie in years, probably the second best after Spider-man 2. And that in no small part down the Tom Holland: having an actor the correct age range to be Peter Parker is so refreshing and makes the character way more relatable. Because that's the allure of Spider-man he is a kid with everyday problems who just happens to have super powers, that down to earth style. 
Speaking of down to earth, Michael Keaton's villain is more grounded he doesn't want to take over the world; he's just stealing stuff from Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) because he took away his job- there's no sky beam, so thumbs up for that.And yes Robert Downey Jr. is fun in this movie so is Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), totally not necessary other than giving Peter a mentor figure but fun nonetheless. Spider-man Homecoming is actually a very funny movie as well Peter's friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) gets some good lines, and I even liked Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori). I liked they changed his character slightly from being a huge muscle bound bully, to a snarky annoying douchebag.
Homecoming also has a lot of downturn moments with Peter just in High School doing everyday things, which might turn of younger viewers because they wanna see Spider-man doing Spider-man things. But these moments can be a lot of fun and gives us more insight to the other side of the Spider-man persona.I only have a couple of issues with Homecoming. This is a Sony movie so there's quite a bit of product placement in fact the alternative name for Homecoming is Spider-man Go Buy an Audi. They also seem extremely pleased that they are part of the MCU now with just a tad too many references to the wider world, which I get why but becomes a bit of an annoyance at times. And finally the exact same issue I had with Wonder Women, the final fight takes place at night... Again. In fact this fight is even more difficult to work out at times as it takes place in the air with dull flashing lights, and then it moves to a beach in front of an amusement park... Why wasn't the fight inside the amusement park? Isn't that an unwritten law of movies- if there's an amusement park you have a fight scene in it?Anywho, Spider-man Homecoming is a really enjoyable Spider-man movie with some great performances and it's super awesome that we have an appropriately aged actor playing part, it may sound like a small thing to focus on but it really does impact the role of Spider-man greatly.I give Spider-man Homecoming a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The first MCU Spider-Man movie introduces an awkward Peter Parker who is a perfect mix of Maguire and Garfield's performances.,"Peter's inexperience in being Spider-Man clearly shows throughout the movie, and it was fine up to a point. His freshness doesn't mix well with a villain like the Vulture, resulting in rushed action sequences. Michael Keaton is a very good Vulture though.Tom Holland manages to capture the essence of both Peter and Spider-Man, but his nerdiness could have been shown a little more and his jokes as Spidey are mostly good. One thing that did bother me throughout the movie was the screaming. He does not need to scream so much.I'm kind of bummed I didn't get to see how Peter became Spider-Man, him finding out about his powers, creating a suit from scratch. The death of Uncle Ben also doesn't seem to be defining for his character. It's good that they're trying to give Tom Holland his own storyline, but maybe they removed too much of what's familiar to the viewers.Pretty good soundtrack, Zendaya deserves more screen time and that plot twist caught me off guard the first time I watched the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I don't normally comment. But this film has amazed me.,"I am a 35 year old guy from Scotland with a degree in digital film making. But I do not fancy myself as a critic. I know how hard it is to start with a white page and create a moving experience. The right ingredients can still create an awful mess.That is why they call it cinema magic. Many times Hollywood has ensembled the perfect cast, story, director etc. but has totally missed the mark. Batman V Superman could be put on that list. The ingredients were fine, but the magic wasn't there. I really wanted to love that film. I have dreamed about it as long as I can remember. But in that context it was a total failure. Scene after scene I felt let down, betrayed. How could these people just not get it? The lack of understanding in the source material was shocking.That brings me to Spider-Man Homecoming. My expectations were reserved for this film. I have been let down so often recently. Even from Marvel and Marvel Studios. The Civil War was a bit of a damp squib. Avengers 2 was basically Avenengers in eastern Europe (With robots). The rest of the line-up recently is kind of dull. Don't get me wrong. They are not bad films, they are good films, but they are not great.Spider-Man Homecoming is; in my opinion, great. From the beginning to the end I was delighted, amused or moved.Big-budget action scenes are standard fare nowadays, but to give those scenes real purpose and finesse is unique. The limitations of physics; or the local geography, really ground the film in a reality DC films have struggled with. Spider-Man is put in environments where Holland's youthful spirit is forced to mature in front of our eyes.The characters are fully formed human beings, with passions and flaws which make the whole story more believable. Michael Keaton and Tom Holland are wonderful at giving the protagonist and antagonist purpose. We understand why each is following the path they are on, without the need of explanation.The story is kept provincial; compared to the usual super-hero smash-a-thon. With Peter (Tom Holland) dealing with neighborhood problems. But we still get the implication that the effects could spread to the wider world, giving a real sense of peril.Spider-Man Homecoming is a fitting title for this film. That is what it feels like. With all the warmth and memories of an almost forgotten childhood. It feels like coming home",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

2 hours of Marvel heaven,"Although teenagers may find this movie more enjoyable, Spider-Man: Homecoming is an excellent addition to the MCU. The acting is great, the CGI is great, the jokes are funny, and the action sequences are entertaining. There are few unexpected plot twists, one of which left me on the edge of my seat for the entire scene.

"Welcome back Spider-Man, welcome back.","I loved Spidey's introduction in Captain America: Civil War, but maybe ten minutes into Spider-Man: Homecoming there is a montage where Peter Parker is doing his Spidey stuff around NY after school with Blitzkrieg Bop playing in the background, and it was at that moment, I finally felt like Spider-Man is truly home.Sitting through origin stories can be a chore, and here Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal, writers Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, and director Jon Watts don't let the audience relive that familiar tale. They drop us right in the middle of it and it's relentless in proceeding the story from start to finish in a good way. It's a long movie, but it's fast paced and a joy to sit through. They do a great job juggling multiple story lines and it never felt jumbled or hard to follow.The world ending trope is not evident in the film, its a more scaled down adventure, similar to Ant-Man. There are as many high-school/John Hughes scenes as there are with the action sequences. Easter eggs in the film are subtle and great fun, they're not as distracting as one would expect them to be. Also, for the record I can watch Captain America PSA's all day.I said back in my Captain America: Civil War review that within ten minutes of screen time, Marvel Studios does exactly what Sony failed to do with their last three Spider-Man films. Tom Holland is terrific. He flourishes in this role and I can see that he gave it his all. His charisma oozes off screen and in the scenes where things get serious he's able to show off his acting chops. He's impatient, energetic, a bit naive and super young. I yearned for high school Spidey in films and finally we have continuing stories that take place in high school and an actor who looks the part, and doesn't look old. Holland combines the best of both Maguire and Garfield, with a bit of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly, resulting in what I think is the best film iteration of Peter Parker/Spider-Man to date.So far in Phase 3, every Marvel villain felt like a step forward. While they didn't solve their villain issues, they made small steps to fixing it with each Phase 3 film. Here they finally deliver. Of all villains The Vulture is easily one of the MCU's best villains on film since maybe Loki and Winter Soldier. Michael Keaton delivers, and what makes his performance so great is that he plays it subtly. It's not over the top, it's muted, and more low-key. As someone who owned a business trying to clean up after the mess the Avengers leave all over the world, Damage Control and Tony Stark took over, leaving him nothing. He turns to the life of crime, picking up leftovers from any superhero battles, turning them into weapons to sell on the black market with his crew so he can get by living life and providing for his family. That is a motivation I can get by and understand.He has great exchanges with Holland throughout. One of my favorite moments in the film is when and he tells him that he's young and he just doesn't understand how the world works. This got me thinking, if this were an older Peter Parker, he'd probably understand where he's coming from and they would maybe be having a different conversation.The supporting cast are terrific. I don't really need to elaborate Downey Jr. at this point. He always brings it every time. Stark is used effectively and for those worried that he might overshadow Spidey, he really doesn't. As shown in the trailers, Stark ridicules him for being ignorant during the ferry incident and it's nice to see Tony Stark in a mentor role giving him only new things to do. Great to see Favreau back as Happy Hogan and he gets some good moments throughout. Marisa Tomei is not the typical Aunt May we see in the comics or in the other Spider-Man films. She's more involved and kind of a cooler, hip aunt. The film also has fun with the fact that she is a very attractive woman. Keaton's crew in the film are also good, they don't have huge roles, but they have something to do in the film. The film treats them as characters as opposed to disposable henchmen for the most part.The kids in the film are also fun. Jacob Batalon is Ned, Peter's best friend and they're a hoot. The budding romance between Peter and Liz is also well done and not overplayed. Laura Harrier does a good job projecting a personality of a popular, but friendly and humble girl. Zendaya also scores some decent laughs as a rebel student similar of Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club. Tony Revolori is a different incarnation of Flash Thompson. Being a comic-book conservative, in truth I was let down by the fact that we wouldn't get something similar of Chris Zylka's Flash from the Andrew Garfield series, but after digesting everything Revolori was quite good and the new approach they took won me over.Occasionally the film stumbles a tad, for instance Ned can get a little too annoying at times. Some of the cgi effects didn't look as polished as I had hope, but it's not distracting where I'd be taken out of the film. Tonally, having Peter Parker actually enjoy being Spider-Man brought a breath of fresh air. That in it of itself is the best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's a colorful adventure that fits with the rest of the MCU without getting bogged down with franchising. He's home and it's good to have him home.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Nothing to get very excited about,"Saw Spider-Man: Homecoming yesterday, and it was thoroughly... OK. Didn't love it, didn't hate it -- basically because there's not much there to care about either way.It has a very shallow 80s teen film feel to it, like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. So if you can unlock your inner 12 year old and not think too hard about anything, you'll probably enjoy it.The culturally diverse characters are completely two dimensional - full of stereotypical personalities, and all commercially constructed to be easily digestible and likable - which pretty much sums up the movie.The dialogue is very light, complete with a perky, middle-aged-plus gmilf of an Aunt May. The plot is very basic, but with at least two stellar action sequences, solid cgi and a refreshing cast of villains from Vulture and Shocker, to early glimpses of Scorpion and Prowler.Not much else comes to mind. Like I said, it's a very safe, cute movie, seemingly designed to get a substantial number of laughs and avoid controversy.

A generic high school movie that works as a good Spidey movie,"Spider-Man Homecoming was a solid, fun, and charming film. While it's nowhere near great I would say that it's one of the better Spidey movies. There's a lot that I like and not much I didn't enjoy. For one thing I thought Tom Holland was pretty great as both Peter Parker AND Spider-Man (which has never been done before in the movies). It's a different representation of the character since he's so young, but it works to the film's advantage since he screws up a lot as he should. There's even a few harsh moments with him that legitimately impressed me. The acting overall was very good. With my second favorite performance being Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. Michael Keaton is great in everything and here he really gets to shine, especially in the later parts of the movie. Only issue with him was how it sounded like he tried to have a thick NY accent early on but then just stopped after a bit. But I gotta say, he's without a shred of a doubt the best Marvel villain. Marisa Tomei as Hot Aunt May was also really enjoyable as there were quite a few funny moments around her being unnaturally attractive. The humor was also much better than I expected. It's a very light-hearted movie without feeling as tonally unbalanced as some other Marvel movies, and the quips from Spider-Man are always fun. Another thing is that the cinematography is surprisingly really good. There's a lot of great shots and a good color palette that suits the movie's tone. From a directing standpoint this movie is much better/more defined than most other Marvel films recently. Where my issues begin to emerge is mainly with the writing. This is every single high school movie you've ever seen, mixed with a generic superhero movie that happens to be about Spider-Man. It doesn't necessarily do this stuff poorly, but none of it is unique either. The romance subplot is especially mediocre. It goes through the same beats as every other one you've seen and is riddled with terribly clichéd dialogue. It's definitely the weakest out of all the films because at least in ASM Emma and Andrew's chemistry was fantastic. And in the Raimi movies Mary Jane was fairly developed as a character. Another thing I wasn't crazy for was the emphasis on the Avengers and the rest of the MCU. Even though there were a lot of clever and meta bits where it showed how a post Avengers world would operate, it seemed a little heavy-handed. Especially with Tony Stark. I'm glad that he's not in the movie as much as I thought he would be, and I like how he's trying to be a sort of father figure. But I felt like he was the executives' way of implanting all the sequel-baiting and setting-up-for-Infinity-War into the film. Which is a negative cuz I when I see a Spider-Man film I wanna see a Spider-Man film, not another Marvel movie. My last problem is that I felt like this film really lacked much of an emotional grit to it. For the most part the sequence of events just kinda feel like a sequence of events with no real consequences. There is a scene before the third act that really held some weight to it and brought a bit of that grit to the film. There's also a little moment in the final battle where Tom Holland does his best bit of acting as he truly felt vulnerable and hurt, that with some great imagery also brought some much needed drama to it. I get that it's ultimately a kids' movie, but a good sense of weight to situation could've really made the emotional moments even more powerful. Any other issues I have are minor like product-placement, stretches in logic that the movie itself set up, and a way characters react to Peter's final action that seems out of place. Overall, I really enjoyed Spider-Man Homecoming for what it was and accepted that it's not perfect by any means; I would gladly see it again. Enthusiastic 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best thing about this movie is that...,"...it pisses off the racists. Anything that gets them whining like drama queens and their panties in a twist tickles me pink. So all the white characters that morphed into the ""other"" category are completely fine with me. You don't like it, tough s**t!Now, onto the movie. I grew up with a different take on Spider Man, and this version in my mind of him differs from what this movie presented. I'm not keen on a teenage superhero. It just doesn't work for me. I'd much rather see Spider man somewhere around that 19-23 year old range. 15 years old is waaay too young. But, I understand why they did this. It's simple. This movie has progressed 8 years from Civil War, so I assume the next time Spidey gets to the big screen, he'll be firmly in that age range I expect him to be. Starting him off as a 15 year old gives him a few more future movies where he'll being just out of AARP range.I also envision Spider Man as being bigger and badder. I'm not talking Capt America physique, but not a short little pip squeak either. Spidey wasn't even taller than his pseudo girlfriend, or even MJ, his future love interest (who happens to be black...HA, had to get one in on the racists). I guess I like my superheroes truly super; I attribute that to years of reading the comics, where superheroes are buff and cut by default.Another issue I had with this movie was Spider Man's reliance on Iron Man. Now, I get that Iron Man serves as something of a mentor and liason to the Avengers, but too much of Iron Man's technology rubbed off on Spider Man. This makes Spidey more of a hybrid than an actual, skilled, fighting machine with super moves, above average smarts, and spider-sense. Spider Man is actual quite capable in the comics, easily a tough match for anyone. In this movie, not so much, and especially not with Iron Man's help.All in all, it's an okay movie. Could be better. Recommended to watch, and then top off the night reading all the online bytching from loser bigots spewing their favorite word over and over...can you say PC ,PC, PC ,PC, PC, PC, PC...(they do).8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Spiderman: Homecoming fulfils what the fans desired all this time, to have Spiderman in the Avengers.","Oh, and to also make a damn decent iteration of Spiderman for the big screen. Was never a fan of the Raimi trilogy, Tobey Maguire didn't work for me. Andrew Garfield was great but the films ultimately didn't deliver. Now that Marvel acquired him, we finally have a great iteration. Not perfect, but pretty damn great. Smart moves were made that I do applaud. Not rehashing the origin story for a third time was THE move that was important. This is post Civil War, and the studio knew how intelligent their audiences were...obviously being the fact we didn't want to see another 30 minutes of Peter getting bitten and discovering his abilities in bewilderment. Second smart move was to use Tony Stark as the father figure as opposed to Uncle Ben (again!), thankfully Iron Man was kept to a minimum but the endearment and protection that Stark has for Parker was a much needed attribute to the plot in order to keep it grounded. That is exactly what this film does best, it remains low-key even in terms of our villain's motives (which I must say were rather bland). Final smart move, obtaining the perfect cast. Oh yes this cast was so tidy! Tom Holland, in a career defining role, aced it. Finally we have a younger Spiderman and his portrayal was the most accurate representation of the comic book superhero so far. Michael Keaton looks like he was enjoying his role as the psychopath Vulture, although for the film to describe him as a psychopath is hyperbolic. More bitter perhaps? The rest of the cast were charismatic and were able to execute their lines to comedic perfection. The script is rather witty which definitely enhances the comic book feel that the film was going for. It's part superhero blockbuster and a coming-of-age comedy and switches between the two frequently, my problem is they didn't mix well and it felt like watching two separate films. I was more interested in Peter Parker's school life than his super heroic antics. Still, a consistently good entry for the MCU!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An awesome movie experience!,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is refreshing, exciting, funny and captivating.

His portrayal is down to earth which seems to be a trend in the superhero movie universe. What was nice to see were the action scenes without the suit. He seemed more like a regular guy who inherited super powers.I don't think this was groundbreaking in any way, just a good action movie and a more interesting Spider Man than the last two.

Great Spider-Man Movie with Plenty of Twists and Grounded Villain,"I love the direction they took the new Spider-Man movie. Marvel has been hitting the right notes with making these movies that can please most comic book fans and general audiences. In this chapter, you get to see Tom Holland play a high school version of Peter Parker in his early days of trying to manage work and play. I wasn't fond of the idea when Marvel released the synopsis at first but I thought the movie went beyond my expectations. I didn't expect that many twists throughout the film and you'll be surprised at some of them if not all of them. They definitely answer a lot of questions on who the characters really are and they pay homage to Millar's ""Civil War"" series and we get to see some familiar faces we haven't seen in awhile once again. There's so much to say but it would spoil the movie! I think Holland did a terrific job playing a young Spidey with plenty of ""grit"" trying to find his right footing as a superhero. Therefore, as any young person would, you witness Peter not making the most rational decisions because he's only 15 years old trying to save New York City! I'm glad they didn't go with the origins route with ""great power comes great responsibility"" format that was done twice already. Although, it is very important for Peter throughout the comics, I'm hoping they touch upon Uncle Ben and this in the next film. Holland does a great job at playing the smart yet socially awkward high school kid. There were certain revealing moments in the movie where you see Tom really show the tension in his face. Also, I really liked the realistic portrayal of a diverse high school that's focused on nerds! I love it! The action was great but you don't see as many cool moves like in the previous Spidey movies. But I get it, he's still working with his ""training wheels"". I loved the supporting cast and you get to see some more Happy Hogan in this film and adore Marissa Tomei as a younger Aunt May....so attractive! But it was such an interesting take to see Michael Keaton play the villain and he really brings the character to life and you ""understand"" where he's coming from. Although, some may argue that Holland isn't the best Spider-Man or Homecoming isn't the best Spider-Man movie, there's something for everyone in the film whither it's the light humor, action scenes, more Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man or to continue the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll enjoy the movie and I would definitely watch it again in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Boring,"Am I the only one that did not enjoyed this movie? There's not much to say about it because there's not much that happens throughout the whole movie. There are a few good moments but those are not enough to make up for the underdeveloped story, shallow characters (especially the villain and side characters), action sequences that do not last very much and aren't even that special, jokes that aren't too funny (I think I've smiled once or two times). And the worst thing is that I'm very disappointed of Spider-Man. I liked Tom Holland a lot in Civil War and I was certain that it will be perfect for this role. Unfortunately, it wasn't at all. And it pains me to say that it was a boring movie",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Mischievous Spider-Man,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" mixes what was great about the Tobey Maguire era along side the spider-man antics of the Andrew Garfield era to serve up a superhero movie that is the most true as it is fresh to the character ever since 2002's Spider-Man. Everything from the mundane things like Peter missing his web shots, running around in a field without tall structures, failing numerous times before fulfilling an objective, not having a love life yet unlike the previous film, and having the story focus solely on his journey to truly become spider- man is what sets this movie apart from everything that came before. It screams, breathes and feels like what spider-man should've been all these years, a 15 year old coming of age story with some spider-man.No longer is the time where Peter Parker has already graduated high school and is almost in his adult life. No longer do we need to focus on this love story between Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane. This is a new era for spider-man, in the sense that he's no longer the only hero in the block and he can have other people help him. So the question now becomes, how can Peter Parker still be spider-man in this world of Avengers and countless supers? This is the main arc of the entire film wherein Peter now tries to prove himself as spider-man for Tony Stark. However, at the end, he learns that he doesn't need to prove that to anyone other than himself. This is the nuance this film brings in to the table, a kid who already tries to embody responsibility without needing another speech or death from Uncle Ben. Someone who constantly fails and isn't sure of what he should do in each scenario. A hero with a heart of gold and is vulnerable and still innocent to the things around him. Tom Holland's performance is the most naturalistic and deferential to the character and it shows. He IS the best combination of Peter Parker and spider-man even though you still may like Tobey for Peter or like Andrew for Spidey. Tom's portrayal shows a vulnerable and more heartfelt side to the character that you can resonate with every time he's on the screen. Michael Keaton serves as another addition to the low level and every day man turned villain in the Vulture because of the damage caused once again by the Avengers. The fact that this wasn't an origin movie made us love spider-man more. The first scene with him in the entire film immediately humanized and made him likable already. It goes to show that Marvel truly knows the character and is in safe hands. The scenes where spider-man was alone also were the complete highlights of the film. Despite him already being in this huge cinematic universe where anyone can possibly just show up and help him, the film still backtracks and show profound moments of Peter just being himself, talking to his new found AI friend Karen, or trapped in an unforgiving situation. It even has time to show the John Hughes inspired moments that add more than just ""teenage angst"" or ""old and grown men writing dialogue that they think will relate to teenagers"" type of stuff. The writers knew what they were doing and were able to provide a self-contained, non world-ending and separated yet still attached movie to the MCU much like what Ant-Man tried to do. It was also brilliant that we got to see more interaction between Tony and Peter, where we see more of how Tony reflects and projects himself on to Peter yet he wants him to be better than he ever was. It also feels like a passing on the torch because we know that Tony can only be in the MCU for so long and they need a definite flag bearer. The only gripe with the movie is how some of the side characters are brushed off without any meaningful or considerable act except for a few. Wonder Woman did it remarkably well with its side characters, but then again there is only so much you can do with an already over saturated universe that are already saturated with so many characters.In the end, this film will probably stand the test of time after all the huge and extravagant Avengers films break out. This will be remembered as the connective tissue that brought some heart to it all.Verdict: 4/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Could've been great.,"Marvel: Stop cramming diversity down our throats.

Changing the gender and ethnicity of characters just  for the sake of being inclusive is ridiculous. If there's a reason for  it - fair enough. But there simply wasn't in this case.

Please God no more SPIDERMEN!!!,"I came I watched. Another Spiderman movie from some brainchild over at Sony who feels somehow that we need ANOTHER reboot of this Marvel arachnified offering and of course the truth is that Sony doesn't want to give up the franchise hence they must honor Marvel film commitment. BUT the one thing I am most grateful for is that they didn't SHOW THE BLOODY SPIDER BITE ORIGIN SEQUENCE. Had enough of that already. The film is well made and well processed through the commercial filter that programs us to like what we see before us and that process seems ever so predictable as my body clock ticks onward. It does have some interesting juvenile based dialogue (because Peter Parker is only 15 in this film, why not SPIDER-BOY?)and the high school characters are all plausibly comical in their post pubescent glory. I felt manipulated and partially gangrene by the time this film was over yet I did enjoy the wondrous presence of Michael Keaton who thanks to Birdman (he practically reprises that role in this film), has again graced our panoramic vision of present day cinema and I am ever so grateful he has returned to us like the prodigal son or uncle might be more appropriate. The acting, the special effects are all well and fine and blah blah blah yet somehow I was sick a might in the core of my gut to have been back in a theater seat to gaze upon SPIDER-MAN predictably going to unravel the villain and return to Auntie May (nicely updated by the gorgeous Miss Tomei), and do the usual BS only to return 2 years later in yet another sequel coming soon in 3d Imax in 2019. I am saddened that Hollywood insists on putting out more recycled sludge and apparently doesn't have much of a unique idea in its hollow head anymore.

A successful reboot that strays from the comics,"Iron-man: Homecoming first of all nails the ""Friendly Neighborhood"" hero from Queens feel. It's also immaculately directed, features the first good version of the Vulture and every single actor was great. Where the film struggles somewhat is being a coherent adaptation of the comics. Peter is half Ultimate Peter, half Miles Morales and half Iron-man's sidekick striking out on his own. That's all a bit much! ""MJ"", Flash and Aunt May have nothing to do with any comic counterpart either and i 100% fail to comprehend why the film can't have 5 minutes devoted to his origin. This is a reboot targeting a new audience and they are now missing Spidey 101 canon. I don't get it. The film is obviously a success and not another Amazing 2 mess, as the crappy trailers suggested, yet it's not much of a comic adaptation and more of a radical reinterpretation. That is why this film will always come behind the highly comic accurate Sam Raimi original and obviously it's borderline perfect sequel. Still, Sony + Disney did good and successfully rebooted their golden goose and that's all that matters.One question remains though: Who though that the now 21 year old Tom Holland could pass for a 15 year old? Can we please get Spider-MAN out of high school within the next solo film, as that period only lasted for about 2 years in the comics!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man: Homecoming better than Spider-Man 2?,"* This review may contain spoilers *Hey everyone, thanks for reading my Spider-Man: Homecoming Review. So we had Spider-Man,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 3,The Amazing Spider- Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2. And now we have Spider-Man: Homecoming. And of course is the big question did I enjoy it. Like I did with Spider- Man 2. Yes of course is a Marvel movie. Because is the first time that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And watching with IMAX 3D was even better. But unfortunately Sony spoiled in the trailers more than they should. But besides that is a good movie. Before watching this movie I was like please don't be a mess. Because this is the third Spider-Man reboot. What I really like about the movie is that Peter Parker is texting Happy Hogan. And texting when is my next mission. While Happy Hopan never text him back. (Yeah, I know that feeling) Also you see that Peter Parker really trying to impress Tony Stark. He's helping so many people. Although I must say that when I watched the movie they have changed a couple of dialogues. And I think that was really a great idea. Because Sony already spoiled a lot in the trailers. What also is good in this movie is that they don't show a lot of how Peter Parker became Spider-Man. And that's good. But of course in every Superhero movie you have a bad guy. And this time it's Whiplash Bird aka The Vulture. (HAHA) But seriously Michael Keaton did a really as being the bad guy. He's literally The King of the Wings. Because he's Batman, Birdman and now the Vulture. (You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain) What I also love about the movie is that Tom Holland is a good Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Because you can see him as a fifteen year old boy. Because come on Tobey Maguire as a fifteen year old and Andrew Garlfield. (naaah). This movie also showed that Peter is not kind of handy with his superpowers. That was really funny to see. Jacob Batalon was a really Ned he was keep asking Peter Parker all kind of questions of becoming Spider- Man. And that was hilarious to see. ( I would also do that if I had a friend who is Spider-Man). Don't worry that Spider-Man: Homecoming is Iron Man 4. Because that's not true he only have a big cameo. And it's great to see Iron Man as Peter Parker's mentor. To be honest I remember in 2012: People were saying why is the Avengers not helping Spider-Man. And now in 2017: People were saying like what is Iron Man doing in a Spider- Man Movie. I think it was really great to see Iron Man in this movie. And with upgrades that he gave Peter to his suit it is even more comic accurate. Also this movie had the two Shockers and Vulture what kind of want to have biological wings for vulture. But this suit also great what they have used for the Vulture. But that's not my main point what I wanted is that they really did a great job of adding multiple villains. And Michael Keaton is just one of the best villains what we have seen in a Spider-Man movie. And I think I would enjoy this movie more if there was not so many Spider-Man movies yet. Also there are a lot of Easter eggs of Spider-Man in this movie. I rate this movie a 9. Yeah, Spider-Man is fun again. And I will catch you guys in my next review.YouTube Video Creator Santhkanaal",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A perfect 10,"To clarify why I think Spider Man - Homecoming is a perfect 10: they made another genre movie - high school coming of age movie to be precise, but with this they made a true marvel (pun intended). For example, they never tell you ""With great power comes great responsibility"", they show it in a best possible way. Perfect from the first second to the last (and stay till the end of credit roll - there is an important lesson ;-) )...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man Homecoming,Spider-Man Homecoming is a very fun film and one of the best Spider-Man films. Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man and the rest of the cast is great. I thought Robert Downy Jr was used well and the villain was great. The action is fun but does lack the intensity of other Spider-Man movies.

Best Spider Man Movie Yet,"There are so many things to talk about the new spider man movie but let just say it is better than I expected it. It's fun, Heart warming, relatable and no offense to other Spider man movies cuz i love them all but it's like a lift up, lighten, bright and cheerful and not so dark all the time. Tom Holland by far is the best Spider Man base on his performance. Must see definitely!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
There could have been no better way to mark the return of the estranged mega-star to the folds of Marvel Multi-verse.,"Tom Holland is probably the best and most relatable Spiderman ever and this film is an almost dream reconstruction of the Spiderman franchise. Spiderman seems refreshingly different than usual, nerdy and way stronger than ever before.For the first time a Spiderman villain is not pathetic or irrelevant and the credit goes not only to Keaton but also the writers to have shaped a memorable anti-hero character.If you thought this was a childish film... well you are mistaken. If you thought Wonder Woman was the best film of the year, you are mistaken there as well, with two big movies yet to be released, it is too soon to form an opinion. But, I will tell you what Spiderman Homecoming has done, it has raised the bar and now the upcoming films have to compete with this Spiderman masterpiece.On the hindsight, the film makers have obliterated Spiderman's character building exercise, where in he needs to make irrevocable mistakes as to shape his character in future. The absence of Uncle Ben, death of Peter's parents and the tag-line: with great powers come great responsibilities are missing and might as well affect the character in future endeavors.Lastly, some films are made in such ways that everything falls right in place in those 2+ hours of screen time. And Marvel somehow has managed to master the Art and Homecoming for a change is one ""clean"" Marvel film which manages to attract the young, the adults and the young adults alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spidey and Wonder rule this summer.,"""If you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it."" Tony Stark to his intern, Peter Parker/Spider-Man.If a superhero film such as Spider-Man: Homecoming can relay that being yourself is more important than being somebody, Director John Watts (director of the under-appreciated Cop Car with Kevin Bacon) and his crew of bright writers have succeeded. I don't remember enjoying more such a focused, albeit young, Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tom Holland), whose emotional problems are those of any teen and not overly driven by angst over a girl, as Tobey Maguire so often portrayed.While Peter experiences the challenges of teen love and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), the film keeps it personal by having fewer explosions and more introspection. Emphasizing Peter's existential responsibility to forge his own character makes this film a cut above even the estimable Wonder Woman this summer.The spot-on humor is better than any other superhero adventure in memory, and I'm a big Deadpool fan. The difference is that Spidey humor is organic, emanating from the foibles and insecurities of a teen, while in Deadpool practically every other line is witty and seems the product of set pieces. In Spidey, for instance, Ned (Jacob Batalon) asks Spidey, ""Can you summon an army of spiders?"" That's teen to teen with absurdity and worship as comedic ingredients.In a fine bad-guy performance by Michael Keaton, playing Adrien Toombs, the writers give him the identity of Vulture, appropriate to an actor known for his portrayal of Birdman and reminiscent of Batman. Anyway, alluding to his most famous roles, the film has fun while enhancing the richness of the character.At times it almost seems that Toombs is there to lend some gravity, albeit villainous, to the light-hearted proceedings. When he lectures his crew about the ruling-class indifference, he's not just talking about Brooklyn; he's referring to the world: ""The rich, the powerful, like Stark, they don't care about us! The world's changed boys, time we change too!""Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fitting companion this summer to a distaff heroine, Wonder Woman. Unfortunately, Spidey is not all laughs, for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) tells Peter about adolescence while she unwittingly comments on his heroic burden: ""You need to stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An Okay Attempt at RE-Rebooting the Franchise,"Spider-man Homecoming changes up the formula compared to the previous two Spider-man attempts. This time around Peter isn't just getting his powers; he has had some actual experience with them. There is no longer an Uncle Ben moment as Tony Stark takes over that role. There seemed to be a lot more humor in this movie than the other ones which I can accept given this is a teenage Spider-man who is pretty naive to the magnitude of the situation most of the time.What this movie lacked at least a good 3/4 of the time was a real story. Spider-man kind of just bounced around giving jokes here and there. We had I think four noteworthy villains but really one was given any significant dialogue. Vulture was a good villain and I liked the whole concept of the character's purpose but I can't say he ever had me worrying for Peter. Besides Tony just seems to be able to swoop in whenever to help out when things get tough which further lessens the stakes throughout the movie.The one thing this movie has going for it is the fact that they chose Tom Holland for Spider-man. This guy is charming as hell and can really deliver serious and comedic lines with the best of them. He basically had to carry this movie as the direction of this movie was really not one of Marvel's best. The supporting high school cast did well for the time they were given. I find it funny how they were advertising this as a John Hughes type movie, but I have not heard that mentioned once since the release. This movie doesn't focus on the school side any more than the Amazing Spider-Man movies did and neither were really that impactful to their respected stories.Now how does this movie rank with the others? I think the Amazing SM movie were okay but they had a lot of cringe moments. The best thing had going for them was Peter and Gwen but that is about it those movies along with Spider-man 3 rank below this movie. I did find myself enjoying Homecoming but I can't say I would watch it again anytime soon. Spider-man 2 seems to still be the gold standard.If you want to see an entertaining summer movie that visually looks great and will have you laughing from beginning to end then check this out. I would still however recommend Baby Driver over this movie though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An entertaining extravaganza but...,"Excellent movie yet again from MCU. The only thing that ruined the fun was the 3D effect in this movie. The movie was not sharp enough and lacked details. At times Spiderman was so small that it was hard to locate him on the screen. The color tone was already dull, wearing 3D glasses added more dullness to the effects. Dark scenes and night effects were disaster. Avengers is far superior film if it comes to CGI and visual effects. But this criticism cannot take away the fact that ""This is the best Spiderman movie ever."" Tom Holland was lovable and simply fantastic. He portrayed his character's vulnerabilities and strengths like a mature actor. This boy will go places and he is the best Spiderman till date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A fun teenage coming-of-age movie,"I think I might've put my expectations a bit too high, the film feels a bit standard for marvel. It is up to par with Dr. Strange, for example, but not as memorable as.. er.. I guess Marvel's standards are pretty high. This one feels more down to earth. Spiderman fights his villains on his own, and so isn't bogged down by the large scale and heaviness of films like the Avengers. I particularly liked the opening scene with Peter Parker making a little video diary, with some scenes from Civil War in it. Totally what a 15 yo teenager would do.Tom Holland, as he did in his appearance in Civil War, is the perfect Spider-Man (and I'm a Tobey's version fan), and Tony Stark makes a pretty good mentor/father figure. I like that they only mentioned the fact that Peter lost his uncle just recently (we don't really need another spider bite and uncle death story). I wish there were more Aunt May scenes.Even though the general feel of the film is upbeat, I have to say that Tom delivered his rare emotional scenes perfectly. You feel his loss when he fails to be what he wanted to be. He reminded me of his excellent work in ""The Impossible"" (must watch).The changes in this version of spidey takes him to a completely different universe. He still lags in school due to his ""other"" responsibilities. But now he's the smart science nerd with his smart IT nerd friend, not the reporter-to-be kind of Peter Parker (I still remember Tobey's Peter taking pictures of MJ when he got bit). His suit and abilities are a bit different and mostly made by Stark, and I think spidey fans didn't like that idea. And I'm not sure I like the in-suit AI either (even though she sounds so soothing... it was Jennifer Connely's voice). But on the other hand it was pretty cool to see the different web effects the suit enabled him.Michael Keaton as the Birdma.. I mean Vulture.. he's menacing and vicious when he needs to be. Excellent play between him and Peter Parker.It's good. Fun, light, with some emotions interspersed throughout. The only bad thing.. well.. it's every other marvel standalone movie (well that's not bad actually because most of them are good too) and I guess we've seen those before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Refreshing Spider-Man Adaptation,"Spider-Man: Homecoming seems to be polarising opinion amongst viewers. I think the people who hated it appear to be fanboys of either comic books or the original Tobey Maguire trilogy. Perhaps these viewers are too accustomed to the traditional Spider-Man legend and can't appreciate a bit of variation from the same story getting retold, reboot after reboot.Tom Holland's take on everyone's favourite web slinging hero is refreshing. This Peter Parker's story picks up in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, and so we don't have to go through the whole kid gets bit by radioactive spider, uncle gets shot blah blah blah we all know how it goes. Homecoming slots perfectly into the wider MCU. The references throughout to the Avengers and events in previous films are never ending, giving a fascinating insight into how this fictional age of superheroes has taken its toll on the microcosmic environment of Peter's high school.Holland's Parker is relatable, and he fills the role with so much fun and personality. Also, contrary to popular belief, the jokes in this film are genuinely funny and I'd rank Homecoming 2nd behind Guardians of the Galaxy in the Marvel comedy rankings. Overall, the MCU's Spider-Man is a hit - highly enjoyable with a gasp-worthy twist at the end (no spoilers) that make it more than just a shallow parody.

Homecoming is right as Spider-Man: Homecoming is an awesome return for the web-slinger into the MCU,"Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics.After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield.Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best.I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation.

"Scaled-down, truly witty and surprisingly fresh","It may seem greedy and a bit stupid doing another Spider-Man reboot so short after the last one, but Homecoming brings something fresh.Talented Tom Holland is an amazing asset to the movie. His charisma and comic timing balances this new Spider-Man flick in way that both makes you care more about what happens in the movie and, more importantly, brings a well-needed break from the somewhat mechanic action of the Avengers and Captain America movies.It's a bold move letting young and rather inexperienced feature film director Jon Watts (""Clown"", ""Cop Car"") direct a blockbuster of these proportions. Usually, this is done in order to make it easier for the producers and the studio to control the production, but here, clearly, we're given the vision of a director and not the formulaic mess the studios sometimes forces through.Last but not least, kudos to composer maestro Michael Giacchino, who's created what is probably the strongest Marvel score this far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A different direction,"This is definitely not your typical Spider-man movie. Gone is the sentimentality of Maguire's movies, and also the mysteriousness of Garfield's movies. In this one, we get a Spidey that is young, inexperienced, and eager to please his mentor--no, not Uncle Ben--Tony Stark. After the events of Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man is thrilled and wants to impress Iron Man. Unfortunately, in trying to do so, he gets into more trouble than he bargained for. You can't just call this a superhero movie, because it's visibly more than that. It's a coming-of-age teen movie, that happens to be about Peter Parker. We see our hero go through all the normal aspects of high school life: sitting alone in a cafeteria, asking his crush out on a date, the regular stuff. But, of course, it's a Spider-Man movie, so there's a lot of action, including a truly vertigo-inducing sequence involving the top of the Washington Monument.

It's old and new at the same time.,"As with the previous Spidey flicks, the films doesn't get Everything right. But, mostly, it is the closest to being spot Here are reasons: 1. An actual teenager plays Peter/Spidey. This brings an awesome Kick Ass element to the film. Tom Holland looks like a teen rather than a twenty-something...because he is a teenager. As much as I liked Andrew Garfield (he should have played college age Spidey), Tom Holland brings it home as a true high school Peter/Spidey.2. In the first Spiderman, Willem Defoe camped it up hard core with delicious villainy. Michael Keaton, as the Vulture, brings sympathy for Adrian Toomes/Vulture at first. Buuuut (no spoilers because I hate them) he gives you a reason to reeeaaally dislike him at the end. Keaton as the Vulture was just balls-out! 3. Without spoiling anything, Ironman and Captain American appear. You've seen Tony/Ironman in the trailers. Nothing new there...maybe:) Finally, there are two end-credit scenes.

Here comes the new Spider-Man..,"Spider-Man: Homecoming, the latest addition to the MCU is one exhilarating and breathtaking ride. By breathtaking, i mean it literally does not give you enough time to breathe. It is packed with fabulous action sequences and time is not wasted on unnecessary character introductions.So, is SM: HC the best Spider-Man movie till date? Well, let's just say that once the final credits roll and you step out of the theater, you'll definitely feel so. For example, remember the time you thought Mad Max: Fury Road was the greatest action movie ever for an entire month? Similarly, I don't think this movie will survive the test of time. Die Hard released in 1988 still gets touted as the best action movie. SM 2 released in 2004 still gets talked about 13 years later. Do I think SM: HC will be talked about in 2030? Not a chance. A year down a line it's just going to be another movie in the vast collection of the MCU.That's not to say to this or Mad Max: FR are bad movies. In fact, they're great movies.

Is this the best Spider-Man film to date?,"Tom Holland was made to play Spider-Man.Let's start with Tom Holland. To me, he is the best Spider-Man yet. Compared to Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield, Holland really captivates audiences with his teenage persona, while the other two seemed too old.

As always I'll be honest and again I know by doing so people won't agree but.....,"REVIEW - SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMINGHmmmm I'm now in a quandary.What to say about the reboot of spider man.As always I'll be honest and again I know by doing so people won't agree but.....For me the best Spiderman was Toby Maguire and always will be, OK that said I have to admit the new guy to wear the Blue and Red Lycra is also good, not as good but good.Story is believable but and honestly the big but was the involvement of Tony Stark, why? Can't give too much away but with the involvement of Tony Stark I'm fearful that Spiderman with his new tech suit (ooops) will become more like ironman than Spiderman.That being said story was good and a glancing mention was given to the radioactive spider so it wasn't just another rewind.I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this version of Spiderman but in parts I did (yes in parts) but in other parts I'm afraid it didn't inspire and just lacked luster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"Coming back from a mission with Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr) Peter Parker (Tom Holland) waits for a call from Happy Hogan (Jon Faveau) Tony Stark's right hand man to go on another mission with the Avengers. We never do learn what that mission was but Peter Parker wants to become a member of the Avengers. In the meantime he must attend High School and as Spiderman he cruises his neighborhood to handle petty crimes or to help people. Spiderman breaks up an ATM theft, and discovers the weapons used are alien in function. He tries to warn Happy, but is not successfulThis must be some kind of reboot of Spiderman. Many things are different. Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is a young hottie, without husband. Ned (Jacob Batalon) his HS chum discovers that Peter is Spiderman. Peter has a love interest in Liz (Laura Harrier) and we find out later that her father is bad guy Adrian/Vulture (Michael Keaton), who was a salvage contractor who is shut down by Local government official Ann Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly). The Avengers battled and beat aliens called the Chitauri and much of alien equipment is salvageable. Adrian decides to keep much of the alien equipment and makes weapons out of them and later turns himself into Vulture.We will see that Tony Stark doesn't have all the confidence in 15- year old Peter Parker and takes back the special suit he gave Peter. Peter feels he is nothing without the suit and this disappoints Tony Stark. Somewhat shaken Peter Parker goes it alone to take down Adrian and his organization and learns that it isn't the suit that helps him.Notables : Stan Lee as an apartment tenant who shout s out a window; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and we see her very briefly near the end of the movie; Chris Evan as Captain America, but we just see him in a TV motivational presentation for high school students.This is actually very good, a little too long, perhaps, but very good nevertheless. The CGI is fantastic and the music helps things along too.Stay after the credits run to heart stomping music to see an additional scene with Adrian in prison. Why they put it after the credits is beyond me.With this new reboot we should see more of a more mature (he did turn down Tony Stark's invitation to stay at Tony's new place with the Avengers) Spiderman and maybe with the Avengers too. Should be good too. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
i heart spidey,":) i heart spidey. this movie was very different from previous versions. i liked the changes for the most part. very funny and well-made overall. well-told story, good heart. it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies, but that is expected in the first installation, so they can have room to get bigger and better. tom holland is a perfect peter parker and spidey. this movie addressed so many flaws in the previous versions. and it had a good villain. i couldn't really see him being in a live-action movie before this.after having watched this multiple times, it kind of lost its vigor. i think the biggest problems is that none of the actions scenes are very good. they're not terrible, but they don't stand out at all, no jaw dropping moments, nothing that wowed me. it's still a very good movie, but it seems to lose a little on every viewing, the opposite of my experience with guardians 1 (5 viewings, 5/6/2020)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not what I'd hoped for,"There are moments, but his is easily the worst Avenger's related movie to date. I never read Marvel comics, I was always a DC guy. Or I should say kid as I left them behind pretty young. But the Avenger's movies have been pretty good.Nothing against the actors, who are all quite personable, especially the leads, but there's just something off about the whole approach. Exactly how long does it take to convey teen angst? Get on with it for heaven's sake. Like many a modern movie, this one's too long and filled with characters and scenes that could've been omitted. The Avengers flicks can get away with this because all the heroes are interesting. Peter's school chums, not so much.From what I understand, Spiderman fans might find this truer to the spirit of the original character, but non-fans will probably wonder what happened to their Avenger movie. In that vein, this is the first that isn't on my re-watch list.Ultimately, for my taste--completely forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Tom Holland soars but Marvel stumbles,"Marvel has had a dream run with exciting, engaging films until meddling with the latest reboot of Spider-Man. Instead of expanding the universe, this ho-hum exercise in Marvel franchising wastes the considerable talents of Tom Holland while working an increasingly tired Iron-Man tone into proceedings. The film is salvaged by the performers from Michael Keaton to Zendaya, who are able to bring an engagement the Marvel heavy footprints crush with their self-serving empire building.The story is deliberately Lo-Fi, aiming for a point of difference within the recent film history by scaling back the action and emotions. This works surprisingly well in the high school and home settings but undermines the intensity of set-piece sequences which, instead of building the excitement, come off as distinctly average CGI scenes. DC took the lead for me in Super-Hero movie magic with Wonder Woman, combining action, drama and emotion with intensity. The problem with Spider-Man Homecoming is the lack of potency for the plot development, the investment doesn't have great pay-offs.On the plus side, letting the film be better than it deserves to be, Tom Holland does make Spider-Man his own character despite the teen-movie conventions and Marvel tyranny. The refreshing take on Peter Parker's high school friends works in the film's favour with good performances from the young cast, especially Zendaya. Michael Keaton does well to add dimensions to a fairly standard villain. Maris Tomei, however, isn't quite right as Aunt Mae which is a script and plotting issue rather than a performance one.The production has made much of the local setting being true to the comics, but the lack of narrative drive takes away from the many promising elements. It's not a bad film, just an average one. It lacks genuine threat, suspense, tension and engaging excitement. Thankfully, the cast push this one beyond the Marvel Franchise limitations, offering hope for future films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
From Hero to Bumbling Idiot,"Spider-Man is supposed to be a slightly immature, but very skilled, and intelligent high-school student. This movie makes Iron Man into the very skilled and intelligent father figure that underestimates Spider-man. Spider-Man (who should be the one teaching Iron Man ALL the lessons), into the one learning from Iron Man, whom Spider-Man idolizes like some bimbo blond would idolize a rock star. The movie makes Spider-Man into a slightly nerdy teenager and a really incompetent hero.The really incompetent hero spin is what totally ruined the movie - right up there with Ant-Man. Spider-Man was a great comic hero, but this movie makes Spider-Man into a Bumbling Idiot.All they needed to do was use the Vulture villain vs. the mature Spider-Man created in previous movies.

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"Spider-Man: Homecoming, directed by Jon Watts, crafted this super fun, laid-back, coming of age Spider-Man film! Jon Watts is the man for the job! You can tell that he knows his Spider-Man, adding so many great, yet subtle, comic book references, that gives the film countless memorable moments! Watts incorporated that Marvel vibe, but his style was heavy handed for the better, giving us a great origin story, while not making it the origin we already know. Watts had so many great ideas for the film, but made sure to keep everything as grounded as possible, knowing what the film is, and not overshooting. Watts did a great job setting this light-hearted tone, with smooth transitions into some darker tones, but for a Spider-Man film, Watts seemed to play it pretty safe, keeping the risks and consequences to a minimum, and tying in too much subtle exposition.The creative team executed the Spider-Man characters perfectly! The whole cast shines bright, capturing that perfect, teen-comedy tone. We have to start off by talking about Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Himself, and the creative team worked tirelessly to recreate the Spider-Man character as a whole, and they created the best one yet! They grasped the complete idea of Spider-Man and Peter Parker, almost to a T, being grounded and humanized, yet so full of heart and charisma! The charm Holland brings to the character is so pure, stealing every scene that he's in! Inevitably, he had the best character arch of the film, having a cliche, yet powerful build up as Spider-Man. This faithful take was just a breath of fresh air, showing tremendous heart and potential for the saga. I was a little skeptical about Robert Downey Jr. returning as Iron Man for this film, but he absolutely works, letting Tom Holland take a lot of the spotlight. All he adds is a beautiful compliment to Holland's character, while building this genuine bond they built over a very short period of time. Jon Favreau also returns as Happy Hogan, and he is just great, man! He doesn't have a whole lot of screen time, or stuff to do, but he adds a great deal of humor to every scene he's in, complimenting Tom Holland well. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was definitely the odd-ball casting of the film, but after a little bit of time, it was easy to adjust to, because she brings a big likability to the character. Zendaya's character was an original take that will work for most, but not for some strict comic book fans, that only want to see recreations of the comics. The film could've benefited by giving her more to do, because she comes off pretty snarky, and uninteresting for almost the entire film. Jacob Batalon as Ned, is a much needed compliment to Tom Holland, adding a lot of humor to the film. Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, is another fresh and fun addition to the film, serving his purpose decently, with the small amount of screen time he had. Michael Keaton as the Vulture, has to be the most fun addition to this film, not just because of the talent he brings to the set, but due to his past film, Birdman. Keaton fits really well into the scheme of the MCU, being one of the better villains of the saga. His connection and motive to Peter Parker is one of the best selling points to his character, bringing an extreme amount of intensity to their feud. The biggest issue I have with his character, because there was so many other small villains they wanted to introduce, Keaton's character went a little underdeveloped. He had such a meaningful message behind his character, that made me care for him, but due to his lack of screen time, he didn't get as much characterization as he could've. Michael Keaton makes the absolute best of what he was given, and you can tell he had a blast playing the Vulture.The screenplay by Jon Watts and some other new faces in the MCU, in John Francis Daley, Christopher Ford, Johnathan Goldstein, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, crafted a well written script, while being one of the funniest films of the MCU. You can tell that they took their time writing everything out, trying to make everything as cohesive as possible.As far as the action goes, it was really fun, being well shot, but there just wasn't enough of it, while not having that grittiness and risks the first three films had.Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is one of my favorite films of the MCU, well deserving to be close to the top of the list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Solid reboot saddled with franchise setup,"When ""Homecoming"" is actually about its hero, it's a lot of fun. And I think the reason it wasn't quite amazing is that I was expecting a Spider-Man movie, not another billboard for upcoming MCU movies. It needed less Iron Man and Avengers movie shoutouts, which distract from the good stuff.But it's that good stuff where the film excels and that's due in large part to casting Tom Holland in the lead role. He delivers on the promise of that teaser appearance in ""Civil War"". And it strikes just the right coming-of-age tone; Peter belongs in high school. Michael Keaton plays the heavy with great sneer, and Marisa Tomei is exactly what you'd expect as a younger Aunt May (plus, she offers one of the greatest closing lines I've ever heard). These are great spins on classic characters. Throw in what's gotta be the funniest use of Captain America in a Marvel movie, and there's a lot to like here.It's a purely functional reboot, I just wish they'd let Spider-Man stand on his own.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Nothing without an origin!,"One Spider-Man too many and built around a multiverse which added fuel to the fire of total meltdown. Fair play Sam Raimi was obviously going to be a tough act to follow, but at least get the foundations right first. Otherwise all you are left with is a generic superhero movie with style over substance. Okay so we already know how Peter Parker develops into Spider-Man, so can we cut to the chase? Perfect... Well actually not quite! Where Jon Watts fails in his reincarnation or reboot in my opinion is running before he can walk. Previously in Captain America Civil War Spider-Man was given a mission by Mr Stark, so yes evidently, yes, he was already Spider-Man in the timeline. However, I believe a flashback or a narration of the death of Uncle Ben would suffice, adding a bit more volume to the character. This version of Parker is very comedic and has very little in the way of emotional impact or depth. Where is that traumatic experience that pushes him over the edge to become Spider-Man in the first place? Don't get me wrong I know we have already seen this in Maguire's or say Garfield's Spider-Men, still, it just feels too flat to have nothing. Another issue is the technology Stark hands him, at times it's funny with the Alexa like Karen voice prompting Peter to tell Liz how he feels, or the fact he skips training because, yeah who really needs that! But evidently when it's all said a done it rather does genuinely feel like he is nothing without the suit, as quoted! It's interesting how the trend of being 'such a Karen' seems relative in this. Meaning white privileged middle class entitled woman or so I hear as of late. Is this the reason Peter names his device Karen? Joking aside, why does Hollywood feel the need to make every film cultural at the moment? Who exactly is this Ned character, I've never heard of him? Fair play I don't read the comics but still I'm sure you get my point here. I'm surprised they haven't added a character from the LGBT community. The script for me appears discombobulated at times not entirely sure of what it wants to be. This is partly due to the tick box that needs to be fulfilled in order to make it suitable within the Marvel cinematic universe. This film often feels like a time filler leaving Keatons Vulture seeming somewhat small or irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.Left to clean up the mess the Avengers left behind Michael Keaton (The Vulture Adrian Toomes) is the saving grace of this film, although he only has a limited amount of time onscreen and his character isn't developed well enough by the scriptwriter. For example why does he turn to crime after working in construction? The simple answer is, he is so mad after getting thrown off the project of cleaning up the disaster in New York left by the Avengers. Is this really a feasible reason to go full out villain all of a sudden? (Tom Holland) is a mighty fine Peter Parker and more around the age bracket I'd imagine Spider-Man to be. Still, he is given one of the weakest Spider-Man stories so far, his challenge is to wait for Mr Stark to call with a mission. Really? Is this what has become of our friendly neighbourhood Spidey? At times this film seems like a mockery, a spoof of everything that wouldn't be welcome from avid Spider-Man fans. I'm a take it or leave it kinda guy, yet I can clearly see Spider-Man has been sacrificed a little, a footnote surrounding a much bigger plan, that plan is the Avengers. What Michael Keaton brings in his antagonist is character and believability, however he lacks duration to fully perfect it. (Robert Downey Jr.) Tony Stark is practically Mr Marvel at this point, they clearly latched onto the fact he was their big seller and evolved the universe around him, sometimes at the expense of other heroes. He pops up now and then to warn Peter of how he isn't ready to take on the universe and become an Avenger yet. (Marisa Tomei) is a much younger attractive May Parker, who oddly gets hit on a few times. Not sure why this was necessary but hey ho, let's go and all that! At this point I'm thinking the creative team went ahead with a board meeting saying, how can we make this third reboot of Spider-Man so different and distant from the previous ones that people are gonna love it? Often people don't like too much unnecessary change though, change for the sake of change, mostly people prefer a touch of nostalgia.I find some of the school cast obnoxious at best, particularly Ned's fanboy act as well as the annoyance of Peter actually having a close friend in the first place. Parker always appears better as an outcast bullied nerd trying to survive high school. Now, we have two seen to be loser nerds and a third who occasional shows up at their dinning table claiming she isn't even there half the time in Michelle (Zendaya). Now we all know Zendaya is a talents young actress, unfortunately this film does very little to show that, giving her crazy one liners from time to time and leaving it till the very end to reveal her true character right before the credits. Liz (Laura Harrier) is a smoking mirror in the love life of Peter Parker, although she has very little chemistry with him. Then there is Peters bully Flash (Tony Revolori) who is barely even a bully at all.I'd like to conclude by saying it isn't terrible hence the rating of six. The visuals are good and score isn't bad either, it's the most important part which suffers, the story. As far as it goes for a Spider-Man film though this is scrapping the barrel of what I've come to expect. Spider Spoof take one and action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man: Homecoming Review,"Spider-Man has been one of my favourite superheroes of all time. While many grew up on the old Batman or Superman films, Rami's Spider-Man trilogy was my superhero films. And while now I see flaws in the third installment, the first and second still stand as not only two of my favourite superhero movies of all time, but my favourite movies of all time.Spider-Man Homecoming does something different to the other Spider-Man films and they absolutely nailed it. Previous films have had most of the focus around Peter being Spider-Man while also being a student. Homecoming flips this. We see Peter as a student who just happens to be Spider-Man. By far this was my favourite aspect of the film. Marvel have continued the trend of diving into new sub-genres. Because of the high school aspect, this movie is very much a coming of age story where previous ones have been mainly an origin story. Due to this coming of age angle, I feel that we know Peter more as a character than we ever have before and less of just the guy who is behind the mask.Despite a lot of focus going on Peter himself, I still think they did a great job of fleshing him out as Spider-Man. As we know from the trailers, we see Peter learning to use his new suit and I feel like they played those scenes really well being not only does it show Peter at times feeling out of his comfort zone with the suit, but you see him as a character feeling out of his comfort zone being a superhero.Humour is something we have come to expect from Marvel movies and this movie was no different, however I thought they really changed it up. While there were still the quips and one liners, being a movie that is centred around high school life, they had high school humour. The jokes the students were telling were different to the types of jokes a teach would tell. In many ways, it felt a though a high schooler had written the jokes for this movie. There was puns and play on words and a touch of that immature humour that we wouldn't get in any other movie where an adult is the main focus.Moving onto the cast, I thought they were all fantastic. Tom Holland is officially now my favourite Spider-Man. While much of the reason why is because of the writing and the story around it, I felt that he really nailed the Peter aspect of the character as well as being suited to being the fast talking, quipy Spider-Man. The return of Jon Favreau as Happy was very well suited to bounce of Holland's Parker. Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori and Zendaya all nailed their specific roles as high schoolers in Peter's life.I really need to take the time to talk about the two big names of this film, Michael Keaton and Robert Downey Jr. Firstly, I thought Michael Keaton was amazing. It's not often that we come out of a Marvel movie and the villain is one of the stand outs but in this case he was. While much of the credit goes towards the writing and backstory of this villain, Keaton was able to portray the emotion and presence needed to sell us on the Vulture. Secondly, any fears people had about RDJ being a massive part of this film will be brushed away. I wasn't specifically keeping count of how many times he appeared, but his total number of scenes but it would have been no more than maybe 5 or 6. What really worked with those scenes were that story wise, it made sense that Tony was there. Tony is very much the father figure of Peter and I think RDJ really nailed that role, considering that this is a side of Tony we haven't seen a lot of.Like most Marvel movies, they are filled with easter eggs. I in no way consider myself close to a Marvel expect, but there was quite a few that I picked up on which makes me feel like there are going to be so many more that I missed. Most of the eggs are off handed references amongst dialog or in the background that don't take away from what is happening in the scene.There are two reveals/twists that his movie has which I thought were both great. One of them many people already assume is going to be revealed in some way, however there is another that completely caught me by surprise. What is most important about that reveal is it up the stakes level for the third act. It got you more invested because you knew that what was going on means so much more than it did before.While I do have a few problems with the film, I think most of them is just personal expectations I had going into it, rather than straight forward film problems. Personally I would of liked to have seen a bit more of Donald Glover, Marisa Tomei and Hannibal Buress, but I understand why they were pushed aside for the most part in this story. On the flip side of that though, I think both Glover and Tomei are going to play a role in the future of Spider-Man in the MCU so that gets me excited for the future.Overall, it's hard to say where this ranks among the other Spider-Man films for me. I know it rates above many of them, but only time will tell if it will overtake the first 2 Rami films. However, this is still an amazing movie that I know I am going to revisit time and time again.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man: Homecoming Spins a New Web,"Only a mere 15 years ago, I was astonished to see Spider-Man's first big appearance on the big screen played by Tobey Maguire. While that trilogy hasn't aged too well, there was a fresh energy still there when superhero films began to take a more human route. The Amazing Spider-Man films, however, lacked any real impact or relevancy for me. So Spider-Man: Homecoming had a lot riding on the film more than just ""we got Spidey home"".When I saw Tom Holland in CA: Civil War, I felt a breath of fresh air as a younger Spider-Man driven and hungry to prove his abilities. And that driving force in his character is played well throughout the film, even when the film admits he's still very inexperienced and still needs help being in control. Placing him in Queens where the buildings aren't as high so it forces him to stay closer to the ground and have to get around town in his suit like everyone else. Michael Keaton does a solid job as the winged villain (probably his 3rd or 4th or maybe even 20th time playing a winged character in his lifetime), who is a blue collared salvager struggling trying to provide for his family (despite questionably good living conditions that I personally couldn't shake). Luckily Tony Stark's character doesn't stand overarching in the film as much as the trailers make it seem either and does bring some needed father figure dynamic to the MCU.Zendaya and Jacob Batalon play as Peter's few friends which are both uniquely as nerdy and socially awkward as he is and allows for some of the films consistent laughs. I think one of the things that may shake audiences a bit is that the film does have slow periods pretty often, and while these moments don't really feel like the film dragging its feet, it doesn't really feel like it's moving fast enough either. Also the emotional impact, is just okay. It never feels flat or bad, but just not as impactful as it feels it should or need (which I notice more and more in the MCU).Spider-Man Homecoming is more of what I wished the 2012 reboot was in getting straight to the point with the character and bringing fresh new energy. It is the strongest of Spidey solo films since Spider-Man 2, and hints that ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" won't be leaving town anytime soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"With an excellently cast Spidey, Homecoming swings High, but not as High as other Marvel entries.","After the relative disappointment of the Amazing Spider-Man films, Spider-Man Homecoming is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's well acted and directed, with the best version of Spider-Man to date, although it does feel like something's missing. The tone is one of the things I particularly admired in this film; I could really relax, and have a good time. The high school element element was also invigorating, and felt like a good move on the studio's part as well. The script and story are adequate, and the humour charming if leaned on a little too heavily. But the cast, well directed by John Watts is what really impressed me in Homecoming. Tom Holland is the Perfect Peter Parker, and is genuinely hilarious and lovable throughout the film. The Vulture is a great villain, with Michael Keaton making you uneasy with every word that came out of his mouth. Jacob Batalon is sparky as Ned, and RDJ is once again on fine form as Tony Stark, albeit in a smaller role in the film. A criticism I would make is that the relationship between Peter and his love interest Liz (portrayed by Laura Harrier) feels extremely strained. Something that did trouble me walking out of the cinema was that whilst the film was great, it did feel like it was missing something; perhaps it was darker elements, or even emotional scenes. Overall however, Homecoming is a success, and undoubtedly a welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and an installment that will please Spider-Man fans without question.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not very original, but still lots of fun","I got to hand it to marvel, they manage to spew out one good movie after the other. I don't think i have rated any of their movies bad the last 10 years, but a few have been mediocre.Spider-man: Homecoming is good, but not exceptional in any way really. What we get is a story about a boy and a girl that is told the exact same way as hundreds of times before it. But even though it is quite predictable and unoriginal it has a lot of entertainment value.To get some of the bad of my chest. There is not enough screen time for Micheal Keaton in this film, he does so well as vulture, and i just wanted to see more of him. But instead we see too much of his crew. That is a bad move, because this film has a lot to cover in 2 hours, even though we skip everything that made Peter Parker into spider-man in the first place, there is several stories that is being told here.I think that they did a good job of cramming all the information into the film, but i can't by help thinking, the story should have been different. I just think we spend a little bit too much time with Tony Stark, and much of that time should have been with Keaton.Tom Holland does a phenomenal job though, he is the right choice to play this role. He has a great wits about him, and he is playful and energetic, and nerdy. All the traits you need from Spidey.Marisa Tomei is one of my all time favorite actresses, but in this film she doesn't have much to work with. If you have seen Marisa Tomei act, you know how good she is, and it is a real waste of talent to have so little time for her in this film. But since Keaton also has too little time, Marisa should probably just have been dropped from the film all together.Marvel has done a great thing with the MCU, how they manage to web all these films together and keep it entertaining is truly admirable. But Spider-Man: Homecoming is a bit weaker than films like ""The Avengers"", ""Guardian of the Galaxy"", and ""Captain America: Civil War"". Maybe it also has something to do with all the spider-man films that has been released past 15 years. Maybe they should have just dropped the Andrew Garfield films and given spidey some time to become really interesting again. Because Spider-man: Homecoming feels oddly boring at times, even in some of the action scenes. It's the feeling of ""Been there, done that, seen that"".But even though the film is weaker than many DCU films, it is not a bad film. It definitely has it's moments, and Holland is really fun to watch. And Keaton is damn good. You get 2 hours of pure entertainment, with all the action you'd expect from a Marvel film. And it is executed quite well, with pretty great cinematography, awesome special effects and great hero music. So the movie is not a downer, plenty to see here for all superhero fans.7/10 - Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst films I've ever seen,"I recently decided to rewatch it, to see if it was as good as I remembered, and it definitely wasn't in my opinion. Even the talent of Michael Keaton was wasted in this film, there was no redeeming characteristics. I found that it had no interesting elements, and no characters were likeable, it was a boring slog that I only found enjoyment from when making fun of it with my friend. I felt that it was a soulless film in my opinion, having nothing interesting to offer.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man: Homecoming proves that Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-man,"The enduring presence of Spiderman on the big screen over the past fifteen years presumably caused a little fatigue once news spread of the third depiction of the crime-fighting hero. However, Spiderman: Homecoming fails to induce such feelings as the exuberant Tom Holland masters the role as Peter Parker in almost every way. After seeing him briefly in Captain America: Civil War and now under the wings of Marvel Studios, the introduction of Spiderman into the ever-expanding MCU proves to be an incredibly entertaining ride.Spiderman: Homecoming is a very well directed film, as Jon Watts gives us a joyful adventure of the teenager Peter Parker who troubles to find the balance between his personal and superhero life. Still consumed by the actions he took against the likes of Captain America in Civil War, Peter Parker becomes a desperate man, hoping to join the Avengers and impress Tony Stark aka Iron Man, who acts as his mentor. It is with this mentality that he becomes entrenched into the Spiderman persona that has severe ramifications on his social life, both at home and at school. And as the nerdy and unpopular teenager, he uses his hidden persona to define his own sense of duty and morals. As seen in one of the trailers, Tony Stark chastises Peter, quoting, ""If your nothing without this suit, you shouldn't have it"". Tom Holland develops great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr in all their scenes, however, Tony Starks appearance doesn't shy away from the fact that this is a Spiderman film. This is a film that is grounded to Spiderman, and Spiderman only.His high school story was very intriguing to watch, as we meet Ned (Jacob Batalon) who aids Peter Parker as his nerdy and funny best friend, Michelle (Zendaya) as the quirky, yet the lonely student who stands in the background, and Liz (Laura Harrier), Peter's accessible love interest. With Spiderman, Peter becomes less involved with the school, causing dysfunctional relationships to occur between him and many other students. Likewise at home with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), who we see Peter become more distant with her as his agendas begin to take over.The main villain, the Vulture, is unlike many of Marvel's villains, in that he is the most human out of all of them. He despises the rich and the powerful messing up the lives of those below them, in this case, Tony Stark and he cares deeply about his family, wanting to do everything in his power to keep them safe and happy. His backstory, seen in the opening of the film, and the effects of his actions proves that Adrian Toomes (his hidden persona) has more redeeming qualities than one might expect of a villain. Michael Keaton brilliantly plays the role, adding hidden depths rarely seen in a Superhero villain.Of course, every movie comes with its negatives, however, those in Homecoming are only minor. I would've like to see more of Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover, and possibly some other secondary characters, yet I do see them playing a major role in the future of Spiderman. Another minor problem was the music score by Michael Giacchino, who actually created some really good music pieces, but I personally felt that it wasn't enough to lift it even further to something more memorable.Overall, the action was solid, yet the film serves better as a character-driven story rather than the usual action we tend to see in other Marvel movies which may disappoint some fans. However, comic book films are about the characters and Spiderman: Homecoming accomplishes that extremely well. Tom Hollands gifts us with a great performance of the crime-fighting, friendly neighborhood Spiderman, accompanied by a great villain acted superbly by Michael Keaton, and a host of secondary characters that really complete a very well written film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Engaging Enough,"This is the first ""Marvel"" movie Iv watched since I was like 12 so maybe it's my own fault but I felt like I'd been dropped in on the 2nd movie when I guess this is meant to be like the first of a new trilogy. It confused me. In someways I sort of agreed that we didn't need an origin story but in others it sort of made me lost.The film was fine. It kept me invested for the most part. It didn't really have any interesting angles but it was perfectly watchable.My biggest issue was the joke book quips. Ugh they were so bad. It was like video game punch up line. So bizarre.I don't know who's fault this was but another issue I had was spider man felt like he was 7 years old. He was like a giddy kid who has too much fizzy drinks and sweets. And he spoke like a baby? It really confused me. I get maybe someone wanted to make him have this Naïveté about him but he just came across as like a giddy 7 year old.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Homecoming like a breeze,"It was obvious that things were going to be different when MARVEL Studio took the rights of Spiderman from Sony. MARVEL had to step in to save the sinking franchise as it seemed Sony wasn't really sure of what it was doing after The Amazing Spiderman 2. Most were treated to a pleasant surprise in Captain America: Civil War with a much younger version of Spiderman than the earlier films. Spiderman: Homecoming is a refreshing take to match the taste of current MARVEL audiences without compromising the originality of the character.In this movie, there is no dark origin story of the character Peter Parker. He is mentored by Tony Stark and with Stark's help Peter Parker fights neighborhood crimes under the so called 'Stark Internship'. However, things start to take a turn when Peter Parker discovers a gang of criminals lead by the Vulture, utilizing hi-tech weapons which were recovered from the intergalactic battle in the Avengers. He tries to take them on his own, which hampers his relationship with Stark and he loses the internship. The rest of the movie is how Spiderman proves himself to regain the trust of Stark and also stop the Vulture from doing further damage.The 'MARVELisation' of the Spiderman is clearly evident in most of the scenes. Spiderman wears the suit made by Stark Enterprises, which can do things that can blow everyone's minds. Director Jon Watts also makes sure not to disappoint hardcore Spiderman fans by, bringing back the simple old suit in the end. The humour and sarcasm totally reminds us of the recent MARVEL movies which is no surprise. The role of Aunt May has been as glamorous as ever just like other female characters in the recent MARVEL universe. The action sequences are crisp and are really worth a watch in 3D. However the intensity of the film is quite low compared to any other MARVEL films these days, which was slightly disappointing for me.There is one word to describe Tom Holland as Spiderman: Adorable. Marisaa Tomei as a very toned down Aunt May will surely raise eyebrows as she does in the movie itself. Robert Downey Junior might not have much to play as the mentor Stark in the movie, but he is as cool as ever. Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan plays a significant part. Jacob Batalon as Spiderman's best mate Ned manages to tickle some funny bones. Although the negative role Vulture is not so well written, Michael Keaton dominates the part. The movie also has a very diverse casting and is very evident in the characters from Peter Parker's high school played by young actors Tony Revolori, Zendaya and Laura Harrier.Spiderman: Homecoming is a pleasant 'homecoming' for MARVEL's spidy. It will be very interesting to see how MARVEL takes his character forward to the next Avengers' movies as the rights for the Spiderman sequel is back with Sony again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great fun with a few flaws,"'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a fun venture into the Marvel adaptation of the character, but it isn't without it's flaws. A few casting choices were baffling, and I don't feel that they delved enough into Peter's character, but this is certainly Spider-Man's best on-screen representation since 2004. With great action, a compelling villain, and the great balance between Peter Parker and Spider-Man, I definitely recommend 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' to Spider-Man fans and casual audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Comic book Spiderman makes a comeback,"This thoroughly entertaining new take on the long-loved Marvel hero unexpectedly succeeds without taking itself too seriously nor turning the story into a silly gag- fest.As the title character, Tom Holland naturally needs to carry the film, and he does it with all the youthful energy and charm he can possibly through at the camera, not leaving a stone unturned to sell the role. It is a bit of a stretch to have him play a 15-year-old, but the only time it took me out of the movie was when he literally claimed he's 15 years old. Should have cut that one out.This incarnation of Spiderman is tonally as meta as Deadpool, although not as outrageous and violent. A hugely popular duo among comic book crowd, these two feel instantly such a perfect fit on screen that there could well be a joint Deadpool/Spiderman outing in the pipeline. Well, at least as soon as Peter becomes -hmm- ""legal"".There is really not much negative to say about this delightful Spiderman reboot. Those worrying to see yet another uncle Ben death scene need to rest assured he's not even mentioned in the movie. Even the traditional Marvel shortcoming, a convincing villain, works this time around, thanks to the quietly menacing but not heartless or rootless performance by Micheal Keaton, getting yet another chance to fly on the screen.The one thing to complain about is that I was a bit unimpressed by the score. It didn't feel in tune with the movie, often rushing to underline emotions when no underlining was needed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
No,"This is not your father's Spiderman, nor your father's Peter Parker. This is not Stan Lee's or Steve Ditko's Spiderman either, although Stan does make his expected cameo... and I expect will be cashing a fat royalty check any day now.And this sure as hell is not anyone's Aunt May. (Can I just say how great it is to see Marisa Tomei, whom I have always had a crush on... but not as Aunt May. Come on already.)I cannot accept a Peter Parker who is not capable of making his own suit. I cannot accept a Peter Parker who is so in awe of any other super hero as this one is in awe of Tony Stark. I cannot accept a Peter Parker who has a pudgy side kick. No Jonah Jameson? No Daily Bugle?Why did Marvel Studios feel like it had to remake so many of the basic elements of Peter's story? The Lee/Ditko creation was pretty successful, don't you think?Yes, the screenplay otherwise was well written. Yes, Tom Holland plays an excellent Peter/Spidey. Yes, Michael Keaton was great as the Vulture. And the effects were as they should be. So I give four stars out of ten for the four things that were right about this picture.Too many things wrong with the overall vision of Marvel Studio's Spiderman.

"A review of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) isn't a bad movie. To the contrary, it's a very good one — I would even rate it a 9 out of 10, if a little reluctantly.The action, humor, surprises and special effects are all top-notch; it's got a slew of fun Easter eggs and great continuity within the Marvel Cinematic Universe; and Michael Keaton hits it out of the park as the story's villain. (As Ed Harris did recently with HBO's ""Westworld,"" the sublimely likable Keaton really surprised me with how he could become so intimidating.) Furthermore, the screenwriters wisely omit another redundant re-telling of the web- slinger's origin. (Even a die-hard fan like me is sick of seeing or reading about it.)I think your enjoyment of this movie might vary according to what you want Spider-Man to be. This isn't a movie in which Peter Parker or his alter ego stand out as his own man (despite its plot resolution's heavy-handed efforts to tell us that). I submit that it's fairly undistinguished as a standalone superhero film — it feels like an ancillary, companion film to the ""Avengers"" movies, including last year's de facto installment, ""Captain America: Civil War."" Indeed, fan-favorite Tony Stark is ""Spider-Man: Homecoming's"" most significant supporting character — far more than any of the many friends, family, love interests or villains that have long inhabited the iconic hero's mythos. Peter's primary motivation throughout the movie is his desire to become an Avenger, like a normal kid would aspire to the varsity football team. Many of his powers stem from a ultra-high-tech costume designed and given to him by Iron Man; it even has an advanced A.I. that is a femme fatale equivalent of J.A.R.V.I.S. (Fun fact: that alluring voice belongs to none other than the alluring Jennifer Connelly. The actress is the wife of Paul Bettany, who is the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. and then the actor portraying The Vision. And Connelly herself played the love interest of 1991's mostly forgotten ""The Rocketeer,"" a World War II-era hero with the a similar character concept to Iron Man.)I was a big fan of Spider-Man in the 1990's, and, believe me, the ol' web-head did just fine with his own powers, intelligence and character — and without any sort of ""internship"" with Iron Man, either metaphorically or otherwise. He was also a far more popular character with readers. I was buying comics regularly between 1991 and 1996 — while Spider-Man books and merchandise were everywhere, I don't think I ever remember seeing an ""Iron Man"" comic on the racks at my local comic shop. I kept thinking inwardly of Spider-Man during this movie as ""Iron Man Jr.,"" and, for me, that wasn't a good thing.I also found myself musing during the film that this felt like ""Spider-Man Lite."" While ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was fun, it doesn't have the depth, character development or gravitas of the Sam Raimi trilogy. (Yes, I even liked the third one, despite its bizarre flaws.) I know that critics are praising the movie's lighter tone, and I realize the need to avoid a simple rehash of the Raimi films. (Nobody would want that; we can rightfully expect more from the excellent MCU.) I actually prefer the Raimi films, though. While Tom Holland might be the better Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire was a strange casting choice), the Raimi movies were more  heartfelt. They were an earnest exploration of the Spider-Man of the comics, and they felt  truer. ""Homecoming,"" in contrast, is yet another cool installment in the ""Avengers"" series. ""Spider Man 2"" came out 13 years ago, and I can still remember how that movie made me feel — not to mention how its sheer quality vindicated ""comic book movies"" like no other film before it. This new movie will not be memorable that way.Anyway, although my criticisms above are obviously lengthy, please know that this is only because I love the source material so much — and we comic book fans have a tendency to analyze. I certainly enjoyed the movie, and I'd cheerfully recommend it. (Note my rating.) The MCU continues to entertain with quality movies; its consistency, even with its expanding group of ongoing Netflix series, is kind of astonishing.Go see this. You'll have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

They contain content appealing to general public as well as critique, but are not for people of my type. Speaking about this movie, amongst all the trailers and movie I liked the first trailer the most, it conveyed teen love and had beautiful music from song MGMT - Time to Pretend .Acting was above average, although at the place where I saw, lacked subtitles. I wished if those were there.The spiderman suit logic was good. It made sense of having such a suit which was not sewn but gifted (better logic as compared to previous movies).Music was average. To - many people, the music might be good, but to me, I come from a land rich in that area (music). And thus music in my view, in the movie was average.

"Pleasant to the eyes and ears, this film tried to escape a little from the standard of the comic strip films.","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects.

Fun and no Uncle Ben,"Finally, we get a new actor playing Spider-Man who doesn't have to watch Uncle Ben die. Don't get me wrong, I love watching Uncle Ben get murdered as much as the next movie-goer, but we all have to admit those Uncle Ben deaths were starting to weigh heavy on our minds, much unlike Spider-Man's webs, which are light yet strong.We finally get an answer to the question that's nagged me the most about Spider-Man: how does he get around when there are no buildings nearby to shoot his webs onto and swing from? Spider-Man surely would be at a disadvantage on an open battlefield, or even a regular field.We also now know where Spider-Man keeps his extra web juice, and I have to admit my ignorance here because I thought, you know, as Spider-Man, he generated his own web juice, or at least knew a guy who could make it on the cheap. Then again, after a long day of shooting your web juice all over town, it makes sense that you'd run out eventually, the law of conservation of matter being applicable to the Marvel Universe and what not.Spider-Man is 15 and struggles with fun teen times such as social awkwardness, curfews, dating, identity issues, and the desire to make a meaningful contribution to society. The villain is a hardened, simple man trying to make ends meet for his family and employees, with a bit of maudlin jealousy towards Peter Parker, possibly pining for a simpler time when your whole life is ahead of you, and aliens weren't trying to destroy the earth, galaxy, or universe.Why is Tony Stark in this movie? He doesn't trust Peter Parker with any real responsibility, and does little to tingle one's Spidey senses. Perhaps this is a parallel for Marvel Studios not trusting Tom Holland to carry a movie by himself, even though he likely would have done just fine without the extra star power. He convincingly plays a teenage dork who thinks it's really cool to be Spider-man, despite the perpetual threat of death or severe beatings.Despite the perpetual threat of Spider-Man movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Conveniences and Fun,"Spider-Man: Homecoming follows Peter Parker as he attempts to take down an organization in his city to prove to the Avengers that he can be one of them.Unlike in the previous Captain America movie where I found Spider- Man immensely annoying, in his solo movie he actually proved to be quite good. It's clear that he's putting a lot of energy into his role and having a lot of fun with it. His character is pretty eccentric, and seeing him being able to pull off this character in a solo movie is really refreshing. Plus the writing for his character is a lot of fun too. He's a nice, younger break from the other movies.The movie as a whole is a lot of fun. The other actors are good and again, clearly having fun, the action sequences are fast and entertaining, it's all a good time. The only problem with this fact is the lack of stakes. It never seems like Spider-Man is actually in danger, there's always some convenient thing there to make sure nothing bad happens. The amount of problems Spider-Man actually fixes himself are incredibly small next to the amount of plot conveniences. Something bad will happen and immediately be fixed by some convenient, semi-connected to barely connected thing. It was too convenient to believe on multiple occasions, and I just didn't dig that.There was one scene in the movie, closer to the end that involved a major villain and the love interest that I knew was supposed to be super intense and serious, but I just couldn't help laughing the entire way through. It felt like the movie suddenly became a sitcom for those ten minutes. The scene was totally out of place and so clichéd to the point where the audience can't actually predict it. It's a cliché that's been done to death, so most filmmakers know not to include it in a movie anymore. I'm not saying it was a bad twist, but it sure was a funny one. Where my problem with this scene really lies is towards the end when a character comes to a realization about something. It's as if the writers didn't know how to start wrapping up in the generic Spider-Man way and just went with some half-developed way that really doesn't make a lot of sense.Overall I had a lot of fun with Spider-Man: Homecoming, but that doesn't make it a great movie. It's immensely convenient, lacking tension or stakes, at one point becoming too silly when it's supposed to be serious and at times sacrificing realism for rushed plot progression. Other than that this is a perfectly disposable, turn-your-brain-off action comedy to watch with a group of friends on a rainy day. In the end I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
On par with the first two Spiderman films.,"Spiderman Homecoming is the sixth film featuring our friendly neighborhood Spiderman and his first solo film in the MCU and I have to tell it right now to pull out of my chest, it is on par with the first two Spiderman films.Now to the film itself ,no spoilers of course we follow our high school hero as he tries his best to be a superhero and at the same time have a functional life as a student, good luck with that. At the same time we follow Adrian Toomes the antagonist of the film portrait by, let's face it a legend of the superhero community, Micheal Keaton aka the Vulture. What I like about this film is that we see how the effects of the actions of the Avengers in the world and something that now should be expected by the inhabitants of this world, get use to the superheroes, yes a new superhero is a interesting news, but not world changing as the world has already changed.To our new wed-sling-er, Tom Holland is excellent in his role and I loved seen him try to be a hero with various level of success, what did you expect he is a teenager, he is new in this game unlike Iron-Man ,Captain or Thor ,who have years or in the case of Thor centuries of experience, so his attempts are the predicted by a youth trying to get in to a grown up game. Also they nailed his nerd persona and over all difficulty to socialize in to his environment. And as for the subject how is the best Spiderman ,well for me they are both number 1 I can't and I won't decide.As for Micheal Keaton ,well he was quit good and this Vulture though differed greatly from the one from the comics and animated series, he was a good first villain for our new hero. This Vulture reminds me an pitch from What-culture for this character and I have to say if the creators of the film watched that video and though to apply some of the ideas in it, then awesome.As for Iron-Man he isn't much in the film, however here has taken the role of a father-mentor figure. Which was both funny and interesting as some years prior if someone saw Tony Stark he would say ""that is a terrible idea"" now after the Avengers films and Civil War it was ,in my opinion, the natural progression of his character as now he and in general the original Avengers (Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Iron-Man, Thor and Hulk) have to take responsibility for the new heroes who have take inspiration by them (Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Spiderman, Vision doesn't count).The action is nice and creative ,nothing more. As for the jokes, well placed and in great quantity and quality.My last praise is the portrait of school life. It was great and though the cursing was missing (not at all, but it was minimized) the director and writers showed, they have a clue of how the mind of young person works, for further clues, go watch Cop Car.My issues now are, that it had some repeats from previous Spiderman films, the action as I said is good but not excellent and finally set up for future films. OK I now it is a shared universe and but I am starting to getting sick from the set up Marvel ,don't over do it , just sick to make good films ,as you do, and the audience will come.Over all it was a great experience and a solid introduction to the A class films of Marvel who are up to now (my view here): Iron-Man, Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers Age of Ultron, Civil War ,Guardians Volume 2 and Spiderman Homecoming.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
If John Hughes made a Spider-Man movie,"This was absolutely, without a doubt, the best ""Spider-Man"" movie ever! It's everything I loved about Spider-Man in the comics, cartoons, and video games growing up. It has his signature wisecracks, the fun thrills, and struggles of being a teen that Spidey is famous for. Michael Keaton gives a wonderfully chilling performance as the villain. There is one scene in particular that I won't spoil where his threatening demeanor is enough the frighten even a grown man. Spidey's tech-savvy sidekick also provides some wonderful comic relief. My one complaint was the actress Zendaya. She was so monotone and bored, that I was really starting to regret Disney buying Marvel at some points. (She was a Disney Channel star.) If she had put more emotion into her lines, or had been given better direction, she could have been a more interesting character, but she just came off as bland. I will probably have to watch this movie several times when it hits Bluray, because I spotted some fun little Easter Eggs and inside jokes, and I'm sure there were plenty more that I missed. As always, stay for the very end of the credits. I'm not going to spoil anything, but lets just say that Marvel is starting to become very meta....and that's all I'm going to say about that. It's too good and too funny to spoil.

Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spidey movie ever made,"IT MAY seem ridiculous, rebooting Spider-Man for the third time in 15 years but after seeing Spider-Man: Homecoming, you'll be glad they did. The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man of 2002 was fine; the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 was also fine. The Tom Holland Spider-Man of 2017 is the best Spider-Man movie ever to grace the screen. Spider- Man: Homecoming is the perfect blend of high school dramedy and superhero antics. This is Marvel's homage to John Hughes, complete with Ferris Bueller reference. By taking it back to the school setting and ageing Spidey down to 15 years old, it recaptures some of the innocent magic gleaned in the comic pages. It also, for a movie with a flying villain and an altitude-defying superhero, grounds the story. One of the main criticisms of superhero blockbusters is that they're overblown with ever-increasing, imminent apocalypses and cities toppling over, usually in a stupidly bombastic third act. Here, the stakes are much smaller, as is the body count with Peter turning off his suit's ""kill mode"" as quickly as he realised it existed. For this Spider-Man, asking a girl to the homecoming dance is as fraught as stopping the bad guy. Our reintroduction to this iteration of Spider-Man starts with a home video Peter shot on his phone of all the behind-the-scenes action of his adventure with the Avengers. It's cheeky, fun and a clever reminder of what a big hit the character was in Captain America: Civil War and how Holland managed to steal every scene he was in from much, much bigger stars. It sets the tone for the whole movie as we join Peter at his science high school where he and his Star Wars-loving friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) aren't the most popular kids in school. Here, Peter has to worry about Spanish quizzes, winning the academic decathlon and keeping his secret identity under wraps from the classmates he saves. In many ways, it has more than a touch of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Thanks , Rijil www.ekavala.in",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Teenage entertainment,"I have never been a fan of Spider-Man in any of his incarnations, and I pretty much hated him in Captain America: Civil War. I know he is supposed to be annoying, but so many gags that are supposed to be fun mostly end up being overly cringeworthy (unless you are in third grade or something). The movie itself is fairly enjoyable despite the plot being so simplistic: the first half is a bit bland and the facts are mostly uninteresting, but it grows on you towards the end. It gets interesting from Homecoming day, which is also when we start getting some proper action and a clear direction in the events. Vulture was the biggest surprise as he is one of the best MCU villains. He is far from being the best movie villain ever and lacked real motivation, but at least he got some personality.

"Good, but very different","Spider-Man has quite a wild ride on the big screen, hasn't he? Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies are a solid trilogy, but Sony's are rather forgettable. But with two sets of Spider-Man movies behind us, it's hard to not look back, especially on the Raimi trilogy, when thinking about Homecoming as a movie. That's important to bring up because Homecoming drastically differs from the previous Spider-Man films. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean that something just feels wrong about this movie. Maybe it's because the Daily Bugle's not in in. Maybe it's because Mary Jane isn't in it either. Maybe it's that Spidey's suit has all the different powers and weapons that makes him feel more like Iron Man. But something just feels off about it. It is still a very good movie, and possibly Marvel's funniest to date. Even if he was introduced in Civil War, there's no denying it. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. He acts and looks like he's 15, unlike Maguire and Garfield, who were clearly way older than the character they portrayed. Without giving anything away, the climax and ending were absolutely spectacular, both on a visual scale, and the way the character development sorts out. The other characters were good as well. Vulture was one of the best comic book movie villains ever. What's great about him is that you could make the legitimate argument that he's not actually a villain. He's not out to kill Spider-Man or something like that. He's just doing what everyone wants to do - get rich and live an easy life. He doesn't even cause that much damage, making him much more human than other villains. As for the other characters, well... Controversial opinion: Zendaya wasn't funny in this movie, she was annoying. She's a good actress, I know she's a fan favorite, but the whole movie she was trying way too hard to be edgy. It wasn't funny at all. Ned was pretty funny, though. He fills in Harry Osborn's role quite well. Liz wasn't exactly the most memorable character, but she had some good scenes, so she's fine. It really did feel like she was filling in for Mary Jane. You do gotta feel bad for her at the end. Iron Man is in this movie, but he's kind of like a father figure to Spidey here, and it works.All in all, I think I'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the Sam Raimi trilogy to appreciate Homecoming for what it is. I know that the aspect of Spider-Man having become famous through YouTube in this version negates the purpose of the Daily Bugle, but that just leaves a void in the film. It doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just makes it hard for me to enjoy Homecoming as much as others did. It's a worthy addition to the MCU, and that's what it is. MCU Spider-Man. What we've wanted for so long.Personal aside: my brother saw this movie before I did because I was stuck in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, and he successfully tricked me into thinking that the post-credits scene was super important. I had to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the movie, but I absolutely had to wait for the post-credits scene. I couldn't miss it. And if you know what it is... yeah. I got fooled big time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

My least favorite Spiderman movie. That was horrible.,"Glad I didn't waste my money to see this at theaters. Overrated movie. Except Michael Keaton and Tom Holland, Homecoming was pretty awful.

Okay, we get it! The inconsistencies from Civil War annoyed me. Peter's room is completely different, Spiderman was strong and capable in Civil War, but in Homecoming he's a clumsy clown who cant do anything right, why did they change the holy ---- line in the blog? I never liked the Homecoming title. It's so cheesy. The political agenda was so unnecessary.

Spider-Man Homecoming: Best Spiderman film? Absolutely,"I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good:Holland and Keaton are excellentVery likableGenuinely funnyThe Bad:Flash Thompson castingBad attempt at ShockerVulture simply isn't VultureThings I Learnt From This Movie:Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman Lite,"Homecoming brings Spider-Man into the Marvel Universe to hang out with Iron Man and the Avengers and while it succeeds in being fun and action-packed it lacks in any kind of drama or consequence which came before in the previous standalone movies.Tom Holland plays Peter Parker with a childhood enthusiasm and high energy which makes for fun times but his character never gets serious or really feels like he is ever in any true danger.Michael Keaton plays the villain and without him I think this rendition would be in some serious trouble because the side characters are all very weak here and don't have much to do beside be funny.Marissa Tomei is completely miscasts as Parker's Aunt May and just another point of humor for hot-jokes while Ironman (Robert Downey) pops in and out and there are some nice cameos here to keep the tongue and cheek going but his involvement diminishes Spider-man's journey.I guess with there being so many Spiderman movies now the problem is we have seen it before in the previous movies and Uncle Ben dying in his arms and telling Peter how great his responsibility is has been done so the writers have shied away from telling a story with any real emotion or consequence but to me it's always been about Parker's relationships whether it's his aunt or his partners are crucial to the Spider-Man arc.Homecoming is very light on drama, but high on action and humor and sure to please the Marvel masses who want to see him team up with the Avengers in another computer generated spectacle but as one of of my favorite Marvel characters I can't help but think they should have continued with a more grounded story with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone at least for one more round because they had chemistry.I hope it gets better and they give Spider-man more depth.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-man: Homecoming: 8.0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie since 2004. It nails the characterization of Peter Parker and adds a fun John Hughes feel around him. It's a very refreshing experience to finally see Peter Parker as an actual high school student who looks like he's in high school, and not a 28 year old Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland does an amazing job embodying Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Where Tobey Maguire has the best Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield has the best Spider-Man, Tom Holland successfully balances both sides of the character. The opening 30 minutes are fun and exciting, you get to see a montage of Peter just being a friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is hilarious, and shows a really likable character in Peter. This film shows how naive Peter really is. He has tremendous power, but he hasn't honed control over that power. That inherently forms a very well executed Mentor and Student relationship with Tony Stark. Tony Stark is used great in the film by not being too there too little and not being there too much. He's kept a good distance away from Peter so that he's not hovering over him the entire movie. Happy also serves as a hilarious side character to Peter, especially in the beginning. The tone perfectly nails Peter in high school, while the tone is amusing there is still moment of serious consequence for Peter, and he has to answer to Tony for some of them. Although the feel of the high school is spot on the only aspect that didn't as well as it needed to was the love interest. It never seemed to fully click between Peter and Liz. Micheal Keaton as Vulture was a good but not great villain. Some of his motivations seem slightly contradictory, but he's a good character with an interesting connection to Peter, and the Vulture Suit is a heavy slashing piece of sharp metal that look dangerous as hell. The films biggest fault was the overuse of CGI for Spidey's suit. It's a great suit but the film heavily relies on the CGI for moments that don't need it, and it takes you out of the movie as a result. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has a fun atmosphere around it with a good characters surrounding Peter Parker. So I give it an 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

another superhero finding his place in the Marvel Universe,"This is a coming of age movie about a kid learning to be a man, as well as a webslinging superhero at the same time. Peter Parker, the template for high school awkwardness attempts to go from child to adulthood without concerning himself with the trials and tribulations that go along with this process. The movie itself is a bit refreshing in that we have an antagonist that most of us can relate to...an antagonist that would get ripped apart by Hulk or Thor, but can more than hold his own going toe to toe with the young ""web head"" who attempts to thwart his every nefarious move.You will certainly receive the ""Marvel Treatment"" here...albeit in a more subdued manner, and smaller scale than you may be used to. Decent story, and a kid who is just having an absolute blast playing your friendly neighborhood Spiderman...he's having fun, and we're having fun watching him do so.

Spider-Man: Homecoming Review: A Fresh and Fun Take on the Friendly Neighborhood Hero,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" directed by Jon Watts and released in 2017, revitalizes the beloved web-slinger with a youthful energy and a fresh perspective. Starring Tom Holland as the titular hero, this film integrates Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while delivering a heartfelt and humorous coming-of-age story.The story picks up after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" with Peter Parker (Tom Holland) trying to balance his life as a high school student and his new role as Spider-Man. Eager to prove himself to his mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Peter takes on local crime-fighting in Queens while waiting for his next big mission. However, when he stumbles upon a dangerous arms deal led by Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture (Michael Keaton), Peter must step up to protect his city.Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker is a standout, capturing the character's youthful enthusiasm, awkwardness, and innate heroism. Holland's Spider-Man feels like a real teenager, dealing with the typical struggles of high school while navigating the complexities of being a superhero. His performance brings a refreshing authenticity to the role, making Peter Parker relatable and endearing.Michael Keaton delivers a compelling performance as Adrian Toomes/Vulture, a blue-collar worker turned arms dealer who feels betrayed by the system. Keaton's Vulture is one of the MCU's more nuanced villains, motivated by a sense of injustice and a desire to provide for his family. His confrontation with Spider-Man provides some of the film's most intense and memorable moments.The supporting cast, including Zendaya as the sharp-witted Michelle (MJ), Jacob Batalon as Peter's best friend Ned, and Marisa Tomei as the youthful and caring Aunt May, adds depth and humor to the story. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark/Iron Man serves as a mentor figure, guiding Peter while challenging him to grow and mature.Director Jon Watts infuses the film with a lighthearted tone and a vibrant visual style. The action sequences are exhilarating and well-executed, particularly the set pieces involving the Staten Island Ferry and the climactic battle at Coney Island. The film strikes a balance between high-stakes superhero action and the smaller, more personal moments of Peter's life.The screenplay, penned by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, and others, deftly combines humor, heart, and suspense. The film's comedic elements, such as Peter's interactions with his classmates and his attempts to keep his secret identity hidden, provide a welcome contrast to the darker themes often found in superhero movies.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" also excels in its world-building, seamlessly integrating Spider-Man into the broader MCU while maintaining a focus on Peter's individual journey. The film explores themes of responsibility, identity, and the challenges of growing up, making it resonate with audiences of all ages.The soundtrack, featuring a mix of contemporary hits and Michael Giacchino's spirited score, enhances the film's upbeat and dynamic atmosphere.In conclusion, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a triumphant return to form for the beloved character, offering a fresh and engaging take on Spider-Man that honors the spirit of the comics while bringing something new to the table. Tom Holland's charismatic performance, coupled with a strong supporting cast, thrilling action, and heartfelt storytelling, makes this film a standout entry in the MCU and a must-watch for fans of the web-slinger.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hyperactive Spidy,As a big fan of the Toby Maguire Spiderman series I couldn't get fully on board with this version of Spiderman don't get me wrong Tom Holland is great as Spiderman but as Peter Parker not so much he's much to hyperactive to take seriously his life as Peter Parker needs more work and calmness.The movie follows Peter Parker AKA Spiderman (Tom Holland) after the events of Captain America Civil War is thrown back into his normal life by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and is told to keep his feat on the ground until he calls for him again naturally Peter can't wait to hang out with Avengers again and tries to prove himself worthy to be part of the team when he discovers people selling alien weapons he seeks to track down there leader and put a stop to there dealings and impress Iron Man but it all goes wrong and Spiderman finds himself in the clutches of the villain The Vulture.The movie is well directed great music the usual special appearance by Stan Lee the fight scenes and humour are all on point my only gripe with this movie is as an older fan of Spiderman I found the movie to be way to fast paced the talking is a mile minute and even when no action is going on the movie doesn't slow down its a little to over the top.I recommend this movie to any Spiderman fan or even if you are new to the series It's worth watching even if you haven't seen any other Marvel movies before this.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Hail the critics and Robert Downey Jr. also,"A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. Yesterday, I was watching Enemy and 10 days ago I was watching Transformers 5, and both of them sucked badly! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Spider-man movie ever made!I watched Homecoming in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture.

In the trailer, he mentions ""If you are nothing with the suit, you don't deserve it!"" The question is: Can Spider-man carry it's own weight in the near future without Iron-man? I mean that he was also utilized in Captain America: Civil War.Hats off to Michael Keaton from his transition to Batman to Vulture. The best villain after Doc Oct (2004).

An Honest Review,"I won't complain about the continuity error within the MCU...because no one really cares least of all myself.Well, how do we do this. I mean, it is refreshing that Garfield is gone and with him the Spider-Bully. For Marvel comics fans, it really hurt watching Garfield bully and taunt his victims.Now we have a Spidey that is, well, nice. Holland is able to be funny and wise-cracking without seeming like a, well, a Flash Thompson. With that it beings us back to the source material.In other words Holland puts the ""friendly"" back in ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" And I think the MCU was well aware of this, given the time they took to make sure everyone knew Holland was going to be the hero that everyone loves.And then Keaton does a great vulture from his origin to his demise he seemed to do everything he could to really become the character.My only complaints were the supporting cast. Aunt May I can accept with a moderate grudge because she is a great actress...But Tony Revolori doesn't seem....built enough to be Flash. He's more the bully of the Millennial generation that uses words and little more and...when it comes down to it, even those are vapid.What's that old adage, ""sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never harm me."" Millennials I guess have never heard that.Flash is supposed to be that big bully jock that hits his prime in high school and, a decade later, delivers the pizza when you go home to visit your folks...this Flash has a future.And the MJ tease at the end...it went a little too far away from the character in looks and personality to sit well.Still, on the whole the movie is a breath of fresh air in its distance from Garfield's rendition and at times, Holland was even able to pull off almost a James Bond quality while still portraying a kid over his head.Like all MCU movies, however, the pay off is the humor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A fresh take on the beloved web-slinger,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" offers a refreshing and energetic take on the iconic superhero, blending the classic elements of Spider-Man with the contemporary style of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Jon Watts, the film follows young Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as he navigates the challenges of high school life while aspiring to become an Avenger under the mentorship of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.).Tom Holland shines as Spider-Man, capturing the character's youthful enthusiasm and earnestness. His portrayal of Peter Parker is both relatable and endearing, grounding the superhero's extraordinary abilities in the everyday struggles of a teenager. Michael Keaton delivers a compelling performance as Adrian Toomes, a.k.a. Vulture, adding depth to the film's antagonist with a nuanced portrayal.The movie excels in balancing action and humor, with standout sequences that showcase Spider-Man's agility and resourcefulness. The high school setting provides a fresh backdrop for the superhero's adventures, emphasizing Peter's dual identity and the pressures that come with it. While the plot follows familiar superhero tropes, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" manages to inject enough originality and heart to make it a thoroughly enjoyable entry in the Spider-Man saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Spider-Man: Homecoming Lives Up to the Hype With Lots of Humour, Thrills and Great Performances","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is being shepherded by Tony Stark's former head of security Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to his debut appearance in Captain America: Civil War. He's overwhelmed but as we know, he rises to the occasion and does an admirable job backing up Tony and his team. He's understandably psyched for his next job with the Avengers but Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) has taken it upon himself to mentor Peter and tells him to acclimate and stay low to the ground till he gets another call for his assistance.Peter does his best to blend in at school but he's facing your average teenage problems on top of fighting crime. He has a crush on Liz (Laura Harrier) who doesn't notice him, he also has to balance getting good grades with synthesizing his web formula in science class. He has his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) to help him get through his day to day but his afternoons are spent arresting small time crooks instead of his big battle vs. Cap and Falcon. He also has to hide his identity from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) who may not be as oblivious as she's letting on.Spider-Man coming back to Marvel was a minor miracle and with a relatively inexperienced director in Jon Watts (I'm not saying bad, he's just not experienced with a huge franchise project) it did nothing but ramp up the pressure. But against the odds, I think that this movie succeeded even over other storied entries of the web-slinger's franchise. One of these things is that the characters that they create feel more grounded and relatively easy to relate to. Peter actually feels like a kid in this movie. He's got this wonderful gift that he has to keep secret and it makes the rest of his issues seem trivial by comparison. He's got a good heart and a brilliant mind but he doesn't understand the possible danger in what he's trying to do. Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) isn't a cackling super villain, were there easier ways to support his family? Probably. But he's not in it for world domination and he never comes across as completely evil. This movie even grounds Tony as a character further. He tries to project an uncaring aloofness towards Peter but his true paternal feelings become more apparent as the movie continues. I was completely blindsided by this and although Marvel Studios churns out quality blockbuster entertainment regularly, this is a sterling example of good character development even for them.With Robert Downey Jr. being featured so prominently in the trailers, people were worried about him taking over the movie. I'm happy to report that he's in the movie about as much as he needs to be. He gives Peter someone who can relate to his experience and he also provides much needed guidance. I thought he was used perfectly (more on Downey Jr.'s performance later) and I also thought this movie did a great job of interweaving the larger Marvel universe into it (aside from one or two time-line issues). There are a couple of fun cameos and they bring back certain characters (it was fun to see Happy Hogan again and he gets a surprising amount of screen time) for a fun jog down memory lane.This movie brings the plot and the character development but it doesn't drag or fall down in any other of the requisite areas. The action scenes move quickly and feature a nice mix of Spidey's abilities (even if we've probably seen better from other Marvel entries). The movie also features a surprising amount of heart. You understand the difficulties of this responsibility for Peter and his mixture of innocence, caring and determination is even inspiring at times. What I didn't expect is that this is probably the funniest Marvel movie I've seen in a long time. We get more than enough comedic relief from Peter's awkwardness, his friendship with an even more awkward Ned and his lack of understanding of his skill set. I was laughing hard through most of the movie and you can't help but enjoy yourself when you're tearing up from laughter.Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield both had their strengths and weaknesses as Spider-Man but Tom Holland shows us a new Peter Parker. He was awesome in his first appearance and he continued his great work here. Michael Keaton also does a memorable job, I don't know if he's the best Marvel villain but I would probably put him in the top 5. Jon Favreau was a welcome addition and he was pretty funny throughout. I've always loved Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Ironman and he was his typical great self. Jacob Batalon was hilarious as Ned and strangely endearing. Laura Harrier wasn't given a ton to work with as Liz but she held her own. Marisa Tomei was good as Aunt May and I'm glad the movie had the good sense to address how different she was in this part compared to other actresses in the past.This movie was everything that I hoped it would be. I got everything I wanted out of it and I left the theatre with a big smile on my face. This movie had a high bar it needed to clear to be successful, with all the pressure and the expectations and I think it hurdled it. I can't wait for the sequel and Spider-Man: Homecoming continues 2017s great run of superhero movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Odd title,"I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Hero is Way More Than Just the Suit,"After fearlessly saving Liz, played by smart pretty Laura Harrier, from the plunging elevator in Washington Monument as Spider-Man, 15 year- old Peter, played by Tom Holland, summons all his courage to tell Liz, ""I like you."" Peter then asks the girl of his dreams to the Homecoming dance, ""Do you want to go with me?"" This is the distinct delightful charm of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". Director and Writer Jon Watts's ""Spider-Man"" is visually stunning action as when Peter strains together the severed ferry boat in the Hudson. ""Homecoming"" is clumsy and clunky at times, but it is all heart.Watts and the army of screenwriters, Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers composed the narrative based on the Marvel Comic with varying outcomes. Tom Holland is the star who enrolls our compassion. As Spider-Man and his teenage persona Peter, Holland has a frenetic and gee whiz charm—he captures the kid whom Peter Parker really is. Peter's friendship with geek buddy Ned, played by spirited Jacob Batalon, has a sweet and timeless air of youth and innocence.Fortunately, the story leverages the gravitas of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man in the new role of Peter's mentor and father figure. Holland's quiet power emerges from this screen partnership and expands throughout. After Tony confronts Peter's recklessness, Peter tells him, ""I wanted to be like you."" Tony says, ""I wanted you to be better than me!"" At its best ""Homecoming"" is about seeing and allowing for the greatness in others.At times however, ""Spider-Man"" stumbles over itself. Michael Keaton as the villain Vulture and Adrian Toomes is not compelling. Keaton's performance is magnetic. All Toomes is, is angry and bitter. No nuance of the character. He is about money and greed. So what? ""Homecoming"" opens 8 years ago as Tony Stark and the Government void Toomes's lucrative construction contract to repair the demolished Avengers Headquarters following the vicious alien invasion. In the following years Toomes utilizes the stolen alien technology from the Avengers site to steal and market weapons of mass destruction. With this technology Toomes creates himself as the advanced weapon, the Vulture. We empathize with great villains in their exposed humanity. Unfortunately, as good as Keaton is, Toomes is a heartless jerk.In a departure from previous ""Spider-Man"" movies Peter's guardian Aunt May is played by stunningly beautiful and funny Marisa Tomei. Previous incarnations of Aunt May were as a much older sage woman. Not someone who gets hit on by the server at their favorite Thai restaurant. In a touching scene Peter implores Ned not to tell Aunt May that he is Spider-Man, because ""she has suffered enough"". Watts clearly missed the opportunity to deepen the relationship with May, who believes and loves Peter. She is kind and soulful as she coaches Peter for his Homecoming date. Too bad much of Tomei's performance is the irony of her youthful attraction.In the story Peter returns from battle in ""Captain America: Civil War"" with Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Tony gifts Peter with the Stark Industries high-tech Spider-Man suit. Peter believes that if he proves himself, he can become an Avenger. In the meantime, he'll be the hero as ""the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"". Tony's assistant Happy, played by hilarious Jon Favreau, takes charge of Peter's personal growth. When not doing the ""Stark Fellowship"" duties, Peter resumes high school life as member of the Academic Team and sparring with iconoclast Michelle, played by wonderful Zendaya, who perhaps is a little too annoyed with Peter.Holland's exuberance and understated power make him perhaps the best Spider-Man in a long while. His mercurial presence lightens up the screen on ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". He captures the frailty, grace and courage of the hero. His Peter discovers that the hero within is way more than just the suit he wears. He finds his power as he believes in himself. That inspires in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""If you're nothing without the suit then you shouldn't have it""","After an auspicious cameo in last year's Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man now has his own standalone feature in the MCU and and I'm happy to report that it more than lives up to the promise of his previous appearance. Spider-Man: Homecoming is the third on- screen iteration of the illustrious web-slinger, as directors Sam Raimi and Marc Webb previously had separate swings at the characters, but in many ways, this seems to be the first version that truly understands what makes the character unique and indispensible in the superhero realm. If Raimi's trilogy exhibited an earnest campiness ripped straight from the comic book pages and Webb's pair of films was brooding retort to the Dark Knight series, then this film casts a lively signature of its own that's defined by soulful storytelling and perfectly pitched humor.Tom Holland reprises his role as the young Peter Parker, who is desperate to become a full-time Avenger after the thrilling battle of Civil War but is told to lay low and not get into anything too perilous by his burgeoning father figure Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Eager to help his community, he ignores the advice and crosses paths with arms dealer Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), who harvests the alien technology brought to Earth during The Avengers to create advanced weapons for criminals all around the city. Parker also must balance this new conflict with the everyday dilemmas of teenage life, including a best friend (Jacob Batalon) who accidentally learns of his secret identity and a new love interest (Laura Harrier) who challenges him on the academic decathlon team.The film's subtitle is a nod to the fact that Spider-Man has ""come home"" to Marvel Studios after 15 years of Sony hoarding the character rights but it's actually more telling that it refers to the big homecoming dance at Parker's high school, as the movie tends to play out more like a coming-of-age teen comedy than traditional superhero epic. As opposed to the high school scenes of previous Spider- Man movies that mainly consisted of ""kids"" in their late twenties sitting around in room made to look like a lunchtime cafeteria, Midtown High School actually feels like a believable setting complete with awkward gym classes and dreadful detention sessions (there's even brief chess club shoutout, for good measure). Homecoming understands that the stakes of the story are established by Parker's interpersonal conflicts and are not just defined by the big showdown with Spider-Man's villain of the week.This emotionally grounded mentality extends not just to Parker but also to Toomes as well, whose evil plan isn't to blow up the planet or take over the galaxy but rather to just stay under the radar peddling guns on the black market so that he can support his family. Keaton's portrayal of the Vulture (the Birdman jokes write themselves) is one that's steeped in desperation and circumstance rather than sinister clichés that have infected many a Marvel villain in the past, which makes the character one of the more compelling examples in the category. When Spider-Man and Vulture do arrive at their final confrontation, the shared history between the two comes to the forefront and creates a poignancy that makes their airborne showdown that much more thrilling.It may sound like serious business but believe me when I say that there are plenty of laughs along the way with loads of quick visual gags, ping-pong dialogue and some brilliantly conceived bits that reference other segments of this Universe (there's a running joke featuring another MCUer that's delightfully unexpected). Like The Lego Batman Movie, this is a film written by people who know how to get plenty of comedic mileage from riffing on aspects of their respective characters' legacies but they do so respectfully, taking care to avoid mean- spirited jabs in the process. People are rightly skeptical of reboots, especially with franchises that have had as much recent activity as this one, but Spider-Man: Homecoming proves that a fresh vision on an existing property can sometimes have truly amazing results.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Fun and full of laughs, Spider-Man: Homecoming fits right in with Marvel's ever-expanding Cinematic Universe.","It's been about a month since a major superhero film release, so here we are again!Marvel is at bat now, and they've brought out their most iconic superhero, Spider-Man. We got a peek at him in last year's Captain America: Civil War, so now that he has his own film, let's see what it has to offer.Spider-Man: Homecoming follows a teenage Peter Parker (Tom Holland) shortly after his discovery by the Avengers. He can't seem to keep their attention, though, as he dreams of saving people on a larger scale. Meanwhile, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), a local construction worker, has been hoarding leftover alien technology from the attack on New York in The Avengers and is selling hi-tech weaponry around New York City. Parker must learn to balance his high school life with his desire to impress the Avengers to hopefully stop this homegrown menace.Without a doubt, the best part of the movie is our main character. His two most recent representations on film have been strong in their own ways, but were fairly weak in their portrayal of high school. In Homecoming, Parker's life and struggles as a smart kid with a huge crush on a classmate are now shown with refreshing sincerity; one particularly heartfelt and awkward scene hit me in such a genuine way that I immediately felt a dozen high school memories of my own come rushing back. Holland is infectiously enthusiastic throughout in his portrayal of the young hero and might be my favorite take on the character to date.With great heroes must come great villains, and Michael Keaton absolutely knocks it out of the park with his performance as Vulture. In the tradition of other Spider-Man villains, Homecoming presents an ordinary, down-on-his-luck man who goes in over his head and is corrupted by power. The suit that he wears is genuinely intimidating, and Keaton portrays his character with a mix of the charismatic persona we're familiar with from the '80s and '90s and the unhinged performance he gave in 2014's Birdman. I hope we see more of him in the future.While the film succeeds with several of its characters, though, it is very shallow and ultimately lacks heart. Homecoming is a fun movie, but it is little more than that and fails to offer real emotional depth. The movie actually seems afraid to let the viewer really feel something; dramatic moments are consistently broken with jokes, and we learn only in passing dialog that Peter and Aunt May have recently lost Uncle Ben. This tragedy was traditionally the kicking-off point for Parker's heroic journey, but we don't meet him at any time, and neither of the ""mourning"" characters so much as frowns over the event.Maybe Wonder Woman has me spoiled, but Spider-Man also doesn't feel like much of a hero in this one. Homecoming nailed the character of a high school Peter Parker but left Spider-Man awkwardly stumbling through people's back yards with almost no character growth throughout the film. This is a sort of origin story, but I had hoped he would feel more amazing by the end credits. My concern is that he is left to develop in the time before the next film or carry his clumsiness into it.Despite its flaws, though, Spider-Man: Homecoming is absolutely worth a watch. It offers a fun, colorful experience that corrects some of the shortcomings of our hero's recent outings while standing alone as both a Spider-Man film and a worthwhile entry to the ever- expanding MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I'm trying to remember the last time I laughed this much in a movie. (Wonder Woman).I think this movie would be doing much better if they had stressed that it wasn't a retelling of the origin story.The only reason I didn't give it a higher score was because the best friend got on my nerves (until the end).This is a really good super hero movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A good reboot !,"Here's my review of spiderman : homecoming. So , Tom Holland was great as spiderman . He was funny , athletic and smart just like how you saw him in civil war. Michael Keaton was great as the vulture , even though he could have been a little more intimidating , not just the bad guy , the whole plot could've been a little dark , it was too cheesy , I'm not saying bad , but it was cheesy like its TV series . Some things which pissed me off , was how spiderman talked to the AI in his suit and depended a lot on stark tech , because spiderman talks to himself while swinging by and one of the original traits of his is not depending on tech except for his web shooters . The supporting cast was great too , especially the fat Asian dude . Aunt may was good in this movie , but more uncle Ben memories would have boosted the emotional drive , which was lacking in this movie. Iron man was cool , and he knew his place without crowding it. The music in this movie is really cool and that too how they did a remix to the classic theme song which blended really well with the action sequences. In the end , homecoming is a perfect summer movie with lots of cheesiness , web slinging fun and wall crawling action and perfectly timed one liners. Oh yes , there's a post credits scene and an end credits scene , the end credits scene however ... Just watch it .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man comes home to the Marvel universe,"I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming!So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" swings into my 7/10 rating, and I must confess, I liked it. Tom Holland brings youthful charm and an earnestness to Peter Parker that makes him relatable as both a high school student and a superhero. The film editing keeps the pace brisk and engaging, blending Spidey's everyday struggles with his heroics seamlessly. Its strength lies in its message of responsibility and the journey of a young hero trying to prove himself. Michael Giacchino's music adds a playful yet heroic tone, and the cinematography captures the vibrant and diverse neighborhoods of New York City. ""Homecoming"" is a delightful return to Spider-Man's roots, a reminder that even a young hero can carry the weight of great power and great responsibility, and my liking for it is as strong as Spidey's web-swinging skills.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Teenie Superhero Angst.....,"If your age demographic is somewhere between 13 -16 you may actually be able to relate to Spider-Man (or is that Spider-Boy) Homecoming.This film is chocked full of truly gruesome ""teenie angst"" as poor little teen Spider boy moves ever so awkwardly towards spidery adulthood. The pimply clichés culled from almost any, ""coming of age"" codswallop you care to mention come thick and fast, leaving this mature viewer, squirming uncomfortably in their seat.What this means, in my opinion, is this film has very narrow appeal. Its unsophisticated fare that may not even engage more switched on teens and is certainly not accessible, to mature viewers, like myself either.On the upside the acting is passable and the action scenes are competent but really those factors on their own are not enough to make this film anything other than bland fare at best.

Spider-Boy,"Spider-Man is arguably the most relatable and beloved superhero of all time, I know this is true is for me. When Sam Raimi first brought him to the big screen in 2002, the film had the biggest opening weekend for any film at the time. Now 15 years, 5-6 movies, 3 actors and 2 reboots later, we now are graced with Spider-Man: Homecoming. Directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland as the third Spider-Man, Michael Keaton as the Vulture and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Spider-Man: Homecoming tells the story of an overly eager, adolescent Peter Parker, who is done with being the bridesmaid (your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man), and thus desperately attempts to impress Tony Stark in the hopes of becoming an Avenger. The film is a fun addition to the Marvel universe that is by far the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004).Spider-Man: Homecoming is unlike any Spider-Man film before it. It is crossover film in more ways than one. Yes the film has Iron Man in it, but it also has Spider-Man face off with former Batman, Birdman now Vulture, Michael Keaton. Jokes aside, this film is unique in the sense that it does its own thing and doesn't follow in 'The Amazing Spider-Man's footsteps by retelling the classic Uncle Ben origin story. The film fortunately does what Spider-Man 2 did so well, getting right into Peter's life as Spider-Man. I swear if we got a third origin story that would be a last straw, I'm sorry Spidey. Also in the same light as Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming plays with the question ""can Peter Parker be Spider-Man without the suit?"" I personally enjoyed the rather realistic way this was handled and this really helped warm you to Tom Holland's Spider-Man as a person with faults, thus juxtaposing the way audiences related to Tobey Maguire's relatable, good guy nerd Spider-Man.As I've compared Spider-Men and Spider-Man films I might as well cut right to it. Tom Holland is a great Spider-Man, he embodies the naive ambition, rebellion and awkwardness of a young teenage boy and did what I believe to be the right way to approach Spider-Man, that is playing Peter Parker first and Spider-Man second. People love Spider-Man not because he can swing from a web and climb walls, well not just because of that. People love Spider-Man because Peter Parker is a relatable character. When I was growing up Spider-Man wasn't just a hero, he was a figure of representation and therefore was MY hero. Although Tom Holland will never be better than Tobey Maguire in my eyes due to personal history, he is a surprisingly close second. I appreciate Holland's approach to my childhood icon, and I think it's safe to say, he was definitely better than Andrew Garfield. As well as Tom Holland, Michael Keaton also did an excellent job as the films antagonist, The Vulture. His story was understandable and his character was given a surprising amount of depth for an MCU villain. Keaton's Vulture stands out above pretty much all MCU movie villains (except Loki of course) and would feel more at home in the Netflix shows alongside Cottonmouth, Kilgrave and Kingpin.My only criticisms surround the high school dramedy parts of the film. Although, a lot of the comedy that came from this was pretty funny and so I can't fault it too much, I could however have done without the teen romance sub plot with Lizzie. Again, I understand that it does become crucial to the plot and nicely reflected the Osbournes over for dinner scene in Spider-Man (2002), this being said, It just felt cliché overall and seeing as this is a rather fresh take on Spider-Man, the typical high school romance took away some of the films freshness, in my opinion. Also I felt that maybe the character Ned and Michelle could have swapped positions. Ned just didn't do much for me by being in the film, I feel Michelle and Peter could have had better banter and that Michelle could've acted as Peter's reality check. I do see however that Michelle may become important in the sequel so we shall see.Finally, I get this being an Avengers crossover movie, Tony Stark being a father figure to Peter, as well as, a massive payday for RDJ, but there is a part of me that feels this is Marvel trying to make every superhero movie a 'Mini Avengers' movie, ever since the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier. This is a Spider-Man film, but it also isn't as it is a constant reminder that the Avengers exist and have a movie next year. Part of me would have liked an solo Spider-Man movie with references to the universe similar to the Marvel/Netflix shows, which to be honest it does do, but at the end of the day, I'm just thankful they have finally made a good Spider-Man film after 13 years of trying.To conclude, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun and surprisingly relatable superhero movie that ends Spider-Man's bad movie streak. Its an entertaining action and teen movie that understands its character, as well as, what made the last three movies not so great. Sure its another 'Mini Avengers' movie as well as a typical teen film, but with brilliant acting, writing, directing and a real sense of humour, Spider-Man: Homecoming does my childhood icon justice and satisfies on many levels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Saw the third reboot - it was okay.,"I took my wife and three boys to see the movie tonight. My boys gave the movie a ranking of 8-9 on a 10 pt scale; while my wife and I gave it a 7.I felt that the story was okay: okay character development, an okay story arc and better than average acting from Spidey and the Vulture.Now,again, understand that my children didn't grow up with comic books. They haven't seen all three different versions of Spider-Man brought to the big screen. My boys liked this movie a great deal and so will most adolescents. However, if you are older and have had more than a passing interest in the original story, lower your expectations.Honestly, there was nothing bad here - but there was nothing better than what I've seen before. Each previous actor: Toby McGuire, Andrew Garfield and now this new young man - brought something different.The first two Spidey movies had great action suquences, they were very good and Toby did a great job. Then, came Andrew Garfield's movies and there was chemistry galore between Spidey and Gwen.The third time's the charm right? To succeed as a new reboot you can't retread what the other two versions covered. So, this new movie focuses more on the anxiety of being a very young web-slinger. Furthermore, to modernize this movie, the director added/changed a great deal of the supporting details that I thought I knew.I understand the move...they want this to be accessible to a wider audience. The director made an effort to make this movie more politically correct. Coming from an older comic fan's perspective, this challenged my preconception of the world that Spider-man used to inhabit. Things are always changing - right?However, if Marvel wants change things why keep the old Spidey/Peter Parker story line and not go with their Mexican-American version with Miles Morales? Why not make Ned an overweight Spider-Man? Why can't the main characters find a love interest that is a normal, smart, average looking person, you know...that type you find in every high school? Wanna shake things up? Under the suit Iron-Man could be Pepper Potts - right? The power comes from the money and the electronics. Let's be blunt, even Marvel said that the new Thor was going to be female.Maybe, after all I've written, I'm tired after viewing too many Marvel formulaic adventures. The movie is somewhere between okay and good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A kinda good spider-man for the MCU,"I have a lot of mix feelings with this spider-man. On one side I love that now he can interact with the Avengers and that he is part of this universe, I like that he is still a teenager and I really lve that he doesnt know how to do the job yet, he is still learning how to do things and how not to screw up. But on the other side, I feel that he is carried a lot by Iron Man, giving him a suit with a lot of functions, that the goal of peter is to impress Tony, instead of wanting to help all the people he can, I absolutely ate his side characters, because while they can be funny at times, when rewatching the movie, the jokes arent as good as the first time and they dont contribute to anything else. But now, on the god things, the villain is pretty good, he is intimidating and has very good motivations. Still, despite all the personal problems I have with this interpretation of Spider-man, I still enjoy a lot this movie because it has really cool moments and the story is very good, and it still isnt my least favourite spider-man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Tom Holland shines as Spider-Man AND Peter Parker,"Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man movie and a great MCU movie and a great movie in general. I like how they made this film more of a teen comedy, it really works well. Tom Holland is not only a great Spider-Man but also a great Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker but not a great Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was a great Spider-Man but not a great Peter Parker. But Tom Holland is both. Vulture is also a great villain as well. One of my nitpicks with the film is that the spidey sense doesn't seem to be present. And it can be a bit predictable at times as well. Overall Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man film and a great MCU film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Couldn't expect more from a hitchhiking Spidey,"Everyone knows about the copyright issues with Sony and Disney. Spider-Man is here because of the success of the MCU. Those who have seen the previous two versions of Spider-Man know what our expectations of Spider-Man are. This is just a Spider-Man hitching a ride on the MCU luxury car without a proper introduction. With so many important MCU characters introduced leading up to Infinity War, it's hard to guarantee this movie that's full of emotional highs. Based on that, this movie probably got the job done. A clear, cohesive story. New characters introduced. A bubbly Spider-Man in bright colors. The problem here is that they are so focused on telling a fun story about Spiderman that they forget about the emotional attitudes of the characters. We are watching this movie from the perspective of a TV viewer instead of understanding each character's reactions. There are many scary and dangerous events happening but the viewer does not see the danger. CGI cannot bring emotions to the viewer, it even makes the story less interesting than it really is. The fact that Tony built Peter a fully functional suit shows that he has been studying Peter for a long time, but we, the viewers, don't see even a single scene that talks about that. And there are many other regrets about this movie that I don't want to talk more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not only the best Spider Man movie but I think the best Superhero movie,"I haven't seen ALL the Marvel superhero movies but as of late I have found them to be boring, lacking in any real characters, even the action sequences seem boring (on average). When Iron Man came out in 2008 I was soooooo stoked to finally be getting a decent super hero movie. Then Marvel repeated themselves over and over and over again.Previous Spiderman movies have all come up short. Some had ok leads, ok bad guys, ok support cast. Homecoming seems better in every category. I think they finally found the right person to play Peter Parker/Spiderman. I was really skeptical when they said Vulture was going to be the main bad guy I was dissapointed. He was one of the lamest villians from the comics. So I avoided this movie having been disspointed so many times. Michael Keaton was perfect for the role.The only thing I had a beef with was the corny boat scene, which was shown in the trailers. You slice a boat in half, you aren't going to just push it back together before it sinks. That was really dumb and it felt lazy on part of the writers.

Nice outfit,"This movie was levels above what I expected, the comedy is actually funny, Tom Holland gives a near perfect portrayal of the web-slinging quipper, supporting performances are amazing and the villain is actually interesting and performed brilliantly by Michael Keaton. I was surprised by Spider-Man's reveal and his overall character in Captain America: Civil War, and my excitement was justified because wow... Tom Holland easily gives the best portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider Man since Tobey Maguire in the Sam Raimi trilogy and that is a MASSIVE achievement. The best solo Spider Man film since Spider Man 2 and one of the best superhero films of the decade. His outfit is so fresh as well, rather than the kind of homemade look in the original movies and the lesser design in the two Marc Webb movies.Zendaya as MJ is perfectly cast, easily the best and most original performance of MJ by far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hits Home,"Spiderman has now been reintroduced as a film series for the third time in less than twenty years with the release of Spider-Man Homecoming. While it might be easy to dismiss this film for that reason, it's important not to given just how well this film interprets the franchise it represents.Homecoming is very aware that most of its viewers have already seen a Spider-Man origin story multiple times. As a result, it smartly leaves out the bits of story you already know and focuses on the more meaningful parts of Peter Parker's character. This is truly the first of the Spider- Man films to accurately depict the Spider-Man as both a high school nerd and a friendly neighborhood super hero (complete with wisecracking puns), not necessarily dealing with Avengers issues of impending world destruction, but rather with problems of a smaller scale. In fact, showing the balance of high school drama and super hero responsibilities is an excellent depiction, such as in Peter's dedication to being a good student and him placing as much importance on attending his academic decathalon matches as saving the city.The introduction of a more high tech suit was an interesting direction for Spider-Man as well. For some fans it might be seen as a poor choice considering how the basic super powers (such as Spidey Sense) are somewhat downplayed in favor of Stark technology. However, it was important when considering the story arch that was introduced by it for Peter's character. The theme of actions versus abilities is shown, highlighted by Tony Stark himself, who makes a few brief appearances in the film.Speaking of Tony Stark, I was worried going into this movie about the presence of big-name stars such as Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Keaton who might possibly overshadow the up-and- coming Tom Holland (who, if you didn't know, is playing Spider-Man). However, the direction of the movie is flawless, and each of these big stars is given the minimal screen time to advance their character in the story without leaving the young Tom Holland as a supporting character in our minds. Keaton's villain is a very relatable blue-collar man who is fighting for the working man. He does his part well without overstating his welcome. And Tony Stark, well, by this point we're all familiar with Iron Man. Thankfully, the film has him as more of an Easter Egg and uses a more thoughtful method to connect him to Peter. This is done successfully through Tony Stark's assistant, Happy, now having a more prominent role as Peter's mentor (which he fills well as a form of comic relief). Other supporting cast members also perform their parts well, such as the now younger Aunt May (whose attractiveness is a running joke in the film), and Peter's best friend at school, Ned.The film is the overall one of the most surprising of the MCU films released in awhile considering how different of an approach it has to Spider-Man, and super heroes in general. It's worth checking out and certainly hits home, not just as an MCU submission, but as a reintroduction to the Spider-Man franchise, and as a movie in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The wannabe superhero,"Spider-Man was introduced in the last Captain America movie and now he got his own movie. It is more light-hearted and more suited towards the younger audience being from the view of a high-schooler.Is it just me or does it just feel so unsatisfying not to be able to say that you're Spider-Man? I was so glad when Tony Stark declared that he was Iron Man in the first Marvel movie. But this just felt bad. I really wanted Liz to know that he was Spider-Man, but oh well.Other than that, the Tony Stark scenes were all really funny as usual. My favourite part of the movie.

"My Opinion, it's Iron Man : Homecoming rather than Spiderman : Homecoming.","I'm a big fan of Spiderman. I always love it. Whenever I heard a new film is coming out, I always watch it immediately. And like almost every Spiderman film is great. They never make the viewers disappointed.Spiderman : Homecoming film is very different from other Spiderman because I feel like Spiderman in this film isn't quite good compared to the ones in other films. Or maybe the Iron Man is really showing off in this film.No offence, but as for me, it's about Spiderman's victories and he should be a hero in this film. Instead, I feel like Iron Man is hero. So, the film name shouldn't be Spiderman : Homecoming. It should be Iron Man : Homecoming. I really hate that they made Spiderman got scolded. Of course, there was some parts at later time where he's a hero, but every scenes need to show he's a hero, and not Iron Man because this is about Spiderman, and not Iron Man.To be honest, when I think of that fact, I couldn't even enjoy the film completely. But I must admit it's a great film if I didn't think about that fact.

In this version, he has a cool superhero dad to learn from, which, so intelligently, makes Spider-Man a sidekick. That is the antithesis to his conception.

The film never loses sight of Peter's student side and when Keaton re-enters the narrative the tension is legitimately dynamite.

"Fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles justice for the titular hero","Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has made his return to the big screen, and he is more charming than ever. With the filmmaking rights now handed to Marvel Studios from Columbia Pictures, the titular hero is gained membership to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a more unique approach unlike what he saw in the Sam Raimi trilogy or the underwhelming reboot series starring Andrew Garfield. With the days of Garfield as the web-slinging hero now three years in the rear-view mirror, this comic-book adventure helms Tom Holland in the role of the title character, after advertising a spectacular introduction in last year's 'Captain America: Civil War'. And the director responsible of this project is Jon Watts who grants the hero with a more zany approach than what we were accustomed to in the past, in attempt to connect him to the MCU's Avengers team. This also allows for brief appearances by MCU veterans such as Iron Man and even briefer ones by Chris Evans's Captain America. Following the events of Civil War, this film follows 15-year old Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a geeky high schooler struggling to balance his social life at school with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon), and his time crime-fighting as the titular web-slinging superhero which he hides of Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei). Under the watchful, if overprotective eye of Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.), Peter must prove he is worthy of becoming the hero Tony wants him to be, as well as making a good impression of his crush Liz (played by Laura Harrier), when he faces down the evil Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is in possession of some dangerous weapons.Aside from shedding away from the slightly darker tone of the previous Spiderman entries, Jon Watts also grants the title character with a more polished story rather than rehashing familiar elements from the past. Instead of embarking on yet another origin story, this film jumps almost immediately into the action while setting up the relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, with some sadly predictable results thanks to the trailer giving away certain plot points. This method allows for more potent character development. The story establishes Peter as a typical teenager with common high school problems including the struggles of impressing the girl of his dreams and getting caught in the crossfires of bully Flash Thompson (played by Tony Revolori) who often makes crude remarks of him. At the same time, it also touches on Peter's ambition to impress Tony and Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau, the supporting man of Stark Industries, when Michael Keaton's Vulture and his evil deeds catches his eye. This all leads to some exhilarating, frenetic action sequences polished some dazzling special effects. The rescue sequence on the United States monument is spectacularly executed, as is the scene of Spiderman trying hundreds of people on a ferry that gets fractured in half. The climatic scene on the airplane however, is a bit of an eyesore. Setting the scene at night with components of the plane exploding and sparks flying everywhere renders the fight between Spiderman and Vulture a bit too incoherent for the eyes to follow. Nonetheless, the final result somewhat pays off. As for Tom Holland, now the youngest actor portray the title character, he makes pleasant use of his role with a great sense of charm and humor that evokes a decent amount of laughs from time to time, even when some of the jokes fall flat. Michael Keaton also boasts a nice delivery as the main antagonist. Then there is Robert Downey Jr. who pops in and out as Tony Stark and Iron Man, only given around eight minutes of screen time.Spiderman: Homecoming is a fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles the justice for the titular superhero, and rightfully does so without feeling the need to set up for the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. It is a fun superhero spectacle destined to please fans of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics. If there is anything more accurate to bet on, it will be the astounding box office performance which will more than likely be in competition against last month's 'Wonder Woman'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"In the recent furore of cut and shut, fiddled with blockbusters, by talented, inexperienced directors, puppeteered by hack studios,","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a honed, clear, flowing popcorn flick with a charming and watchable lead from Tom Holland (a perfectly agreeable young Nathan Drake).First and foremost despite looking great, Homecoming is just one big Easter egg inside of an Easter egg. It's an edible Russian nesting doll of injokes and nudges and winks and throwaway moments; take Giacchino's cheeky nod the animated theme at the start, and some of them work but most of them don't. The timeline for a start feels a little muddled (which film was Avengers Tower rebuilt in? What bad guys did what where and left what behind?), but I did roll my eyes with a certain satisfaction at points which pretty sums up my feelings on the film.I mean, they did all they could; they made it a Peter Parker movie where Parker was more interesting than Spider-Man (ASM's Andrew Garfield is spectacular but he had much less to work with than his Spider-Man). The action sequences were not exactly bad and they were coherent but just a bit uninspired. But to be fair ASM2 was far too inspired! And I'd like to take a moment to complain about the miscast, from another film, saccharine, live-studio-audience-sitcom-type actress Laura Harrier playing Liz that was cringey to the extreme.But by god did I not see some of the third act coming. I mean I should have, I just didn't, so I applaud it for that. It led to some nice direct parallels between teen angst and superhero trials It was nice to see Spider-Man finding Peter Parker and then fusing the two: Not finding your identity in your assets, gifts, support but instead in yourself is a clear and relatable theme; Peter is not a suit or an Avenger or an intern for a billionaire, he's a young boy that makes mistakes and bounces back and does the right thing.I liked the marketing/posters, I liked the poppy but indistinct score, the smart costume made it different enough. The blogger opening was fresh and down to earth and more Happy Hogan is always welcome. And the Iron Man-esque stinger at the end and the post-credits sequence are both laugh out loud. Plus there's a key tone in this film where Peter and his friends are aware of superheroes, and in a way, superhero films, and this kind of fourth wall thing (man in the chair??!!) made for a nicely unique tone compared to the other Spider-Mans.So Homecoming has some hilarious, on-point, gags, some excellent acting and great, out-there, actor choices; having two lead females (three if you include Aunt May) of overt ethnic minorities is a huge deal these days, it shouldn't be, it should be everywhere, but it isn't and here should be applauded that his school feels like a real one.But at the end of the day, most of all, Homecoming is Avengers 2.5, or maybe, for better or worse, Iron Man 3.5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man Swings Back to the Top,"Spider-Man Homecoming is appropriately named, finally bringing our favorite web-slinger home to fun, lighthearted fun. After the Raimi- Maguire era came to an ignoble stop, and after Garfield's gloomy, glum, grim take bottomed it out, Spidey is swinging strong. This is the best since the apex of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 over a decade ago. We begin immediately after the Avengers defeat of the Chitari in New York when Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is scavenging through the alien technology. He was contracted to do so, but then ingloriously kicked to the curb by the government and Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.) He takes some for himself to research and use. Kick forward to near present day when Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) helps the Stark Team against the Cap Team in Civil War. Then, we return to New York where Stark tells Spider-Man he will be an asset to the Avenger and to wait for his call. Spidey is now relegated to the kids table while Happy Hogan (Jon Faverau) ""monitors"" his progress. The adults tend to ignore Peter Parker as he gives minor help and juggles his life at high school. He still wants to prove himself, and eventually stumbles across Toomes' team as they try to sell weapons fueled by alien technology, and rob from ATMs. Happy and Tony tell Spidey to stay out of the big stuff, but not much else. Spidey is desperate to prove he is ready and pursues the low-lying crime syndicate on his own. He does a few impressive things, but eventually, his endeavors backfire. Tony Stark/Ironman has to bail him out, and takes the suit. Alone, Spidey has to figure out how to save the day. There are a few gripes to get out of the way. First is the Spider-Man suit from Stark can do as much as the Ironman suit. This takes away from Peter's ingenuity and creativity he displays in the comics. Secondly, the Aunt May character is underused, undeveloped, and miscast. And this seems to be a conscious decision by writers and producers to focus on the Peter Parker cadre at school. Aunt May is a prominent character, and can show all of strength as Rosemary Harris proved in Spider-Man 2. Finally, the lacking of adults in the movie spreads to the crew as well. With the focus on high school, mostly Peter's peers, it is a high school movie. Of course, Peter is in high school, and attempting to reconcile his aspirations for peers and his responsibility. On the other hand, the strengths of homecoming outpace this missteps. The first kudos is to Tom Holland who portrays the web-slinger with such conflict, hope, and frustration so well. Between his anger with Happy and Tony, and reconciling his disappearances with Aunt May and his friends, and trying to impress the Avengers, Holland gives us an earnest performance. The audience will believe he is 16. Just as good is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. As a Spider-Man comic collector, I never held the Vulture is high regard. That goes the opposite way in this cinematic adaptation. This was the best villain since Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2. He does garner sympathy to a certain extent, but Keaton gives the Toomes character the right amount of bitterness, anger, and desperation. Finally, there is a Spider-Man who has to reckon with being a kid and wanting to be an adult with adult figures failing him. As a kid, he makes mistakes because he does not stop to think things through. This is Spider-Man movie of the future. It works, and works well. It still does not have the power and gravitas of the original Raimi/Maguire movies (1-2), but it is a great one for the ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man Homecoming is the best movie of the summer of 2017,"After seeing the film for the 3rd time I re-rated it from an 8 to a 9. I don't give 10 ratings because I believe in the overall calculations of films in IMDb the ones and the tens are disregarded and only those ratings between 2 and 9 matter. Nonetheless Tom Holland makes a perfect Peter Parker/Spiderman. Robert Downey Jr. appeared just enough in the movie to be interesting but not enough to upstage the real star that Holland is. The acting is top notch, so is the screenplay and special effects. I hope ""Homecoming"" receives the recognition it deserves come Oscar time. It was that good!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but not my favorite","It was an alright movie, but it was probably my least favorite Marvel movie. One thing I had an issue with was the humor. I understand these movies would like to cater to children as well as adults, but this time around the humor seemed a lot more forced and cheesy. A lot of parts definitely seemed cheesy. I still laughed at a few parts, and I like humor in movies in general, but this was a little too much. It took away the seriousness of the film.I also didn't care for the change of the characters. I think the actor for Spiderman and Vulture were great, but Aunt May, MJ, and Flash were the one's that bothered me. Only because they strayed away from who they actually are. I usually don't have a problem with a little differences, but they are drastically different from who they are suppose to be. Honestly, it's nothing to do with race, but these characters were made a certain way from the start, so they should stay like that. New characters can be different races, genders, ethnicities, etc.Other than that, I thought it was a decent film. I still enjoyed it and will be getting it on Blu-Ray. Again, it is probably my least favorite Marvel film to date and least favorite superhero film this year. Looking forward to Justice League and Thor 3!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I really liked it!,"Wow. Some of the reviews are brutal.I liked it. It was entertaining. I enjoyed all the cameos of other Avengers.

"Fun, worth more than the ticket price, but still waiting for the Homerun","Great casting with Holland and Keaton, but I honestly wanted more scenes with Keaton. Awesome to see him as a super villain. The villain gets plenty of screen time but a lot of it is the vulture character and Keaton was at his best out of costume. Passable story line. With 12 credited writers, this felt a bit like a patchwork of ideas, some that worked for me and some that didn't. Some of the best scenes were the comedy. Some of the CGI action looked a little jerky to me, in that way that all the other Marvel action looks. Loved that they took the character back to high school. Didn't 'feel' the chemistry between him and the girl so some of that drama fell flat. They could have toned down Parkers 'spaz' moments just a little.See it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Get real Marvel movie's are mediocre,"If this is the destiny of this site i will leave and never come back. Hollwood has never ever been this UN-imaginative and instead of people trying to fight the endless unnecessary reboots and sequels Marvel fanboys keep giving every marvel movie 10/10's so all of their movies hit the top 250 list. Get real with yourself, Marvel movies have no core no heart no soul no creativity. Just corporate greed and a fan-base so loyal they will like anything. Even movies like ''Blood Diamond'' and Ratatouille are not on the 250 list and this movie is? let that sink in. and think twice before giving the next marvel movie another 10/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Watts captured the essence of the Spider and understood that following Peter Parker's human dramas is much more fun and exciting than seeing big epic explosive battles,"With the story of several superheroes having been established previously, one important member of the Avengers in the comics spoke, and certainly one of the most popular. Spider-Man was created by editor / writer Stan Lee and writer / artist Steve Ditko, and his first appearance was in the anthology book Amazing Fantasy # 15 (August 1962) and gained even more popularity with previous film adaptations, especially the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi.
Since their film rights are tied to Sony, only now have Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the 2016 UCM film, Captain America: Civil War, before now starring in his own film, directed by Jon Watts, who had previously been featured with the interesting Clown (2014) and The Vehicle (2015), in addition to writing short films and television series. With this agreement, the subtitle of the feature ""Back to Home"" never made so much sense, referring to one of his stories in the comics and, also making this reference with the return of the character to his home, Marvel.
The most interesting thing about this script written by twelve hands by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Jon Watts, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, is how he manages to draw parallels and make all the connections with other Avengers films, even the insertion effective Spider-Man has occurred late, only in the final phase of phase 3 of the Marvel universe in theaters. Right off the bat, we've gone back eight years in the chronology of the universe, right after the battle of the newly revealed to the world, Avengers, against the alien race Chitauri in New York. Right away, we are already introduced to one of the best known villains in the comics, the Vulture / Adrian Toomes, played here by the always great Michale Keaton, who was once on the other side of the story, as Bruce Wayne, Batman.
Right away, we already know the villain's motivations, with the loss of a millionaire contract with the city to clean the city after the battle with the aliens for the joint venture formed by Stark Industries with the federal government, with the Control Department of Damages starting to supervise the collection and storage of alien materials. From then on, still having possession of an amount of alien technology in hand, Toomes begins to create his hyper-technological flying suit and to earn money by selling this technology to all types of criminals. All of this also awaits revenge with Tony Stark, amid preparations to move to the new headquarters of the Avengers. There is a human history there. The old bank robber, created in The Amazing Spider-Man # 2, undergoes a humanizing adaptation, becoming a figure with more understandable motivations here, even though greed has gone up in the character's head more and more after so long . join him and are gaining prominence throughout the film other enemies already well-known from Cabeça de Teia, such as Shocker, Scorpion and the Builder, all with their well-defined purposes and a lot of work with the scraps of the chitauri that destroyed part of Manhattan in the first Avengers.Right at the beginning, it is interesting to see behind the scenes of the first scenes we saw of the hero together with the other Avengers, in 'Civil War' where the Friend of the Neighborhood is recruited for the first time by Tony Stark, who takes him to help him in the confrontation against Captain America and his allies in Berlin, in the famous airport sequence, with more than a dozen heroes meeting each other. These backstage are revealed through a cell phone, through the eyes of the teenager Peter Parker, showing all his dazzle and a lot of excitement in participating in all that alongside the Avengers. And it is in these scenes that we can, right from the start, have more of the always priceless interaction between Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Happy Hogan. It is precisely this chemistry and interaction between two super-sharp actors for comedy like Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr and all this dynamics explored in some moments of mentor and pupil is one of the ingredients that make the film work. Despite the participation of Iron Man in key moments of this film, it is great that the film does not rely on the already established and popular Iron Man. Tony Stark is key to mentoring the young and still wandering arachnid hero and being the link between the film and the Avengers universe. The film is of Spider-Man all the time and it is he who is actually the protagonist here.Having made this quick and efficient presentation of the villain, the script begins to set our hero in the world in which he lives two months after the events of 'Civil War'. Peter is an ordinary, superintelligent high school student who lives with his aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He is Ned's best friend (Jacob Batalon), and has to deal with the bullying of the Flash school bully (Tony Revolori), with the antisocial and sarcastic friend Michelle (Zendaya) and the passion he has for Liz (Laura Harrier), the captain of his Academic Decatlon team. In the meantime, he continues to await a new call from Tony Stark to join the Avengers while continuing to help people in ""not-so-heroic"" acts, thinking he could help more, on a really important mission. We followed Peter Parker's life at school and the problems that adolescence brings to a boy who, between chemistry and Spanish classes, wants to use his powers responsibly. There are also comical situations in which he ends up getting involved by pure immaturity. We see him falling in love with the high school girl, the school dance, the school's friends and rivals, the dilemmas and consequences. With references to 'O Clube dos Cinco (1985)' and 'Curtindo a Vida Adoidado (1986)', neither Spider-Man nor The Spectacular Spider-Man adopted high school as an organism as alive as Homecoming. The day-to-day life of high school still sounds pretty exhausting for Parker, but not at all boring for the publicWhen faced with real criminals using high tech weapons at a bank ATM, Peter begins to investigate the sale of this type of technological weapons by a band of criminals, which leads him to follow the Vulture. From that point on, we can see Peter dealing with the discovery of new features of his uniform with the help of the uniform assistant Karen (voice of Jennifer Connelly) in the Damage Control underground storage safe. The action scenes are original and well thought out. There are the scenes that take place at the Washington Monument, close to where the school Decathlon competition would take place in which Spider-Man saves his high school friends from the Chitauri explosive energy core that became a bomb when exposed to radiation. Another exciting sequence is set against the smuggled arms of weapons in yet another confrontation between Spider-Man and the Vulture, with the essential participation of Iron Man.It is also curious, to note several small references to previous films of our hero that have already been brought to the screen, such as when Betty (Angourie Rice) says at school that Spider-Man can be 30 years old (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were around this age when they first debuted as the hero), or the scene in which Spider-Man tries to hold the parts of the boat reminding the hero by saving people from the subway accident in ""Spider-Man 2"", or even by lifting giant structures of concrete with its strength also seen in ""Spider-Man 2"". The internal references of the franchise are also there, whether in the videos of Captain America - it is even mentioned that he is now a wanted after the events of Civil War - in the imitations of Peter of Thor, and in the quotes from the colleges of Hulk and Black Widow, for example.
The character's romantic pair, Liz (Laura Harrier), on the other hand, is not as strong a figure as Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy were in the predecessor works. The chemistry between the girl and the hero is low, but there was no reason why this was really worked out by the script. The film itself guarantees the character the status of passing passion, being a good approximation to the source material, since Liz Allan, in the comics of the 60s, is also an affection - not at all relatable - from school, never proving to be true. In this sense, it is a faithful adaptation, because Liz Allan leaves for Oregon after the climax of the work, due to bombastic events.
However, the film insists on falling into some clichés, such as the discovery of the villain being directly linked to someone important to him. For the initial physical difference, it is something that we could not make the immediate connection and it even surprises right away. However, it is a device used in all previous times, whether it is exactly the same in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", or also exploring a relationship with someone directly connected, as in ""Spider-Man (2002)"" by Sam Raimi.
Finally portrayed here as a teenager, director Jon Watts explores very well all the insecurities and peculiarities of an ordinary teenager, who had discovered his powers a few months ago. We can notice the hero's portrayal in a phase full of challenges, self-knowledge, and learning from his own mistakes. Watts captured the essence of the Spider and understood that following Peter Parker's human dramas is much more fun and exciting than seeing big epic explosive battles (not that there aren't, as in any blockbuster). Another essential element here is that 'Back to Home' builds the basis for your script with the consequences that the actions of the heroes had on the lives of normal people. 'Back to Home' fully justifies yet another ""origin"" story of one of the most beloved characters in the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
As authentic as possibly can get to Marvels Comic Books Spider-Man,"First Of All , i had seen Spider-Man Homecoming movie for the first time in Randolph Theatre in Massachusetts this past Friday 07.07.2017. My name is Piotr Kucharski and i am from Europe Poland. I got into comic books at age of 10 years old and what got me into them besides growing up poor was Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man and that is when i fell in love with the comic books in first place. I am 32 now and up to this day out of all super heroes and comic books that i am still collecting The Amazing Spider-Man and everything related to him is all my life time favorite comic book hero. Now i've had seen all past spider-man movies up to homecoming and i have to admit personally that this one with Tom Holland is as best and close authentic as it can get so far to Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man except the fact that Iron Man Tony Stark had given him the suit and was his mentor in this latest movie. There are a lot of things that i loved in this movie such as: Tom Holland surprisingly fit and portrayed Spider-Man almost close o perfect because of his personality and great humor either though Spider-Man is American and not from England he he. Tom Holland was funny/sarcastic when he needed and serious when needed also in the movie and displayed characteristics from comic books a lot. He also fit great besides his age as high school student and as peter Parker. Michael Keaton also played fantastic vulture and almost followed him closely as Marvel comic book portraits the character. Last but not least Tony Stark was a nice surprisingly addition to spider-man as his mentor and gave him nice suit either though in comic book Spider-Man had made mostly them himself. But as future goes and compared to real life, this movie suit helped him gave the spider sense acting as a female voice in his mask which i found perfectly amazing and close as it can get to his spider-sense other than kinda movie imaginary sense in other spider-man movies. Few other things were also fantastic but some were a bit disappointing such as why they did not show Holland starting fresh a bit and getting bit by spider and becoming a spider-man?? Well they wanted to follow of what happened after civil war. In conclusion Spider-Man score 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Science of the Movie,"Overall, I quite enjoyed this movie. That said, I have to wonder if anyone on the crew did more than a hint of research when drafting the lab procedure to make web fluid. You'd think they'd at least be sure all the compounds they drew on the page were at least plausible, however 1-isopropylene-2-methylcyclohexane is pretty far from that. Beyond which, it seems no one bothered to figure out what actual spider silk was made of, as the lab formula has absolutely nothing capable of creating amino acids (the main component of most spider silks). Unfortunately, this movie, while attempting to feature a science whiz, completely fails to present well-researched science.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie is fantastic.,"I saw this movie in theaters and wasn't even looking forward to it that much. I didn't think that it was going to be bad, I just hadn't been carried away by the internet hype before I watched it. This movie was amazing. There is an end credits scene if you didn't already know. Remember to stick around for that if you haven't already scene this movie.---After rewatching the movie at home (over a year later) and finally watching all the other Avengers movies, I've gotta say that this is a fantastic movie. It fits well into the MCU, and is easily one of my favorite movies in the series. It is one of my favorite Spider-Man movies, second only to Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (although there are several Spider-Man movies announced that are coming in the near future so who knows). If you like comedies, action, the MCU, or Spider-Man, then I would highly recommend watching this movie. I would also recommend watching all the deleted/extended scenes and bonus features if you can.

Surprisingly good!,"A few years ago when I found out that the Spider-Man saga was going to be restarted again, I was like: ""Nooooooooo why? Garfield was awesome!""I always loved the Spider-Man's trilogy (the ones with Tobey Maguire) since I was 4, and they're still special for me; the ones with Andrew Garfield were as amazing as the titles.And then we have Tom Holland...well, when I first saw him performing Peter Parker/Spider-Man in ""Captain America: Civil War"", I was judging him all the time, because I found him like very stupid and irritating for being Spider-Man. And, of course, I first considered him as a giant insult for its predecessors.But then ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" arrived and the only motive I had to go and see it was my eternal faithfulness to Marvel and its movies, but that was it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered on buying a ticket for it.And I was almost completely wrong.I was surprised of how good and hilarious was the job of Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Although before this movie I always saw him stupid, I realized that, after all, Peter Parker was still a boy, and that's what Tom was in here, and something that the other Spider-Man movies lacked.Michael Keaton was excellent as the vulture (what can I say? He always does an excellent job), and I think that everyone in the cast did a great job, even Marisa Tomei as Aunt May (despite the fact that she was a bit young for that role, but it was find).The only character that I thought that was completely awful was Flash Thompson. He was a big guy who enjoys to bully everyone who is smaller than him, not a stupid and annoying geek who made look Peter as the bully. And there's other character that at first you will love, but then when she made a brief reference to a character, you will hate...you guys when you see the movie will know who am I talking about.In conclusion, all the action was good, it has nice jokes and well, it is always nice to see Mr. Downey Jr. and, of course, the always important special appearance of Stan Lee.Thanks for reading!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

What a promising start! Spidey's back!,"Spiderman: Homecoming was a fantastic second reboot of the beloved web slinger, and that already is something. It is an entertainment gem, with victories from an outstanding cast, characters that boast of fresh personas, and an OG take on Peter Parker's backstory that smells like teen spirit. See what I did there?This Jon Watts rendition of Spider-man sees Peter's struggle between adolescence angst, and becoming a friendly neighborhood superhero. In quite a shocking turn of events then, Watts and his horde of screenwriters FINALLY veers away from the usual Uncle Ben sob story and the Gwen Staci, Mary Jane overplayed romance. In place of these is a coming of age story where Peter's choices between becoming a regular high-schooler, upping social status, and craving for this heftier place in society, are spotlighted. With these themes, the overall tone is then childish, fun-loving and revved up with teen hormones, yet in amazing fashion, the narrative brims with seriousness.Apart from its storyline, Homecoming as well home-runs with its cast and characters. Tom Holland was SUPERB as Spider-man, realistic in his portrayal of youth, optimism and unrelenting ambition. Newcomer Jacob Batalon was another welcome addition, terrific as Peter's mate and the comedic, innocent ""guy in the chair"". Michael Keaton as Vulture however, was the picture's most pleasing surprise, as Keaton takes advantage of the depth given to the scavenging villain, and conveys the needed humanity without fault, drawing audiences to his motivations.Onto its imperfections, Homecoming does drag in overbearing episodes that focuses on his naivety, far too much. We understand the innocence already; so were those AI dialogues and badass time mishaps worth it?Nevertheless, with storyline and character concepts that are honest & brand spanking fresh, and heroics that come infused with an assortment of MCU entertainment elements, Homecoming absolutely proves that WE DO need this second reboot. Could Watts & Holland give Sam Raimi & Tobey Maguire a run for their money? Let's wait for the sequels. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's a kids movie.,"Gave this a low 3 out of 10 because basically this new spiderman is just 'baby ironman's junior high school days'.

The story was OK and with this being the third spidermen reboot since 2000, I guess they couldn't really have done another 'boy gets bitten by spider, boys uncle gets killed, boy becomes good spiderman' movie, but I wish they had just made stand alone spiderman. Not 'baby spiderman meets father figure Avengers member Ironman'I think this movie was made to appeal to the 50 percent or so of children in America being raised in a single parent household... great for them, but not so much for 35 year old, Toby maguire spiderman fan me.So overall s disappointing movie, not terrible, just far, far, far from great.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great movie!,"The Spider-man: Homecoming film is one of the greatest movies of 2017 so far. The movie shows Peter Parker as a teenager and his struggle to get into the Avengers and battling high-school at the same time.The casting of Tom Holland as Spider-man is just incredible! He was able to perfectly portray the Peter Parker and Spider-man we all know and love from the comics. The Peter Parker in this movie really helped the audience connect with him as if he was just another kid from New York. Adding Robert Downey Jr. a.k.a. Iron Man in this movie as a father figure to Peter, was also a brilliant idea. The Spider-man in this movie is still this friendly neighborhood Spider-man from the comics without being too cocky and too awkward.A lot of fans are complaining about the big changes from the comics too like how Flash is a nerd and not a jock which we can all understand but personally, I'm okay with changes. This movie isn't for people who are afraid of changes and really want to stick with the story in the comics.Overall, I think this movie is just great! The acting, the visuals, etc. Although the acting scenes fell a little short, it wasn't really the main point about this movie anyway. It's about Peter Parker discovering more about himself and trying to be much more independent. This movie really helps the audience connect with Peter Parker/ Spider-man.

Web of Youth: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' Weaves a Tale of Teenage Triumph and Tribulation,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" swings into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a youthful vigor that is as refreshing as it is entertaining. Director Jon Watts captures the essence of high school life with a John Hughes-esque sensibility, infusing the superhero narrative with a coming-of-age authenticity that resonates with anyone who has ever felt the awkward pangs of adolescence.Tom Holland embodies Peter Parker with a charming naiveté and earnestness that is instantly endearing. He is, in many ways, the heart and soul of the film, portraying a Spider-Man who is not yet jaded by the world of superheroes and villains. His performance is a balancing act of wide-eyed wonder and the weighty responsibility of newfound power, and Holland navigates this dichotomy with a deftness that belies his years.The action sequences are crafted with a kinetic energy that propels the story forward without overshadowing the character-driven moments that give the film its depth. The Vulture, played with a blue-collar gravitas by Michael Keaton, is a villain who is both relatable and menacing, offering a critique of the societal structures that create such adversaries.The film's integration into the larger Marvel tapestry is handled with a light touch, allowing ""Homecoming"" to stand on its own while still acknowledging the broader world it inhabits. The humor is well-timed and genuinely funny, avoiding the pitfall of quips that can sometimes feel forced in lesser films.The reliance on Tony Stark to anchor Peter's journey, while understandable from a narrative standpoint, occasionally feels like a crutch that undermines the autonomy of Spider-Man's arc. The film sometimes leans too heavily on the charm of its protagonist, glossing over opportunities for deeper character development.The CGI, while impressive, can at times be overwhelming, detracting from the film's otherwise grounded approach to storytelling. The high school setting, though delightfully rendered, sometimes borders on caricature, with archetypes that feel a touch too familiar.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a film that captures the thrill and angst of youth, the excitement of discovery, and the burden of responsibility. It is a worthy addition to the Spider-Man legacy and a testament to the enduring appeal of the character. While it may not reach the heights of cinematic perfection, it is a solid entry that reminds us why we fell in love with the web-slinger in the first place.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"the main course is served, and the motto is let's go chipper!","Back to the drawing board after Sony opting for foreshortening THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise, and recruited into the ever-expanding Marvel Comic Universe, this Spider-Man re-redux features a new web-slinger Tom Holland, treads the same treacherous water of being repetitive (an aggregate of 6 stand-alone summer blockbusters in the past 15 years), but smartly angles for re- connecting with a sizably younger demography by coordinating Peter Parker as a high schooler and emphatically bowdlerizes his tragedy-laden original story (no mentioning of his parents, or the demise of uncle Ben, or how he acquire the superpower), after this new Spidey's scintillating debut in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016) as an amuse-bouche, now the main course is served, and the motto is let's go chipper!The prologue concisely dwells on the movie's main villain Adrian Toomes aka, Vulture (Keaton), an arms trafficker who has no ambition to lay waste to the world and wisely chooses to stay under the radar for his profiteering business of forging mass destructive weapons graced with extraterrestrial substances. The film kick-starts with the caption of ""a film made by Peter Parker"", a fuzzy video shot by his phone which evinces his excitement of becoming an Avenger and he is all keyed up for the next big teamwork which seems to be indefinitely parked.So, life goes on, after all the thrills and spills dissipate, Peter is back on his neighborhood watch escapades, has his first crush on a senior student Liz (Harrier), and inadvertently reveals his secret identity in front of his best friend, the computer-savvy Ned (Batalon), director Jon Watts and his writers make sure there are sufficient gags and jokes to cosset upbeat youngsters and it is a decisive move to reinvigorate a markedly fatigued franchise. After several skirmishes with Vulture and his cronies, including a heroic rescue in the Washington Monument of his academic decathlon teammates, and a ferry fracas nearly causes great casualties, Peter is reprimanded by Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and his bespoke intelligent suit is confiscated.Becoming an Avenger seems hopeless at that point, but for a 15-year-older high schooler, there is something more imperative to do, for example, to invite Liz as his date in the homecoming dance. Only a twist will soon bring Peter face to face with Mr. Toomes, and an ensuing aerial-to-ground battle devised as the final showdown ultimately comes across as derivative and uninspiring, it is not such a compliment to the craftsmanship if one is constantly occupied with galling trivialities such as why Spidey's homemade suit is so durable or why the close-range combat is so inanely gore-less?Pitifully, this reboot isn't a real trooper to give a completely absorbing makeover of one of our most beloved comic heroes, or to shatter the status quo of the comics adaptation formula, although one can see that it has the potential to do so, Tom Holland is a beneficent choice to wear the suit, utterly down-to-earth and charmingly spontaneous, let's only hope he will not be typecast in the future. The whole cast is meritoriously inclusive, each character is given their distinctive individuality, and Michael Keaton, after his self-referential come back in BIRDMAN (2014), looks pretty self-paradoxical taking a fat check in this winged about-face, haranguing his much junior opponent with his faux-family value which belies a thinly veiled egoism and callousness, as a villain, he has his matter-of-fact tack but nonetheless, slumps into an old chestnut when it comes to profit and confrontation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man, Yet!","The same way Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight was a realistic approach to Batman, Homecoming gives us the most realistic idea of what a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man should be, and it was not a dark image, just a real one. He made mistakes while proving his worth and it was not all about epic battles and high dramatics. A lot of the action felt so down to Earth while still being very impressive.You don't have to be a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe to love this movie, but it does make it cooler as they put a lot of subtle references in this in order to integrate Spider-Man into the fold.At the same time, the focus on Spider-man is all the movie needs. Tom Holland was the perfect choice for this teenage superhero. I just loved his Web-Swinger the most. He was awesome.Also love that even though this is a revamp of The Spider-Man franchise, which comes like three years after the Amazing Spider-Man, that they did not revamp the villains. Like Batman, Spider-Man is well known for his large collection of colorful villains, but unlike Batman, who feels the need to revamp the Joker each time he starts a new set of films, Spider-Man keeps going forward, never using his greatest foe (Green Goblin if you don't know) as a formulated crutch. We may have revamped Spider-Man far too many times already, but at least we are seeing all his best enemies on the big screen.Speaking of, here comes the vulture, played by My Batman, Michael Keaton, wow! He's Batman, then He's Birdman and now he's The Vulture. I would think this would be the type of moves that would kill an actor's career, but you'll think differently once you see him portray a man who just went overboard providing for his family, especially in those scenes when he's doing those ""I want to justify my villainy to the hero""scenes.Not the best special effects that I've seen in one of these movies, but other than that, I loved it.

Not bad for a first movie.,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a decent movie. New cast is always refreshing when done right and in this case, it is. The actors are solid and do a great job portraying their character. Vulture is an excellent villain, only problem is.. It doesn't connect with Peter or Spider-Man, you could argue when the plot twist happens, then it's connected. But the whole reason for him turning evil was because of Iron Man. Overall it's a
B movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
good enough that I'll watch the next one BUT,"This is WAY BELOW the first couple of Sam Raimi and Tobey Mcguire films. The writing is far worse. The villain is almost a joke. I guess he is supposed to be an evil, amateurish version of T Stark & I'll guess that we will see him & his daughter in another film someday. If not, WOW, they did NOTHING with that character. And, they seemed to make the fight scenes as slapdash as possible since this spideyboy doesn't even know how to fight.Other problem: this spidey is kind of a goofy teen but when he tells Stark about some guy selling weapons with alien technology to criminals, you would hope that Stark would do something more than ""tell the FBI"". But NOPE. that is all Stark did. Well, I guess in this spidey world, the FBI may be better than the real clowns who became Obama's political operatives and lost all credibility & competence.btw, most of the 7 pts is for giving RD Jr screen time & using 3 great late-70s/eraly-80s songs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tom Holland as Spiderman,Tom Holland as Spiderman was the best idea ever. This movie was web slinging fun the whole time. Tom Holland deserves an Academy Award for his great job as Spiderman / Peter Parker. The way this movie was shot with the IMAX 3D cameras was spot on perfection.

Does pretty much everything right,"I'm not a big fan of Marvel films. I've liked a few of them, and none of them have been outright terrible, but they're mostly just average and nothing to write home about. I think Spiderman: Homecoming feels so fresh because it isn't concerned with the usual ""save the world"" plot that many of these films are. It's incredibly grounded and what it has going for it is a lot of relatable, actually funny humor centered around Peter Parker's life as a teenager. More than anything that is what the film gets right: the tone of high school. The action sequences in this are well done but none of them bog down the film's true heart. This is pretty much everything the film needed to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Probably one of my favorite Marvel films,"This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War. Marvel wisely opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is tasked with taking Peter under his wing. Of course, Peter only sees the glory of being a superhero and ends up taking on situations that are too big for him to handle on his own. He has to be bailed out by Iron Man on a couple different occasions. Peter seems to think that wearing the suit with all of its gadgets and fancy technology will bring him the tools he needs to be like idols Iron Man and Captain America--not realizing that there is much more too it than just fancy tools. One very poignant moment has Peter telling Tony that he is ""nothing without the (spider-Man) suit."" To which Tony responds very bluntly, ""then you don't deserve to wear the suit."" Tony is waiting for Peter to show something emotionally and mentally that proves to Tony and the rest of the Avengers that he has what it takes to be a viable member of the team.Much of the film involves Peter trying to figure out what it means to be Spider-Man. It's more than just foiling bank robberies by wrapping people up in his web. He's also trying to figure out who he is. Feeling like he's wasting his time in high school, he struggles to make friends and to fit in with his peers. He faces many of the normal issues that teenagers - especially ones that are unique- face such as bullying, crushing on a girl who seems out of his league, trying to juggle academics with outside commitments, and so on.Michael Keaton portrays ""Vulture,"" the villain whom Peter encounters. Vulture is somewhat sympathetic as he seems more like someone who always gets the short end of the stick and is just trying to get a piece of the pie.

Should have left it S.H.I.E.L.D.,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a tightly orchestrated, intertwined, time line of films, where viewers need to watch all the parts in order to follow the overall story line, which is possible because Marvel Studios control is.
Spider-Man is controlled by Sony; they pay for 100% of his films and take the box office receipts, which makes including him in his own film as part of the greater story arcs a tricky proposition.Maybe that's why this film feels more like an Iron Man film at times. Unlike previous Peter Parker films, there's no Uncle Ben and having his life defined by that death, or need to show him getting bitten and developing his native powers, but it's rather how he fits into the greater MCU - as though you haven't seen an MCU film before - as part of Tony Starks ""intern scheme"", and introducing extra parts to the neighbourhood Spider-Man that feel gimmicky. This results in Jon Favreau as Tonys body guard Happy getting more screen time than Peters love interest Liz (Laura Harrier).It gets the quirky, angst ridden Peter. The nerdy Peter who builds Lego with his best mate, the star of the general knowledge team. Whose never been on a plane and sneaks around behind his Aunts clueless back. 
Tom Holland plays the role with humour and rage, fluctuating between the naivety of a young man finding his powers and confidence of a superhero willing to put his life on the line for society. Alongside him, Jacob Batalon as Ned, likewise has the juvenile questions about what can Spider-Man do (how far do the web slingers fire?), while being Peters ""guy in the chair"", tech savvy associate; seemingly able to emulate Tony Starkesque computer skills.Yet at times the scale of the action seems wrong. Going from stopping local hoodlums on bikes, to dealing with weaponry that nearly destroyed New York and took the whole team of Avengers to stop. 
The weapons developer - Phineas Mason / The Tinkerer (Michael Chernus) would have made for a good Agents of SHIELD enemy; coming up with various weapons to take on the old government agency. Following the Sokovia Accords
(mentioned in the film), who would stop him?
Michael Keaton makes for a good bad guy; he has the motivation and opportunity to create the situations for Spidey to combat, without being so psychotic as to completely take over Peters life. Like many teen based films, he could be a person that a teen might have to overcome in their everyday life, but being a superhero, they have the ability to actually kick their ass rather than having to verbalize the conflict. That works.What doesn't work for me are the shortcuts and scale that joins the set pieces up. He doesn't need the Iron Man gimmicks to be the neighbourhood Spider Man.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Michael Keaton plays his role well enough, while it's cool to see 'Iron Man' duo Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau involved.Jacob Batalon is good, while it's noteworthy to have Zendaya and Donald Glover appear; even if they are underused/unimportant, at least for now for the former, I assume.

Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) Worst Spider-Man?,"Everyone always wanted to see Spider-Man along with the other superheroes in the Marvel universe, but after that happened a lot of criticism was made. Are these reviews really right? Some say this is the worst Spider-Man in cinema, but I don't think so. As much as it has the problem of being too much of an ""iron boy"" movie, it still holds up as a good Spider-Man movie. He has the character's charisma and manages to make good jokes, the biggest problem is Peter Parker. He seems not to suffer consequences and his entire school and family nucleus is very weak. The film's villain is its highest point, especially in the third act when it is revealed who he really is.

"Spider-Man used to be my favorite superhero, and now Marvel has ruined him for me.","'SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The second reboot of the 'SPIDER-MAN' film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. This one is co-produced by Marvel Studios (for the first time), with Sony Pictures (who previously held the film rights) distributing the movie. It's the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it integrates the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character into the Marvel film universe for the first time. The movie has Parker (now played by Tom Holland) as a 15-year- old high school student, that's trying to balance being a super hero, fighting a new villain called Vulture (played by Michael Keaton, of 'BATMAN' and 'BIRDMAN' fame), and school life (all at the same time). The movie also costars Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man/Tony Stark of course, once again), Jon Favreau, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Michael Chernus, Martin Starr and Donald Glover. It was directed by Jon Watts (who's also helmed such indie hits as 'CLOWN' and 'COP CAR') and it was written by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Watts and Christopher Ford (a usual writing partner of Watts). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's of course another big hit at the Box Office for Marvel Studios. Being a huge Spider-Man fan, I was severely disappointed with this movie!The story begins in 2012 when a salvage company, ran by Adrian Toomes (Keaton), is ran out of business by Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), but not before Toomes, and his employees, steal some alien technology from a New York site they were working at. They then sell the technology to other criminals, and Toomes builds a suit with it that enables him to fly (and he also takes on the nickname Vulture). 8 years later Peter Parker (Holland) is recruited by Stark to help fight Captain America, and he gives him a special suit to fight criminals with. Parker is eager to become a superhero, while also trying to live a normal high school life. His first major opponent becomes Vulture.I think the film is well directed, acted and even well written (to a certain extent). I also love how minimal the action scenes are, and I like how the villain isn't really that bad of a guy in it. Still I hate how much Marvel changed the source material. This is kind of a good superhero film, but it's just not a good Spider-Man movie (if they would have called it something else, that would have made it a much better film in my opinion). I also don't like how sexist the casting of this film is, all of the women are really attractive in it (including Aunt May, which is ridiculous), and all of the guys are pretty nerdy (even Flash, which is equally ridiculous). I also hate that it's yet another superhero movie that makes rich people the heroes, while the poor hard working Americans are the villains. Tony Stark should not even be in this film too, it's absurd that he's Spider-Man's mentor! So I really hate so much about this film, and I think Marvel is one of the most evil and corrupt businesses in the world, but I have to admit it's still a well made movie. Spider-Man used to be my favorite superhero though, and now Marvel has ruined him for me.Watch our latest 'MOVIE TALK' movie review here: https://vimeo.com/226190246",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Homecoming"" rediscovers Spider-Man's roots without retelling his origins","No Marvel superhero has been through the ordeal of Spider-Man on the big screen. Peter Parker's first two films practically launched the modern superhero genre, but then after creative issues, Sony rebooted him, and audiences were less than enthused. Probably with much reluctance, Sony and Marvel Studios reached terms on a co- production to let Spidey play with his superfriends in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true homecoming that turned out as good as either studio – and the fans – could have imagined.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" returns Peter Parker to his teenage roots as well. Played with a refreshing youthful energy by Tom Holland, Parker is presented as a sort of Avenger-in-training whom Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has taken under his wing. In essence, the film depicts Parker's training wheels period, learning what it takes to be a hero and earning the bumps and bruises that come with it.What's notably missing from that summary is Spider-Man's origin story; a wise decision given that retelling it seemed to cast a shadow over ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films. ""Homecoming"" story creators and initial screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley still take elements of Spider-Man's roots, but choose instead to focus on how a teenager might approach superheroism. Without being a slave to that spider bite and Uncle Ben storyline, which audiences were tired of anyway, the film gets a lot more time to develop the character in more innovative, meaningful ways.""Homecoming"" spends significant time on Parker's high school life, namely his academic decathlon team, a diverse group that includes his best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), his rival/bully, Flash (Tony Revolori), the odd girl that kind of stalks him, Michelle (Zendaya), and his crush, Liz (Laura Carrier). But Peter's academic dedication is lacking thanks to his ""Stark internship."" When he discovers criminals using odd/dangerous weapons in his neighborhood in Queens, he goes on a bit of a crusade for good, despite Tony Stark's warnings, and his dual identities become more and more difficult to maintain.The story allows director Jon Watts to pursue superhero film meets coming-of-age movie. Although John Hughes is a lofty comparison (one the film tries to literally make in one amusing sequence), Watts' film has the right playful, loose and carefree spirit that echoes the attitudes of its hero at this stage in his journey.In the scene with a Hughes movie reference, for example, Spider-Man is clumsily barreling through a suburban neighborhood, which is all the more funny to those who understand how suburbia is not conducive in the least to Spider-Man's abilities. Much like how it bypassed the origin story, ""Homecoming"" smartly recognizes other ways the audience is familiar with Spider-Man and pushes the character's boundaries in exciting ways.The element of the suit coming from Stark Industries might deviate from the character's origins, but it's a device, literally and figuratively, that keeps us on our toes. At one point, Peter finds a way to hack the suit and activate its full capabilities, which allows for a lot of fun surprises. More importantly, however, is the humor and challenge of Spider-Man figuring out how to use them as a kid who has gotten in way over his head.The greatest strengths of ""Homecoming"" are these subtle deviations from and fresh takes on the conventions of both previous ""Spider- Man"" movies and other superhero movies. No example is more prominent than the villain, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), a new MCU-take on the villain Vulture. A blue-collar boss motivated by family and being cheated as the little guy, he and Spider-Man develop an interesting relationship that borrows a bit from the 2002 film's Norman Osborn character. In today's landscape on omnipotent, power- hungry, world domination villains, the intimacy here is a breath of fresh air.Consequently, the action stays small scale: a truck heist, a bank robbery, a Washington Monument rescue and a Staten Island ferry fiasco. Rather than resorting to city-leveling, these sequences are tightly constructed with greater ingenuity, almost a throwback to the way things were before bloated visual effects budgets. This choice also hearkens to the storytelling goals of the movie, one of which is to bring Spider-Man back to his ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" roots. One would think bringing Spider-Man into the MCU would do the opposite, but the story smartly contains it while allowing it to feel as though it's part of that bigger universe.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" doesn't revolutionize the genre or Spider- Man, but as the third iteration of the webslinger in 15 years, its creators understood the importance of stepping back and identifying how a new Spider-Man could both emerge and thrive in a bustling comic hero movie landscape. They figured out how to restore the character's unique fingerprint for Spider-Man's sake and for our sake. With Holland only 21 and the character still in high school, Spider-Man now has the chance to mature and grow both in terms of story and as the genre and box-office dominating hero he's always been.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Enjoyable and... that's all.,"A good movie is that one that grabs the audience from the very beginning and engages them fully throughout its duration on the screen. Spiderman movie is correct in most aspects, but somehow, at times, I found myself thinking about the technicalities of filming rather than feeling completely immersed in the story. The plot is just not good enough to let you enter and connect fully with the story being told. That might be because I'm not the target audience –the movie is a teenage movie probably targeted to teens– but that doesn't mean an adult will not enjoy it and have a good time too.From the technical point of view, the film is excellent, the lighting and camera work gives a realistic feel to the story that helps the viewer to believe whatever happens on the screen. The writing is funny, and got the right rhythm and perfectly mixes comedy and action the way Marvel does so efficiently.The actors are believable and make the characters to feel real on the screen, although the drama in the story is not enough to engage the audience fully. A little bit of drama would have helped the audience to connect deeper with the characters and would help the story to be more engaging. I'm not a Spiderman fan and I can't really compare this Spiderman to the one in the comic books, but I would agree the movie is a very good depiction of the character as we know from popular culture.Now I would like to ask myself a few questions; did I enjoy the movie? yes, I did, would I pay to watch it again? yes, maybe, does it entertains? yes, great, is it a classic, a movie you will remember as something which contributed to my knowledge and understanding of the world we live today? no, not really But, who cares, this is a product meant to entertain you and have fun, so just sit, relax and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A very satisfying addition to the canon.,"After three ""Spider-Man"" movies directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire in the eponymous role and two ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films helmed by Marc Web with (British) Andrew Garfield as the titular super-hero, we have a sixth cinematic outing for the arachnid in a mere 15 years. This time the director is little-known Jon Watts and Peter Parker is played by another British actor, Tom Holland who made a cameo appearance in this role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". Essentially this is a stand-alone contribution to Marvel's Cinematic Universe, although there are short appearances by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and an all-too-brief look-in by Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).So, what's new? Well, for once Parker - who is presented as a 15 year old a high school student - is represented by a genuinely young thespian (although Holland is 21) and we have the youngest Aunt May yet (an underused Marisa Tomei). Also we have a new sidekick for Peter, Ned (Jacob Batalon), and an interesting new villain called Vulture (a smart Michael Keaton). Of course, any super-hero movie depends on effective special effects, which are certainly om show here, and exciting action sequences, which are on offer with histrionics at the top of the Washington Monument and on board a Staten Island ferry.

"It's got charm, wit and style - just missing heart.","In Spider-Man's fifth appearance on the big screen they chose a very different approach for his character and it pays off greatly. Peter Parker is a humble teenager who just can't wait to be a superhero. His conflict is that he has been deemed by his hero and mentor,r Iron Man, as merely a ""superhero in training"". Taking influences from John Hughes movies of the past, Marvel tells a teen movie as best they can. The only issue is that it is too ""super"" to truly embody the spirit of John Hughes films. Director/writer John Hughes films succeeded because he so well understood the ethos of adolescence, from teenage insecurity to high school hopes and ambitions, John Hughes had an innate sense of how teenagers ticked and how to make his teenage characters emotionally relatable. Its hard to tell a story that is emotionally relatable when its about a teenage boy who has been recruited for something so great. It may be relatable to the likes of Lebron James, who couldn't wait to be drafted to the NBA out of high school, but for most audience members Spider-Man's conflict could come off as less-relatable - or at least less emotionally significant. And therein lies the biggest issue with this movie: it seems to lack heart. Spider-Man is driven by wanting to be taken seriously, by wanting to be a real superhero. In climatic moments his emotional motivation is just to not let down his hero Tony Stark - rather than being driven by any deeper personal commitments to loved ones or any intimate personal reasons. Its a main plot that does drive character development, but its so lightweight of an emotional anchor it seems like it would work better as a subplot. In some ways this is a nice change of pace for a superhero movie, but there are some scenes in which the film tries desperately to drum up emotion and hearken to the heart of the film, and its these scenes that just feel empty and shallow. But for the rest of the film its light on its feet. It is charming and Tom Holland and his supporting cast of teenage friends are a joy to watch. My only hope is that going forward they are able to find a deeper, more relatable emotional heart for Spider-Man's story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Also, enough cannot be said about how they were able to take a character as lame as Vulture (seriously, is there a weaker repeat character in Spider-man's rogues gallery?) and make him ominous. The character had hat tips to the comic book character (flight suit collar looking sort of like the comic book Vulture's nonsense around his neck) without drawing too much from it -- which is a good thing, since comic book Vulture is lame. Shocker was in it... albeit in a secondary capacity.

Robert Downey Jr has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, plays a mentor to Peter, although he does care for Peter, but in one scene does show he becomes the mentor that Peter needs.The big problems here is the love interest, who I feel never becomes a character, but just fills the void of someone for Peter to be attractive too, unlike Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacey there is not a believable connection.

The nemesis used a contraption to fly and something else that I don't want to give away. But truly this movie had an uphill climb simply because we've seen Spidey so much. There were five movies preceding this one where we've seen what the webslinger can do. How would this movie top those?It didn't. Tom Holland did a good enough job. He's younger looking, dorkier and even has a teenage voice to go with it but we've seen all of his stunts already. Having Iron Man make a cameo certainly helped but it couldn't completely save it.

does a lot as a friendly neighborhood mega-franchise; one of the better 'reboots',"For the most part, if you were among those that saw Spider-Man/Peter Parker appear in Civil War and found him entertaining and, more to the point, *right* as that character and icon, then you will like him all the more in his first movie in this iteration. It's amazing to think that this is the sixth Spider-Man movies in 15 years, and yet this is the first in over a decade that understands this character, in large part making close to the comic books (I haven't read them religiously, but it seems to follow pretty close to the Ultimate run at the least, if not others). I don't know if every action scene is terribly original, but every one has massive stakes for Parker, and yet at the same time they're not the usual apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios that sometimes can make a super-hero movie feel too big, even if the stakes are still strong. Everything is down to the personal here with Parker, and even more than the Raimi movies these get right the high school, awkward teenager part of Parker down pat.Now, was this all even necessary? I don't know, and that may be cause for debate among people for a long time. I got to look at what's put in front of me to say whether it works or not as its own thing; the previous try by Sony to get Spider-Man back into theaters after getting rid of Raimi, Amazing Spider-Man, felt tired and had its moments amid a very spotty story. I'm not even sure if it's necessarily that Marvel Studios *solely* could have brought Parker et al back, or then some, to former glory, but I think with Civil War being the dipping of the toes into the pool and this being the big dive and 1000-meter lap, that they got it right as they could. It all comes down to what makes any of these gigantic corporate products work, regardless of if it's Marvel or DC or whoever: are the actors convincing enough to bring the characters to life, and does the writing do right by them with a story that makes sense and characters that give them something to do?Holland found just the right note in Civil War as like a half of the time innocent-looking puppy of a teenager, the kind that we almost don't want to see get hurt, vulnerable and caring and showing the conflicts so perfectly that Parker has to deal with everyday in his balance as just a regular kid in extraordinary circumstances... but, other half of the time, he can certainly mouth-off and be convincing in that way that Spider-Man just was int the comics (that doesn't mean the comics are sacrosanct or anything, that they *had* to do that to get it right, it's merely to point that this Parker is a wise-ass but funny as hell at doing it, even down to a moment in a montage early on when he stops a guy stealing a bike). Meanwhile, the writers give Parker a best-friend/comic relief, a tired trope that feels totally revitalized here because a) the kid he's paired with is wonderfully dead-pan and yet excitable (kudos to Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds getting it right), and b) he proves himself useful... maybe oddly, a lot, conveniently useful for a teenager, but I can suspend disbelief for a little while.And then there's Keaton; is he used properly, given how damn talented he is? Yes, but only up to a point. There's some moments, like a very tense exchange with the hero in a car, that have a crisp intensity that Keaton can just turn on as if it's nothing. Other times, he's having to work more in what the plot requires, and under his Vulture get-up - obviously, without question, right, a meta-comment in an ironic way regarding BIRDMAN - we don't get to see as much of it. It's in the third act he gets to flex his chops the most, without saying exactly why it's a wonderful twist that we don't see coming but makes sense. Even when he is in the midst of certain story continuity things (an 8 year jump is a bit odd, but again, we try to let it go on q first watch), he is... Michael Keaton. He's a lot of fun to watch.It's hard I think for me to fully analyze this right away as some profound work of art that may have more depth that needs a dive in. That may be all good now for the Raimi movies, but that's looking back over a decade. This is still too fresh, and the only thing I can say is that the writing of the story if 90% of it all tight and gives Parker and Spider-Man a solid, if a little predictable, arc as far as his hero's journey, and the dialog is consistently comedic. I found myself laughing far more than in any previous Spider-Man entry, and that's the key to its success: it knows it's silly in a way, or at least Parker recognizes it, and while the MCU is known for doing that (this year with GotG most of all), this feels even sillier. It knows it. We are let in on the fun. Despite any nitpicks and misgivings, and there are more I won't mention (one involving a character reveal that is right out of, of all things, Dark Knight Rises), it's among the better summer blockbusters in years because of that. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Welcome home,"Being a teenager is hard. So's making a good movie about that existence, and this is thankfully the exception. If you have superpowers, and you think you could escape your awkward, meandering high school(which this one is actually about, only took 6 tries... and 1 for the MCU) life, yet can't seem to make it, it's all the more difficult. Peter Parker(Holland, awed, spot-on) is struggling to balance it all. When The Vulture(Keaton, psychopathic and sometimes charming, complex, one of the franchise's great villains), a gun-runner, starts moving product made up of alien tech left over by fights involving The Avengers, our lead knows he has to stop him.Spider-Man has finally gotten justice on the big screen. In a solo piece, I mean – his Civil War scenes nailed it, as well. You'd think there'd be no way we could get into another adventure with the wall-crawler. 5 times in 12 years?! How to even make it distinct? For one thing, we're spared the origin everyone already knows. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" isn't said, it's communicated non-verbally, as it remains a major theme. The logically limited(how could you swing if there's nothing tall around?) powers are now enhanced by gadgets, without it becoming an Iron Man film. Tony(Downey Jr., witty, and funny in his discomfort with the role of mentor) doesn't take over. The trailers show most of the bits he's in, and he doesn't fight alongside the webhead. Humor is a focus, without it feeling desperate. The cast are likable, other than, of course, Flash, re-imagined as a rich kid. While Liz(Harrier, sweet, smart, driven) is no Gwen, she definitely isn't a Mary Jane either, and, hey, not every major female character needs to be that active in saving the day. Too Disney, Nickelodeon, excessive collateral damage(especially considering that Stark takes most of it in stride, despite what happened between him and Steve)? Some will think so, and I can see why.I recommend this to everyone. Yes, you read that right. If you can enjoy any movie, give this one a chance. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fun and mischievous,"This film tells the story of a young man who is selected by Tony Stark to be the trainee Spiderman. As he is desperate to prove himself, he runs into more trouble than he ever imagined. Soon, he appears to be out of his depth.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" reminds me of ""Deadpool"" because of its light hearted atmosphere, and Peter's mischievous demeanour. The fact that Peter is in observation and training provides a good background to the mischief, otherwise I think it might have proved to be a little annoying. Spiderman is not the almighty hero, but someone who has the potential to be. It is nice to see a cameo from Captain America, and it creates a seamless transition for Spiderman from a standalone franchise to integrating into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
That friendly hero is swinging his way back!,"We're all very used to there being many Marvel movies coming out every year, and this feels like another one right from the same gears as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"", but more scaled down. It doesn't get bloated or overcrowded with invincible heroes. Which I appreciated. There's arguably less superhero action scenes then you would think and more focus on our main character's struggles in life. Is the Marvel formula getting tiresome? That's what I feared, but ""Homecoming"" manages to bring back that relate-able, friendly feeling that you had watching the Sam Raimi films. I'm happy to say this because I was not looking forward to there being a second reboot of Spider-Man.If you've seen a ""Spider-Man"" movie before then you know what you are gonna get. It's a huge improvement compared to the Andrew Garfield ones. And I'm not being biased to Tom Holland or Tobey Maguire because I think all the actors who have portrayed Peter Parker have been great. It's just that all the movies haven't been the best. So, I went in with no real expectations which I think made the experience better. There's a lot of comedy here and the jokes really landed. I found myself laughing often. Especially with all the high school stuff and Happy Hogan's role in the story. I did honestly enjoy the comedy more than the action. Because all of the exciting scenes weren't so amazing, but they were alright at best. Michael Keaton plays one of the better villains in the Marvel Universe. He's not a mustache twirling bad guy, but a man with motivations you can understand. Most importantly; He was an actual person, not just a cartoon with a costume. The rest of the players are fantastic as usual. Robert Downey, Jr. brings his A game even if it's just for a supporting mentor role. The first act of the movie was the strongest with many hilarious moments. It somehow slows down in the second act and never gets as good as the beginning. The finale was not great either. Kind of lackluster which is a shame. Like I said, I enjoyed the more downplayed or funny parts more where there was no big action moment.It's a crowd-pleasing one. The thing about these Marvel movies is that they are enjoyable. They know when to have fun and when to be more serious. This one brings the fun back to Spider-Man. He is not unbeatable and good at everything. He has his powers, but he hasn't learned how to use them all yet. We get to be part of that journey and at the same time see the juggling of his school life. It's a pretty innocent movie that would surely make Sam Raimi proud. Not the most original one I've seen, but a good time nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It's a really fun time when it gets going; the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's second instalment.,"Surprisingly (or maybe not so for anyone who's confidence in the steadily declining quality-control centre over at Sony hasn't been shaken as much as mine), it's the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's second instalment. Though it's a clear step down from the first two films of that trilogy, it thankfully gives us something we haven't already seen. By skipping the origin and giving us a younger Peter Parker who's less experienced as a web-slinger than ever before (finally, an actor who isn't nearly thirty), it creates a uniquely engaging story and a refreshing change of pace. This time around, the web-head's powers are neutered slightly in favour of a more tech-heavy suit, but the feature also manages to fit his abilities in with his characteristics comfortably. He certainly seems like the same person in and out of the suit, and his movement constantly reflects both his physique and his personality. The villain is a three-dimensional character who feels like a human being with proper motivations and valid emotions while still being menacing. He's the best villain in the series since Doc Ock. There are a number of exciting set-pieces that focus on a lower-stakes kind of spectacle that not only makes narrative sense but feels fresh. The best sequence in the film involves the hero and villain sans suits simply having a cleverly conceived conversation. The feature manages to balance the school stuff with the web-swinging so that the former never encroaches on the latter but also has enough time to feel like it matters. Overall, it's a really fun time when it gets going and is a fine return to form for the web-head. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"One of the worst in marvel, destruction to spiderman","I really like spiderman, but unfortunately this is one of the worst movies in the mcu. The casting is just terrible, with tom holland playing the most idiotic spiderman ever existed. Spiderman may be young but he's not stupid like what tom portrayed, an immature lame yelling kid who hasn't even reach puberty, which totally destroys the hero's integrity. His performance is just so annoying and terrible, together with the childish imbecile casts makes the viewing a suffering from start to finish. It's just so bad when comparing to Andrew Garfield's Spiderman who's performance has a lot more depth and thought, with good casts with great story, homecoming is like a cheap made soap opera or children show with bad story and awful acting.

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Being the 3rd reboot of one of my favourite comic book heroes, this attempt marks the first time collaboration between Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios allowing the character to be included in the MCU, what results of this is truly an entertaining, funny and yet so well made film that gives justice to the character and the extended franchise.Firstly, Tom Holland's performance is truly the best, really showing what a teenage boy wants to be a hero so much, bringing charisma and joy to the role. While Michael Keaton gives us a true marvel villain that finally breaks the trend we have seen so many times, not only as a threat but we feel sympathetic towards him for his backstory. The supporting cast were all likable, and Downey Jr keeps it small not overshadowing the screen but his 'father figure' role was indeed good.Direction is strong, story is simple and stays 'street-level' and even nods and references to the characters are all good, not even a feeling of overstuffing was present. I don't think there's much or little to say about the cons of the film but the way it was resulted left me happy and hopeful that Spider-Man in the MCU will indeed mark high hopes for the franchise to expand.Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming marks a true return for one of Marvel's iconic heroes, it's one we definitely needed in the MCU and shows that justice for the source material can be done perfectly, while having heart, action and fun to make this a real 'homecoming' for Spider-Man. 4/5 stars.

Funny teenage movie.,"Well, I always loved the Sam Raimi trilogy and hated the Amazing Spider-man. But this one is a very good one. It is a really funny teenage movie, filled with young people and jokes. The bad guy is not that bad after all, and it is funny to see a young avenger ascending to success.-Negative stuff: first off, no spider bite, no uncle Ben, and no back- story at all. We can also feel that the avengers actors were too expensive to pay for a cameo in the movie, so we just have captain America on the TV and a little bit of Tony Stark. -Cool stuff: Young aunt May, funny characters (especially Ned, Peter's BFF). And a bunch of silly jokes that will always make you smile.Don't expect any curse words or blood like in Deadpool or Logan, it is a family-friendly movie, but one to watch. It's a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man with a fresh twist,"Really enjoyed the first two films, both contained great scenes/action, acting and the two best villains of the films. Was mixed on the third film, which wasn't that bad but suffered mainly from bloat, and was not totally sold on the 'Amazing Spider-Man' films.Whether 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the best 'Spider-Man' film ever is debatable, some may prefer the first two films, others may prefer this. To me, it is the best 'Spider-Man' film since the second and on par with the first two. It may not have taken as many risks or had sequences/action as memorable as the first two films, and for more of an origin story it's best to stick with the first two films. For a fresh twist on 'Spider-Man' and the superhero genre, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (one of Marvel's best to date) more than fits the bill.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is not quite the masterpiece as proclaimed to me and maybe not quite as good as the acclaim, but personally can totally see why it is loved so much and that it deserves all the positivity it's received. It has a couple of faults, Liz is a bland and underwritten character and Laura Harrier does nothing with the character. Flash also could have been much more intimidating in demeanour and physicality, for a bully one is not intimidated, pretty anaemic actually and even annoying at times.Much more could have been done with Spider-Man's powers and how he got around, they could have been better used, being not used enough, and of better quality.However, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' looks great. Slick, stylish with bold, atmospheric use of colour and mostly top-notch special effects. Michael Giacchino pens yet another winner of a music score, both rousing and hypnotic with also an intensity and emotional undercurrent.It's a remarkably well scripted film too. It has some hilarious and rarely forced humour (namely from Ned and Michelle, both of whom should have been annoying but were refreshing scene-stealing comic relief), poignancy and tension. The story works well as a superhero story, with great chemistry between Peter and Tony Stark and a terrific scene in a car with our hero and Vulture, and even more so as an affectionate and easy to relate to coming of age and trying-to-fit-in story. The action is kept at minimum but what there is is fun and suspenseful, even if there were sequences and climaxes more memorable in the first two films.A risk was taken having Jon Watts in the director's chair, but luckily inexperience doesn't show, there is a great sense of visual style and momentum is kept taut. A great cast also helps, with Tom Holland doing a wonderful job in the complex dual role, both roles are easy to relate to and he differentiates the two personalities of nerdy, awkward high school deadline and charismatic head-line-making superhero with remarkable ease.Michael Keaton, fresh from giving two of his best performances in years in 'Birdman' and 'Spotlight', is also superb as Vulture, a refreshingly different and more complex villain than most Marvel villains, a menacing villain but with a humane side with a far less generic motivation than one would find in other Marvel films and doesn't feel underused. A villain that one is intimidated by but also feel sorry for. Marissa Tomei seemed bizarre casting on paper but she is very charming actually and fits well.Robert Downey Jnr brings charismatic intensity and authority to Tony Stark, Jon Favreau is fun while Jacob Batalon and Zendaya are refreshing comic relief.Overall, very good, often great and very nearly outstanding (which it would have been if more care was given to a few of the supporting characters). 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Love it,"Spider-Man: Homecoming swings into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a youthful exuberance and a fresh take on the iconic web-slinger. This film not only captures the essence of Spider-Man but also brings a delightful coming-of-age story to the superhero genre.Tom Holland shines as Peter Parker infusing the character with a perfect blend of teenage awkwardness and heroic determination. Holland's portrayal feels authentic and relatable, making Peter's journey from high school student to neighborhood superhero a joy to watch.The film wisely avoids rehashing Spider-Man's origin story, diving straight into the challenges of balancing teenage life with newfound superhero responsibilities. The high school setting adds a unique and charming layer to the narrative, with Peter navigating typical teenage woes alongside thwarting villainous schemes.Michael Keaton's Vulture emerges as a standout antagonist, bringing a grounded and menacing presence to the film. The personal connection between Vulture and Spider-Man adds emotional depth to their dynamic, making the conflict more than just a battle between hero and villain.This one masterfully blends superhero spectacle with humor, courtesy of Peter's witty banter and interactions with his AI-powered suit. The film's comedic tone doesn't diminish the stakes but instead enhances the overall viewing experience, creating a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere.The supporting cast, including Zendaya as Michelle and Jacob Batalon as Ned, adds charm and diversity to Peter's world. The characters feel like real teenagers, grappling with relatable issues while contributing to the film's overall charisma.The film's action sequences are a visual treat, showcasing Spider-Man's agility and acrobatics in ways that feel both innovative and true to the character's comic book roots. The incorporation of Spider-Man's homemade suit adds a touch of DIY authenticity, emphasizing Peter's resourcefulness.In summary Spider-Man: Homecoming is a triumphant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2,"Not the best Spider-Man movie but still a very good effort nonetheless. It feels very fresh and unique when compared with other MCU movies and even previous Spider-Man incarnations in that it feels like a high school movie first and a Spider-Man movie second. This movie really nails the 'day in the life of' Peter Parker type of feel that it needed to in order to take the character back to his roots which is clearly what they tried to accomplish and did accomplish for me.Tom Holland is the ideal Peter Parker and Spider-Man in that he is shy, nerdy and charismatic all at the same time. I don't care much for the Stark tech version of the Spider-Man suit, however, and really feel that they made a mistake by taking the iconic Spidey-Sense away.Michael Keaton is menacing and as realistic as MCU villains have come so far. He steals every scene he is in and is a great addition to the movie. It is clear with this movie that Marvel responded to the complaints about their weak villains by fleshing the Vulture out a lot more than most other MCU villains and even starting the movie out by focusing on him.Although Tony Stark is not in the movie as much as the trailers would have you believe he is still in it a little too much for my liking. It really did feel like 'Spider-Man featuring Tony Stark' at times whereas I think more of a cameo with just two or three scenes would have worked better by further sharpening the focus on Peter Parker. This is not to say Tony isn't used well, however, as he basically fulfills the Uncle Ben role in this movie and it does work rather well. The supporting cast is fine and does feature a lot characters you will recognize if you are a fan of the Spider-Man comics.All in all, the movie is a little uneven in that the first half is okay but the second half really does step up its game and ends on a strong note.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Great new Re-imagining of Spider-Man!,"I think at this point, everyone is sick of the spider-man story. We all know that Uncle Ben dies, and Spider-Man makes his suit, but this is something we needed. We needed a new story with this character. I think portraying him as a little younger than usual works for his character. I love this movie, because Tom Holland's version of spider-man is very relatable. It can be easy to look at the MCU as just a giant super hero universe far from ours, but in this movie we see a high school kid in New York go on a field trip. We see him walking through the halls of school, and we see how the kids, and regular people react to the existence of superheros in this world.
This main reason is what gets me going back to the movie. There aren't too many MCU movies that portray this feeling. However I think some of this movie doesn't work as well as it should. Spider-Man is given a really powerful suit that just feels like a spider version of Iron Man. Sure that works in differentiating it, but you don't get the struggle of him making the suit, which can build character, and give great emotions when he uses the suit in battle.
All of the characters feel developed pretty well. Even some of the Decathlon team seemed pretty involved, which is great. However Aunt May didn't have as big a role in this movie, but hopefully now that she knows Peter is spider-man, she will be more prominent in Far From Home.

Good show,"Okay first of all there will always be a comparison to Toby McGuire's version. Second While Tony Stark is no role model but Iron Man is a hero and Robert Downey Jr.'s Magic makes his superhero role fabulous, hopefully the Tony Stark/ Steve Rogers (Captain America) dilemma that exploded in Civil War will quickly be resolved, it is painful to see these two awesome characters fight, there is enough intelligence, creativity and diplomacy as well as good will within the Avengers to solve this problem peacefully. Tom Holland brings to the movie something special, the innocence of Spider-Man and his Amazing and refreshing optimism and it is exactly the thing that Tony Stark needs to remind him what a hero is all about and us all as well. We need peace, we need good leaders, love not war, unity and the belief in an America that stands for all that is good and just, similar to what Captain America spoke of in his films and in the Avengers. The ideals of all men created equal, justice, truth, compassion not killing, not hate is what America is about and what makes it great. Please remember also the comics code Authority to protect children from objectionable material, remember comics were made for kids yet when Marvel and DC went Mainstream they got rid of it, not cool. Bring it back, we need to protect our kids from all the grime that is circulating the world is becoming evil, dark and horrid and no we don't want that! Avengers Infinity War, please make sure that Thanos looks really cool and doesn't act doofish someone of this caliber has to have a real presence, the movie has to pull all the stops this is the big one, maybe it should be 2hours 30 minutes long, also get rid of the kitari aliens and bring a better cooler looking better alien race like the Skrulls! Finally Avengers vs. Justice League has to happen and will top 2 billion or even hit 3 billion at the theaters and the public (both camps DC and Marvel) should vote on which hero will win each contest. YEs the movie should include Darseid and Galactus and feature the Fantastic Four (which deserve another and final remake, this time do get it right. For example, you had the Torch and Thing done right in the first film, but you need a smart, serious scientist, for Mr. Fantastic with leadership qualities and beautiful but pure Sue Storm. This time Dr. Doom must wear the armor and dark green cloak, the armor is the equivalent of Iron Mans and he is a superior foe. Also bring back Silver Surfer but he must look more natural when in silver form and all the time he is shown, he really is a remarkable and visually dazzling hero, and his purity and goodness is truly beautiful, like an angel, we need to see more of him.)and a cameo with the X-men to show they do share the same world, and on that note the Avengers need to show the X-men and mention their existence as part of the same world.Lastly the New Mutants should have a cameo with Spidey in it and they should have a full $100 million + budget with all the effects of a major film and the next X-men, because the films just didn't look like they had a big budget. Naturally the script and story should be tight and the costumes should remain close to the comics, the black tights look great, have a reference to Alpha Flight and show some members of the X-men to show continuity, it would be great to have Halle Berry back as Storm and Picard as Xavier cameo, this time make sure Storms hair looks natural, flowing and beautiful not as it did in the feature films where it looked like a wig, please. I would love to see the Rhino with the mech armor, or Morbius in the next film or both.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Grab Your Tickets If You Wanna Encounter The Coolest Spidey In The Series!,"Spiderman series is among the most celebrated franchises in Hollywood and has managed to create a dedicated fan following for the character among youth in particular.The news that Marvel has signed a contract with Sony to hitch up Spidey to their league of superheroes was a bit of a surprise,but I personally felt that the move was rather a much needed one for the revival of the series of which the penultimate offering ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" was the weakest among the lot.Positively,with ""Spiderman Homecoming"", marvel has succeeded in giving a high school drama's tint for the spiderman franchise without losing the soul of the series -whatsoever.Notably,spidey's character portrayed by Tom Holland is true to the spirit of the original comic series and more relatable on comparison with one's portrayed in other films in the series.A perfect balance has been maintained between a Spiderman spin-off and a Marvel helmed superhero film and the presence of Tony Stark as Spidey's mentor and references to Avengers were all handled well by John Watts and his supporting crew who succeeded in making an engaging film with only few loopholes in the narration.On the negative side the 3D effects were mediocre and the climax portions could have been more thrilling of sorts.Overall,Spiderman Homecoming is a neatly presented rework of the original comic series that's worth a watch from the big screens near you !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
almost amazing,"Spider-Man: Homecoming could've been great if it had been a stand-alone film. Instead, its constant references to the Avengers weighed it down. It's tied so closely to the Avengers it should've been called Spider-Man: The Seventh Avenger.But coming to the rescue were Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. They were great. Also, having Spider-Man be younger, more playful and witty was a refreshing change. I don't read comics but apparently this new depiction of Spider-Man was more inline with the comics than previous depictions.Ironically, if this Spider-Man reboot was supposed to stay truer to the comics, it only did so in some aspects. At least it did get the main character, Spider-Man, right but if you're looking for more, you'd be disappointed. Other characters were changed slightly. Their ages and races were changed. And Spider-Man's suit is now tech created by Stark. It's practically another Ironman suit that does all the work.Despite this film's strong ties to the Avengers, its ham-fisted attempt at political correctness, and a Spider-Man suit that does everything for whoever who wears it, the strong performances by Tom Holland and Michael Keaton made this film enjoyable to watch.Tom Holland was great. Then again, I thought Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were fine too. If there's one thing I've learned from watching all these Spider-Man films, it's that anybody can play Spider-Man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Finally! A Movie Deserving of Spider-Man,"In my review for Cars 3, I called 2017 ""the year of the franchise-fix"". Spider-Man: Homecoming is more proof. Not that Marvel's universe didn't need fixing, but the webbed-wonder definitely did, with 3 straight duds under Sony Pictures. Peter Parker's homecoming to the company that made him a household name was clearly the right decision, as we're finally given a movie our friendly-neighborhood hero always deserved. Thankfully, they've foregone the unbearably overplayed origin story (bit by spider, uncle dies, blah-blah-blah) and instead swing right into the true essence of Spider-Man. The cast is a web of hilarious teachers, relatable students, and a plethora of quirky non-supers learning to live in a post-Avengers world. But Holland is (obviously) the center. Surpassing both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, he's the confident, funny, wide eyed, smart and awkward hero we always wanted in the red-and-blue tights. Even at age 21, Holland plays the first Peter that's believably a teenager, and the movie refreshingly leans in to that adolescence. Struggles with schoolwork, childish crushes on girls, and even naiveté in his heroism all shine through beautifully. So yes, this is yet another positive review of an MCU film. Even if the normal issues are here (weak villain motivations, confusing timeline), it still stand among the 12(!) of 16 movies within that franchise that I unabashedly recommend. Nearly ten years since Iron Man kicked it off, it seems the further we go into this world, the deeper we explore what the implications of superheroes in the real world looks like. And as one of the premier superheroes of all-time, Spider-Man deserves that treatment, and finally gets it in this, his best film yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Finally a good Spider-man AND Peter Parker Movie!,"We are now at the third re-boot of the spider-man movies.... AND IT'S NOT AN ORIGIN STORY!!! Thank you Marvel!The Movie starts from that cameo in Captain America and just keeps going from there. Peter met the great Tony Stark and is now star struck. the movie is him trying to prove that he's not just a kid in need of gloves but a man and totally Avenger material!A coming of age story of a 15 year old kid still in school, what could be more Spider-man then that!Tom Holland (as our hero) Is very charming as both personas and pretty much carries this movie... which brings me to the negative part, I'm not sure if this was done on purpose but all the supporting case in this movie acted like they've never been in front of a camera before. Aunt May, Liz (the love interest) and his best friend Ned were down right annoying at times and awkward the rest of it.There is rest of the supporting cast were just too obvious in their roles that it just felt forced. There was Zero chemistry on screen...The Antagonist however is another story, Micheal Keaton as the ""vulture"" was down right menacing and I don't think he had to raise his voice once to achieve that. Easily one of the more memorable villains in the MCU!The Movie has a quirky sense of humor which will have you smiling, and if that doesn't get you stick around to the end credit scene.Overall this was an enjoyable movie, the supporting cast and some of the choices they made (The actually tried to play it safe here) weighed the movie down a bit for me. I'd give it a 6/10 but it got an extra star due to the amazing performances by Holland and Keaton, those two carried this movie on steal (and web!) wings!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman: Snoozefest,"Is the MCU now immune to negative reviews? Such is the love for Tony Stark and co. that anything they now appear seems impervious to fan boy criticism. Spiderman: Homecoming has been receiving glowing praise with some critics going as far to say this is the best Spiderman film yet and the best superhero film of the year so far. I sometimes thought as if I was watching a different film then, as to me this was big disappointment. I was bored watching it, and I felt like most of the audience was too. There was no laughter in the cinema during the 'comedy' moments, just lots of uncomfortable fidgeting.After calls from fans to 'give it back Marvel 'it was great to see Spiderman appear with other Marvel hero's in the excellent Civil War, something that most us did not think we would ever see.But maybe this is case of be careful what you wish for, as despite Marvel providing creative input, this feels like the lest Spiderman like Spiderman movie so far. SpiderIronman may be a better title or Ironspider?Spiderman's suite is provided by Tony Stark, and aside from not being able to fly, works pretty much the same as his own suite. It has a similar heads up display, and array of weapons to select from, its own attachable drone and most its equivalent to Jarvis, called Karen (voiced by Jennifer Connelly, wife of Paul Bettany, aka Jarvishmm)It just didn't feel like I was watching Spiderman with all these gadgets. I did hope towards the end that maybe this was on purpose so when he was striped of them he would rely on his own ability. But this it was not be and he gets them all back.This film try's hard to be funny and cool, with throwbacks to 80's John Hughes films. And in case you didn't get that, one scene even has a TV randomly placed showing the same John Hughes film it is paying homage to. Very meta hey? And when Peter Parkers best friend wears the Spiderman mask, its funny because he's fat right? Ahh good one lets all laugh at the fatty. The constant attempts at humour and usual MCU quips, strip the film of any tension.Michael Keaton's Vulture could have been a great villain but is wasted. People hate on Spiderman 3, but at least I was never stifling yawns watching that. The opening fight in that film with Harry Osborne was far more exciting than any encounters Spiderman has with the Vulture here. The Vulture is a flying villain, so that should set up some vertigo inducing aerial battles through and over the city. But the best confrontation they have is sitting in a car.Spiderman himself seems to be the cause of his own problems. He's the most accident-prone superhero this side of Mr Magoo. In this film he manages to indirectly blow up the Washington Monument, tear a ship in half and crash a plane into a beach, taking a fairground ride with it and possible killing dog walkers taking a stroll by the sea.There is no sense of awe in this film. None of the epic and dizzying web swinging action we saw back in the Sam Raimi films. The actions scenes are lacklustre and ends in messy and scrappy CGI fight on a plane, of which somehow both Spiderman and the Vulture survive crashing and exploding on impact.It speaks volumes when the recently shown preview of Spiderman on PS4 has better Spiderman action than this film provides at any point.At the end of the film, a very annoying hipster girl who pops up now and again reveals her name is Michelle, but people call her MJ. What? Surely this is not going to be MJ? Michelle? Although I did read recently that producer Kevin Fegie has stated this is not the new Mary Jane. If that is so, why the MJ line? Just trolling for the sake of it. Hopefully this is not the 'real' Flash Thompson or 'real' Shocker either.The film feels cheap. Its hard to say why, but it looks and feels like a kids film. Was it the director? Hard to say. I am big fan of his previous two releases. The best part of the film is the aforementioned stand off between Toomes and Parker in the car, which shows though the directors horror credentials. The film needed more of this, to generate tension and threat for our hero to come through. Sam Raimis horror skills also showed through on his films with that bruising fist fight between Goblin and Spiderman and the infamous hospital scene in Spiderman 2. Scary, brutal and brilliant. Such a shame we don't have these kind of scenes anymore.I really hoped for something fresh and new with this but what we have is still very much Spiderman by committee, only now with added MCU cameos.It's a shame but we will probably never get another Spiderman film that comes close to the greatness of Spiderman and Spiderman 2.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great Spidey, bad writing. Forced diversity","My take on Spider-Man Homecoming. To me it seems like Sony and Marvel were in a battle. Sony execs were trying to make a terribly written movie to match Spider-Man 3 and Amaz Spidey 2, but Marvel tried to blunt their blows with making Tom Holland an awesome Spider-Man. For me, starting around the ferry scene (which just turned ridiculously stupid) the ""small world"" plot devices and ridiculous name dropping was stupid and insulting. The over the top forced diversity is annoying. Why was Liz black? OMG, a beautiful actress and good job...but why not just create a character for her to be?! Flash was so off point it made my skin crawl. ""Michelle""...I want to kick Sony in the teeth. Holland saves the movie...but, even though this will be a blockbuster...the seeds of Sony's inept handling of the franchise are already planted. It's so easy to predict that Sony will ruin this franchise in 1 or 2 more movies, completely. I give it a B...because Tom Holland was great. Ned was good...but was he a new character or a bastardized Ned Leeds? So sick of Sony and Fox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Greatest Reboot Ever in Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Spider-Man Homecoming is the greatest reboot that ever happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a clever and incredibly funny film. It takes place two months after Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man wants to become part of the Avengers, however Tony Stark thinks he isn't ready because he is a child and still needs to learn from his mistakes. Peter Parker tries to juggles being a high school kid with being a hero. Also in this film, Peter tries to stop a group of men from selling dangerous weapons to people.I love this film for the characters and their banter. Tom Holland makes Spider-Man, the teenager, very lovable and relatable. I like how they show Spider-Man as a bit immature and relaxed, unlike other films where Peter is too serious and the films feel pretty dark and grim. My favorite character is Ned (Jacob Batalon) because he asks Peter so many questions about Spider- Man and that makes it really funny to watch. Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man mentoring Peter is quite wonderful. Iron Man helps him but he doesn't take the focus away from Spider-Man. Spider-Man's constant banter in this film is also quite amusing. This film makes certain that Spider-Man can stand on his own in another sequel.There is one thing I did not like about this film and that is the storyline about his crush. It really doesn't develop and it seems that it is only there as filler. Besides that the film is great.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 8 to 18. I think adults might like this as well. This film does contain intense scenes and some inappropriate language, making it unsuitable for younger viewers. This is a ""know your kid"" movie. I recommend it to people who like action, adventure, comedy, films based on books and family movies. This is a movie worth seeing and I guarantee you will not only like this film, you will love it.Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The MCU (So Far) Ranked: #5,Things are looking up for Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Homecoming was my favourite Spider-Man movie up until very recently. This genuinely feels like watching an 80s John Hughes film in the 2010s that also happens to action sequences in it. The scene where Peter Parker and Adrian Toomes are in the car together is brilliantly tense and shows of the dramatic range of both Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. The characters feel real and fleshed out and the breezy feel of the editing brings the world to life through the naive eyes of a young Peter Parker. I honestly can't believe how good this ended up being.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great Spider-Man character, decent but not great Spider-Man movie","Spider-Man deserved a new movie, simply because (a) the previous reboot failed, and because (b) the new Spidey (after Cap. America 3) set a new standard for the cinematical version of the superhero.In his cameo in Cap. 3 Tom Holland held his own, thanks to gimmicks that tied him to The Avengers and Tony Stark. With respect to the previous movies, the makers made the smart move to NOT make this an origin movie, which would have slowed everything down. Instead they focused on his younger years at school, developing relations with other teens and Stark, and a brand new enemy that steals every scene.The good part: Tom Holland as Spidey AND as Peter Parker. Other good parts are the action, Michael Keaton as the villain, and Spidey discovering his suit (instead of his powers). The interaction with his school teens, and the impact of his superhero-part on his relations.The not so good part: by not doing the origin, they gain speed and momentum. That same speed is lost by dragging the clumsy part. Spidey is shown clumsy as a kid learning the responsibility as a hero, but they drag it on like forever. After a while, we get the message. Spidey is a kid, strong enough for more, but not yet mature enough. Great message, now move on.All in all, a very fun movie, but not as brilliant and charismatic as the original Spider-Man 2. Maybe that movie can't be topped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This isn't perfect or one of the better Marvel pictures but it is entertaining and worth a viewing,"Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) is a movie my wife and I recently watched on On-Demand. The storyline follows Peter Parker shortly after discovering his powers and falling into his first Avengers mission. While Tony Stark informs him that he isn't ready for the big time, he is ready for his own costume but needs to try to focus on his normal life more than his superhero life. When a new villain known as Vulture appears, Peter finds it tough to balance being normal and a superhero.This movie is directed by Jon Watts (Cop Car) and stars Tom Holland (The Devil All the Time), Michael Keaton (Beetlejuice), Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny), Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes), Donald Glover (Solo), Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespear in Love) and Zendaya (Dune).The storyline for this picture is fun, a bit kiddie at times, but that's expected for a Spider-Man plot. The special effects are awesome, and the circumstances are creative and unfold well. Keaton was an excellent villain and I like how they modernized The Vulture concept. Jacob Batalon's character was appropriately annoying but I'm not sure I loved Tomei as Aunt May, but the film is good enough to overlook it. The conclusion and dynamics of the villain are intense and well portrayed and I liked the ultimate resolve and set-up for a follow-up picture.Overall, this isn't perfect or one of the better Marvel pictures; however, it is entertaining and worth a viewing. I would score this a 7.5/10 and recommend watching it once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Absolute waste of time as usual when it comes to these regurgitated Marvel titles,"For starters, this Spider ""man"" has to be one of the most annoying actors I have seen in a while. Whiny voice, uninteresting and cliche dialogue does not help the case. Secondly, the movie does not bring anything fresh or new (I know... shocker when talking about marvel).

It just lacks any rewatch value due to the razor thin plot. Tombs (Keaton) shines both in performance and message, though it is too minimal to make the film real commentary.

Props to Tom Holland for bringing out the best depiction yet of friendly neigborhood Spiderman,"After several years and stand-alone Spiderman films later, Tom Holland now enters the scene as part of the MCU as the latest Spiderman. As Peter Parker finds the time to balance his school life and trying to be a hero, all the while dealing with the hormones of a teenager, he faces another classic Spidey foe.With guidance and support from his Aunt May, best friend Ned, and Tony Stark, Peter Parker does what he has to do to prove that he has what it takes to become not only a friendly neighborhood Spiderman, but also as one of Earth's defenders from evil.Spider-man: Homecoming is a thrilling action paced superhero movie with just the right amount of comedy and drama to fit in with the description of a relatively regular high school Peter Parker. It finds the longings of a young man to be worthy of himself and to others and be independent of others who can take responsibility for his own actions. The cast makes this one of the more lighthearted films in the MCU universe and probably one of the more relatable and attractive superhero films to its young audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not perfect, but still a lot of fun.","I have to hand it to people who make superhero movies. They face considerable challenges, not the least of which is the streak of 'sameness' at the heart of many superhero story lines. You know how it goes: 1. We meet the superhero before they are a hero and see how they became a superhero 2. We meet the super villain and see why they became a villain 3. The superhero meets the public and all is good 4. The superhero meets the villain and now it's not so good 5. The superhero suffers some defeat or disgrace and accompanying confidence crisis and the public aren't so enamoured any more. 6. The superhero gets his/her act together and defeats the villain after all.
To be sure, some superhero movies break this pattern, but most follow it in some way or another. The trick is to follow the pattern in a way that is new, fresh and worth people spending their money to see. Spider-Man Homecoming manages to do that by making Peter Parker/Spiderman a fresh faced 15 year old being mentored by an older, avuncular Tony Stark. Of course, Spiderman isn't played by a 15-year old. Tom Holland is about 6 years older than that. It would have made more sense to say Spiderman was 18-years old, but oh well.... He is good in the role though and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel(s). Michael Keaton makes a pretty good villain too. He is intelligent and menacing. The story is also good.There are some flaws with this movie though. It doesn't stick to established Spiderman canon for a start. Tony Stark was never Spiderman's mentor and Spidey's suit was never like the one in this movie. Also, Spidey's spider sense never shows up. Spiderman purists will be disappointed. There is also some pretty bad CGI. By 'bad' I mean it is obviously fake. We know these movies couldn't exist without CGI, but the trick is to not make it look like CGI. This movie doesn't always do that successfully. One of the biggest bugbears for me though was the way the Spiderman canon was unnecessarily changed to make it more racially diverse. Flash Thompson, a big, muscly, dopey jock in the comics, is a weedy, cowardly Indian here. MJ, Peter's girlfriend, is supposed to be a bright, vivacious red-head. Here she is a sullen, smart alec African-American. Worse still, she is played by the totally dreary Zendaya. I hope she's not going to stick around for future movies. I would have preferred to see Zendaya and Laura Harrier, who plays Liz, swap roles. Still, in spite of its flaws, Spider-Man Homecoming is fun and not a bad way to spend two hours or so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Fresh, young, and really funny Spiderman","Dear readers, yesterday was the first day of screening of Spiderman: Homecoming in my home country, Indonesia. For Indonesian people, the figure of Spiderman has been becoming a symbol of young, brave, and honest superhero, other than Batman with its political conflicts or Superman with its science fiction method. For us, Spiderman is like the representation of a real hero in the society. Spiderman is not rich like Batman, nor having inter-galaxies power like Superman. Spiderman is a college student, being bitten by miraculous spider, and then becoming a hero during nights. Now in 2017, Spiderman movie is back and we are so excited to watch it. Firstly because of the title with the word ""Homecoming"". This makes people curious. ""What happens to Spiderman?"", ""Why he needs Homecoming?"" or ""What is Homecoming itself?"". So here it is my review!! Spiderman: Homecoming is the story about the Spiderman at the age of college student, young, beauty, clumsy, confused, narcissist, and other characters linked to a college student. Those characters make this movie really fresh and give some fun to the watchers. The next critical point is some physical appearances of Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Avengers team. For those who are not following the Avengers so intensely, maybe would be confused what is the link between Spiderman and Iron Man. The other thing that maybe the Director want to show us, is the plots concerning to illegal business or black markets within superhero equipment. That movie's plot is quite new and intriguing fact that a hero always needs a modern and updated thing also in the modern globalization time, including online videos. Too many good points to be judged for this movie, but for me, the minus point is only the action of Spiderman. He is everywhere in the movie, of course, but his actions are not so cool like Toby Maguire ever did. Well, but yes, I still recommend this movie since you will know the young face of Mary Jane :) Happy watching, Spiderman fans!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Young aunt May?,"Homecoming is the newest reimagining of Spider-Man we've had (this time with a younger aunt May). It paints spider man as a still young and naive kid thanks to Tom Holland's performance and uses that for a basis of growth. The movie spends little to no time at all introducing Peter, as Marvel assumes that after five movies you already know the character. Peter learns to find the balance between getting help from others and doing things alone. Also like Tony Stark does in Iron Man 3, who is his mentor by the way, he learns how to be a hero without the suit. The love interest, Liz, serves little purpose but Ned is incredibly funny as a sidekick. Overall just a fun version of Spider-Man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man: Homecoming (@cmp_moviereviews),"The MCU has faced many challenges over the years, but the difficulty this time around was creating a successful reboot to a character we've seen portrayed by three different actors in a 15 year period. ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" unexpectedly holds its own and succeeds by not attempting to retell the origin story yet again, and by casting an actor who portrays both Peter Parker and Spider-Man in a very likable manner. Our hero is very much in training mode at this point, but the journey is fun regardless. Marvel can rest easy knowing they have created not just a fun Spider-Man film, but also a humorous coming of age tale revolved around a boy finding his place within his own circle all while being a superhero. #spidermanhomecoming",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Warning, not for mature viewers","I'll have to disagree with viewers, almost ¼ million gave an average of 7.6 and 51 reviewers who gave an average of 7.2. I guess one could call this ""refreshing"" as it certainly brings the would-be super hero crashing down to earth multiple times but to the extent that it is irritating and comedic - who is this fool? The original tale with Tobey Macguire is vastly superior IMO and captures Spider-Man's earthy, fallible nature in a dignified way.I guess it's about what sells, and target audiences. Critical thinking is hardly popular these days - look at POTUS. Yeah, whatever..A few random thoughts: A much younger and rather sexy Aunt May; a black love-interest, his next will surely be ""MJ"" the loner. Tom Holland's often 8yo attitudes and behavior made even Tony Stark look mature.

Tony Stark's appearances were hilarious, but it was Happy that stole the show along with Ned. Ned was just a hilarious and funny friend to Peter and I got a lot of laughs out of his role.Michael Keaton's portrayal as Vulture was also incredible, by the end of the movie I had totally forgotten he was Batman and now associate him with Vulture.This is a must see movie you'll love it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not bad but far from best Spider Man movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) for me isn't the best Spider Man movie by far. To be honest, i did like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) and its sequel (!) much more then i did this one. Although ""Homecoming"" is pretty entertaining and fun, it felt formulaic and yes, of course, predictable (which Marvel movie isn't??!). Because these isn't anything to talk about in acting category (and that stands for all Marvel movies), needless to say movie does look good but nothing that great. It does feature some nice action scenes, but the 3rd part of this movie (in which a superhero meets super villain and as usual superhero wins) dragged - usual stuff when many things blows up but apparently no one ever dies in Marvel galaxy.Overall, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is somehow fun and entertaining, but it does not deliver anything fresh to the table. Many were complaining about previous spider movies saying ""oh no another origins story"" - and here is a movie which does not deliver origin story and guess what - its as formulaic as Marvel movie can be.

Teen angst and over-kind antagonist,"Contrary to most of the other 10/10 reviews I have seen on this site, I feel that the main character this time seems to be a spoiled brat who does not know much of the phrase that was popularised due to Spider-man: ""With great power comes great responsibility"", as we see him keep getting into incidents where he bites off more than what he can chew.Yes, this is an interesting new take for the Spider-man series, a bit too interesting in fact. The personality and abilities of the Spider-man this time seems much more willing to initiate rather than to save, in fact, more than half of the major incidents were directly or indirectly caused by him. Not sure what's so interesting about watching superheroes cause trouble then end up having to clean their own messes, wait there's ultron as a great example.The storyline is stale, and at one point I wonder why Spider-man does not seem to be in a situation so severe I start to worry for him, well this is due to overpowered and reliable allies turning up just at the right time and over-kind enemies leaving him to rest once he is unable to fight, only to find him counterattacking maybe 5 seconds later.As fresh as this is compared to the rest of the Spiderman series, it is undoubtedly strange to see a superhero act as childishly as he did, like how a kid does stupid things to attract the attention of his/her parent. And not to mention all the teen issues out there, it almost feels like watching some American high school drama with wanna heroism as the topping instead of the other way round.Characters wise, to be honest it is strange how the Asian actors are featured, but I'm not going to go in-depth into that.

Marvel does it again!,"Homecoming takes a refreshing approach as it takes time fleshing characters out instead of just relying on non-stop action. Let's start with our villain Adrian Toomes/The Vulture. He is probably the best villain in the MCU, there's more layers to him than you would expect. Previously made redundant, he decides to make money creating weapons from alien wreckage in order to sell on the black market. There is good chemistry between Parker and his friend who discovers his alter-ego in the first 20 minutes. They end up working together throughout and It makes for some good jokes like his constant questions ""do you lay eggs"".School bully Flash Thompson isn't the physical buff anymore, he's just an annoying spoilt brat this time who verbally abuses Parker throughout, which makes more sense when you think about it. The love interest isn't Gwen or Mary Jane for a change and thankfully it isn't the focus here. Parkers heart is set on one thing, which is to become part of the Avengers. His Spider suit is equipped with cool hidden gadgets including a digital interface, a power shoot, web-wings, 200+ web-shooter modes and an ""instant-kill"" mode which will certainly please comic book fans.As for the humour, it's lighthearted in the tone of the comics and it doesn't feel forced. The action doesn't quite reach the spectacle of other Marvel outings but as stated earlier, it's more character focused which makes it that much better. There are some stand-out set pieces worth mentioning, one includes a boat getting split in half, an elevator rescue and some exciting chase sequences.However it can be CGI heavy at times, there is a particular twist towards the end that would have been better had it been revealed earlier and there are too many references to other MCU events/characters. For instance Iron Man keeps popping up every so often, there's mention of other events like the airport sequence from Civil War and the final battle from The Avengers. But as tedious as it gets, it does serve a purpose to the plot.Nitpicking aside, Tom Holland is perfect for the role as he plays Peter Parker with a sense of joy and wonder. Part of the enjoyment is seeing him come to grips with his powers as he uses them for fun a lot of the time and in doing so, endangers civilians and those close to him. This is about him learning to use his powers responsibly. It will be very interesting to see how the next series of adventures unfold. Let's hope Marvel can come to an agreement with Sony to use Venom in their later projects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Ruined Spidey,"This is just awful awful awful. I'm shocked at the high rating this is getting on IMDb but I'm glad the general public aren't making it as big as the critical acclaim. It's so bad . The first half hour I honestly didn't know what was going on at all. An already established Spider- Man making blogs from a hand held camera. Iron man talking gibberish via avengers product placing . There is nothing to like here, no decent villain, no teen love interest , no humour, no heart basically. Brought my kids to it too and they were confused and by the end of a very boring 2 hours plus they were just meh! Why have they ruined Spider-Man in this way . The acting is good by lead I'll give it that but the Sam raimi films are far superior. Plus , the cgi is atrocious . Don't listen to the reviews and stay away in droves .

What Are the Rules?,"Since I'm seeing this movie as a layperson, not one at the altar of the comic book gods, I'm evaluating it from that standpoint. I've seen most of the Marvel films and have had a level of enjoyment. I love the special effects but most of all getting to know the humanity of the principles. The better the story lines the better the movie. Here, Peter Parker is kind of a cliché as a teenager. Still, he is fun and a bit dense. If I have an issue, it is his over confidence at times. For one with his gifts he can be quite naive. We have numerous moments when everything could explode but he manages to escape detection. I have to say that I'm growing tired of the physical confrontations, the violent fights. When two foes can't seem to harm each other no matter what they do, it actually gets a little dull. Still, I think this film bodes well for the future. One of the better. Oh, Michael Keaton lights up the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Teenage Deadpool,"Good: Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, and Michael Keaton as Vulture are excellent and deliver their roles exceptionally. They each contribute to the coming of age theme well and their dialogue is entertaining. There are numerous comedic moments and even though some jokes fall flat there are enough to leave a smile on your face. This movie with its uniqueness did a great job of portraying Spider-Man and his teenage life.Bad: The action sequences were good, but lacked hand to hand combat and relied more on web shooting. The finale lacked suspense and action. Some parts of the movie can be slow or boring. Although Michael Keaton was fantastic as Vulture I found his motive weak and not effective.Overall: It is worth the watch, but do not expect anything spectacular or amazing. Despite the action sequences lacking and not having much depth, the comedic moments and your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man are enough to keep you entertained in the 2h 13 min run time.3.8/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Oh Spidey, stop it, you are killing me.","This movie is all over the place with its cringe element, the gags are out of control, the tone is always changing, the story is trying too hard and is not really being genuine.
Another thing I picked up was that Homecoming Spiderman is the worst Spiderman ever. If he was to go toe to toe with Spiderman 1 and the amazing Spiderman 1 spidermen he would get destroyed.
Just imagine all they achieved in their first movies, and overall mastery they had on their skills compared to this one and not to mention this wasn't even his first appearance!!!
This all comes down to the way Disney execs and writers handled the character.
Peter Parker one of the strongest most intelligent heroes of Marvel universe was a slave to his suit basically (and yes it was also mentioned kind of in the story about how he was too reliant on the suit but that is basically just trying to dampen the impact of a damage already done.)
Peter Parker is a brilliant mind and here we didn't have the chance to get much of that because what we were constantly getting was the suit doing all the thinking for Peter.
Peter is dumbed down massively and that is sad.
When Peter comes in contact with Iron spider suit in the comics he at first is excited but soon realises that it is not who he is and leaves it behind for his normal suit, that alone shows how much of a different character he is to what Homecoming Peter is.
This is also very unfortunate as Tom is a great actor, he is very fun to watch and I can believe his sense of wonder and joy but the movie plot drags him down too much.
So all in all not really happy with the way the character was handled.
The story needed more work but the visuals that wins a lot of points from me, there are a few imagery easter eggs, as in shots straight out of the comic books and they are basically eye candy and just beautiful.
I expected a lot more out of this movie after all the gloating about the fact that Marvel was going to do a good spiderman movie unlike the older ones. But well I am not actually surprised.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
boring pointless reboot,being a huge spidey fan collecting comics for over 20yrs I have to say this is the worst spidey movie yet. how do you call this a reboot when the movie doesn't even explain his origin. how he got his powers what his powers are. no spidey sense? but more importantly why he became spiderman. why he wants to fight crime. story and enemies predictable. why do the writers feel the need to have everyone find out his secret identity? ironman sipdey suit you got to be kidding me and ironman saves spidey more in this movie than anyone in spidey's entire history in comics. ridiculous. but worst of all boring. ignore all the positive reviews. they have obviously never watched a good spidey movie let alone any good movie. pointless waste of a reboot,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Holland May Be The Best Siderman,"When this was announced, I rolled my eyes at yet another Spiderman reboot this quickly after The Amazing Spiderman movies. Yet Spiderman: Homecoming is a lot of fun. I really enjoy it. Tom Holland is possibly the best Peter Parker/Spiderman. Tony McGuire always looked too old, whilst Andrew Garfield, who was a much better Spiderman, was too good looking to play the geeky/awkward Peter Parker. Michael Keaton is as reliable as he always Is. Robert Downey Jr is not given as much to do, as the trailer suggests he does, but he is as great as he always is. Zendaya stands out in a small role, that looks like it will be expanded in the next movie. Marisa Tomei (an actress I always enjoy seeing on screen) is the hottest Aunt May you will ever see. Jon Favareau is fine as happy, Gwyneth Paltrow also pops up for a cameo at the end too.I look forward to the next one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but Average","Spider-Man Homecoming is the web-head's first solo film since making his MCU debut back in Captain America Civil War (2016). I had high hopes for this movie, mainly because of Tom Holland's excellent Spider-Man portrayal in Civil War. Put it short, I was not disappointed. However, I did not love the movie and still prefer the original Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man (2004) over this newest edition.Spider-Man Homecoming deals with a distressed Peter Parker (Tom Holland,) who is desperately attempting to please Tony Stark while balancing his complicated school life. When a villain known as the Vulture (Michael Kheaton) arises selling dangerous weapons illegally, Peter takes it upon himself to confront the conflict.I think this movie got a lot of things right. It's the best on screen adaptation of Peter Parker as a nerdy, anxious school kid who can't exactly fit in. Tom Holland perfectly captures the 15-year-old geek persona. The film does a very good job of showing that Spider-Man is in fact a neighborhood hero, screwing up a ton but helping the little guys, rather than taking down a ridiculously powerful, world-threatening villain *cough* The Amazing Spider-Man *cough*.The film is also very funny, but it also became an issue for me. Marvel seemed to make this movie a bit too fun, with lines of humorous dialogue spewing from characters' mouths every 2 seconds. Sometimes the humor hits, and other times it just falls flat.Another problem for this movie is the pacing. Peter Parker is in his Spiderman suit for way longer than he should be, making the action scenes feel familiar and not special. You never really see many character relationships or arcs develop throughout the run time, mainly because so much screen time is devoted to him running around in his suit.Although Spider-Man Homecoming had many good moments, I left the theater thinking ""meh."" It's a perfectly fun Marvel movie that didn't take many risks, leaving it nothing more than average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
fun comic book fare,"Salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) holds a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) after his takeover of the Battle of New York cleanup. Toomes kept some of the Chitauri tech to create new weapons. Eight years later after the events of Civil War, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns to his school, Midtown School of Science and Technology. He lives with his sought-after aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He has a crush on classmate Liz. His best friend Ned discovers his secret identity Spider-Man. There is also the sarcastic academic teammate Michelle (Zendaya).This is fun. It's got the comic book action. It weaves into the MCU with ease. RDJ has a supporting role which is more than a simple cameo. This definitely has the John Hughes vibe. It's nice light fun in this overarching comics universe. Holland is a great teen Spider-man as he showed in Civil War. The young cast is terrific and Keaton is an awesome villain. Keaton has real depth which is built over the years. His humanity creates more than a comic book villain. The surprise connection hits it out of the park. This is simply a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider Man Updated Technically.,"SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING REVIEW : I'm a Spiderman Fan from childhood, old Spider Man films series (3 films) is still my favourite. The Amazing Spiderman couldn't match the class of that old Spiderman but i liked it for some advanced technology used in it. Now comes SpiderMan Homecoming, Another spidey film excited too much before release, don't know how but i started expecting Best Spidey film ever but this one too couldn't match the standard of Old Spiderman series.Good Performances, Good Story, Excellent 3D Effects, Enough pacy screenplay but a disappointing Climax spoiled the film. Obviously, one expect breathtaking fight sequences in the end but here you don't see Hero fighting hard and beating Villain. Villain gets thrashed very easily, i mean come on man where is much expected Explosion? Where is Entertainment? Story is Good, Marvel keep making films on Avengers and Spiderman Homecoming script is suitable for MCU. Iron Man and Happy's presence is pleasing. You get to see Captain America's glimpse too (TV). Screenplay is Slightly slow paced in the first half then takes pace in second half but all goes in vain because of too simple climax. 3D effects are Excellent, this film must be watched in 3D only. Cinematography is very good, especially in Spidey's action sequences. Direction is on lower side, you expect more comedy, more entertainment, more explosion but director focused more on story and setting platform for MCU's upcoming films.Overall, Spiderman Homecoming should be watched once to see advanced and technically updated version of one of the most loved superhero Spiderman. He does everything what an Avenger do, oh sorry Iron Man do. With better climax this film would've been better than The Amazing Spider Man but it failed. Go for this one, just don't expect too much, definitely don't expect too less, there's certain space between it to enjoy the film. 7/10* stars by me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Very entertaining, much smaller scale than other Marvel Movies","Spider-Man Homecoming; yet another Marvel movie in the MCU, and yet another success. This movie is a bit refreshing in that it's a much smaller-scale conflict. The focus is primarily on Peter Parker as a character and less on Spider-Man as a superhero, but there's still plenty of Spider-Man action. They made a Spider-Man origin story without the same origin clichés of ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and without showing the Peter getting bitten by a Spider scene, which I appreciate. The movie has a serviceable plot, with engaging characters and a villain that's at least better than most of Marvel's other villains. While many people complain that they ""ruined Spider-Man"" because he's not the same as he is in the comics, I would like to remind people that he's actually MORE accurate to the comics than in other adaptations, since he's a teenager and still has his powers. While he does use a tech suit, the movie does a great job of showing that Spider-Man is more than just the suit. Technically, the movie is great as usual, with very good sound design, visuals, and editing.As for the negatives, the action isn't really the best, especially after the impeccably choreographed Winter Soldier and Civil War, and the visually stunning Doctor Strange. The music is forgettable, as it is in most Marvel movies. But all in all, not many complaints from me. I saw it and was greatly entertained by it, and hey, that's all you really want when you watch a Spider-Man movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I really like the whole cast of the movie and all of them gave amazing performance especially Tom Holland & Michael Keaton (who is the villain in this movie btw).Michael Keaton just nailed his performance and he's character is a really good villain in this movie and doesn't feel like a 'Wannabe type of villain' and they also didn't show unnecessary fights or waste time here and there everything was on point and nothing feels like 'Oh this part was unnecessary'.Overall it's a really good movie and a great reboot to Spider-Man to make his entry in the MCU.

My personal favorite iteration,"Let me preface this review by stating that I grew up on the TV show, loved the first two Spider-Man movies by Raimi, liked surprisingly well the amazing Spider-Man and for all its faults loved at least the emotionality of the second Amazing Spider-Man.With having gone through the origins of Spider-Man already twice the MCU made the wise decision of skipping it this time. You only get a somewhat general idea of what's happened and that's enough.The movie itself is what a Spider-Man movie should be: small in scale. At least compared to international threats. The humor is great. I think I haven't laughed this much in a Spider-Man movie ever. Peter is a great mixture of quirky and quippy. You actually buy that he's pulling all those one-liners while in costume but is also somewhat of a nerd who's shy in front of girls without it being exaggerated, cause look at the kid, it's not like he'd be a total loser, just an outsider.The story is progressing logically and naturally. You feel with the characters and there is a connection growing throughout the story. Last but not least the villain. He's three-dimensional and very menacing. He might be my favorite villain out of the movies - not the TV show, though. The runtime serves the plot well. It takes its time without dragging. The only thing that could be worked on is the fight choreography for Spider-Man and his foe for future installments, because Raimi and Webb both were able to highlight Spidey in that regard better.However, this iteration is in my opinion almost perfect as a Spider-Man movie. Nothing has been recycled needlessly from the previous iterations but it stayed true to the source material even though some were outraged by one casting choice that I can't believe could really represent an issue.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A teenage Peter Parker (Spider-man) is trying to find his way into The Avengers (a group of superheroes) and his way in the superhero world.,"With a new ""Spider-man"" (actor), as well as basically a whole new cast (apart from Iron Man cameos) I saw the new trailer for ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and thought (despite being a fan of them): ""How are they going to drag it out now?"" Seems I was wrong. After years of ""Spider-man"" film adaptations, the origins have been redone by Andrew Garfield (2012) after they were adapted by Tobey Maguire, ten years earlier, with many of the memorable and interesting villains already being adapted. That's why I was glad to see no more origins. ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" is about Peter Parker trying to pair his social and superhero life together in the peak of adolescence. Meanwhile, Spider-man, his alter-ego/superhero identity, is trying to find his 'big break' in the superhero world, competing against a range of factors (e.g. school, love-life, age, etc).This film is the 'in-between' of all the previous movies, with a fantastic and well-driven plot-line, and many comedic touches which lighten up the atmosphere. As well as numerous plot-twists, this ""Spider-man"" movie can only be topped by the epic action and battle sequences in which it follows.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Personally right now I'm in high school and when I look at the old Spider-Man movies and I see a ""bully"" I start to actually laugh because that's not how bullies are!

Swinging into the Spotlight,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming. I watched it on Netflix. The Movie first aired June 28, 2017. It has a runtime of 2 hour and 13 minutes. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by Jon Watts and was also created by Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. One of the characters was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby.Summary: Peter Parker is eager to prove himself as a worthy hero after his thrilling experience with the Avengers. However, he finds himself struggling with the typical trials of high school life, including friendships, crushes, and academic pressures. Under the watchful eye of Tony Stark , who serves as both mentor and father figure, Peter attempts to step out from under Stark's shadow and establish his own identity as a superhero.Review: -I found the plot to be quite engaging, striking a balance between accessibility and intrigue. It allows viewers to easily follow the narrative while still presenting unexpected twists that maintain interest throughout the story. I was pleased with the movie's beginning, and when we finally meet Peter, it is after his encounter with Tony Stark, following the events of the Captain America crossover film. I appreciated the film's youthful tone and light-hearted humour, which set it apart from many other superhero films that tend to lean towards darker themes. The comedic elements were skilfully woven into the storyline, creating an enjoyable viewing experience while maintaining the stakes of Peter Parker's journey. This balance was particularly satisfying. However, I had some concerns about the pacing; certain plot points felt rushed and not thoroughly explored, especially the transition from high school life to superhero responsibilities. This shift occasionally appeared abrupt, potentially leading to a disjointed viewing experience for those looking for a more cohesive narrative flow. I appreciated how we were able to witness the full capabilities of the suit, I also love that we got the short introduction of the updated version. I liked how the film emphasizes the classic Spider-Man theme of ""with great power comes great responsibility."" This moral lesson resonates with viewers who appreciate ethical storytelling within superhero narratives. I liked the Innovative Use of Technology Peter's use of technology-like his homemade gadgets-showcases creativity and resourcefulness that many young viewers admire and aspire towards in their own lives. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots effectively established locations and contextualized action, showcasing Spider-Man's agility against the vastness of New York City during his aerial swings and battles with villains like Vulture. Close-ups captured the emotional depth of characters, allowing viewers to empathize with Peter's struggles as he juggles superhero duties and personal challenges, while also emphasizing pivotal moments of tension. Tracking shots enhanced action sequences by fluidly following Spider-Man as he pursued villains through tight spaces, creating a heightened sense of urgency and excitement. Aerial shots highlight Spider-Man's web-slinging from above, offering a unique view of his city traversal. Drone photography simulates the sensation of jumping between rooftops, enhancing the visual spectacle of his abilities. Effective point-of-view (POV) shots immerse viewers in Spider-Man's perspective during action scenes, allowing them to experience his heightened senses and reflexes. Wile Steadicam shots provide smooth motion for close interactions, particularly during pivotal moments at school and when he transforms into his superhero persona.I appreciated the CGI used in the movie, as it provided a realistic portrayal of Spider-Man's abilities, particularly during his swings through New York City. The film effectively combined 3D modelling and compositing techniques to seamlessly blend live-action footage with computer-generated backgrounds. This integration made the action sequences feel immersive and engaging, especially during aerial battles between Spider-Man and Vulture. The dynamic use of colour and movement contributed to an exhilarating viewing experience. While there were moments when the CGI felt overly noticeable and detracted from character interactions, these instances were minor compared to the overall effectiveness of the visual effects. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie effectively utilized on-screen text to indicate the passage of time, enhancing the storytelling. The soundtrack and sound effects were particularly impactful, as they complemented the scenes beautifully. I found the muffled hearing effect in one scene to be a brilliant touch, immersing viewers in the character's experience and making it feel more realistic.-I enjoyed meeting the characters in the film, particularly Peter Parker, whose significant character development was evident as he evolves from an inexperienced teenager into a more confident hero. I found Peter's friendship with Ned to be heart-warming and I would love to have a bond like theirs. I appreciated the scenes featuring Michelle, as they allowed me to get to know these two main side characters and their distinct personalities. I hope to see more of them in future Spider-Man movies. I found Vulture to be a complex villain with relatable motivations; his backstory added depth to his character, making him much more than just a typical antagonist.-I appreciated the movie's ending, which concluded with an unexpected cliff-hanger. I loved the illustrations featured in the credits and the two cleverly integrated extra scenes that appeared during the closing credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.7 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the better Spiderman movies,"Spiderman Homecoming is the best Spider Man movie since Spiderman Two. Homecoming is a fresh new take on story story of Spiderman, the movie really shines because it stays true to the character of Spiderman while adding a fresh twist of both the characters and story. The movie also shines due to well chosen, talented actors and fun, witty script writing. The movie balances both action and humour well and manages to keep an atmosphere of fun whilst keeping the characters grounded to the story.

A lighthearted take on a well worn costumed superhero,"This is the third incarnation of Spider-Man in the past 15 years, so it was always going to be an uphill battle to make it fresh and exciting to audiences. Quite wisely, director Jon Watts plays 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' for laughs and scales down the world-ending threats to craft a more intimate and quirky comic book adventure with street- level stakes. Thanks to the lightness of tone and the quirk of the characters, the film mostly succeeds, even if the plot never rises above the mildly diverting.Tom Holland is the most believable and endearing Peter Parker yet - perhaps because he doesn't look like a 30 year old man playing at being a high schooler. Holland brings a wide-eyed charm and enthusiasm to the role and is instantly likable as both the bumbling geeky student and his bumbling heroic alter ego. The whole endeavor hinges on Holland being able to pull off the character and he acquits himself well, ably supported by a commendably diverse and zany supporting cast. Meanwhile, Michael Keaton returns to the superhero fold, aping both his Oscar-nominated turn in 'Birdman' as well as winking back to his days in the batsuit. His villainous plans aren't particularly interesting or all that menacing but his backstory as a peeved off blue collar worker (shown in a prologue at the start) helps to ground him in some kind of reality, as opposed to the usual Marvel villains who tend to be bog standard power-hungry megalomaniacs.Set-piece-wise, 'Homecoming' takes a page out of 'Iron Man's' comic book and keeps the threats scaled down and pretty simple, making for a pleasant diversion from all the endless CGI spectacle and destruction porn audiences have sadly become accustomed to, even if the climax itself cannot quite resist overdosing on the VFX budget. Also helping to inject a fresh shot of energy into (what was becoming) a stale cinematic superhero is the way in which both the screenplay and performances embrace the true-to-life tropes and behaviours of modern teenagers - the socially awkward banter; the pop cultural savvy; the obsession with technology and gadgets; the infuriating desire to fit in and be liked, etc. The way in which the characters engage with the story and each other feels reasonably accurate to the perspective actual teenagers might take if a hero like this really existed, at least without it feeling artificial or needing to fall back on those hoary old Hollywood high school clichés.The problems of the film mostly lie within its underwhelming plot, enlivened only by the wink-and-you'll-miss-them gags and the sheer eccentricity of the characters. The strengths of this reboot lie within the way the tale is told rather than the tale itself. In terms of those inevitable comparisons with its former incarnations, 'Homecoming' comfortably beats the dreadful Andrew Garfield-era reboots but falls a few steps short of being as entertaining as Sam Raimi's first two 'Spider-Man' outings, which offered up a different style of quirkiness but ultimately felt more cinematic than Watts' version.This new street-level Spidey proves that there is still life left in the character yet, but because it embraces irreverence and comedy so well, there is a definite lack of tension and the experience feels a tad insubstantial as a consequence. Whether or not it can survive the common Marvel problem of crappy second installments (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers and Guardians all suffered from diminishing returns) remains to be seen. But if anyone can break the curse, it's the socially awkward guy in the red and blue spandex.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"I thought it was a great movie. Me, not being a marvel fan in general, was curious about this movie because spider-man has always been my favorite marvel superhero. Between the language and violence(especially towards the end) merits the PG-13 rating. I'd still say it's good for kids 11+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A fun, hilarious and refreshing MCU teen movie. But it fails the essential Spider-Man Test.","There are two ways to look at this movie: as a Spider-Man fan and as a Non-Spider-Man fan (i.e. A MCU follower, for the most part).As a Non-Spider-man fan, and a follower of the MCU movies, this movie is super fun, super funny and super heroic (in a small scale). After the seemingly monotonous tones some of the recent non-Avengers-related Marvel movies, this movie belongs to the group of Guardians of the Galaxy & Thor Ragnarok of the most fun, different and fresh tales. It could be mostly due to the fact that it's the only one that has a teen-movie angle to it. The rest of the Avengers are all adults (for now) and have world-wrecking problems so switching to a friendly-neighborhood scale problems that Peter mostly faces in this movie is very endearing and engaging. This interpretation benefits from its relation to the bigger MCU giving a sense of familiarity as we see Peter interact with characters we already know aside from introducing new ones. I love this school, this corner of Queens, these teachers and classmates, the tones of the movie, the heroic moments, the villain. The movie is just plain fun, it is actually hilarious, uplifting, light-hearted and action-packed and it's a departure from the more mature and adult plots of other MCU movies.So as a Non-Comic-Spiderman fan & follower of the MCU, this movie gets a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. It is really good, one of the best of the MCU. Fresh, unique, morally uplifting, energic & hilarious.However....As a Spider-Man fan, there are so many changes to original characters in terms of character motivations and arcs that it's just too much for a Spidey comicbook fan to handle. I am pretty chill when it comes to changes in the adaptations of Spidey in the big screen (for example, the ""natural spiderweb"" coming out of Peter's body in the Saimi trilogy...). I have learned to overlook nitpicks like that in service of having a fun experience. Heck, if those changes serve the story then I am more than willing to accept them.Much is adapted differently from the comics, yet some are well developed and work within this movie universe. I get it, I can't and perhaps will never have the adaptation I want of Spider-Man (which I will tell you in a second that that's not entirely true), but there are core understandings that need to remain in order for it to be, well, a Spider-Man story.My score as a comicbook Spider-Man fan, but also a fan of Sam Raimi, Spiderman cartoon from the 90s, Into the Spider-verse & Marvel's Spiderman game... This movie has a total score of 5 out of 10. I will go into spoilers now to discuss those changes for those interested-- WARNING: SPOILERS FROM NOW ON FOR THE MOVIE --There are several things that bug me of this movie as a Spider-Man fan (yes, I am biased because I am a massive comicbook Spider-Man fan). These are all mostly in retrospect now that almost three individual MCU Spider-man movies have been released and we got to see more in depth the characterisation of this Spider-man adaptation:Uncle Ben... Fine, I get it, it was a hard choice to make. The normal audience is tired. Tired of seeing him get killed over and over again in the movies of the last 20 years. I get it, Ironman is cool, Tony Stark is the face of the MCU and everybody loves him, and he came up with the idea of bringing him in in Civil War. I get it, the most natural development of Peter in this version of the character, in this universe, is to see in Tony a mentor and idol to look up to. I get it. And I like it. I like what they do with it in this movie and the next (or at least what they try to do - more on that later), the fact that he wants to be his own hero... But where is Uncle Ben? If you are not going to ""use him"", said in a cold way, don't introduce him into this story. Don't mention him, don't allude to his importance because the moment we know he was part of Peter's motivation to be Spider-man, we start to wonder why we haven't seen any reference to it in the movie. Commit or take him out. Commit to ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and the why of that, or leave it out and make him an avenger-obsessed, morally high-grounded teenager. But don't try to convince us he does the heroing for Uncle Ben and to be responsible if I don't see that. And that's the problem, Peter is so irresponsible in this movie, it makes you wonder what his motivation for being Spider-Man is. He acts like a dumb teenager that happens to have superpowers so ""naturally"" he wants to become an Avenger and help battle aliens and whatnot... Sure, the movie try to convince us otherwise but, as we see later in Infinity War that's just thrown out the window. The fact that Peter now is absolutely tied to the MCU, tied to the Avengers, makes him dependable on it. Peter is hooked to the MCU, he has no outside motivation for being a superhero, he has no want or need that doesn't relate directly with the Avengers. And it's that addiction to the idea of the Avengers & Tony Stark that is preventing from developing as a hero. And as a Spider-Man fan, aware of how Spider-Man's universe is so well crafted, so rich, so well-realised and developed that it an entire MCU could be done just with Spider-man's story's characters. So belittling or limiting his universe, sacrificing it mostly in order to make him fit in the MCU is too big of a sacrifice for a Spider-Man fan to bare.Aunt May... Why? Seriously, why? I don't mind the age they gave her but what's with the oversexualization and lack of maternal protection? Where is the Aunt May that cares about Peter, that serves as his moral compass, that should be scared to death when learning his son is Spider-Man (sure, this belongs to Far From Home review but in retrospect this doesn't seem right). Aunt may is more worried about Peter when she doesn't know he is a superhero than after she learns he is. These are not nitpicks, this are core understandings of the character, we are talking about if you asked me ""tell me in three words or less, how you'd describe this character?"" this adaptation of Aunt May FAILS to meet any of them. It begs the question ""how much can you change a character, how much can you modernise it to current audiences in order to have a bigger appeal; before it becomes a completely new and different character?"".... And with this, we jump into the next pointWhat's with these ""new-but-not-really"" characters? Listen, I like the actors and actresses chosen for the role, they are great and the performances in this movie are amazing. But why, oh why, would NED LEEDS be Peter's best friend when you have a compelling and fully functioning bff in Harry Osborn? Is it because he has appeared in the last two franchises so they were afraid making him appear once more would bore the audience? I don't understand these decisions. I really don't. MJ, or this version of MJ, what the hell, I mean, where's the cocky, party-girl, cheerful girl with a tragic home-life? Sure this interpretation makes it more realistic that this angtsy, odd girl would be a better match for Peter in real life but guess what, this isn't real life. MJ's personality served a purpose, she HAD to be written a certain way in order to function as Peter's partner. You know why they were Marvel's power couple? Because Peter's sense of constant responsability made him more mature and his unstable life as Spider-Man prevented him from having a ""traditional/conventional"" relationship, so pairing him up with the easygoing, understanding and flexible MJ allowed him to have a somewhat normal relationship. And the same goes to Liz, I don't care about ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender. If you name a character Liz Allen, that girl has a ""purpose"" in the story, it serves as a vehicle for Peter to experience things. I don't want to get all lorey and dump all my Spider-Man knowledge but, it's the truth. And the worst hing is, I got nothing against these characters, nothing at all, I like their characterisation and the role they serve in this story but why won't you just call them different so that comicbook fans don't have expectatives. It's really baffling to me, I mean, I can think of no other reason to why this happens. All the franchises are so afraid of creating new characters, particularly in the Comibook industry, that they just modify and retroactively change the origins and nature of existing ones in order to secure the sales. Sure creating new characters is risky but that's where the talent shines, and when they work you have gained an entire new franchise to make money of: look at Spider-Gwen, Miles Morales,... These are no entirely new new characters as they belong to the Spider-universe, but they all got their own well-crafted side characters. So anyways.Whatever happened to secret identities?.... I get it, I really really do. Drones, internet, satellites, nowadays hidding your identity is physically impossible if you are a superhero in a somewhat realistically depicted superhero movie. I mean, the MCU is wacky TODAY for sure but let's be honest, at the very beginning, before all the fame, how many ""superheroes"" in the MCU had actual superpowers? Even the ones that did have them where reduced to fighting or spy-thrillers (Captain America), or are currently considered lesser than the other ones (Thor & Thor 2). But seriously, the best friend, the mom figure (Aunt May), in the second one the love interest...Those are the ""three"" main areas of concern of mine. I really liked this movie, i really do. I didn't know what to feel when it came out, when I rewatched it I hated it because of the latest reasons; and now I have just rewatched it again (post-Endgame) and I just really really like this movie..., But only when I view it as a teen-movie highschool coming-of-age story of a non-spiderman superhero. It is honestly hilarious, well-written, emotionally uplifting, it has great action scenes and character development.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Definitely better than Andrew Garfield.,"Spiderman: Homecoming was a good movie, but I didn't think it was as much fun as the new Wonder Woman film that I recently watched. Although I'm more fond of Toby Maguire, I would say that Tom Holland is better that Andrew Garfield. I never like Garfield btw. His Spiderman suit also looked good in its cartoonish kind of way. Michael Keaton was a good choice for the Vulture. The Vulture suit was pretty cool and menacing. My only gripe about the Vulture is that he didn't have that much screen time. When the film starts, you get to see him for a couple minutes and about half an later, you get to seen him for another minute, etc. The part where Vulture finds out that Peter is Spiderman is when the action between Spiderman and Vulture actually starts. That's about an hour and a half into the movie. I was rather disappointed with Shocker. They only used him in a couple of brief scenes then quickly gets killed off. Then he quickly gets replaced with another one of Vulture's minions and they only used him for one brief scene. I was never that fond of Shocker, but it felt like a wasted opportunity to introduce him to the big screen. The one character I just did not like when Peter's classmate Michelle. She is the most unlikable character ever. Even more so than Flash Thompson. Every time you see her, she always makes some smart ass remark to Peter or his friend Ned. When you see her at Lizzie's party, she flips a bird at Peter when he first shows up. When Peter is in detention, she shows him a sketch she made of him being miserable with a cold look on her face. I the movie but I wouldn't call it outstanding. Out of all the movies that they made up till now. I would say homecoming is better than the Andrew Garfield movies, Spiderman 3, and underneath Spiderman and Spiderman 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Very Disappointing,"First of all, the protagonist is no spider-man. He is spider boy at best. But he is not event that, he is just a dumb teen with a suit.Michael Keaton is given very less screen time. We would have liked to see his reasons for being bad guy other than just money. I felt like this was a wasted opportunity. In other spiderman movies villains always had a good story and reasons for being villainous. Look at green goblin from first movie or sandman from spiderman 3.It was frustrating to see spidey failing so hard at everything. Spoilers ahead. Iron man comes to save his ass 2-3 times in the movie.He has no capability to use his spider senses. He gets hit by everything coming his way. All in all what I am trying to say is this version of spiderman doesn't feel like a superhero or even a guy who is on a journey to become one.Spoilers ahead. He is only able to capture vulture because of vulture's own flaws. He shows little remorse for his friend Liz because she lost her father.The movie seems to be made half-heartedly. I really wanted this movie to be good but I was disappointed. Watching this movie just made me realise how good those early movies by Sam Raimi and Tobey Mcguire were.Homecoming is at least better than amazing spiderman though. That was one piece of holy crap.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman: Homecoming...what?,"Why are detectives so funny to people? Firstly, let me acknowledge that I love Tom Holland as Spiderman. Captain America ""Civil War"" was great.If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else.I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Tom Holland is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well- established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened. Bitchin'.""Spiderman: Homecoming"" was okay, but so dark in places, meaning there is an actual deficit of light, it was difficult to tell what was going on. I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Keaton as the Vulture. A step in the right direction, but I hope the creators of the latest Spiderman franchise aren't scared to step on a few toes in future movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Refreshing; The Original Marvel Standard,"From the Studios that brought us Iron Man, The Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy comes Spider-Man Homecoming, Peter Parker brand new for the third time.Please remember this review is my own personal opinion.I have to admit straight away, I didn't think I would enjoy this. I'm a large fan of The Amazing Spider Man series with Andrew Garfield and was not happy when I heard that Marvel had bought Spider-Man back from Sony, and would be recasting and remaking the series to fit into The Avengers universe. After really not enjoying Civil War at all, and their current movies (save GotG) lacking, in my own personal opinion, I was not looking forward to this. I went with my family, excited for the movie, and sat in my cinema seat really not happy at all.However, within just a few minutes of the film, I was glued to the screen, eyes wide, laughing away and I found myself totally absorbed. The first I noticed, was that the humour was much better than in previous Marvel movies, and it was mostly relatable. He was just a teenager, excited to become a superhero, and the humour was for the age range that were mostly there to see the movie. It was well done, and a very good choice on the script writers part.The cinematography was really well done; I didn't find anything I was unhappy with during the movie, and the acting was all absolutely spectacular. You can tell everyone worked really hard for this movie, and it definitely paid off; everyone was brilliant.This is the standard of Marvel movies that I expect, and it reminds me of the movies back at the start of the series, long before they become the long political and not very interesting movies they have been recently. There needs to be plenty more movies like Homecoming in Marvel's future, as this was absolutely brilliant. It was refreshing, and it brought back what I personally loved about the series. This has been Marvel's best movie in a while; I hope to see more like this in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Reboot that Works,":Slight Spoilers Ahead:After 2014's rather dismal The Amazing Spider-Man 2, I've been rather sour on Spidey and the thought of yet another reboot of the character/franchise. However, Tom Holland's brief, but strong appearance as the character in Captain America Civil War, along with the current trailers renewed hope heart that the web slinger will once again fly high in geeky esteem.So very happy and relieved to say that Spider-Man: Homecoming is definitely a reboot that works. Hands down this movie is firing on all cylinders.It's a young, fresh and a refreshing take on Spider-Man.No time is wasted rehashing the characters' origin story from the beginning. There's a brief mention well into the story and we move on. Personally, the best part of this is not having to see poor old Uncle Ben kick it, yet again. Yeah, yeah. Great power, great responsibility. Yadda, yadda, yadda. This gem of a life lesson comes harshly, but organically.This go around, the backstory is broader and focuses on placing Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe that we've already seen from The Avengers through Civil War, giving us the ""big picture"" as well as this particular film's framework. This integration technique is also quite successful in establishing Michael Keaton's character in the film, making him one of the best villains out there.Characters/characterization. Yes, yes, YES! They did this one right all the way around. Returning characters are built upon, new ones are nicely established and fleshed out, old faves pop up enlighten, delight, and amuse. One of the best parts of Hollands' Peter Parker/Spider-Man is the back to basics of him being a kid, a kid with amazing abilities and potential, but a kid nonetheless. And all the baggage that entails, including being/doing something stupid, repeatedly, even for the right reasons. While things do get heavy/intense the weight of the world hasn't dropped on Peter's shoulders, yet so there's still a light hearted, even naivety about him that's been missing from previous versions. All of which leads to this movie being fun and entertaining from beginning to end. The excitement, awesomeness of getting to be a superhero is infectious.Overall, the story is solid, relatable and gratifying. The characters/acting is terrific across the board. The balance of action/humor/heart/angst is perfect. Nice soundtrack. There are even some surprising twists and turns. And let's be clear, this is the coolest, most bad@$$ version of the Spider-Man suit to date.Fill up your webs lingers and swing to the nearest theater to catch this one. It's a 10 and you need to see it on the big screen. And be sure to ration your drinks, there's an additional scene after the credits.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The movie lacked the hot female lead. Instead we were presented with average to below average girls, with diversity as the main focus on the cast.The plot could have been more well rounded. It did lack drama and the music score did not help. There was a should out to the ""We was Kangz"" group, as they built everything and the lack of tits and ass was a feminist warriors dream.But solid film. Might be the 3rd of 4th best Spidey film.

Itsy Bitsy Spider,"So I'm trying to sort of haphazardly backtrack my way through some of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies if only to keep up with the next one. This one has about six degrees of separation from Benedict Cumberbatch's Dr Strange character I've lately been watching which is why I belatedly dropped in on our friendly neighborhood Spider Man although I have seen one or two of the previous incarnations of the character starring Toby Hooper and Andrew Garfield.And what did I get from this new spin (no pun intended) on old Spidey, well for thing it was a great relief not to go able to another origin story and the death of old Uncle Ben although I'm hoping against hope those things didn't crop up in an Avengers movie I've bypassed where I presume he first hooked up with Iron Man.Anyway Peter Parker is aged fifteen here, is at high school, chumming about with his equally nerdy buddy Ned and exercising his teenage hormones over Liz Allan . I must have forgotten just how young the character was when he first emerged in comics so that Tom Holland's depiction of the hero as a callow youth initially surprised me, indeed I thought at times I was watching an episode of ""Saved By The Bell"" or ""The Wonder Years"".The big bad villain this time is Michael Keaton's The Vulture (what is it with Keaton and bird-related characters?) while the big cameo, if I can utilise an oxymoron, is Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man with Captain America in a very minor background role.Some of the humour being very much of the playground variety, rather missed me but there was some cute stuff too. The action scenes were fine and I enjoyed the scenery in and around New York, especially on the Staten Island Ferry and Washington D. C. The soundtrack was a bit hit and miss too I thought, yay to NYC's own hey ho, let's go Ramones but an old Stones album track and 80's hits by The Beat and A Flock of Seagulls...?This was obviously one of the MCU's lighter movies and once you buy into that, is quite enjoyable as such. Young Tom Holland plays the title role with genuine wide-eyed enthusiasm and interacts nicely with his super-diverse young classmates as well as his on-suit computer although you'd have to say that Michael Keaton had an easy payday of it. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was certainly a lot younger than I remember the character from the original comics!""Hot Dog!""

"Way too over hyped, unless you're a tween.","I'm a little disappointed in this film. I'm not happy the direction the Avengers franchise decided to take - outside its norm of blockbuster films, by changing the screenplay to be geared towards tweens. That's younger than a teenager. We all know they can be more annoying than teenagers sometimes, and this was the case with Tom Holland playing Peter/Spidey. He was just plain and annoying. I'm not sure if it was casting him for the role, are just a bad screenplay. All I have embedded in my brain is his annoying whiny yelling when the action started, every single time. I thought to myself, ""what a lousy superhero this kid would make.. no, wait.. he IS the superhero."" I just couldn't get past it. But I guess it's an untapped marked of new moviegoers that can go see it with their mom and dads and enjoy it. So in the franchises defense, it was a marketing move.

This tale is all about making you laugh with a fantastic dialog, great delivery, and a cast that only amplifies it. It's not easy making a high school film that isn't an afterschool special, drama filled, soap opera and still make it entertaining to watch. But Disney was able to do it again. While the production team has a lot to do with this, most audience members are going to give props to the acting. Tom Holland again rocks the role, taking his cameo from Civil War and running I mean slinging with it. He is the first actor in this modern age to capture both the nerdy peter parker and the smart mouthed Spiderman, giving you the character you wanted made for some time. Now throw in Michael Keaton portraying a villain who didn't make you cringe, yawn, or sympathize for the performance they were asked to play. The dynamic between them works and to take a lamer villain like the Vulture and make him respectable gets thumbs up from me. And they utilized their entire cast very well, keeping their big-name contenders involved without robbing the main actor his time to shine.Ned: But my friend and I agreed that the best part of the film was Peter's sidekick Ned played by Jacob Batalon. This character had me in enough stitches to require Spiderman to web it up. Batalon delivers his lines perfectly, and makes the already comedic gold shine where others would fail. He feels like a devoted fan boy and it works to keep things entertaining. The cast did a great job sharing Peter's secret with him and having him as the devoted friend wanting to do whatever he can to live as a super sidekick. This character's work is dynamic, it's fun, and shows not all cleverness has been lost to cheap slapstick ploys.DISLIKES:Special effects are so so: I don't know if it's the costume, the approach, or what, but the special effects didn't impress me as much as they usually do. Spiderman's movements looked fake at times, and the weapons (outside of Vulture's costume) were a bit hokie looking. Not the biggest dislike, but worth noting.Editing/Lack of Action: Biggest dislike for me is more so the lack of action. No surprise, Robbie wants his superheroes to have at least one engaging fight, but that wasn't the case for me in this film. While Homecoming was funny and entertaining, it still lacked the bite that superhero films have had. The fights were short lived, didn't involve too many spectacular moves, and the villains didn't have any impressive moves. We know Spidey's universe have some of the most unique powers of the bunch, so why in the world didn't they show that off more. Of note, the battles do keep in theme with the movie, and are emotional in regards to character development, that is a plus. Yet a 134-minute run time needed a few more suspenseful moments to get the full effect. Either that or cut out the extra laugh, unnecessary moments to shorten the run time. Sorry guys, but editing is still in need of work.The VERDICT:Spiderman Homecoming is certainly one of the better installments of the modern Spiderman age. It certainly is one of the more enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while, and takes some of the darker edge that has been building over the last few installments. A great use of cast, good writing, and many other fun gimmicks works on so many levels and will entertain many. Yet it isn't the most exciting film of this universe, nor did it need to be over 2 hours long. Still, it's a great addition to the library and one I look forward to seeing continued and integrated into the rest of the films. Worth a trip to the theater? Oh yeah (as if I can stop you), it is worth it.My scores: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The smallest thing could have given it a 10,"As I have watched all Marvel movies and will continue to do so leading up to Infinity War, I had high expectations for this movie - especially as SpiderMan 4 was cancelled and The Amazing Spider-Man 3 for stupid reasons but also with stupid plots to come in the movie. So Spiderman: Homecoming was going to be a show stopper for me, and it was! The humour was unimaginably good with perfect timings and getting to know Peter and Ned and the bad guy with all their intentions and lead ups and awkward moments in the movies, with the ending being shocking up understandable. The only downside for me is that we didn't get to know his friends around him, we understood Ned and Liz but everyone else we didn't get to know like I feel like we should of, Michelle we got to know a bit about with her mind and understanding, being the one whose quietly clever and understanding smart with her sarcastic comment, but I would of mind knowing where she got that sense of humour from and what else is her link to Peter and Ned because all we know is she sat alone with no friends on the same Table as then (Happily). Now Flash, he isn't a flash - is a Flash who wants to be mean but doesn't know how to, I feel like was a weak way of putting him in the movie as they didn't know exactly what to do to him and how to make him the meanie we know him to be. We know flash as a bully who picks on Peter the most because he can and has no excuse not to, and Liz as she is the equivalent of Mary - her and Flash have no connection and no relationship, for the time they are together I don't think they spoke to each other, just was in the same conversation but with aiming their talking at each other. It seems like Flash is Flash in the movie is because Peter does what he wants and doesn't give a sh** and Flash is jealous of it and fails to be jealous on the outside and get put down like you think the school bully should but it's a movie - he should be the bully who doesn't get done. Flash was a missed opportunity in this movie and I hope he gets a backbone in the next one and I hope we learn more about his friends/group in the next movie. Now Aunt May Parker, she is the wrong actor to play with character, we know her as an old women who is on the breaking point every day but keeps with the backbone for Peter even when he lets her down, even if The Amazing Spider man was a weak excuse of a Spiderman movie she still did the part - where as this Aunt May was young hurt and seemed like she grew a bit older since Captain America: Civil War. When we saw her they were short and simple lines and at times getting hit on by some guys around, but when she was upset Peter had to say a few words to make the attention go to him crying. I feel like when she was shown it was an easy way of pumping the movie length a bit longer, except Peter crying scene, but that could have been done way better than done. I still to this day will say the original Spider man film with the classic characters and plots was the best one, but this film just shows in part what both Spider Man and The Amazing Spider Man did well, and it shocking as The Amazing Spider Man for me was a waste of money that earned money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Iron Spider: Homecoming,"So here's my review of Iron Spider Homecoming.. ehm.. I meant to say #SpiderManHomecoming. It's an incredibly fun teen movie but it's not perfect. I think Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker, he's got the character down spot on. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield but Tom Holland's version is like straight out of the pages. But with this reboot, they basically plaster Iron Man's previous drama on to Spider-Man in addition to the new tech-based suit, so I'm not sure if that's going to sit well with all the fans.The events take place right after the colossal airport fight in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is stoked about helping Iron Man and looking forward to the next mission. But he seems to have been sidelined by his new mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Peter goes about his high school life with his best friend and decathlon classmates, when Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as the new villain.There's a bit of John Hughes influence in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and that's a good thing considering Hughes was a legend when it comes to chronicling high school dramas, so it's natural for any filmmaker that's handling the same subject to be taking inspiration from his movies. I think Holland's fellow young co-stars are just as perfect in their roles. And Michael Keaton is superb. The movie doesn't have to keep hammering the whole working class man getting screwed over by the rich and powerful because Keaton himself already does a good job of conveying that. I enjoy the vibrancy of the chases because the movie keeps reminding us that Spider-Man can't go immediately from one location to another so Spider-Man has to hitch a ride or trespass a backyard or crashes a sleepover tent.But because the humor really works, the drama has to come from somewhere else. They remove the origin story involving Uncle Ben and they also remove the ""With great power comes great responsibility"" essence, and they replace those with the dilemmas that Tony Stark had to experience in his previous film which asked the question of can a superhero be a superhero without his suit. To some, this might make sense so as to give us Spidey stripped down to his element. While others might see it as an effort to include Spidey in the MCU that comes with the risk of turning our friendly neighborhood hero into something else. The tech-based suit does provide some of the film's hilarious moments, but at times it makes Peter Parker/Spidey even more bumbling than he should be. So I'm not suggesting that iron-manizing Spider- Man is a terrible idea but clearly there are just too many MCU fingerprints all over what's supposed to be a Spider-Man new solo movie. The classic song might as well go like this ""Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever Iron Man can.""-- Rama's Screen --",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Spider-Man's entry into the MCU has charm and a solid lead in Holland, but also feels very small relative to other MCU entries","2 months after the events of Civil War, high school sophomore and superhero Peter Parker/Spider-Man continues his patrols around New York City with help from Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) Spider-Man suit with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) serving as a liaison between the two. With Peter's phone calls and texts often ignored by Hogan, Peter often feels like he's left on the outside of the bigger superheroes with matters complicated by his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) discovering his identity as Spider-Man coupled with the usual high school drama. When Peter comes across a group of thugs using highly advanced weaponry salvaged from the likes of Ultron and the Chitauri he sets his sights on finding out who is distributing the weaponry unaware it is Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) a former salvager who was forced out of business by Tony Stark and the Government and turned to crime as a result.Following Sony's failed attempt at setting up their own Spider-Man cinematic universe with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 intended as a launch point for multiple different spin-offs, Sony and Disney reached an agreement wherein Sony would retain the rights to distribute the mainline Spider-Man films as they owned the film rights to the character but would allow the character and actor to appear in other MCU properties and produce a trilogy set in the MCU. With Holland's take on Spider-Man introduced in Captain America: Civil War, it was soon announced that Jon Watts would direct a Spider-Man film with Holland in the role. While I do like Holland as Spider-Man and feel there are some charming scenes in the film, much like Iron Man 3 I appreciate the polish, craft, and talent while not really behind the story the filmmakers wanted to tell.Tom Holland does a good job playing Spider-Man and being the youngest actor to be cast as Spider-Man this is probably the most Peter Parker has been allowed to act like a teenager with both the Maguire and Garfield incarnations of the series either downplaying that point or rushing by it. I also rather liked Peter's circle of outsider friends like Zendaya's Michelle or Jacob Batalon's Ned. I also rather liked Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes/The Vulture and thought he was an interesting take on a man driven to crime after being forced out of his business by a backroom deal between Tony Stark and the government that left his contract null and void while also leaving him financially vulnerable which one of the officials shutting him has the gall to make a snide remark over.However despite the movie having some good elements to it, I'm not really a fan of the way they wanted to tell this story. In prior Spider-Man movies be it in the Raimi/Maguire series or the Webb/Garfield series the Spider-Man movies always felt like very big and very epic stories that tested Spider-Man's strength both on a physical as well as a personal level. With Spider-Man: Homecoming everything about the movie feels like it's trying to be smaller scale with the stakes nowhere near the level you'd seen in prior Spider-Man films even very messy ones like Spider-Man 3 and Amazing Spider-Man 2. While Michael Keaton is good as Vulture, the fact that he's essentially a low level weapons dealer makes him feel like he belongs in one of those Marvel TV series like Agents of SHIELD or maybe one of the Marvel Knights/Defenders shows. The movie also I feel overdoes it on the humor with many scenes trying to play more like an 80s teen comedy (including a very obvious Ferris Bueller reference) and the movie feels like it's afraid to have any of the drama you associate with a Spider-Man film with Peter not acting all that much like someone motivated by feeling responsible for his Uncle's death and any personal stakes that are hinted at are usually done so with a feather touch if at all. The fact the post credit scene is a joke about waiting for something only to be disappointed also doesn't help alleviate this feeling.Spider-Man: Homecoming is the kind of movie I think is decent in spite of my many issues with it. Unlike entries like Thor: The Dark World or Age of Ultron I actually do remember Homecoming after watching it, I just wish it were a bit more ambitious with what it wanted to do and wasn't afraid of going for the dramatic moments of Spider-Man in favor of so many comedic ones. In the end Homecoming is enjoyable even if it's not particularly substantive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's Super Freaking Awesome...!!!,It was Super Freaking Awesome....Super duper awesome.... Tom Holland nailed it... He was damn good as the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman...Micheal Keaton as Vulture was also damn good. He nailed the part of a cunning villain with undertones of a person who believes in what he is doing is good... He was damn good...Even though it was touted that RDJ will have a bigger role in the movie. It was not the case. He came on screen just and when it was required. With his usual charm and flair he stole the thunder from Tom Holland every single time..Peter Parkers sidekick Ned was also good.. Zendaya and all other supporting actors played their part well...With awesome comedy timings from the whole cast and kick ass action sequences..

Not the Spiderman we all grow up with.,"They are trying to make their adaptation of Spiderman much different from all previous ones by skipping origin and changing character traits and personalities. The problem is that they changed some core elements of them, especially Peter Parker who is nothing like one we all know and love from comics. They dumb him down and adjusted too much to be appealing for today's younger generations. Most of the times, he is just too immature and childish, even for a 15 years old kid, totally ignoring fact that he should be genius and outcast.Story have some good ideas here and there, They add at least some responsability elements to the character so its not completely shallow. Its trying to be mix of comedy and action but often ends being just too cheesy and naive .
Beggining of third act is the highest point of the movie where they turn the table and finally build needed tension. There is that one dialouge driven scene in the car after the ''great'' revalation that slow down the tone and set the climax of the movie perfectly. Sadly the following was returned to first gear again rushed thru final comfortation and conclusion, without delieviring the
fulfiling end.I expected better character development and little more focus on main villain. Which is disappointing because they really waste good potential with Keaton as Vulture, he nailed the role. Other than him, there was Shocker, two of them actually, the first one was fine but second was just uninspiring and bland.Acting was good, Tom Holand is good actor and fine for the role, fit more than Andrew or Tobey.
Action is decent, but not even close to the Civil War nor last Spiderman movie (Amazing Spider-man 2)Direction is where it really fails. Like most others Disney/Marvel movies its too fast phased, They jump from scene to scene, and location to location too fast, Not giving enough time of scenes and acts.It shows that movie is trying to be original and unique, it have same good moments and most important they didn't completely miss the whole point of Spiderman. So its not that bad, kids and young ones will love this movie. 6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Finally, This is the Spider-Man We Have Been Waiting For!","I think Spider-Man: Homecoming is my favorite Spider-Man movie to date, but it is not my favorite movie Spider-Man has been in. Let me explain: Out of all of Spidey's movies, Homecoming captures the spirit and the essence of the character the best. I don't think any of the other films so perfectly embody the Spider-Man I know from the comics. However, I do think Spider-Man 2 is ultimately a better film. So while Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date, it is not the best movie Spider-Man has been in. Raimi's Spider-Man films excellently captured the tragedy of Peter Parker, and I commend them for it. But this film captured his youthfulness. One of the defining elements of his character is that he's just a teenager, and while previous films have tried to capture that, they've ultimately fallen short. Here, Peter is just a kid, and you believe it. That element of his character is done perfectly, from his high school interactions, to his crushes, to his life problems-- it was right out of the comics...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The reboot this franchise has been waiting for,"Disney's Marvel is a juggernaut unlike we've ever seen, as there is almost no end to the films the studio churns out of the comic book universe. So much so that they've resorted to rebooting franchises multiple times, with 'Spider-Man' now on its third reinvention of itself.In 2017's 'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' we get to see the full backstory of Tom Holland's take on Peter Parker, who fans got a glimpse of in 'Captain America: Civil War.' When compared to Spideys of years past (Maguire and Garfield, looking at you), this interpretation of everyone's favorite neighborhood crimefighter seems closets to what's depicted in the comics. Holland looks the part of a nerdy high school geek, and he plays it well, making nerdy seem cool.And while the superhero is the main attraction here, his supporting cast is stellar - from Michael Keaton as a construction crew supervisor-turned winged villain to Marisa Tomei as Aunt Mae, not to mention Donald Glover, Jon Favreau, Zendaya, Iron Man himself and a special cameo from everyone's favorite pepper (Potts, that is). As the Marvel cinematic universe has expanded, it's been easier to squeeze in all these characters, and there is a feeling that it is one continuous storyline as opposed to siloed chapters.As for the storyline here, 'Homecoming' seems a bit lukewarm compared to previous efforts. Sure, the protagonist is still going to Spanish class and competing on the academic decathlon team, so we can't be dealing with anything extra crazy here, but Keaton's Vulture nemesis is not the most menacing thing we've ever come across. Instead, 'Homecoming' opts for a lot more humor and lightheartedness, focusing on adolescent issues like first love and getting asked to the homecoming dance (makes sense now, right?). Still, there are plenty of action sequences and cool shots of the NYC skyline that should not be taken for granted.It's not amazing, per se, but 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' feels like the reboot this franchise was in need of, and will fit as a better piece in the Marvel puzzle for the foreseeable future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Definitely The Best Spider-Man Movie Since ""Spider-Man 2""","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the 6th live action adaptation of the popular comic book superhero and third reboot we have gotten, as well as the 16th entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Peter Parker must try to balance his high school life with being Spider-Man while the Vulture (Michael Keaton) is on the loose.I've been a fan of Spider-Man for a long time. I grew up playing Maximum Carnage on Super Nintendo, and watched the original Say Raimi trilogy. I like the first one, love the second one, but when Spider-Man 3 came out it's more of a mixed bag, and the other two after that don't really count in my opinion. I can say this is definitely the best Spider-Man film since Spider-Man 2.What I really liked was that this was essentially a high school teen comedy with Spider-Man. It was interesting to see Peter Parker trying to balance his life as a superhero. He has hardships in his personal life, he has hardships as Spider-Man. He wants to impress Tony Stark so that he can become an Avenger. It was an interesting way to go about things. It wasn't an origin story, thank god. How boring would that have been if Uncle Ben had died again in this reboot? We don't have to see that all over again for the third time. I'm glad they steered clear of that.The Vulture was a solid villain played brilliantly by Michael Keaton. I don't think he was one of the best villains of the MCU like people have said but he was functional and fun to watch.The side characters were really good, but there was one thing with one character at the end that didn't really sit well with me.

Spiderman feels like Spiderman again,"The truth is as much as I loved the raimi take on spiderman and the first 2 where great films they where never really that close to the comics, then the Amazing spiderman movies where something I also actually enjoyed for the most part but again didn't feel like spiderman and the second one had too much filler too many repetitive scenes and felt like a jumbled mess because they where trying to use it start creating their bigger spiderman universe with the sinister six etc which seems like it ended up being a waste of time in the end now.But this film surprised me, from the trailers I thought it would be a little TOO cheesy for me to enjoy and as much as it does feel like more of a kids film it was none the less a fun watch aslong as you are the type of adult that doesn't go into every movie expecting it to be aimed at that crowd, it is much more like a Marvel movie but to be honest if ever there was a Marvel character that suited the type of films marvel are making it was definitely Spiderman he is finally the wise cracking young kid he always has been and starting him off so young simply gives us time to see him grow up into the adult peter parker we have seen for quite some time over and over again giving Marvel a chance to really build the character up well without having to just force the uncle ben death on us as the only driving power behind peter being a hero.It feels like a proper 90s early 2000s superhero movie and despite going in hesitant I have to admit I enjoyed every second of it, a lot of people complaining about how he was basically iron man clearly never read the comics as peter used various new tech throguhout the years in his suit and had as many varied suits as even the likes of iron man... well OK not quite that many but you get the idea, but I feel a lot of the hate is coming from people wanting some kind of Nolan batman universe again where everything is dark and moody and serious, but that was never really spiderman as a whole as its tone was very light 90% of the time.Either way see it judge for yourself but don't expect anything too dark, michael keaton is a great vulture and his character can be dark at times but it never goes over the top.Take your kids or if you are a real fan of spiderman from the comics go and enjoy otherwise it may be a 50/50 movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Is a second reboot justified? Somehow, yes.","Marvel fans rejoiced when the announcement was made that Cinematic Universe overseer Kevin Feige had managed to reclaim the movie rights to one of their most beloved and iconic characters, Spider- Man. Along with Bryan Singer's X-Men, Sam Raimi's Tobey Maguire- starring Spider-Man trilogy laid the foundations for the modern superhero movie and proved that comic-books aren't just for nerds. After constant meddling by Sony, Spider-Man 3 was a convoluted mess, and although it raked in the cash at the box-office, plans for a fourth instalment were put on ice. The plan was later scrapped entirely in favour of a reboot with Andrew Garfield, which was also cancelled after its sequel made the same mistakes that saw Raimi's Spider-Man 3 receive a critical mauling.Marvel cast British actor Tom Holland in the role, and he was quickly heralded as the best Peter Parker yet when he debuted in last year's Captain America: Civil War, and Feige revealed that a standalone reboot was coming soon. The thought of a second reboot just 5 years after the last one naturally had people sceptical, but Holland's exciting cameo also raised hopes. While it certainly doesn't reach the lofty humanist heights of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (still one of the best comic-book movies ever made), Homecoming - a title that works on two levels - is bloody good fun. Taking Parker all the way back to high school as an overeager 15 year old, with detention, hormones and the homecoming dance as much of a concern to our hero as the villain flying around with alien technology, the film shares just as much in common with the classic John Hughes movies of the 1980s than it does with anything starring Iron Man, Thor or the Hulk.Having proved himself to Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) by stealing Captain America's shield and helping topple Paul Rudd's Giant-Man during the events of Civil War, Peter Parker now waits eagerly by the phone for a call from Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan to announce his next mission. Only Stark would prefer that he remains a friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man for the time being, but Parker's eagerness to prove himself and struggle to truly control his powers see him taking on hardened thugs and barely making it out alive. On top of juggling his new responsibilities (thankfully we are spared the Uncle Ben speech this time around), he awkwardly courts the pretty Liz (Laura Harrier), receives abuse from rich douchebag Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), and must prevent chubby best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) from revealing his superhero alter-ego to the rest of the school. Ned quite rightly believes that the revelation is their ticket to climb the high school cool hierarchy, and Liz naturally has a crush on her local masked vigilante.A world away from Marvel's previous supervillain Ego the Living Planet (no pun intended), whose masterplan spanned the entire universe, Homecoming's big bad is in the form of working man Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton). Talking in a thick New York accent and favouring a baseball cap and a hoodie, Toomes is introduced cleaning up the mess left by Loki and his Chitauri army during the climax of 2012's The Avengers, only to watch as his contract is snatched away by Stark and his billions. He doesn't leave empty-handed though, as he manages to smuggle some alien technology away and form a lucrative, and highly illegal, arms business. He also has a formidable suit made for him, allowing him to soar through the sky on razor-sharp wings, dubbing him the Vulture. After a number of forgettable Marvel villains, Toomes brings to mind Alfred Molina's three-dimensional and incredibly sympathetic Doc Ock, and Keaton has fun with the role, proving a menacing presence during a particularly tense car journey on the way to the homecoming dance, in what is undoubtedly the film's standout moment.The likes of Thor would be able to take out Toomes with the blink of an eye, but his family-first motivation and distrust of the rich and powerful ground the movie, and helps make Homecoming Marvel's smallest and most intimate entry since Ant-Man. While the climax does deliver a routine smash-em-up CGI fest that director Jon Watts doesn't seem experienced enough to handle, the film mainly avoids the usual superhero tropes and rarely shifts its focus away from Parker, who is played with irresistible charm and athleticism by Holland. There's an endearing playfulness in the smaller moments, particularly in the dynamic between Holland and scene-stealer Batalon. Having watched Watts's previous film Cop Car recently, it now seems obvious why Marvel placed so much trust in a director so clearly adept in handling young relationships. Homecoming continues the recent trend of proving that superhero movies don't necessarily need to be superhero movies: They can also be a high school comedy, or a violent western. Is a second reboot for a character only introduced to the big screen 15 years ago justified? Somehow, yes",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

But and that is important, even if this is the first one you're watching you won't be disappointed. And as you can see by the general rating, I'm not alone with this statement.So taking an 80s classic and putting a Spiderman costume on it ... well you get this as a result. It's a pretty solid movie and having the blueprint of a classic injected you can see why this works. It allows for something far more than just a superhero movie. I have to admit I was skeptical with Spiderman in the previous let's call it cameo he did in the Captatin America movie. It seemed like he was belittled. Even the fact that Iron Man was going to be in this one seemed like taking away the spotlight from the man (boy) who's supposed to be the star.But all of it was worries that never really manifested. Actually we have a Spiderman who walked the thin line Toby Maguire couldn't in Spiderman 3 not so long ago. Of course that wasn't entirely Tobys fault (script issues, producers influence and so forth). But it all lead to this moment, so let's take the positive ... and enjoy! Also do I have to point out there are scenes in and after the credits? The one after the credits - well let's say you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Another version...,"Spider-Man: Homecoming or Spider-Man: The Homecoming in Quebec is an American superhero film directed by Jon Watts, released in 2017. Produced by Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures, it is distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. This is the sixteenth film of the universe Marvel and the fourth in Phase 3. For my part, this is a version too, an extra version of Spider-Man. I love this character, but in a few years we had our lot. The actor has signed for 5 films. Civil War, Homecoming, Avengers 3 and 4 and Homecoming 2 (but still not for Homecoming 3).

"Started Off as Light Teen Movie, but Ended with A More Complex Storyline","Well, this was a movie that I was actually feeling a bit weird to see at first. Reason being it was the 6th Spider-Man movie done in the past 15 years and Tom Holland was the 3rd person portraying the superhero. I was earlier hoping for a 3rd Spider-Man movie with Andrew Garfield since the 2nd one left with a rather disturbing cliffhanger. But with the recast and the inclusion of Spider-Man into Marvel Cinematic Universe, that hope vaporized already. So even though a Marvel movie was generally highly anticipated, my excitement towards the movie was a bit mixed in the beginning. However, after finished seeing the movie, I felt that Sony pictures was correct in their decision to join up with Marvel Studios as this movie was fantastic.The earlier part of the movie was a bit too light for me as I felt it was a really teenage movie with high school problems. But as it continued on, the movie became heavier and more complex, especially with the challenges that Peter faced with his wish to be taken seriously by Tony Stark, and also his dilemma between high school education and the life of a superhero. Being a kid of 15 year old with only his aunt certainly did not help (Yes, this Spider-Man is really just a kid!).Now aside from the story which I think was excellent from the middle onwards, I felt that there was too little screen time of Aunt May (seemed like she was not a supporting role but just a minor role and was unclear of her role in Peter's life other than just being there few times). This movie was not like any other origin story of Spider-Man with the showing of how he was bitten or how Peter became a Spider-Man and there was not even a flash back to show that. I guess the writers thought it was enough shown anyway in other adaptations.This movie was very good in term of its special effects and action sequence. I felt it was done fantastically during at least 3 different major fighting scenes involving Spider-Man. Its sound effects were also nice (though it was strangely not made in Dolby Atmos or Auro 11.1 system). The major surprise in the last third of the movie was good and also a bit of nice surprise before the end. As usual Marvel movies, this one had got post credit scene. One in the middle and another funny one at the very end that you should not miss out.For a movie with just a little over 2 hours, surprisingly it had quite significant story line and quite a lot were told, though as I said the beginning was very light. One major thing that I felt was good was the amount of screen time for Iron Man was not too much. Otherwise it would not be a Spider-Man movie but a Spider-Man & Iron Man movie. He was shown only occasionally which was just enough since Robert Downey Jr. had such a major on screen appearance and would take the spotlight off Tom Holland who I think was pretty good in portraying a very young Spider-Man.So if you are a fan of Marvel movies, this one would not disappoint you. If you are one of those audience who felt there was too many superheroes movies in the past few years, you should still try and see this one as I believe it would be worth the while. For family and young children, this movie would be quite entertaining and as what I saw in the internet, the ratings for the movie was very high and it would most likely go on as a major hit again for Disney/Marvel studios.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The best SPIDERMAN movie after 2002 epic !,"Brilliant just Brilliant.Nostalgia!!! Replacing Tobey Maguire as spider-man is always going to be difficult Garfield couldn't even reach anywhere near it. But Tom Holland was the best candidate for that role. {its difficult to forget Tobey :( }Spider man was back to his comic best a ""KID"". He does what an 14-16 year old do. Thats what made spider man one of the most loved superhero (IMO 1. Batman 2. Spider-man then others).The movie is perfectly directed,Jon watts (thumbs up!!) he made it enjoyable, thrilling, and very marvel-esque.Casting is top notch Tom Holland deserves credit, his expressions are superb and dialog delivery is almost perfect, the chemistry between him and everyone is special. Michael Keaton as his usual self brilliant and super villainy after Loki i think marvel has a villain worth noting (aside from THANOS), Downey is as brilliant as ever, his charisma will never fade i guess , he brings something different to the screen,cant think of anyone playing the iron-man like Hugh Jackman for wolverine. (the best marvel hero after Spider- man).Rest of all casts are good even though aunt may and Liz Allen dint have much to do.Action wise one of the best i have seen in superhero movies. Especially the acrobatic ones.Story is a predictable one from the word go. If u r a spider-man fan then this is a must watch. there are moments u will feel goosebumps, smile, Laughter and great thrilling action scenes.And At last oh boy the SUIT !!! the gadgets, the techniques in the spidey suit are amazing, the last suit scene will make you go ""WOOOW"" .

Breezy fun with spectacular set pieces.,"With this iteration of the web-slinger arriving hot on the heels of the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man movies, it needed to justify its existence by bringing something fresh to the table. It does. As soon as Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is introduced through a series of his own video blogs, taking us behind the scenes during a key battle in Captain America: Civil War, it's clear this will be the funniest and most playful cinematic version of Spidey yet. Chockfull of irreverent humour, borderline adult gags and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) injects, but also enough angst befitting a 15-year-old protagonist, director Jon Watts keeps the tone lightweight but edgy. Soon-to-be-megastar Holland is crucial to this tone, nailing the balance between ignorant enthusiasm, geeky charm and—coming with the adolescent territory—world-on-his-shoulders seriousness. When this Spider-Man makes mistakes you can't help but like him even more. And when his lapses in judgment lead to epic action set pieces, who can complain? The most memorable is a vertigo-inducing thriller set in, around and atop the Washington Monument; with both this and the gigantic ferry sequence showcasing Watts' talent for crafting big budget awe – expect to see him around a lot more in Hollywood. Of course this new Spidey requires its own take on all the usual elements, so we get a much younger and hipper Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), a more awkward and complicated romance (with Laura Harrier's Liza Allan), and a Stark-built suit with an amusing female-voiced interface. For the most part the new and/or improved ingredients work well (Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also make for a sweetly goofy best friend and a hilariously snarky loner respectively), however, Homecoming is not perfect. Michael Keaton's villainous Vulture isn't as threatening as he could've been, Tony Revolori's Flash Thompson is boring and clichéd, and there are sporadic bouts of distractingly shimmery CGI, particularly with shots that are entirely computer generated. By and large though this latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a breezy delight with spectacular set pieces and winning humour. If there was any doubt before it has now been expelled: Spidey is in safe hands at Marvel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Unique Solid MCU fun,"Tom Holland really hits the spot in his first solo web swinging adventure.Returning to his regular friendly neighbourhood life in Queens, after his call to arms in Captain America Civil War, Peter Parker must earn his wings as a super hero by tending to his local community cries for help, while balancing his academic life, including his best friend, his crush and bully. But Peter gets his chance to prove himself when righteous salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) the winged Vulture beings smuggling extra-terrestrial advanced weaponry, and its down to the wall crawler to take him down.The journey of Spider-Man has been a long one from the camp 70s TV series, Toby Maguire's perfect Peter Parker, just not so much Spider-Man, to Andrew Garfield not so perfect Peter Parker, to excellent Spider-Man. Now thanks to Marvel and Sony's new agreement we are blessed with the sensational presence of Tom Holland. Since he wowed us with his brief appearance in Civil War, fans have not slept till we saw his own flick, and how much does this man deliver. Although still not bang on the precise age of Spider-Man Tom Holland does amazingly capture the exciting teenager character of Spider-Man, a much more realistic and enjoyable screen presence, something that Magurie and Garfield could never bring.With spot on directing by Jon Watts Homecoming wonderfully explores the real life troubles of Spider-Man, especially at the early stages of hero-ing he is. With great focus and detail to Parker's teen life with a great mixture of a thrilling plot and well establish villain (something that the MCU does struggle with, just not today). This is brought to life the rest of the supporting cast, such as Keaton, who demonstrates a who new Birdman since his last costume role. Furthermore Parker's best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) proving significant contribution to the laugh factor. Robert Downy Jr also popping once or twice to play the role he must certainly nail in his sleep, Tony Stark/Iron Man. This was also a relief as Iron Man's appearance is perfectly distributed in a low key tone not once stealing the thunder of Holland.One thing that the MCU does seem to do well in is the laughs, and with a wonderfully witty character like Spider-Man there is much loud laughs to be had. Not just brought by Holland but the majority of the cast. One slight resentment is that there may so many jokes that could convince yourself your in an all out comedy movie, but when the action and drama starts, it becomes an intense roller-coaster.It may seem that this just another spider man film (in 3 years) but the MCU creates more space for all heroes in their own worlds. So when we enter Spider-Man's world we can have a fun and energetic perspective of the world of super-heroes. This of course comes form Tom Hollands performance. There is great national pride to be taken since we have had two British Spider-Mans in a row.Spider-Man Homecoming is a magnificent exhilarating experience unique on its own for the MCU, with a flawless performance by the worlds perfect Spider-Man Tom Holland.

"""Kick Ass"" meets Iron Man","Its a good film. Not very original as I felt I was watching a new version of ""Kick-Ass"" but it had some really great aspects. The action scenes were wonderfully put in scene. The story approach is indeed like John Hughes would have shot a super hero film which worked perfectly for me in regards of a ""Spider-Man"" film because this was something I missed about all the previous films - the coming of age factor. Tom Holland was perfectly cast. There is no doubt. He IS Peter Parker and he IS Spider-Man with the right among of youth naivety. Great performance and absolutely convincing. Also the choice of Michael Keaton as Vutlure was not only a pitch perfect ironic casting choice but also the absolute right one because he took that role really seriously and delivered a wonderful performance. Really menacing in many aspects and it was role you could have easily overacted. The weakest point of the cast for me was Laura Harrier who wasn't particularly bad but just very boring. Marisa Tomei was a bit wasted and it was a positive surprise that they really kept Robert Downey Jr's appearance short - don't get me wrong I love him and his Tony Stark but he left to spotlight to Holland and Spider-Man which was the right thing after ""Captain America: Civil War"" felt more like an Iron Man film than a ""Captain America"" film. Why Gwyneth Paltrow tho received such a high billing for her cameo will ever be a huge mystery to me, same goes to Zendaya who had more like a side kick part, but at least she was fun.

So it started well, but honestly most of the funny/good bits were in the trailer. Then it got boring. I mean really boring.

Also big shout out to the wonderful Marissa Tomei, who was as good as she could be as Aunt May but really didn't have enough to work with. Sounds like a sideline comment but Aunt May has always been the big moral compass for Peter in the comics and films past.

Shocked At How The Great Marvel Studio Has Made The Worst Spider-Man Movie!!,"I'm a fan of the previous 5 Spider-Man movies and as i'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe movies i was sooo sure of a great Marvel version with Spider-Man:Homecoming. Their movies have great stories teamed with outstanding action, a good sense of humour and great character development. I've only disliked one Marvel Universe movie which was one of the early ones and sadly this one joins it now.It made me really wish SONY had gone and made the sequel to Andrew Garfield's The Amazing Spider-Man 2!The reasons my friend and i weren't keen on this Spidey movie were....It felt rushed..Story didn't flow smoothly..It felt kinda pointless..Scenes felt crowbarred, e.g. Iron Man scenes.The ""teen"" scenes were long, kinda boring, weren't fun or funny like in all the other Marvel movies.Aunt May felt like background, unnecessary.Pointless teen characters like Zendaya's, as if someone said we need Ali Sheedey's character from Breakfast Club in this, unfortunately it was pointless in this.The film was emotionless and felt nothing towards any of the characters, unlike the emotional progression and connections in the previous Spider-Man movies.The villain had an underdeveloped screen presence, so his connection to Spider-Man felt threadbare.Just a shallow and empty experience, and the action sequences couldn't save it sadly.The whole film just felt like a wasted opportunity.4/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Tom Holland Shines in a Refreshing New Take on my Favourite Superhero,","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a talented cast. We follow the suited web slinger in his fifth feature film, and the character is still fun and exciting as ever to see slinging around on screen, delivering some stellar one liners. Peter Parker is now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, changing the dynamic of the character and the world around him, making it something refreshing for fans. It is action packed from start to finish, including a stellar sequence in Washington and a stellar finale, it had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish.As a long time fan of Spider-Man, I could not help but have my gripes with this movie. First of all, there is a lack of a special connection with his audience that the Maguire and Garfield movies have. When it begins with several major characters already knowing he is Spider-Man, it can be a little less thrilling and personal, I loved how it was only Peter and us who know at the beginning of the other movies, while we get to see him revealing his secret ourselves throughout. As well as that, I was underwhelmed by Tony Stark's role, his connection with Peter was so strong in Captain America: Civil War that I was hoping for a similar one on one here, instead, he is merely around to tell Peter when he is doing something wrong, offering him advice. The back and forth between them is not as enticing, I do not blame Holland and Downey Jr. for this, as they certainly have chemistry, I blame the writers.The performances are all around brilliant, the casting director deserves a big pat on the back. Tom Holland is charming, funny and dramatic when he needs to be, offering a great new take on the character that is very pleasing after two previous interpretations, he has great ease in the role that makes him a pleasure to watch. Michael Keaton shines as the Vulture, one of my favourite villains I have seen in this franchise thus far, he has some of the best dialogue and reveals throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is dazzling as always as Iron Man, Marisa Tomei is a delight as Aunt May, it is a pleasure to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan once again, Zendaya plays a quirky, likable character and Jacob Batalon steals many scenes as Peter's friend Ned.Great fun from the beginning, a delight to finally see the web slinger in this universe. While I can not say I am completely pleased with this film, it kicks things off nicely and I am highly anticipating what is next for the character, I would recommend Spider-Man: Homecoming to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film.Peter Parker tries to balance his school life with his newfound superhuman abilities.Best Performance: Tom Holland",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),"Directed by Jon Watts. Starring Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Jacob Batalon, Robert Downey Jr., Jon Favreau, Marisa Tomei, Laura Harrier, Donald Glover, Zendaya, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Michael Chernus, Logan Marshall-Green, Martin Starr, Hannibal Buress, (voice) Jennifer Connelly. (PG-13)Overlong, overfamiliar, but adequately enjoyable Spider-Man adventure is both a second reboot in about half-a-decade and a full-length installation of the character into the fringes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (this is a co-production of both Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures); plot is both patently simple--the baddie, Vulture (Keaton), just wants to steal tech, sell weapons, and make a lot of money, nothing more--and unduly messy--Peter deals with not only superhero responsibilities and teenager anxieties but also Avengers drama. As it was with ""Ant-Man,"" the lowered stakes are a relief, letting character and humor grab focus away from the chaos of enormous digital pyrotechnics; granted, not all the characters are especially interesting and the humor misses as often as it hits, but at least it probably won't give anyone a headache. Holland makes for a plucky, ingenuous Peter Parker, cracking wise more often than Maguire and Garfield combined (a little of him goes a long way--he was more tolerable as a supporting player in the third Captain America movie); Keaton does his best as the villain, but the character's motivations and back-story are too thin to make him truly menacing and memorable. Aside from the web-slinging and jesting, Spider-Man is a different entity here: younger than usual, wearing a high-tech Spidey suit with its own AI (Connelly), crushing on someone besides Gwen Stacy or MJ, and so on. Similarly, the characteristics of nearly every supporting character (Aunt May, Vulture, Flash, Mary-Jane-but-not-really, etc.) hardly resemble those of their classic counterpart from the comics. Several stars of prior MCU films make appearances, some in supporting roles, some in cameos.63/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tom Holland is a great fit and every character had a shining moment or two in the film. Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton! This man has single handedly saved the MCU from the dreaded villain curse. You want to talk about character development. Wow he gave a strong and intimidating performance as The Vulture. Peters best friend Ned, Aunt May, Tony Stark and even Happy the Butler all kept me glued to the Screen throughout the film. Now let's talk about the action. Very well paced action and pretty intense scenes, I mean you can tell that Peter was out of his league. Even the Shocker was pretty damn powerful and gave Spider- Man a run for his money. With MCU and the signature comedy lines it was well placed to make a pretty great summer blockbuster. The MCU does a great job with taking a genre and adding super heroes to it. For example Cap 2 was a espionage film and Ant Man was a heist film. Spider-Man Home coming is definitely a high school teen movie with a super hero twist.

Refreshingly small scale and lighthearted,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a refreshingly small scale MCU adventure and a tonally lighter Spider-Man film that doesn't forget the core tenets of a Spider-Man story even if its class commentary is a little muddled. It's a story in which Peter Parker yearns to be an Avenger saving the world but learns to appreciate the friendly neighbourhood stuff whilst coming to terms with the sacrifice needed to be Spider-Man.Tom Holland confirms what was obvious from his brief yet impactful appearance in Civil War. His version of Peter Parker has a near endless enthusiasm and determination to prove himself making him really likeable and his arc to realise a high tech suit doesn't make him Spider-Man all the more satisfying. Robert Downey Jr. Almost literally phones in some of his scenes and it's still clear to see why the MCU was built around him from this small role.Michael Keaton gets a role wholeheartedly worthy of his talents as one of the best villains in the entire MCU. It's the ideal combination of him having plenty of depth and his motivations actually making sense as he makes valid arguments but goes about it the wrong way. The conflict between him and Peter is so good because it showcases Keaton's ability to be likeable and terrifying in mere moments of one another and the film knows how good he is as it opens with Keaton first.Jon Watts unfortunately cements himself as the weakest director to helm a Spider-Man film when it comes to the visuals. None of it's horrendously ugly and the action is always competent enough, it's just a noticeable step down from his predecessors. The John Hughes inspirations combined with how good everything else is make up for it though, including the greatest twist in the whole MCU and a steady stream of really funny jokes that only undercut one major emotional beat.CGI is an increasingly over relied upon tool in these films and even though it's got some noticeably rough spots it still looks solid overall. Composer Michael Giacchino has done many scores for the MCU so it's impressive that his work here still stands out in the wider context of Marvel and against other Spider-Man themes thanks to its distinctly jovial nature and the accompanying soundtrack also really fits the tone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I feel like this could've just been an episode of Agents of SHIELD,"If I could I'd give this something in the high 6's. It's entertaining but I sort of felt like I walked in half way through the movie and had missed something... we just jumped straight in with little explanation of why things were happening. Because of this I'm still not 100% on if spiderman actually has powers anymore but it seems not. From what I could see, this movie is sort of like Iron Man goes to high school. There's a suit, there's a non-threatening ai who helps the user of the suit. But what makes spiderman special exactly? Tony Stark may not have super powers but at least he has the intelligence to make the damn iron man suit. I guess it brings up another avenue of story telling when he's given his power by another person but it just doesn't have the same gravity to me because this is something that can be easily taken away and then you're left asking why couldn't it be anyone in that suit. Maybe they were just sick of telling the same story for the 3rd time. I had a similar feeling when the newest hulk showed up in avengers. It's just like: we need a warm body to play this role so lets just slip him in and hope people accept it and we can make some more movies. It's great to have the fuller embodiment of that universe but at the same time I feel like I've been to this puppet show and it was better done before.

Cinematic transposition faithful to the comic strip.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best attitude since The First Avenger,"Can't say I'm a huge fan of the comic book movies - but I tend to watch all the big ones Marvel and DC release these days. Some are more fun, some are less - but it's always intriguing to see the evolvement of the approach to such kind of cinema.It may sound strange to some, but, despite Hulk's unbeatable strength, Thor's divinity or Tony Stark's wit, it's the Captain America movies that became a pinnacle of the Marvel way of storytelling for me. Maybe because, unlike every other super guy, Steve Rogers is not even about the display of power but rather about ethics. Ethics that's distinctively far from any preaching, but is instead aimed more at yourself, making yourself your own harshest judge. For an superhero action movie, such approach is not simply unlikely - it's unique, allowing the film to bring in the dramatic quality that genre seldom is able to possess.And now, after the pretty bland Ant-Man, disturbingly flashy Dr Strange and outright ridiculous GotG2, it's such a pleasure to see a Marvel film whose main character is as mature as he is modest. Sure, Peter Parker is still a kid, and the movie never misses a chance to prove it with a portion of goofing around, but he is much more than his goofy side shows. Which we seriously need to thank Tom Holland for. I have no idea how the genuine Spidey must be, but both Tobey Maguire and especially Andrew Garfield felt as if they wore the Spiderman suit mostly to show off themselves. Tom, on the other hand, is as natural in this role as a human being could possibly be, feeling like a true teenager for whom having such abilities is not simply cool but also awkward and even frustrating, and who's torn apart between the desire to become larger than life and staying down to earth.One thing to attribute that character versatility to is probably the fact that Peter has a mentor this time around. Which is curious, because the same exact reason that turns Tony Stark into a great support for Parker/Spider-man buildup makes Iron Man himself acutely annoying. But maybe that's just natural, after all, all parents are annoying in their kids' eyes. Still, despite all the Civil-War prehistory and Cap's current outlaw status, it feels as if Spider-man's much closer spiritually to Steve Rogers than to the guy who's actually sponsoring all his superhero'ing. Why do I get this feeling that such resemblance isn't just a random coincidence and that it's gonna be built upon later on...Another thing to love here is the villain. Well, apart from the tongue in cheek reference to the Inarritu's masterpiece, Michael Keaton's character is exactly what Spiderman movies (and Marvel universe as a whole) have been missing greatly: a villain who's formally a bad guy without a doubt but who you have mixed feelings and unlikely sympathy for nonetheless. Overshadowing everyone, Parker included, Adrian is a guy whose agenda doesn't only sound legit - it _feels_ like one: I couldn't help feeling that our ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist"" dude is like a huge corporate colossus sucking in all the tech he could lay his hands on, while the small guys might be equally resourceful and even useful for the society, if only they weren't pushed out of the game by the big shiny players.One last thing that I can't get out of my head. Spider-man Homecoming is exactly what Deadpool might've aimed to be, but failed to: a film where clumsy isn't equal to devoid of a soul. Homecoming isn't perfect in any way, but it makes up for it in one single way: it's damn sincere. There's no over the top cynicism or self-irony, no self-adoration or self-loathing. Just a story of a kid who wants to be true to what his heart tells him to do and to be, and learns to do that throughout the story. That may sound not as cool as throwing a magic hammer or chopping your enemies to pieces with two katana swords, but to me it's a real superpower, the most worthy of them all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Friendly in the ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man""","What can I say its a really fun movie that knows when to be serious. The best portrayal of the Friendly Neighborhood side of Spider-Man so far and thus its full of quirky and lovable charms. Tom Holland really is the best of both worlds and altho the MCU Spider-Man movies have a lot of problems and shifts it makes sense and somehow worksMy biggest gripes have to be the inclusion of Tony Stark. He's not in it a lot but his influence is sadly everywhere. That is what bugs me, Spider-Man in the MCU is literally Iron-Boy Jr which goes against everything Spider-Man is in the comics. Spider-Man is selfmade and makes his own gears, he strictly protects his identity from his closed ones and smiles through the pain no matter what happens.This movie threw almost everything that defines Spider-Man out the window in order to seamlessly integrate to the MCU and even tho it works in this universe, its a betrayal to the character. Not saying I don't enjoy the changes because I do but it would've been much better if Peter Parker was allowed to grow himself instead of living under Stark charity.What it does get right is the friendly neighborhood side of him and its a blast to watch Tom Holland nail the role. The absolutely right man for the job and he embraces the role and acts ring around everyone in the cast. Peter is understandably much younger than the other iterations which also explains why Aunt May is also young and hot. Even tho its not different from the comics it really does work in the MCU so I'll let it slide, plus its Marisa Tomei.What I don't like are the casting of MJ and Ned, these two don't work for me at all. Ned is infinitely more bearable and also kinda charming and fun at times. But MJ straight up doesn't work and is absolutely nothing like the Spider girls in any media really.There is a distinct boyish charm and its very lighthearted. Only time it gets serious is when Michael Keaton is on screen as Vulture. A solid casting that is responsible for the movie having a very smooth fun to intense transition. One of the better written villains of the MCU and definitely the biggest star of the show alongside Tom Holland. The car intimidation scene is one of the best scenes in the MCU and you really feel the tension. And since the movie is very breezy up until now it has proper impact.Not enough credit can be given to Tom Holland who displays his superior acting chop whenever possible. Especially during the rubble scene. Not the origin movie people were expecting but its more like coming of age. The tech stuff altho not fitting with Spider-Man does give Jennifer Connelly voicing the suit and well I can't say no to that. Not because she was the perfect one to voice a female AI(after maybe Liv Tyler) but she was hilarious.Overall I'm very fond of this movie and altho I really do believe the presence of Tony Stark muddles Spider-Man as a character. It does work in universe and people not familiar with the comics are going to have no issues with that either. I can put down my purist googles if I had fun and it works, because it definitely works and always a fun to rewatch.RATING: 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best Spider man film this far!,"This film reminded me why i love Spider man, Tom Holland es very good in this role as Peter Parker and Spider man both, i felt a connection with him and to all the things that happened to him during the film. This is just a teenager trying to make a difference and save the world from the evil villains that are present in his area.The movie has some very good performances, good chemistry between all the characters including the main villain. Is energetic, is very funny, has some very breath taking action sequences, and i think that most of Spider man fans will be very satisfied with this film.Is not flawless, has some issues like, there is this one character that if i were the director of this film, i just put this character at the end of the movie and not during the entire film, because in some scenes is annoying, in some scenes this character is very funny, but in my opinion is unnecessary to have this person in the entire run time of Spider man: Homecoming. There are some scenes in this movie that there not that interesting and i was like ""can we see Spidey again? this is kind of boring"".

Title: Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) - A Spectacular Journey of Growth and Responsibility.,"The narrative and character development of this is very parallel to the one of Batman Beyond. They both share similar beats; the importance of the person beneath mask, the technological advancements in their retrospective worlds, and delve into the legacy of their predecessors, that being Tony to Peter and Bruce to Terry, both striving for their acceptance, living up to their legend and learning to find their own paths as a hero. Amusing considering Beyond was created in the late 90's to appeal to a teenage audience and be much similar to Spider-Man.A very refreshing watch however, wether that be the refreshing story approach, abandoning the need for a third live action origin, the grounded characters, with Micheal Keatons's Vulture sticking out the most for me... as well as the grounded narrative, showing a superhero plot doesn't always require a world ending threat to tell a compelling story.I love the 90's coming of age aesthetic and the nuance that Watts brought throughout this.

Spider-Man Hit or Miss?,"Many will say Marvel have hit the mark once again and in some ways they have. This movie most likely will appeal to many and especially to the younger Marvel universe fans. Unfortunately for myself I just found Mark Holland's Spider-Man annoying, which was a disappointment because he nailed Spider-Man in the Avengers. Too be fair Mark's acting has little to do with the character being annoying. I guess I found Spider-Man's witty banter to miss the mark and the way Jon Watts chose to film the movie from the view of a mobile phone, fell flat for me. Still an ok movie it has a solid storyline and some greats action scenes, Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Stark yet again but I think for my liking Mark Holland's Spiderman really needs the whole team behind him to make his witty remarks work other wise it just becomes too much.

Where we all wanted him to be,"Everyone seemed to like the Tobey Maguire 'Spiderman' trilogy (although less said about 'Part III' the better), some people were okay with the Andrew Garfield reboot, but then all five films came along before Marvel's 'shared universe' really kicked off. As soon as it became 'the norm' to see Captain America crossing over with Iron Man, Thor and the like, everyone wanted to see their favourite web-slinger swinging alongside them. However, it seemed that there was one force more powerful than a thousand Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Thanos - studio film rights. Sony held the rights to Spiderman, rather than Disney, so, after much wrangling, it was decided that Sony would allow Disney to include him into their 'shared universe' (hence creating the 'Homecoming' part of the title). And the result is pretty good.At least the film-makers were aware that, seeing as we've already had two 'origin stories' in a matter of years, most of us are already aware of how teenager Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and it gave him superpowers (plus he had a kind of extended cameo in 'Captain America: Civil War' to remind us all of his roots). So they don't waste any time with how he came to be and we join him already 'webbing' local muggers around his home city of New York.
I think out of all the Marvel films in this current batch, 'Spiderman Homecoming' seems the most designed 'for kids.' It's predominantly about teenagers and I would say its primary audience would be pre-teens. That could be a criticism, if it wasn't for the fact that it's one of those rare filmic beasts that can also be enjoyed by adults, whether you're heavily into the MCU or just casually aware of it.It's worth noting that if there's one weak point the MCU has, it's lack of decent villains (excluding Loki and Thanos, of course). Therefore, not only do they get (former awesome Batman himself) Michael Keaton as the villain, but they give him some half decent motivation for his actions - he was a contractor employed by New York council to clear up the debris left by the alien attack which the Avengers thwarted, only for him to lose the deal after investing heavily in it. This makes him no fan of Iron Man and co! Now Spidey has a feeling that he's about to start selling weapons based on alien tech to the highest bidder, regardless of the cost to human life.Of course, having Spidey in the Marvel universe wouldn't be worth doing unless we could have some decent cameos from other superheroes and who better to add in than everyone's favourite billionaire, Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Naturally, Robert Downey Jr is excellent, even in small doses, but, more importantly, adds a much-needed sense of a 'bigger world' at work for Peter Parker to exist in. And who doesn't like seeing Iron Man and Spiderman teaming up to fight side by side? Tony Stark also acts as a kind of mentor/Uncle Ben figure to our young hero, further helping to do away with repeated backstory.There's obviously a great deal of special effects needed to show the destruction caused by flying fighters and teenagers swinging all over well-known monuments, so expect plenty of CGI. However, it's certainly improved a lot since the first Sam Rami Spiderman movie where the effects looked more like cut scenes from a Playstation game. Here, much of Spidey's movements almost look natural (almost, I'm being generally forgiving).Overall, 'Spiderman Homecoming' is a worthwhile addition to the MCU. It's certainly the most 'happy go lucky' of all the colourful films and hopefully Sony will release some of Spidey's other characters who they also own the rights to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Return to Form for Spidey,"This was a surprisingly good addition to the Spider-Man mythos. The third on-screen iteration of Spider-Man, the sixth Spider-Man movie, and the first time Spider-Man is a part of the MCU (aside from his involvement in ""Captain America: Civil War""), this film brought some really neat stuff to the table.Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is much more suited to be Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield, who was too much of a jock. Like Tobey Maguire, Holland really brings a relatable vulnerability to Peter Parker, and he really seemed to be having fun as Spider-Man. I thought that the new things they did with the Spidey suit were really cool and interesting.Michael Keaton as The Vulture proved to be an excellent villain. He's a much better villain than any of the baddies from the two ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films. He's a fairly compelling character, and Keaton managed to make him very convincing.The action sequences are very well done. I particularly liked the sequence where Spider-Man had to stop the elevator from crashing and the ferry scene.It also has a solid supporting cast. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man as usual, Aunt May was good, and I also really enjoyed Peter's best friend Ned.The film does have some issues, though. The pacing at times can feel very off, and I didn't find Liz, Peter's crush, to be that interesting of a character. There are also some instances where the humor falls a bit flat.However, I still really enjoyed this movie overall.

I'm more of a DC fan myself and I've never really understood the big deal about Spiderman, oh sure he can swing from place to place and have super strength which is fine but what else can he do? Anyway the new spidey is played by Tom Holland who I had hadn't heard of and he's British, those Brits fooled me again gosh darn it. He plays Spiderman/Peter Parker who is a freshman in High School and he's trying to deal with being a teen, doing homework, girls and oh yeah being a secret superhero who's trying to proof himself to Tony Stark/Iron Man who is played by Rodney Downey Jr who claims he's not playing the role anymore after Avengers Infinity Wars but frankly I don't believe him because he loves the role. Tom/Spiderman is trying to prove to Tony/Iron Man that he can join the Avengers but Tony feels he's not ready and to be patience but he's a teenagers their not patience believe me. I have one in the house who is 13 who is so impatience it's annoying. Kids these days.Michael Keaton plays the bad guy Vulture which is not to my liking. I'm not use to him playing the villain he's Batman for goodness sake but he played Vulture with a tough exterior of the character and not to mess with him or get in his way.Now I'm just going say it but that girl Zendaya who played Michelle was ANNOYING. Oh my God I wanted to smack her and say ""Dude your jokes aren't funny, go away and bother someone else."" but I can't cause I wasn't in the movie BUT if I had been it would have been funnier than her lame behind.

And Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan annoyed me too but not as much as Zendaya.The special effect of the movie were great. I wish I could fly around the city instead of using my feet but I'm not spiderwoman. I thought the script was a bit played out, I mean typical kid who is a superhero having problems with school, women and oh defeating the world.

'Spider Man: Homecoming' Movie Review,"'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' is, in summary, an enjoyable and lighthearted movie that I had fun watching.The incarnation of Spider-Man has endured much throughout the ages. Originated in 1962 by Stan Lee, Peter Parker, an everyday high-schooler from Queens, defied earlier concepts of comic heroism by being particularly young, pure, and innocent. And his commercial success was evident; becoming one of the highest grossing comic book heroes in Marvel history. Inevitably, several film adaptations were planned, the most significant being a 2002-2007 trilogy featuring Tobey Maguire.These films are known for being shamefully lighthearted and fun, and focused on Peter Parker's steady character arc as he continually struggles with the identity and purpose of a hero. Rather than an angsty, troubled, tortured, hero, we received one with undeniable hope. The trilogy, while generally liked, is often cited for being too juvenile and simplistic. I think that, while a bit simplistic, these movies captured the general essence and innocence of Peter Parker and his growth as a hero.After these films had overstayed their welcome and became steadily worse, The Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 and its sequel of 2014 starred Andrew Garfield. These were noticeably edgier, darker, and more adult-like. The first film was welcomed to relatively warm reception, namely for Garfield's performance, which, as Tom Charity of CNN writes, ""...combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ...immediately appealing...""In contrast, the second installment, released 2014, is known as the downfall of a theatrical Spider-Man for its, as Rotten Tomatoes puts it, ""unfocused narrative and an overabundance of characters.""Spider-Man: Homecoming is a different, lighter, and better variation on the Spider-Man story. Rather than focus on aspects of Peter Parker we are already familiar with, it introduces and implements something unique and its own. The story itself blends just enough high-school pettiness and superhero shenanigans to make it a healthy balance so Peter Parker's purpose as Spider Man remains dominant. The problems I had with it, if any, was its reluctance to deal with the consequences of Parker's often reckless actions.Each character, namely Parker and the villain, Toomes, are developed near perfectly so both's motivations and intents are clear. It is easy to sympathize, or at least empathize, with both of these figures forced to extremes by a continually evolving world. Toomes is an everyman with a general hate for the rich and powerful, Parker is a superhero wannabe trying to please a figure of power and wealth. And the side characters have character, but not enough to control the story or completely steal the spotlight from these two.The film in terms of physicality is what you expect from Marvel films. Usually compelling visuals that often propel the story to higher standards. It may not hit you immediately, but the music, lighting, visuals, and cinematography all play a crucial part in delivering the emotion for a scene.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Homecoming, while an imperfect film, is preferable to prior interpretations.

Great Teachers Praise Mistakes,"Sometimes heroes need to go to school. Training wheels need to be attached to their suits, and handlers double as moody nannies. Peter has been called up to the minor leagues, but that is not where he wishes to conclude his ascent. Trading in a mashup hoodie for a technologically perplexing epidermis, he must learn to drive a sports car without even a permit.The world's most dominating man, Tony, has taken a fatherly affinity to Peter, yet will never show too much admiration. Peter's success becomes more and more connected to Tony's, and a symbiosis develops between the two prodigies. As with any working relationship, conflicts flare up that risk identities and shelters of unassuming bystanders.Latching on to the first target in sight, Peter stumbles upon the most successful Robin Hood in the game. Adrian justifies his operation by capitalism, the cruel chess match that has allowed the insensitive to rise, and the burdened to plummet. His family offers a full-proof alibi for his shady business exchanges.Peter desperately attempts to be seen, while Adrian meticulously digs below the surface. This faceless rivalry will give the orphan child yet another father. The lessons sound eerily similar to Tony's punishments, and Peter's conscious begins spiraling. His hero funds violence probably more so than this hastily chosen villain.Aging requires compromises. Growing into your place in the world will make you sacrifice even the sturdiest pillars of your morality. Peter foresees this ugly metamorphosis and challenges the tides. Nothing can buy his allegiance, a trait that Tony becomes most proud of in the young maverick.In an era of shameless self-promotion and needless crossovers, the humble tale of a blossoming superhero washes down rather pleasantly. No horrific casualties loom in the balance. The highest stakes is that some billionaire might lose money he can afford to lose, and a young gun faces a dilemma of remaining loyal to his cause. Lines are never clearly drawn, and so compassion for one's foe might be the only route to salvation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Sadly ended up being nothing short of forgettable and feeling more like a Disney Channel exclusive than a Marvel cinematic film.,"Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place post Captain America: Civil War and is predominantly set in Queens but therein lies the problem. While we are very used to seeing Spidey swing around New York City, this change of scenery reducing him to being a glorified neighbourhood watch is hardly exciting. Action sequences were few and far between and the hum drums of Peter Parker's life (although crucial to any Spider-man story) were overemphasised and less than tolerable.While many are heralding this film for its smaller scale and homeliness, it felt like these very facets were lugging the story down from progressing at a faster pace. The parallels between Peter Parker and his alter-ego were felt on screen in that the tone and pace changed each time he donned the mask and switched back to a being a dramatic piece when we resumed with Parker's life. With a run time of 2 hours and 13 mins, these lulls were felt and boredom often crept in. Tony Stark popped up numerous times as Peter Parker's guiding light and while these scenes were welcomingly entertaining in that they gave true insight into character of Peter Parker, the follow-up scenes of Parker just living his high school life and obsessing over being in Tony Stark's good books often pulled the handbrake on the main plot.In Homecoming, Peter Parker is merely 16, considerably younger than his previous on-screen renditions. It must be said that Tom Holland at 21 years of age plays a brilliant Spider-Man, but as a 16 year old, the older more mature versions of the character are sorely missed. This creative decision to have such a young Spider-Man snag the interest of a younger audience in an already aging fan-base (seeing as how Guardians of the Galaxy does the opposite by hitting the sweet spot for 80s and 90s kids) stinks of Disney's meddling and honestly has potentially ruined Spider-Man's Marvel Cinematic Universe debut. As the film panders to the 12–16 audience in the cinema, it simultaneously tries to satisfy the adult audience only to end up with a tonally jumbled quirky mess that is neither here nor there and almost devoid of humor despite its numerous attempts.Action sequences in Homecoming boil down to about 4 major events which all things considered on paper shouldn't be an issue as Iron Man only had a handful of action as well. Although the action sequences are well executed and high-budget enough, they sadly don't stand out among Spider-man's predecessors. Except for the climax, most of the action sequences are small scaled. This only played further into how this film felt more like the safe and calculated decisions of a straight-to-TV film rather than a feature. As far as the climatic boss-fight of the film goes, as interesting and action packed as it was, by that point you're driven to a point of boredom that it is sadly too little too late.Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and even Marc Webb's double presented us with plenty of memorably iconic scenes. From Spider-Man grabbing Mary-Jane and dodging a slow motion car hurtling through a coffee shop to dodging clock pieces being hurled by an eight-armed Doc Oc on a building facade, these are just some of the Spider-Man action sequences that remain memorable and entertaining. Homecoming on the other hand disappointingly fails to stand out and take its place beside its predecessors given its smaller scale. Given the fact that an origin story was avoided in this film, the excuse that it is the first of a long series is not one that I think can apply to this instalment.It was a major controversy when Donald Glover (who was used as a model for a ethnic Spider- man revamp) campaigned to be the new Spider-Man and was denied the role. While Glover does appear in Homecoming in an under-utilised cameo, the suspected reason as to why he did not get the role of Spider-Man was probably because Spider-Man is traditionally white. Mary- Jane on the other hand, is now a brunette woman of colour as opposed to the traditional redhead that we have grown accustomed to. I wonder why if Spider-Man cannot be black, Mary- Jane instead can be ethnic. While I personally have no issue with an ethic Mary-Jane, I have always been of the view that changing genders and ethnicities in this way is a lazy attempt to change what is traditionally canon instead of revamp the source material (as has been done in the Marvel camp recently Thor is now female in the comics and justifiably so). Instead of forcing the illegitimate change of a character in this manner, it is far more credible to write in a new character from the source material like Donald Glover's Spider-Man. Better yet, the studio could have easily written a new character which is birthed from her on-screen appearance much like Harley Quinn's origin was from the Batman Animated Series as opposed to a comic book.Ultimately, the final issue with Spider-man: Homecoming is the issue of canon. Not even going into the fact that Peter Parker is basically using a wonder-suit akin to Iron Man's with webs, the essence of Spider-Man was forgotten. Throughout Homecoming we see this version of Peter grovelling to Tony Stark to take a seat at the table with the Avengers. But, honestly, a true Spider-Man wouldn't care less given the string by which his life is already hanging on. With an already full plate of crime-fighting, school, a crumbling relationship with a girl way out of his league, his photography job for the Bugle, and putting in face time with an already suspecting and lonely aunt, the praise of another hero is hardly his concern. Yes, I understand that a 16- year-old would only relish to play with the big leagues but it felt like Homecoming, in dwelling on this, missed the bigger picture.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spider man comes of age,"The basic story line is that after the Avengers gig, Spidey is mentored by Tony Stark, who effectively ignores him and lets him just be a normal kid.Except for giving him a new suit. When a new villain emerges, Spidey has to deal with him, but in so doing messes up enough that he losses the suit, and has to prove himself without it. This nicely meshes Iron man into the story as a mentor, and obviously sets up closer work for Spidey with the Avengers in the future. But it also stands alone as Spidey comes of age having to make tough choices. Well acted, with some good light heartedness fromSpidey, but also his school buddy,. This ages down Spidey - from older to younger teen - than some of the other version, but works well anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Just brilliant,"Everything is enjoyable and believable. Other than Ned's suspiciously adept hacking skills, and the timeline establishment at the start, I loved everything about this movie. I felt every emotional beat, I was supporting every heroic endeavour, and I was always on the verge of laughing if not already chuckling throughout almost the entire runtime. I love Holland as both Peter and Spider-Man, I was so behind his flawed ambition to be his best as a hero. If there's one thing that's not necessarily missing, but will arise as the story progresses, will we ever get to see the Peter who really struggles? Who is pulled in every direction but always gives his all to help people? Whether we get that or not, this movie absolutely deserves so many watches. Get into it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

In fact, they complicate it more.A heartfelt and funny take on the tiresome web-head, Marvel's first cinematic crack at their own mascot not only breathes new life into the wise-cracking wall-crawling but also raises the bar with superior performances, a cohesive script and spectacular CGI.Incidentally, any adult super-villain who hits the underage Spider-Man can be arrested for child abuse.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman for the modern age,"I really didn't fancy going to see Spider-Man: Homecoming but with there being no football at the moment and my youngest pestering me to go , I succumbed . I haven't really been into Spider-Man since the cartoon TV show of the seventies and with all the changes of lead actors I wasn't holding out great hope but I was pleasantly surprised. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter Parker returns home under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark . Parker tries to fall back into his normal daily routine—distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man—but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, he finds that there is a massive conflict between his Spidey life and his private life. Tom Holland is excellent as the new Spider-Man. He's playing a 15 year old Peter Parker and that will definitely appeal to the kids. In fact the whole film feels like it's aimed at the younger market. There is less death and destruction than a usual Avengers movie ( and this IS an Avengers movie) and more references to what teenagers are into. Some of the special affects are amazing especially one scene where Spider-Man climbs up the Washington Monument ( great in 3D) also a scene on a ferry. It could do with half an hour being shaved off of it but I think that of most Marvel films . Not Bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best Spider-Man movie so far,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a MCU movie and if you are familiar with other titles, you can imagine how this movie works.
Part of becoming a hero is skipped and it's a big plus, since we know it already and seen it thousands of times. The movie shows that expectations about being superhero may differ from reality and that makes Spider-Man a bit different from other superhero movies.
Since Spider-Man is a 'teen' in this movie, Tom Holland act like one and he does a great job. Making Spider-Man younger again didn't make movie childish. Of course it's not serious drama movie and you shouldn't expect it from Spider-Man, but the movie can entertain adults just as kids, just because it's not filled with too much fantasy and unbelievable stuff. Jokes fits perfectly and are not overwhelming. If you are looking for fun family movie - this one is probably the best pick from whole MCU movie collection.It's easy to watch, entertaining and filled with good humor- go for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Welcome home Spidey,"In fifteen years, Sam Raimi and Marc Webb have been the only ones favored in adapting the comics of the amazing Spider-Man to live- action movies, one with more notoriety than the other, but, after all, both managed to be entertaining proposals with their dissimilar varieties. Anyhow, the successes didn't last long, causing the retention of Sony's projects to keep on making popcorn movies. Such time of rehab had an expiration date, exactly, until 2015, the year in which the film studio announced, with presumption, the deal with Stan Lee's production studio for bringing back the carefree hero from Queens, something that amazed both fans and Marvel Studios logical chronology as to the introduction of new characters, who will soon be present in the magnanimous American epopee par excellence, at least we hope that. The first step, Holland signing up, then Watts, later an extravagant number of screenwriters, Keaton as an antagonist, Michael Giacchino usual adding and the predisposed tools by the studio allowed the coming of the first great adventure of Spidey after his extremely short glance in the film of Russo brothers, ""Civil War"". And we're in luck, since its director takes the overblown mold of summer film away, in order to manufacture a coming-of-age movie portraying the day by day of one of the most well-liked and beloved superheroes of the MCU in a fascinating way.The script doesn't endure the consequences of the American trend focused on saturating plot construction of screenwriters, here, idea assortment works wonderfully, endowing this origin story with a brand-new, flippant, jovial and even original air; a ""Deadpool"" for teens. The base argument benefits by omitting info that should already be general culture for any connoisseur of the character— Uncle Ben's death and the transmutation from human to hero thanks to the spider venom, besides the succession of situations as funny as suggestive that will keep you on the edge of your seat, either by struggles or chases, jokes or dramas or, specifically, certain twists that lead to an enthusiastic and novice thriller atmosphere of thriller throughout the third act. The artistic performance of the sequences is on target, not as mega-maniac and grandiloquent as previous studio movies, however, ""Homecoming"" doesn't appeal to big things, it's a unique and necessary film among so much formality, politics, and honor driven by Captain America and Tony Stark. As for that last man, his appearances, neither eclipse nor shade the main star, without discrediting the importance of his role, he's vital because he's a paternal figure for Parker, teaching him the true meaning of hero, which not only lies in being privileged with extra human powers.For the most avid and purist comic-lovers, the change of appearances, both physical and cultural, of some characters could be fateful, a modernization used in order to tie in with the strong egalitarian movement that becomes meaningful in the film world. Zendaya, Laura Harrier or Jacob Batalon provide the best of their characters, even so, they're not a copy of the original characters, With what they will be blessed, both fanatics and spectators, is fidelity to the circumstances of books, each scene is loaded with references and easter-eggs from Marvel's movies and comics, sublime and drama ones as the catharsis final when Peter is trapped under the rubble. These moments accompanied by vigorous and authentic treatment of the main character. Tom Holland invigorates him with skill, intellect and physical and acting presence, performing the role of a fifteen-year-old boy suffering the vicissitudes of puberty and heroism at the same time.Marvel has been quite criticized for the lack fundamentals and power of antagonists—except Loki from ""Thor"" and (let's hope) Thanos from ""IW""—, a pattern that has been repeated in every film. However, by signing an Oscar winner (""Birdman""), illusions re-emerged and, indeed, they were not in vain. When a movie opens by putting in front the villain and not the hero, denotes the commitment of the studio conceiving Keaton's role, creating the most human and realistic villain of its universe, of course along with his stunning performance. Although his first sightings don't enjoy a strong impact, from the middle of the second act, the actor breaks down the screen, in detail, in the final twist.Visually, ""Homecoming"" has highlighted points in scenes where tension components prevail, such as that sonorous attenuation when he enters in the prom, the inconvenience in the Washington monument or the boat's breakdown. Accepting indie roots of the director, serene nuance would be obvious, so it's not possible to expect artistic displays at the heights of ""Doctor Strange"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", even the visual dullness of the previous installments by Sony. Likewise, we witness that Giacchino's score doesn't stand out at all, of course, leaving aside the classic and glorious Spider Man theme song in the opening, glorifying the logo of the studio. It's noticeable the most measured pace in action sequences with respect to its competitors, however, CGI cessation, protagonist's gymnastic talent, and grateful set pieces are what makes the movie so special.Watts rejoins our beloved Spidey into the cinematic panorama, with the help of a motion picture that enjoys the delights of independent and commercial movie simultaneously, delivering magnetic entertainment, placing Marvel's film far above that fabulous film by Sam Raimi and Alfred Molina. Carefree, hilarious and intriguing, Holland's Spider- Man takes very seriously what he is doing, delivering one of the most loyal films to comics, still being spectacular and fun. Sony already has a vast idea catalog for the Spider - Man universe, hopefully, it won't happen again with their plans what occurred a few years ago. Blessed Marvel!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Solid way to bring Spider-Man in the MCU,"I saw this movie in theatre when it released and i may have watched it again once but i can't remember. I finally got it on bluray lately along a lot of other movies so i watched it again and honestly it still feel as good as back then, but with the same smaller flaws.First of all i enjoy Tom Holland. I know not everyone does, but for me he work very well for Spider-Man. A lot more than Nathan Drake but thats a story for another time.Michael Keaton as The Vulture is a very good vilain. You understand why he does what he does. He can be somewhat ruthless but at the same time, he ain't full on evil. I also like the suit and the mechanical wings, it work very well. It was not a vilain i was familiar with before this movie, and from my understanding he was kinda silly in the comic book, but in this, he was great. The charisma of Michael Keaton obviously play its part.I also liked the AI costume. The MCU by that point was too advanced, especially since this version of the vilain use a lot of technology. It brough good comedy and cool sequences.Now here is the ""flaws"" i want to talk about. Im aware i may get some tomatoes thrown at me for this, but i don't care. Im honest and thats it. You can already feel even in 2017 that this whole ""forced diversity"" of the MCU/Disney was in full force.Flash Thompson was extremely miscasted. He is supose to be a bigger jock bully, now he is a small indian guy in the quiz team? Peter best friend is played by an Asian, his love interest is mulatto, and finally MJ also being black... It kinda felt like white dudes were a minority in this school...Now ""MJ"" well, sure she is not ""Mary-Jane Watson"" in theory but after 3 movies we know a lot more about her and her role for Peter and i just wish the character would had been named completely different. Its like they wanted to change the story but also remind us of the past. Its a bit weird.That said this is minor flaws for me and it does not detract too much for the overall great experience of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Young & hungry to fight crimes!,"No doubt, Tobey Maguire Spider-man is the best. It was also the first modern superhero of the millennium. The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.This story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.Tom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.After seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

some good bits but underwhelming over all,"Spiderman Homecoming is about an unpopular teenage boy called Peter Parker who is secretly the superhero Spiderman. The only person who knows about his secret is Tony Stark who made his suit.Spiderman is played by Tom Holland who plays the role of Spiderman really well. He was very believable and realistic and very funny at times. He was definitely the best part of the movie for me, i think he will be remembered as one of the best Spidermen. I also liked the fact it wasn't the normal Spiderman origin story that everyone already knows about. How his uncle got shot and that made him want to make a difference. That would just be boring. Instead they told a different story but it was still technically an origin story, the film is about Peter wanting to be the best superhero and Tony Stark stopping him and saying he's not ready. The main villain is The Vulture and is played by Michael Keaton who's good and compared to marvels other villains is better, but not anything all that great. There are parts were he's menacing but never all that scary.Now i'll talk about the main negatives. To be honest I actually just thought that the script for Spiderman Homecoming was just a bit poor. There were some jokes that worked but there were also some that just fell completely flat at times. A lot of the good jokes came when Tom Holland was playing Peter Parker, but when he was Spiderman a lot of the quips he was saying felt more cringey then funny. Another problem i had with the film was that although Peter was well written and the vulture also had a good character, almost all the other character were completely uninteresting, especially his love interest who was really boring and also the bully Flash who was just really annoying.Spiderman Homecoming had pros but I felt that the cons out shined them and I was pretty underwhelmed by the film and would say you should just go watch the Sam Raimi ones with Toby Maguire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Another entertaining Reboot.,"Spider-Man Homecoming is the another reboot of the Spider man franchies and it was Very very enjoyable.What makes it enjoyable is the pacing , the pacing is very well done , the elements of the story beautifully unfolds gradually as the story progresses , we see spider-man developing as the movie goes on , battling his lifestyle and his spider-life.Tom holland's acting was actually pretty good it was Definitely better than i could've expected i cannot wait to see more of him as spider man and i do believe that his role was pretty great in this film.The villain was very very good , Michael Keaton was a very very good villain and as a character there are some twists that i'm not going to spoil but this Villain is probably one of the best spider-man Villains ever ( in the movies of course) his suit is the best part about him , his actions towards achieving his goals as a villain is evil and at the same time can be quite reasonable not accounting for his character's twist.There is just some couple of things that bugged me
1st: We didn't see his Rebooted Origin as the same way we did in TASM and that could've made the movie even better , yeah we saw the start of the movie and how the events of Civil war happened and stuff but man i wish they could've showed us the scenes before and when and after he was spider-man but overall not the worst thing ever , and some couple more things like Aunt may's character here could've been explored more like what they did with the previous movies this time they dont really focus about his family's relationship and there wasn't even a single though about uncle ben it would've been cool to see all of that happen in this film but i think they didn't do those because as audience we already knew what those scenes are so it would've been necessary but my take is i Needed those scenes in this because who knows? Maybe they will make the movie better?. And one more thing the ending could've been better. ( the last 10 seconds tho , they were good )Overall A very good adaptation , Robert Downy Jr. Is ICONIC as Iron man definitely a fan favorite character, the whole cast are amazing Zendaya was cool and the whole movie was definitely a joyride and thrilling to watch and i would definitely recommend this. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Fresh New Take on a Timeless Character,"I came in the Spider-Man Homecoming with high expectations as Marvel has put out solid movies despite playing it safe. It has a sense of realism that made it easy to connect to the film and its themes. I was not disappointed. The film thrives as it focuses on a young Peter Parker who is still struggling with finding his place as a young hero. His journey contains trials that would be found at the age of someone in high school which he has to also balance with his responsibilities of having powers too. The film is paced well and Tom Holland portrays the role of Peter Parker with a certain charisma that most viewers will enjoy. Michael Keaton is also very versatile in his villain role with his compelling acting. The supporting characters did well alongside Tom, and watching Zendaya's role was especially entertaining as she is not in the movie that much but delivers some of the better lines in the film. Overall, the film plays it safe, but is a much more fresh take on the Marvel formula then films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange. I would definitely recommend that you give it a watch as it is one of the stronger films to come out this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Its nice and well done,"After seeing this film I didn't come out saying that it was the greatest film ever or the best one in the MCU, but instead saying this a a very cool take and also a very different take on the Spider Man character. Marvel defiantly understands Spider Man and understands his history and who he is supposed to be and I really felt that hear. It was nice to watch a Spider Man movie where the main actor really does feel like a kid who is just trying to survive life. And that much alone I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun.The Vulture played by Micheal Keaton is also a very good villain for Peter Parker to face. The guy is truly scary and truly threatening as well and that was something I really enjoyed about the film. With most MCU films the villains are pretty meh for the most part, so it was nice to see a villain who was scary and made your worry for the hero's life. That was a definite positive. Also the fact that the villain didn't hurt the rest of the movie was good to. Cause Guardians had a good villain too but sadly it hurt the rest of the movie.I also really enjoyed the Zendaya's character. I thought she was really charming and really funny too. She was a great and very interesting character to me who I defiantly enjoyed when she popped up on screen. There is also a twist with her character that I won't spoil.Overall while not one of my favorite movies in the MCU I still had a good time. I had a lot of fun with it and would defiantly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Iron-Boy has nothing to lose and does not learn anything,"Unfortunately, Iron-Boy does not have an emotional fall. The only thing he seems to have to lose is his internship. With his impulsive, thoughtless action, he endangers a ship full of people and everything that Iron Man criticizes: ""If you are nothing without the suit, then you do not deserve it."" As if the suit was more important than all these human lives.So his motivation is just that he doesn't lose his cool outfit and that the bad guys don't get guns ...
In the end he acts just as carelessly and impulsively again, but by chance or luck he wins this time, learns nothing from his weaknesses in character and what he wins is an even cooler Iron Spider outfit? This is more like leveling and looting in a video game, but not character development.New York is actually part of Spider-Man's character, but doesn't seem to play a big role for Iron-Boy here.Michael Keaton unfortunately gets far too little screen time and is hardly remembered as a villain.In general, all characters are very one-dimensional.I'm missing the basic elements of the Spider Man character, so this movie is just an uninteresting Iron Boy spin-off.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Don't mess with that teacher. She's been to prison...,"That's Flash?! He looks like more of a nerd than Peter.Is the Head of the Class: The New Class? ""That is false""... Fantastic line! I give this movie 4 stars just for that joke.Love Ned's questions, but I would be really annoyed if I were Peter, but hey, his carelessness means he has to keep Ned on his side.Just because it is ""Captain America's Fitness Challenge"" does not make it any less lame.Who is this ""your lame"" girl? I bet she knows who Peter is.Ned's hat is cool. I'd war that.Don't do it Peter! Party on a school night!? Outrageous! ""Get in some light protesting"" :) Bad move letting Siri choose your web-shooter default.Michael Keaton is taking this bird obsession too far.Twist! Nice cover story Ned.Washing his hands :) Great end Aunt May.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great spider-man movie,"I thought here we go again with another reboot but to be fair it was really good, I enjoyed it, great cast and story, with great effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Second view,"The movie wasn't better for me for second time, maybe even a little worse. It is true that this is a little younger Spiderman, so he is dealing with problems at school and obligations that the average high school student has. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so ""light"" and fun. A lot of it was just fine or mediocre for me. The big influence of MCU is visible, so the film looks like one episode, it bothers me personally. I also see how they made a setup for some things that didn't develop in that direction later, I mean certain bad guys. Some of the characters who are near Spideman did not like me because of the choice of actors. Of course, this is a purely subjective opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good Spiderman,One of those movies you have to give time. I struggled in the first half but it really picked up and kept going in the last half.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman homecoming review,"Spider-Man: Homecoming Reviews
Unlike previous Spider-Man films that typically focused on the origin story, this version skips over Peter
being bitten by a spider and the loss of Uncle Ben. Instead, it focuses on Peter's teenage life and his
struggle to prove himself. The film has the atmosphere of a high school teen movie, featuring friendships,
romance, and typical teenage problems, blended with superhero action.Although the fight scenes are entertaining, they are not as grand as those in The Avengers or Captain
America. Some viewers might feel that the movie leans too much into Peter's teenage life. However,
despite not having the most spectacular action sequences in the MCU, its strong storyline, well-developed
characters, and excellent chemistry between the actors make it one of the best Spider-Man films.The performances in Spider-Man: Homecoming are one of the highlights that elevate the film from just an
action movie to a blend of fun and depth in character development, which keeps the audience engaged
throughout the story. Every actor plays an important role and does an excellent job of making their
character interesting and memorable.Peter Parker / Spider-Man

Civil War.Performance: He naturally portrays an ordinary teenager who must bear the responsibility of being a hero.His enthusiasm and playfulness as a high school student are well-executed. The emotional scenes,

makes the audience see his perspective. Tony Stark / Iron Man

Although his screen time is limited, every scene carries weight and reinforces his role as Peter's ""mentor.""

"Average, but so much potential","OK, I've read so many different reviews of this, however it is simply your standard Super Hero flick (at least these days they're better than your average film).As far as spider-man movies go, its probably 3rd (after Spiderman 1&2). However this could've been soooo much more. For teenagers, its probably amazing, but for those who actually like spiderman and know things about him, its annoying as hell.Peter parker is a bit of a whiney tween. He's not the quick witted smart mouth spidey we all know and love.Other annoying things:Flash Thomson is apparently a chubby Indian kid? I mean why? - What is the point of the fat Chinese kid? - Apparently Happy is just there to bea d*ck - Tony could've avoided the whole ferry fiasco with 1 sentence: ""I told the feds, leave it with them"" - Apparently you can not only fight but breath on top of a plane travelling 500mph?Its decent, not great, but entirely forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
