"Stylish, unique and intense","You either love it or you hate it. That's really the effect of any great twist. I was one of those who absolutely loved it and found this creepy, disturbing movie even more terrifying with the reveal. Vera Farmiga (Conjuring) stars as a mother whose just gone through a miscarriage and with her husband played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key) decides to adopt a mysterious young girl played by a very creepy Isabel Fuhrman (Hunger Games). At first Esther seems a little off but it's mostly acceptable until people begin having horrific accidents and some go missing. There is a palpable sense of dread that builds throughout the film and so many setpieces are expertly executed. The scene in the playground is an especially effective one. The film culminates in a surprising and edge of your seat fashion and all though there's a small loop hole here and there. Its completely successful at being a stylish, unique, intense piece of genre.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One word - Impressive,"Every once in a while a film seems destined to slip under the radar either by poor promotion or a trailer that makes the viewer go ""meh"". Orphan is one of those flicks that, while benefiting from a decent studio push, simply didn't impart any compelling reason to check it out based on the trailer, which is too bad because this is actually one tight little thriller.Directed by Spain's Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax), it tells the story of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a 9-year old Russian orphan who is adopted by Kate and John Coleman (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) , a decision motivated in part by the stillborn birth of their third child.An oddball from the start, Esther at first charms the Colemans with her personality, artistic flair, and independence, however it's apparent that there's more going on with Esther than meets the eye. She quickly forms a bond with Max (Aryana Engineer), the couple's deaf daughter, by learning sign language, but is resented by their son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) who views her with contempt. All of which forms a basis for familial tension, further compounded by the skeletons of Kate's history of alcoholism and John's past infidelity.Telling a surprisingly layered story that strays into uncomfortable territory given how it deals with children in peril, the shiniest gem in this entertaining nugget is that of Isabelle Fuhrman, upon whose performance the movie succeeds or fails. While acting is uniformly top notch throughout, Fuhrman spectacularly establishes herself as one of the most remarkable young talents currently working in cinema, and that's a statement not to be taken lightly. This 12-year-old, who had only one prior film credit on her resume, simply blazes her way across the screen in a performance that ranges from sweet to seductive to psychotic. This is her movie and she makes the most of it, and if she doesn't mature into one of Hollywood's premier stars, I'll be most surprised.Orphan won't win any awards (despite Fuhrman's impressive performance) and might well get passed over by many based on the trailer, all of which is too bad because this is one stray that movie audiences would do well to adopt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I enjoyed much of this but there were a few silly moments,"I enjoyed much of this but there were a few silly moments and I feel if the film had been cut down to 90 minutes we could have got rid of those embarrasing bits and made the whole ting tighter. The acting is fine, especially the two girls and that of Isabelle Fuhrman, who at times seems to be carrying the film, is remarkable. Inevitably, perhaps there are unfortunately those times, as in 'gas lighting' films where we sit frustrated urging those on screen to notice the obvious to no avail and then on we go as everything gets more and more embroiled.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Esther is one bad Mother F!,"We've seen Orphan many times before (The Bad Seed, The Good Son and, of course, The Omen), yet, somehow, Jaume Collet Serra manages to squeeze something fresh out of an old tale.There's plenty of shocks and also some laughs and Esther's ""secret"" is, surprisingly, original.Orphan doesn't hold a candle to the aforementioned films, but its better than the more recent ones like Joshua (which, coincidentally, Vera Farmiga also starred in, as well as having the same role (mother)).Don't let the trailer fool you into thinking this is just another ""evil kid"" movie. Its really much more than that. This is definitely one of the better horror films to come along these days.My audience loved it, and so did I.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally a GOOD HORROR FILM. Good film period.,"Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised "" Esther's secret"" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the ""secret"" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a ""creepy"" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well Made, Well Acted, Surprisingly Great Horror-Thriller!","Orphan REALLY surprised me. I expected some stupid pg-13 movie that somehow got an R rating. That was not the case. Let me tell you, Orphan is very disturbing at parts, and pretty gruesome. The movie overall is excellent, has some great acting, an amazing script, and excellent execution. The movie really has a lot of suspense and the twist is pulled off very well and packs a big punch to the viewer.The best thing the film has is the script. What Esther does to the family is brilliant. The movie also has several sub-plots that work very well in the movie and add some complexity to the whole thing. The sub-plots never feel like too much, because they are very subtly put in there.Overall, if you are tired of bad horror films, and want to see a very intelligent and well made film, i would suggest this. Or if you just want to see a great movie see this! I was very surprised at how excellent this movie turned out, and everyone else will be too! Seriously, if you want great, check it out! 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Remarkably well-acted, darkly humorous, and effectively disturbing","Dark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, and blackly comic - one of the best ""evil child"" films I've seen. It's brilliantly cast - Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet- Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch, but 12- year-old Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying, chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography, editing, and sound are fantastic as well.I saw Orphan at a packed advance screening and the audience had a blast. Collet-Serra knows how to pull the strings and engage the audience, as they were screaming and laughing at all the right moments. There are plenty of fun and playful tension-relieving scenes, and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers. When the credits rolled the audience even applauded.The second showing I went to was just as receptive - the audience went nuts. They were collectively screaming, cheering, yelling at the screen, cringing, applauding, and enthusiastically welcoming the comic relief. One guy commented afterwards: ""I never get scared by movies but that was the scariest movie I've ever seen."" Audience participation for both screenings I went to were very high.The film improves upon second viewing, with the knowledge of the twist. I was able to focus more on details and clues, and the anticipation of my favorite scenes made for a much more rewarding experience. It's even more chilling and cathartic the second time around.It's far from perfect though - there are way too many predictable jump/false scares, with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. The last part of the movie becomes a slasher flick replete with clichés and a one-liner. There is a talky scene where Esther reveals herself to her adoptive mother that is totally unneeded, as well as a crucial line regarding Danny, the older son, which really should've been cut. It's also a bit long at 2 hours - for an exploitative ""B"" movie this is unusual, although time is devoted to character development. Esther is multi-dimensional and even sympathetic at times - I would love to see a prequel based on her character.Orphan is definitely not for kids - aside from the ""anti-adoption"" angle, there is plenty of dangerous imitable behavior. The violence committed by and toward children is shocking, realistic, and brutal. This is a ballsy film that throws kids into horrific ordeals.It may be a ""B"" movie, but it's a damn good one that knows its audience. The basic idea is nothing new (except for the unexpected twist), but you knew that from the trailer and synopsis. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichés and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills, you'll have a fun time. The phenomenal child performances alone are enough to recommend Orphan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Overall very indulging, and well done thriller.","""Orphan"" was a movie that truly did surprised me. I mean I came into this movie honestly not having any idea which direction it would take me, I mean sure it looked good, but then again the 30 second previews made it seem a bit mediocre. When the movie went off I was very pleased by what I had seen. The things I love most about Orphan is how they present and introduce these characters so well. The minute I saw the main couple I couldn't help but take a liking to them, and Esther who very easily steals the show, is incredibly likable. As a matter of fact the thing I do love a lot about the film is how they take their time in the story, I loved how for the first half or so you see Esther adapting to her new surroundings, and I became extremely indulged into this. I also think they balanced out the character of Esther well. I mean this performance, and character, could have easily been portrayed as this over-the-top, annoying, non-intimidating, and non-believable character, but not once do you ever feel that. Also it is very entertaining, and you're hooked from the moment you see this little girl Esther. It was also clever at times, to where you feel a sense of danger as far as the story goes because it's literally like anything can happen. Even if does begin to make you mad for whatever reason, you still can't help but keep watching and wondering. At times it may feel predictable, but they've already presented these characters so well, that you can't but feel that maybe you haven't predicted it. I will say I wished ""Orphan"" HAD paced itself a little better, I mean they don't immediately jump into the story, but when they do it feels rushed and as if they fear the audience won't care about the characters, when it's not true. Also towards the end the characters start to lose liking, so much so that I couldn't help but look at these characters(in particular the mom and dad) and say ""Who are you, and why are you being such an unlikable stereotype!"" As a result of the characters acting stupid and stereotypical at this point in the film it just became predictable to an extent where you knew what was going to happen. Last you know I don't know how I felt about the twist, it was done well enough to where it would fit the storyline, but I feel it defeats the shocking, brutal, and thrilling nature of the film. Anyways, overall ""Orphan"" is one of the better thrillers you'll probably see this year, and even if you're not too big on these kind of films, I still recommend ""Orphan""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A little too long, but very creepy!...","I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, but the write-up did intrigue me slightly so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a little too long for my liking, but quite well made if a little cliché in places. I guess I should have done a little more research, but then again I have uncovered the odd 'gem' this way in the past. But I digress; let's have a look at what Orphan is all about.Kate and John Coleman have just lost their baby, a daughter they were going to call Jessica. She was dead at birth. Needing something to fill the void, they decide to adopt. By the way, they already have two children, a boy, Daniel, and a girl, Max, who is partially deaf and uses sign language to communicate. The family are comfortably off and live in a big house in the countryside. Visiting an orphanage, John meets a nine year old girl called Esther. She is originally from Russia and is delightful. He convinces Kate that she's the one and they bring her home a few weeks later. Unfortunately Esther is not what she seems and the Coleman's are in for a very bumpy ride as she sets about her plan for them. I'm not going to say any more on the plot, I believe that should be enough to intrigue you.Although it was very well made I did have a bit of a problem sympathising with the Coleman's. It seems they have everything going for them in terms of lifestyle, job, financial security etc., but somehow that isn't enough for them. It's not as if their characters come over as particularly nurturing either, Kate a recovering alcoholic and John has been known to have a roving eye in the past. But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all.Decent performances all round, particularly from; Vera Farmiga as Kate, Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were; CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail, Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max.Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt, I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so, the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning, it is a little cliché in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale (glad I watched it in daylight!). Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits, very cleverly done IMO, nice work. I guess over all it's recommended, but only just.My Score: 6.1/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Excellet Horror Thriller,"I have not seen a decent horror film in a long time, but this one is definitely worth the money. Be sure to use the restrooms before the start of the movie, as it is very riveting and suspenseful. Except for one sex scene between the husband and wife, this film can be viewed by mature children accompanied by an adult. It is very well written, and well-balanced. Personally I found this film very entertaining, suspenseful, and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else, this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses, her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly.

Simply A Good Thriller,"I had been reading a lot about this film. Internet rumors made ""Orphan"" sound depraved. Advocacy groups protested that the film is offensive to adoption.

Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are excellent as the parents. The three child actors also do a good job.

A different kind of horror movie,"I don't like horror films, but ""Orphan"" was different. It was written well enough to be able to hold my sense of disbelief and keep me suspensed.In this horror film we actually have characters. Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) have two kids, Daniel and Max, and they all have back-stories that are significant to the film, and they each struggle with who they are and how to grow as individuals and as a family. Then they adopt Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). All we know is that there's something wrong with Esther.Esther greatly disrupts the family's life - with a lot of violence and psychosis. Don't forget this is a horror film. Although that is easy to forget because the plot is driven by characters - perhaps a first for this genre? The characters are integral to a story that was so well researched that it's actually legit. That fact probably makes it even scarier.Even if you don't watch horror films, you could start with ""Orphan"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enough with the false scares already!,"I'm about two thirds of the way through watching this film, and I must say it's really annoying me how the director constantly relies on the technique of using scary music and odd camera angles to build false tension. Then, just when you think something really scary is going to happen, it turns out to be a false alarm.There's a word for this cinematic technique, I forget what it is. Regardless, it's a cheap substitute for using actual story elements to build real tension, and this movie has used up all of my good will by relying on it every couple of minutes.I'm going to watch the rest right now, and something really spectacular will need to happen in order for me to feel good about having watched.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A chilling tale with a memorable performance by the kid,"An American couple in their 30s, who can't get over the tragedy of losing their third child, go ahead & adopt a nine-year old Russian girl, Esther to make up for the void in their lives. In all outward appearances, Esther is a silent, well behaved, responsible, kind & sweet & pretty much the kind of child you would like to have in your life.This is one of the very best 'evil child' films I have seen. Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays Esther, is brilliant with her malevolent characterization as is Aryana Engineer who plays the part of Maxiene. Kate and John Coleman (Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) have given a high calibre performance here. Daniel (Jimmy Bennet) plays their son.Let me be clear, I thought this was going to be a ghost horror film. I never saw that coming. It was a complete shock to me. I haven't been that scared or shocked in quite a while, so this film completely delivers in all aspects. The layers of the story is peeled one by one as the story unfolds by director Jaume Collet-Serra. Although everybody's performances were very good, none stands out long after you have watched this, except Isabelle Fuhrman. This girl delivers a powerhouse performance that will have you scared for quite a while. The other actors only feel like props in front of this girl's brilliance. Aryana who plays the deaf child, Maxiene is also brilliant. The anti-adoption feeling this movie gives you after you have watched it is the only drawback, & it shows it delivers where it wanted to..:) Of course, without all the drama, it wouldn't have impacted this much, so don't watch this expecting a bloodfest. This is a thriller which delivers horror.Watch it, you definitely won't regret it. This is truly a gift to the horror genre.9/10-Girish, 20",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There's something wrong with Orphan,"Yes, as the movie's tagline states, there most certainly is something wrong with Esther. Unfortunately there's something wrong with the movie too. It's a movie which starts out with some real promise but as the story plods along that early promise never really pays itself off. The movie checks in at a clearly excessive 123 minutes, the story simply can't sustain itself over that length of time. Oftentimes the movie has a very formulaic feel to it, there's the sense we've seen this all done before. And we've probably seen it done a lot better. By the time we finally get to the shocking conclusion we just may not be that interested anymore. And the big shock really doesn't work either if you actually spend a moment thinking about it. The whole movie is based on a foundation which is not particularly plausible. Suspended disbelief works to a point I guess but honestly this movie asks us to believe things which quite simply could not happen.The best thing this movie has to offer is the performance of the young actress playing our deeply troubled Esther. Isabelle Fuhrman turns in a wildly impressive, appropriately sinister and almost impossibly mature performance. This is a young actress who almost certainly has great things in her future. Unfortunately much of what surrounds her doesn't work. It's a story about an evil little child who is clearly not what she initially appears to be. What is she exactly? Well that's the revelation we save for the big shock at the end. But this movie spends way too much time getting to its big finish. And again the big revelation really does not stand up to even the most cursory of examinations. But it's just a cheap little horror film so maybe if we don't think about it too much...nah, the movie still doesn't work. Even if you ignore the story's ultimate implausibility the movie still has too many other flaws. It's way too long. There are entirely too many of those standard horror movie false scares and not enough real ones. One of the key characters, Esther's adopted father, comes off as being quite a dunce. Horror movies rely on tension, this movie's tension fizzles out long before the movie finally slogs to an end. By the time the movie's halfway done you're just looking for it to be over. Full marks to young Isabelle Fuhrman for creating a creepy, memorable character. But one good character does not necessarily make a good movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan An Effective Thriller With Some Flaws,"Orphan is an effective thriller with some flaws from director Jaume Collet-Serra whose admirable in making this film about a couple who recently lost their baby adopt Esther an innocent 9 year old girl harboring a dangerous secret. Vera Farminga and Peter Sarsgaard are good as the married couple. Farminga shows all the emotions as Kate Coleman still traumatized over the death of her newborn baby who starts to investigate into Esther's past when strange things start to happen. Sarsgaard is decent as her husband John but I found him to be a bit too gullible when he's falling for Esther's manipulations taking her side over his wife's. Sarsgaard still turns in a good performance though despite not being given much to do. Isabelle Fuhrman is frighteningly effective as Esther the seemingly angelic child who will do anything to get what she wants even manipulate the people around her and murder. Fuhrman keeps you on edge as the villain wondering what she is willing to do next to protect her secret. Well done. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them stand out besides Fuhrman. The film did a nice job of developing most of the characters and the violence committed by Esther was well executed. I thought the pacing was a little slow and there some predictable moments. But other then that Orphan is still a decent thriller which I'm sure will please almost any die hard fan of the genre. The twist near the end I didn't really see coming and it helped to explain why Esther would go to the extremes in order to protect her secret from getting out. Overall this film could've been better but it certainly wasn't the worst I've seen. Orphan has character development, drama, and some suspense which always helps elevate the movie. Plus the exceptional performances by Vera Farminga and especially Isabelle Fuhrman make it worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The only thing that makes it worthwhile to view, is the performance of newcomer Isabelle Furham as Esther, the adopted child of unknown origin, from Russia.Director Jaume Collet Sera is not able to maintain any convincing drama or tension, due to a weak, ineffective screenplay, by David Johnson, which contains several convenient plot points.

Significantly Thrilling and Outstandingly Portrayed,"Orphan, the name says very little for what you get to see in the movie. I watched great horrors/thrillers, this movie with mild brutality and refreshingly thrill creates a great impression on audience pulses. Esther, especially, acted terrific in portraying psychotic behavior and the screenplay was just perfect to make it a picture perfect.Be it, the twists introduced in the plot in the later half of the movie or the realistic resemblance of the whole plot, the movie is worth your buck on the big screen. Though the movie was 2hr long, it was a clever move by the director to inject some meaningful comedy into the movie so as to maintain the attention of the audience. An interesting point to note is that audience laughed quite a bit for almost 60% of the movie and then were shocked as the plot took twists and turns. This combination of humor along with shock is what makes this movie a brilliant thriller.All in all the movie was successful in grabbing my attention, believing in such offbeat concepts and lastly giving the worth of my money. Hope you all go watch this terrific movie and feel the heat inside the Air-Conditioned Theaters. My rating for this movie 7.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Look at the snow orphan—snorphan?  Orphan,"Surprise, surprise, Orphan actually isn't that bad. Who would have thought something that appeared to be a bad rehash of The Omen could truly entertain? I guess the ability to acquire the services of a couple on the cusp of A-list status actors in Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga should have raised an eyebrow, but honestly I still had many reservations. In fact, I knew the ""twist"" before sitting down in the theatre—something that I believe enhanced my enjoyment rather than lessened it. Perhaps this knowledge made the proceedings appear more comical than they should have been and maybe took away from some of the horror aspects, however, it also invested me in the tale to see how the revelation would be discovered. The acting is impressive across the board and the visuals are enjoyable for the most part. I loved the opening sequence bridging reality and dream, as well as the utilization of black light, (hokily alluded to with the opening WB icon), but the fake scares—and there are many—started to anger me a bit.This is not the type of horror I enjoy normally; I tend to gravitate more towards the fantastical or supernatural. That said, though, I understand the gimmicks used and the techniques relied upon. Director Jaume Collet-Serra appeared to want to subvert some preconceptions by giving us multiple instances of slow tracking shots towards a blind spot with music swelling louder and louder only to reveal  nothing. I see what he was attempting—trying to get the audience off guard—but all it ended up doing was making me numb to the moments that actually delivered. Rather than be affected from the ""jump scares"" I was more entertained by the brutal violence utilized. Not many films of this ilk are R-rated these days, so when you do get one, it is somewhat a breath of fresh air. There are some definite pedophilic elements at play, very strong language, (used often to comical effect), and the desire to make what few deaths there are as memorable as possible. I mean, come on, if you have a hammer and a body prone and ready for a whack, why not make sure the deed gets done by smashing away a few extra times? I really bought into the beginning due to the fantastic work on the part of Farmiga. The devastation wrought on her face after a stillbirth is unavoidable. Here is a mother of two that had so much love for her unborn child, she crawled into a shell of depression at the loss, needing an outlet for the pain and bottled up emotions never able to be showered on the child. Her detachment from the family, especially her husband, is evident, as is the pure joy at finding young Esther in the orphanage, thinking that her love could finally be released. Farmiga embodies the role so completely that, if I remember correctly, she instinctively signs ""thank you"", (her daughter is deaf), when leaving the orphanage. The moment has no need for it as her hearing impaired child is at home, but it is definitely something that character would do unconsciously. She is also very good opposite Sarsgaard and his inability to stand by her when the truth about Esther begins to show through. At times it seems he is phoning the performance in, but ultimately he does a good job; maybe he is just overshadowed by his counterpart.Rounding out the acting are two brilliant turns from the youngsters. Aryana Engineer plays Max with professionalism and realism. Deaf in real life, she is amazingly able to portray the fear and anxiety that comes with knowing what her new sister is capable of. Unable to tell anyone, both due to her handicap and the threats on her and the family's lives, she must lie and say everything is okay. But her subtle cowering in fright at the sight of Esther in her door is quite palpable. Speaking of Esther, you can't deny the performance of twelve-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman. The most recent example of what parents are willing to allow their children to do for money, (Sacha Baron Cohen's Brüno would be proud), she is effectively creepy and dangerous in her lack of a moral compass and instinctual need to survive. More robotic and calculated at the start, it is the final act, where her true identity is revealed, that shines. The malice and rage buried beneath an angelic façade is finally out in the open; a master manipulator and seductress, Fuhrman will turn some heads and hopefully have a career before her without being typecast in the genre.Orphan begs to memory the slasher flicks of the 90s like Child's Play rather than the psychological terrors I relate to more. I won't let that deter me from recommending the film to those out for some blood because the talent involved cannot be denied. The script can be very generic at times, yet glimmers of surprise come through every once in awhile. With a ""twist"" that may not be too well hidden, the carnage doesn't stay only with disposable roles like one would expect in a movie such as this. I'll just say that the stars aren't safe from knife work, nor a glimpse at their mortality. In the end, though, it is still nothing more than a good night out for some bloody fun. But, then, when did that become a bad thing?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Where Did The Orphan Come From?,"Jaume Collet-Serra's 'Orphan' may tell a familiar story where a child is portrayed as the antagonist but this one is still fun to which mostly because of the camera-work, the atmosphere and the acting. Collet-Serra does manage to create a tense atmosphere in the wooden residence. The hand-held camera is well used. However, the background score is intrusive at times. The snowy Canadian location is refreshing and cleverly relevant to the story. The story builds up steadily and most of the twists are handled well. Vera Farmiga is terrific as a healing mother whose world is shaken again by a new visitor. Peter Sarsgaard does his best with a formulaic role. Isabelle Fuhrman is adequate. Ariana Engineer is quite amazing. She gives one of the most impressive performances. CCH Pounder is wasted.

Amazing!,"Very good movie one of my favorites. I do not see what to NOT like about this movie and why it does not deserve a 10 rating. Actors were amazing, the plot was completely stunning,the intensity was right up there and the feel of the movie and its story felt life-like. Very well put together and I believe this to be one of my new horror favorites. I would not have expected the twist to be of its kind, and I love how they added a thriller sense that got your blood flowing. Well, in my case it did and the two other person(s) I brought along with me, separate times. I cannot wait until the film comes out because it's definitely a movie I would watch with just about anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
""" Why  does  everyone  else  get  the  benefit  of  a  doubt,  except  me? ""","Adopting a child is often a chance for most parents to fulfill their lost dreams of having children. Of course, this supposes their chosen child will fill the empty void left vacant by their unfulfilled searches. However, not all adopted children turn out to be what the parents sought in the first place. That is the synopsis of this film. The movie is called "" The Orphan "" and is more of a nightmare than a dream come true. The story is of a grieving set of parents who decide to adopt Easter (Isabelle Fuhrman) whom they believe is the 'perfect' daughter. Both the parents began by giving their adopted child all they loving and home environment they have. This works out splendidly for a short while until strange and bizarre events began taking place. Under normal circumstances they would easily be explained, until they begin to form a pattern, That is when Kate (Vera Farmiga) the wife and mother, begins to suspect her adopted daughter is not as innocent as she pretends to be. Despite his daughter's faults, the husband (Peter Sarsgaard) believes it's his wife who is developing a vivid and vindictive attitude towards the child. It's not until Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) informs them their adopted child may not be all she claims to be. The movie is careful to release its restrained suspense until the unfolding drama begins to pour out in torrents, when suddenly everything explodes with dark excitement and runs rampant. Good suspenseful scenes allow the movie to create a frightening deluge for anyone seeking a worthwhile movie. ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gives you what you need,"It's a pretty good horror film we have here. Decent, well acted a nice story. Nothing completely new or ground breaking, imho. Even a twist that has been advertised quite a lot (as I read here), isn't really completely helping (actually it serves more than an excuse, than anything else and therefor was more disappointing than anything to me personally and you might feel the same way).I couldn't decide whether to give it 6 or 7 points in my rating, but decided, that through all the things (quite a few clichés are being used, but in doing so, they make sure to use them properly), this is above average. You might not see it that way and might feel cheated by the ending (the alternate ending on the DVD is really bad though, so it's a good thing they used the one, that is in the film now). The actors do their best, that is for sure. And it looks really nice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Exceptional Thriller with a Deceptive Conclusion,"Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) are rebuilding their marriage after a troubled relationship, since Kate had drinking problem but is under therapy with Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale) and has been sober for one year. Her addiction cost her job; a serious accident with their deaf-dumb daughter Maxine (Aryana Engineer); and the abortion of their stillborn baby Jessica and John had a love affair ten years ago. They decide to adopt a child and when they meet the nine year-old Russian girl Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love for the well-educated orphan. Max becomes close to Esther while her reluctant brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) does not welcome his newcomer stepsister. Sooner Kate feels that Esther is manipulative and has some disturbance and she believes it could be hormone or borderline personality disorder but John refuses to listen to his wife and the wounds in their marriage reopen. Kate calls Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) in the orphanage and the sister advises Kate that Esther had been involved in many troubles in the past. When Sister Abigail visits Kate, Esther kills her with a hammer and is witnessed by the scared Max. When Kate goes further in the investigation of the past of Esther, she contacts the Saarne Institute, a mental hospital in Estonia, and discovers that the girl is not who she tells she is.""Orphan"" is an exceptional thriller and a must confess that while watching this movie, I committed the heresy of comparing it with ""Rosemary's Baby"" to my daughter. Unfortunate the commercial deceptive conclusion is an exaggerated collection of clichés. Kate calls the police while driving back home and hits the house with her car, in the beginning of a sequence of ridiculous scenes. The police arrive late in the usual cliché. Max shoots a gun in the lake nearby the house and no policeman listens. With an appropriate and realistic ending, this movie could have become a new classic of the psychological horror genre. Vera Farmiga has another fantastic performance and Isabelle Fuhrman and the débutant Aryana Engineer are awesome. It is amazing the lack of imagination of formulaic producers, writers and directors that prefer an easy solution with the usual clichés for an intriguing plot instead of daring in an non-commercial ending, like for example, Asians usually do. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Orfã"" (""The Orphan"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror movie I've seen since Scream,"The summary says it all. I was on the edge of my seat from moment one to moment last. I love Esther! She was the coolest bad girl I have seen in years. With the cold steel nerve of a mafia hit-man to the cuteness of ""little miss sunshine"", she was a great ""bad guy"". The movie was well done, the sound was excellent, and the music very powerful. Normally, I hate kid actors, but on every level, this movie was extremely well cast. Of course, the ""twist"" is fantastic, but that is not really the heart of the movie. As others have written, this movie is about character, and each character is well developed. The dynamics between them are real and the problems hey suffer are genuine. The kill scenes are very well done, and the girl who plays ""Esther"" is the best actress I have seen in years. Definitely not for kids though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Exceptional,"Finally, a movie that is good enough to see over and over!! This was an exceptional movie and the girl that played Ester is bound for greatness if she performs this well at such a young age. This is also a very original story line. I thought it would be the typical ""unloved child tries to win all the love"" movie, but it well surpassed that. The opening scene in the movie was convincingly acted. I felt real emotional pain for the mother. Of course, this movie is about a family that adopts a child named Ester. She seemingly wants all of the attention, but goes about getting it in ways that leave someone else looking like they, not her, have done something wrong in this. When the mom feels like something could be wrong, she tries to trace Ester's biology back to Russia so she can find out more about where Ester originated and the influences she had before she came to America. One of the children in the story, Max, is a deaf child. Max is an adorable little girl. Ester uses Max and the fact that she is deaf to her advantage. You don't see the end of the movie coming. It is a huge plot twist. I would call this movie a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Poison Ivy Meets Sleepaway Camp Meets The Good Son,"It has to be noted that since Dark Castle began producing movies, the majority if not being a remake, has been judged purely on the basis of how flashy the visuals have been, two movie that spring to mind have been 'House Of Wax & The Reaping.With this latest slice of Dark Castle horror, we find ourselves in what seems like unfamiliar territory, a movie which is neither a re-imagining or contain any sort of visual trickery, I say this, as I noted that Joel Silver was still at the helm as the main producer, and we all know that he likes his movies to appear on screen as big as like themselves.The story surrounding the family unit whilst not overly original does contain certain key elements that give the scenario some grounding, a distant husband, a wife/mother still coming to terms with the loss of her unborn baby, whilst still trying to remain resolute for her two already existing children, one of whom, a little girl who is deaf.The scene between the mother and daughter, when mother uses sign language to tell the story about the little girl ascending to heaven was quite touching.Of course this being a horror movie, the movie needs to gather apace, so luckily it didn't drag, so we the audience already know that the couple wish to add to their family by adopting another child to bring some form of harmony to the fold.At this point, the story structure takes shape, and we meet Esther, prim and proper and a dab hand with a paint brush, she can also carry a tune, albeit an old fashioned one, which when you see her initial appearance you can just imagine the way she carries herself both in terms of how she walks and talks.Of course such appearance can always be deceptive, and true to form, little Esther begins to carefully construct her ungodly plan for perfect family togetherness.As ever when I watch any horror movie, I always seem to find certain associations with other horror movies, in this case, the notion of a little girl being adopted made me think of The Good Son, remember when Macauley Culkin first let rip with the F Bomb? As for my Poison Ivy notion, I am not a fan of spoilers, but the scene where Esther dresses to impress and possibly seduce her adoptive father, whilst very uncomfortable to watch, it made me think of the Drew Barrymore original.As for The Sleepaway Camp Murders, remember the ending to that? Now that was a real jaw dropper too, So placing all those threads together, was the movie any good? Like I said before, the denouement was the biggest kicker, but it must noted that the acting by young Isabelle Fuhrman was quite something, she managed to convey all the elements of a femme fatale, from sweet innocence to sheer stark terror.With all the multiplexes currently showing the latest blockbusters, if you find yourself in the mood for a little late night chilling session, go check this one out.My rating is 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan,"The plot revolves around a classic thriller trope: the protagonist who discovers a terrifying truth but is dismissed by everyone around her. This dynamic generates frustration and tension, as the audience shares her despair when no one else perceives what seems so obvious to her.The core of the story is evil personified in a child, a choice that is always unsettling. Here, that evil is embodied by Esther, a seemingly perfect 9-year-old Russian girl: talented, educated, refined, and highly recommended by the nuns at the orphanage. However, as the story progresses, her true agenda is revealed, centered on manipulating and seducing the adoptive father at any cost, pushing the family dynamic to its limits.The film effectively uses themes of neglect and alcoholism in the adoptive parents to add complexity to the characters and justify the vulnerability that allows Esther to sow chaos. Its ability to blend family drama with psychological horror gives it a distinctive edge, though it occasionally verges on melodrama.Director Jaume Collet-Serra balances traditional scares with a slow-burning, unsettling development, keeping the tension alive until the shocking finale. Isabelle Fuhrman's performance as Esther is chilling and convincing, making her one of the most memorable child villains in cinema.In summary, Orphan is brazenly effective, with a plot that explores paranoia, manipulation, and the fragility of human relationships. While it may lean on genre clichés at times, its ability to destabilize and disturb the audience more than makes up for it. A film that undoubtedly leaves its mark.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting,"I just watched this one because the prequel is happening now in 2022. I think Orphan, was not that bad. But it is not a cult classic.First, the characters are not really smart guessing what is going on, even the the real evidence.Second, how can someone injured with a broken arm lift a big rock. Last, there are no twists or something to make you think in a good way after the movie.On the other hand, the girl's accent is funny. I really enjoyed. Also, the little girl, does a great job here.So, overall an entertaining thriller with a little horror to enjoy. Not a masterpiece. Let's see the prequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Esther wants to be different but they play it safe instead,"Like ""Joshua"" in estrogen, ""Orphan"" not only shares its similarity with George Ratliff's thriller via featuring a precociously villainous juvenile, but also because it stars Vera Farmiga as a mother at the receiving end of her child's diabolical manipulations. Jaume Collet-Serra crafts a mildly diverting hybrid of ""The Omen"" and ""Swimfan"" though the proneness of David Leslie Johnson's script to adhere to cheap horror conventions undercuts whatever interesting psychological thriller about a gradually imploding family that stirs underneath.Played with vicious adequacy by Isabelle Fuhrman, Esther is blissfully welcomed into the Coleman household in a snowy middle-of-nowhere house. Kate (Farmiga), a former alcoholic still reeling from the death of their unborn third child, and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a husband with loyalty issues regarding his wife, nevertheless wholeheartedly accepts Esther as part of their family. Their adopted daughter is gleefully cordial, paints cheery images, eager to learn the piano, and -- for a nine-year old Russian who has just spent a year in the US -- speaks very good English. The mantra ""too good to be true,"" however is slowly evidenced, as the titular daughter starts to react violently to school bullies and casually drops the F-bomb as if it were a customary lexicon for people her age.Embodied by John's imperious refusal to see something is wrong with the things around him to the point of being laughable, ""Orphan"" ultimately plays on overly familiar genre tunes that rely too much on foreseeable shock moments and questionable logic of its characters to deliver most of its scares. Collet-Serra, despite the obvious lack of faith that the material would provide the spooks without resorting so much to shock tactics, at least capably maintains an ominous aura that accompanies his villain's innocence largely through Fuhrman's calm, faux-Manichaean scowls and Oedipus cajolery, and Farmiga's gameness to provide her character with more depth than what it's actually called for. Yet despite being ultimately entertaining and having a potential to be more intelligent, it frustratingly pursues a well-trodden path with such earnestness. ""There's nothing wrong with being different,"" remarks Esther early on. Strange, though, that ""Orphan"" doesn't share the same belief.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting Thriller.,"I didn't mind this movie its OK, a lot of the reviews here are giving it massive praise, although I just felt like it had a bunch of flaws even though you have to give credit to all the actors and the film writers, nearly every film has a flaw or two, but it just seemed that this particular film started to slack a bit halfway through till basically the end.its a good story, but the flaws I'm talking about aren't massive, just commonsense type flaws, the kind of flaws that are deliberately molded into a film that just makes it last the whole 1.5hrs to make it a film in length, i don't want to add possible spoilers or anything like that so I'm not going to bother going into that side to try and holdup why/where i think it was flawed so ill leave it there and just say, it has some flaws, you can watch it and enjoy it, it is tense, i did like the characters the story, and how it moves through, but it just left me feeling a tiny bit disappointed, i quite like 'all' films so its not that this wasn't my genre, but anyway to keep it small ill give it a 7/10 its worth watching and like ppl have said here its not completely what you expect really but it is similar to other (evil)child movies, you will get what you ask for in that sense, but there is a bit more to it.ill end saying if you can just ignore the small flaws its a good way to kill a couple hours :D (most of the flaws I'm talking about are actually in the goofs section but the general commonsense is just a bit slow, meh, watch it and you'll know what i mean I'm sure.)there are a lot of reviews on this film when I'm writing this its like 155 + mine 156, so there is a massive variation in views/opinions, ppl hated it, some loved it, but i think the general consensus is in middle, its a time waster, if you only get 1 night in the week to watch a film and hardly any spare time to kill, don't bother with this film, watch The Omen or something its probably a better variation to the same story, if a bit old now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent,"I thought that this would be one more piece to be added to the whole collection of poorly-made horror movies, but it proved me wrong. What to say of the movie? Just that it's fascinating. The way which David Johnson planned the plot is worth applauding. It grips you all through, by either scariness or surprise. It's also worth mentioning the secrecy built over Esther backgrounds, which is finally revealed in the end. It's so well constructed and performed that you get hooked throughout the whole movie without even noticing that it's a strategy put into use by the director. Now the dignified work delivered by the cast. It's so opposite to the far-fetched acting of other movies. Actually, I wasn't expecting much from the actors, since there were no renowned names listed, but they lived up to my expectations. Isabelle, who was only 12 when the movie was shot, was one of the biggest findings in my opinion; she just managed to play very convincingly an arduous and demanding role of a mentally-disordered girl. So, if you are already done with horror movies based on a thin plot and that don't go deep into the inner feelings of human beings, try Orphan, I assure you are going to like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan (2009),"A truly hysterical (in both senses) horror thriller that starts off as a pretty routine ""evil child"" movie, until a third act twist sends the film into truly ridiculous overdrive. You have to give the writer some credit for having the audacity to write such a twist, it's pure trash cinema gold! Holding this increasingly distasteful, bloody film together is an excellent performance by Farmiga, and to a lesser extent Sarsgaard, the dynamic between them helped by a surprisingly detailed and nuanced back story and relationship. The score and sound effects are distractingly excessive, and could've used a lesson in 'less is more', and let's not even get started on the clichéd finale or the blatant xenophobia. But amidst the hysteria are genuinely creepy touches, the best being Esther's personality disorder being mirrored in her artwork, all sweet and innocent on the surface but with a shocking, twisted adult hatred simmering underneath.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The evil ESTHER,"ORPHAN is a horror thriller about a little girl that is adopted by a family which suffered a recent trauma about losing a child. The family already has two kids, but the parents decide to adopt one more child probably trying to overpass that trauma. They choose a 9 years old girl which was born in Russia but speaks English very well as she's living in the USA for some years. At first the child is very kind and quickly calls their attention, but when she goes living to their home, some problems start appearingThis film is not quite original because this kind of argument has been done for many times, but it has an unexpected twist near the end. At least it was unexpected for me in spite of not liking it too much! In fact I didn't appreciate that twist but I must say it was unusual in this kind of plot. I don't know if it's absolutely original though.About the production I think it is average for a horror flick. I must say I didn't find it particularly scary in spite of recognize it has two or three nice horror scenes.I appreciated the main character, ESTHER, played by the young actress Isabelle Fuhrman, because I think it's very rich and was very well created for a plot like that, but I also think it could have been a bit more explored It's not a great horror thriller but it's not bad either, I score it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Irritatingly bad flick,"I can't stand ""horror"" flicks where all kinds of really suspenseful and horrible manipulations happen because all the characters are either too stupid to catch on or too chicken to do anything about it.The whole ""deftly manipulative sociopath"" formula only works when the surrounding characters are of a believable intelligence and psychological depth. Here, nuh-uh. Check out the ""dad"" in particular. This moron is supposedly a successful architect. Right.But a smart supporting cast wouldn't have worked here, because guess what? The villain ain't too bright either.Most times I sit down with a flick like this, I can be a good sport about it and get entertainment value from the giggles and forehead slaps.

Slow but decent thriller,"Well I got what I expected out of this film, except the twist near the end. The film has a very slow start with more of the jump scares than it actually building tension. The story went about what I expected besides it being more of a thriller and didn't really go in the horror direction. Besides it being pretty slow a lot of people seem to be satisfied cause of the big twist near the end of the film, I will admit I didn't see that one coming and it was original, also shocking. But I found it to be a bit stupid and lame, if you see the movie you will understand what I am talking about cause it leads to a lot of plot holes that don't make any sense and ruins her character which was actually quite intriguing at first. Besides Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who did a remarkable job playing a menacing character, Max (Aryana Engineer) was the most adorable child character I have ever seen in a movie and stood out a lot. I was expecting this film to be better cause I had a pretty decent expectation for it, despite it being sort of a cliché thriller and using a child antagonist to spice things up a bit it was a darkly humorous and pretty disturbing movie that is worth a look.

One word: creepy,"As a self-proclaimed movie fiend, I have no idea how I had never seen this movie. I don't think I had even heard of it. But when I saw they made a 2022 prequel, I figured I'd give this one a shot before watching the new one. And I am so pleasantly surprised.Orphan works on basically every level. Whatever it's going for, it does well. The best example is the creepiness. There are so many scenes where she pulls off the creepiness so well, due to a combination of the performance by the lead and the directing.It's also filled with tension. I found myself clenching my fists multiple times. And when it comes to horror movies with children, they frequently play it safe. Not here. I didn't know it's rated R and a few of the scenes had my jaw dropped.I like the tone, I love the artwork. I was smiling for half of this movie. AND, I frequently found myself rooting for Esther.

Gotta love little horror villians,"I do enjoy a lot of horror movies where happy families get broken apart, and this film did just that. The tension when Esther threatens the couples other kids is really gripping and had me at the edge of my seat. When you see the wife get blamed for the stuff Esther does and the husband doesn't believe her is pretty heartbreaking. Vera Farmiga is fantastic in everything she's in but the one who really stole the show is Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther. Probably one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. She's so maniacal your left thinking in every scene what she's going to do next. When we first meet her she seems kind but we know something is still off about her. How she swaps from sweet to evil is amazing. But of course what really makes her character compelling is the twist ending. I won't dare spoil it but I will say everything that it build up to really paid off and it even makes the actresses performance more astonishing.As for negatives the film's biggest flaw is probably that it's a bit too cliche at times. Throughout their some false jump scares that while not that annoying compared to other films I've seen they still feel pretty redundant. Not to mention the very end while intense and engaging does keep carrying on longer than needed. Another issue is some of the characters couldve been written better.Other than that orphan is definitely a good time. While not that original and honestly not all that scary either, it's still a really entertaining and engaging take on the evil children genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If Orphan is not quite a brilliant film, at least it provides some moments of great tension, starting from a conventional script, but with an authentic twist and a great cast","Directed by Catalan filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra (who had already signed for the producer Dark Castle, House of Wax) and also featuring the star Leonardo de Caprio among the producers, Orphan marks the maturity of the producer, which after several setbacks, seems to have learned the lesson. This time they left aside both the extravagant special effects (which are most often persona non grata among fanatics of the genre) and the famous names in the cast, and in a lapse of wisdom invested in an intelligent and original script.The film tells the story of Kate (Vera Farmiga), a woman haunted by nightmares and the bad memories that the loss of a daughter during pregnancy caused her. The death of the fetus also affected the life of her husband, John (Peter Sarsgaard), and together they decide to adopt a child, now close to ten years old, to keep their other two children, Daniel (Jimmy Bennet) and Maxine (Aryanna Engineer). On his way to an institution, John meets Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a Russian girl who is apparently docile, articulate and very intelligent for her age. She was left alone after her entire family died in a fire.John and Kate's integration with the girl is immediate and they choose Esther as their new daughter. But the girl starts to present some problems. The delicate way of dressing catches everyone's attention and causes laughter at school, which is quickly reprimanded by Esther herself: she pushes and seriously injures a classmate. Other dubious and lying attitudes ""open the eyes"" of Kate to the girl, such as the simple fact of denying that she knows how to play the piano. But the husband remains blind, causing numerous fights between the couple. Esther has Machiavellian plans for the entire Coleman family and will spare no effort to destroy it.The production introduces us to the everyday life of an apparently happy couple, who live a sophisticated life with their two children and come from all the good and the best, in addition to the affection of loving parents. It's a happy home, but also full of unspoken things and almost tragic situations, from the not-too-distant past, which were buried in an attempt to take their days with more lightness and tranquility. When, in 2009, the release of the terrifying film Orphan began, it not only surprised the critics at the time, but also the public itself. The leading couple of Farmiga and Sarsgaard presents an exceptional dramatic performance, with ideas that help to compose the narrative proposal of the film. John is a peaceful, caring man, and concerned about the physical and emotional needs of his home, while Kate is a Yale music teacher, currently away from her activities due to past problems, such as alcoholism that made her almost leave one of her children drowning and the terrible mourning for her baby's death in a miscarriage, events that make her feel guilty and force her to visit a therapist as part of her weekly routine.A manipulator, Esther creates situations against her adoptive mother, always in the interest of having only her father for her, and, because of all her qualities, everyone is left behind with Kate, attentive and suspicious of her every step, something that, as the film progresses, makes it more and more difficult for people to believe in it, thinking it to be despair or paranoia, that's Orphan. The production is only strengthened by the direction of photography by Jeff Curter, who is very meticulous in night scenes and functional when horror needs to settle down in daytime passages, the atmospheric soundtrack conducted by John Ottman, in a moment of great inspiration, the production design by Tom Meyer, and set design by Daniel Hamelin, which is erected amidst incredible spaces and lots of glass and elements that not only design the family's luxury dwelling, but also highlight the potential of some more tense, built-up landscapes. In scenarios as dangerous as the mysterious and diabolic Esther.Collet-Serra had already proved to be good in the weather, and here he plays with a classic setting of the genre - the winter forest, with dry trees and lots of snow - combined with interesting premises (the deaf girl, for example). Unfortunately, for both Collet-Serra and her fellow Hispanic directors, there is always a formula to follow in Hollywood, and the script by David Johnson and Alex Mace can't let go of it. The formula, in this case, is that of the family nucleus divided by pure evil: this evil merges with the family's routine, triggers intimate crises that were in the past and, ultimately, ends up dividing the family (or at least those that don't have the strength to rally and defeat evil in the end). The problem with Orphan is that, before descending into Manichaeism, Esther had the potential to be something more complex than this pure evil.After all, there is talk of how the drama of adoption changes the lives of both the parents and children who were already there and the child who is now arriving. To some extent in the film, Esther's manifestations of malice are, on closer inspection, just the insecurity of someone trying to adjust to the new environment. By extension, the fact that she is mistreated by the other children can be seen as the children's instinct for preservation in front of the new sister. It is a promising material that, while discussing the responsibility of raising a non-traditional family, would allow for the scares and typical atmospheres of the genre without characterizing Manicheism. In other words, you could create a frightening character based on simple child psychology, without the need for the backstory inserted by the script in the viewer's lap in its final act. Another mistake is to insist on the disagreements between Kate and John to try to keep the conflict in the film, despite all the facts leading to the incrimination of the girl. It even bothers how innocent the character of Sarsgaard is, a characteristic which seems to have been inherited by the children, since both, even with all the chances to unmask Esther, do not do it.The structure of the story is not original and is very reminiscent of The Evil Angel (1993), thriller starring Macauley Caulkin and Elijah Wood, in which Caulkin plays a boy who moves in with his uncles after his mother's death. Wood plays his cousin who soon realizes the boy isn't that innocent. For those who don't mind, the film supports a well-articulated suspense, thanks to the sinister Isabelle Furhman's performance in the role of Esther. The girl is very strange and managed to play the psychopath perfectly. In the counterpart is the wonderful Vera Farmiga, in the role of Kate (in the same year she was nominated for an Oscar for Amor Sem Escalas).Overall, does the movie have clichés? Yes, but they work and we really like it because the result is great. The climax is effusive, the plot twists are quite intense, but the narrative paves this trajectory well and doesn't make us feel that discomfort of dealing with a film that depends on something terribly absurd and lurid to shock and justify its quality. And, yes, Esther can be placed in the panorama of fatal women in cinema, not because of her sensuality, but because of her high degree of danger. If she wishes to annul the mother as she has done in other situations before, in order to assume the sexual place in the matriarch in the couple's life, the fatal noir archetype, safeguarding the due proportions, is indeed at work in history.Jaume Collet-Serra joins this select group of talented Hispanic directors who emerged in American cinema in the early 2000s. In Orphan, his only mistake is to abuse some clichés, like the easy scares caused by noise or the classic scene of the reflection in the bathroom mirror. But Collet-Serra shows skill in exploring the beautiful winter landscapes that make up the scene. The place where the action takes place is surrounded by trees and a lot of snow, which creates an oppressive atmosphere, but extremely believable. The filmmaker still manages to maintain sobriety and avoid the exaggerations characteristic of Hollywood productions of the genre.One fact in particular stands out in ""Orphan"": almost all scare intentions are false. The director seems to want to manipulate us, as these scenes don't terrify the characters, only the spectators. All the common camera moves for scares are there, but nothing real happens. And that's how film can be defined, one manipulation after another, either by Esther or even by the director. But the big revelation in Orphan is the young Isabelle Fuhrman (only 12 years old) playing Esther, who stands out in every scene, even when opposite more experienced actors such as Vera Farmiga (the mother) and Peter Sarsgaard (the father). The young actress convinces in every nuance of her character, from innocent or manipulative until the turn of events where her new face is revealed.If Orphan is not quite a brilliant film, at least it provides some moments of great tension, starting from a conventional script, but with an authentic twist and a cast of children far above the average. The film is instigating and engaging, capable of impressing with the psychological aspects involved and with the affliction provided. Hard not to be at least anxious to find out what's wrong with the scary girl, and how the family will manage to escape the nightmare that life has become after her arrival.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Rhoda Penmark, hang your head in shame.","It's Halloween, a night that I have, traditionally for the past 20 years, set aside to watch the latest scary flick. This year's selection was Jaume Collet-Serra's film 'Orphan'.All those cute little tikes were outside dressed like Princesses at the 4-H children's' beauty contest, their parents tailing them like hawks, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths; the perfect setting to scare the pants off me as this brilliant psychological thriller unfolded before my ever widening eyeballs.Esther, oh, Esther Esther Esther... I can't possibly reveal anything that happens in this film. This is one of the most spectacular screenplays I've watched in ages, written by David Leslie Johnson based on a story by Alex Mace. This should be a prime contender for best screenplay in 2010. It is gripping from start to finish.It begins quietly with the beguiling Esther being adopted by an upscale couple who've had their share of tribulations with children. These are average, successful Americans we're talking about here, bringing this hair-raising story very close to home for millions of viewers who have the guts to see it. Little moments of seemingly insignificant tension and release take place but build cumulatively until, at about 80 minutes into watching it, I had to put the thing on pause so I could blink and walk around the house to see if the doors were locked against those dreadful trick-or-treating beasts and that the back light was on for the night, something I never bother with, normally.Make no mistake, this is one bloody, ruthless film and Esther is one scary little bitch. She's cute as a spooky cat, until she begins her little tricks. I began to dread what was coming when about 40 minutes into the film Esther says f**k in such a way as to cause my hair to stand on end. We hear kids say that word all the time, trying to show off and sound tough. Not Esther. She just says it and it is like a nuclear blast to the senses.The ending, the one used in the final cut, is harrowing, following a climactic twist in the story that is truly shocking.The actors are excellent. Peter Sarsgaard is his usual laid-back persona and a bit one dimensional, but it suits this smug, rather weak character whose mother, Gramma, on the evidence of her personality here, is a classic monstre sacré, adding speculative dimensions to the highly charged sexual undertone of the entire film.If Vera Farmiga doesn't win best actress for her role as his wife there is no justice or fairness in Hollywood. She is magnificent as the adoptive mother. And she is a fine pianist as well.Her two natural children, Max, her deaf little girl, and Daniel her pre-teen son, are played with a naturalism and surety that can't be taught in any method acting class. The young actors are Aryana Enginner and Jimmy Bennett.But even more astounding is the performance by Isabelle Fuhrman as the eponymous 'heroine' Esther. To describe the range of her performance would cause me to include a spoiler, or at least a too close to the bone hint that might ruin this film for those who haven't seen it yet.She, too, would be a close contender to Vera Farmiga as best actress in 2010. A great great cast! The music is minimalist but perfect for this tense story. The cinematography is wholly naturalistic, the most high-tech aspect of the film being the use of black lites in Esther's bedroom. There is none of the over-used CGI or any of those tiresome tricks that are so prevalent in the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. 'Orphan' is a straight-ahead horror flick like 'Night of the Living Dead' only it has no fantasy elements in it at all. And like all great horror flicks the viewer has sympathy for the tragedy of the 'monster'. And Esther's life is a tragedy in spite of everything.I expect the Academy of Motion Sickness Pictures will ignore this masterpiece because it probably didn't make enough money, but I predict the DVD will sell millions as the years pass and the perfection of this classic film is recognized by more and more people.'Orphan' is definitely for adults only. There is no nudity and the 'bad' words are not really offensive in any vulgar or pornographic sense, and the bloody bits are not sickening or over-abundant, but it's far too intense for pre-teens.I keep calling 'Orphan' a horror but it isn't. It's a very disturbing and complex psychological thriller. Hitchcock would probably have been proud to have made this film. It's almost as good as 'Psycho'. I don't think 'Orphan' is a 'B' movie at all. If it is then so is all of Hitchock's output.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genuinely Creepy!,"I had always assumed based off the movies poster and DVD cover that Orphan was a movie about a devil child like Damien from The Omen. I never gave this movie a chance when it was first released because I just assumed it would end up being just another awful horror movie about a scary child.Orphan actually surprised me with it's storyline. In the first thirty minutes of the movie I thought I knew how the movie was going to play out and was ready to write a review about another sub par horror movie. I'm glad I got the ending wrong because it actually came as a bit of a surprise when the movies twist was revealed and I was left both surprised and entertained.I wouldn't say Orphan is a particularly scary movie I'd say it's more of a creepy horror movie especially after the first viewing you see the movies events in a different way than before. There's not a lot violence in this movie but in the few scene's that contain blood and gore in them are very well done and are very effective at making a little girl look genuinely terrifying.(Isabelle Fuhrman) plays Orphan girl Esther very effectively giving a commanding and very memorable performance that is genuinely creepy and terrifying. The cast works extremely well together all giving great performances throughout it's not often you find a horror movie that's so well cast there's usually at least one bad performance that stands out but not in this movie.The only problem I have with this movie is that it uses a lot of obnoxiously loud jump scares aswell as jump scare fake outs. This is something that a lot of horror movies do nowadays in an attempt to scare the audience but all it really does is annoy the hell out of people. Ophan has some genuinely creepy moments in it that would of been so much more effective if the music was taken out of it but sadly the movie is filled with ""atmospheric"" music or so they call it and whenever you hear it played you just know there's a jump scare coming ruining what could of been a great scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A disturbing and all-around well made psychological thriller/horror flick,"Orphan (2009) is by all accounts somewhat of a sleeper hit. I only watched the film in its entirety more than 10 after it was released, but being a big fan of the ""evil child"" horror subgenre with one of my all time favorites being the likes of ""The Omen"" (1976) - I rarely found a good contender which had the quality of startling me and leaving a strong impression on me upon first viewing.Orphan is that kind of movie, where the antagonist, meticulously and disturbingly well-played by then only 10-year old Isabelle Fuhrman elevates the entire premise and suspense of the film by a country mile. Consider the creepy and well played antichrist by Harvey Spencer Stephens in the original Omen and apply that same level of craftmanship and turn it up a notch and you get Fuhrman's level of intimidating and manipulative presence on screen.The premise of the story is very simple, as the Coleman family who still is marked by their loss of a stillborn daughter try to move on with their lives by adopting an orphan - thus channeling the love they reserved for their own unborn child to another that deserves it as equally. They get invested in a 9-year old girl with an eastern accent who talks beautifully and complex (way above of what is expected of her age), and adopt her.The movie has strong characterizations by the protagonist mother played solidly by Vera Farmiga who senses that there is something wrong with their newly adopted daughter Esther.Sadly the movie keeps falling back on classic horror clichés of having extremely violent and suspicious events happen to or near the family, conveniently after Esther enters their lives, where seemingly ignorant characters are unwilling to see the clear signs. The situation is of course not helped by the frivolous and flawed husband, competently played by Peter Sarsgaard, who seems somehow bewitched by Esther's very mature way of thinking and conducting herself when she is around him. She is able to charm him into believing her every word and by giving him a new level of interactivity which he seemingly cannot get from his real daughter, Max, who is deaf and is very well-played by Aryana Engineer. The Coleman's son, Daniel, solidly played by Jimmy Bennet isn't exactly ""wonderchild"" material and feels that something is off with Esther. He too now has to take a backseat to his dad's seemingly new favourite little girl in the household.The absurdity of this plot is somewhat mitigated by convenient prior events which invoke instability in the family with the mother having lost her credibility due to her neglect in an accident which could have gone very wrong, prompting her husband and the people around her to question her sanity, and the rift between the couple is widened due to subsequent reveals of betrayal by the husband.All of this contributes to an extremely vulnerable family dynamic and it becomes the perfect playground for Esther who through masterful manipulation begins to tear the family apart to fuel her own disturbing ulterior motives.As the poster says: ""There is something wrong with Esther"", the big reveal and some very morally questionable scenes leading up to it will most likely leave you speechless.Director Jaume Collet-Serra does a great job at presenting this almost surreal story to us with great angles and overall pacing. Due to the solid performances the films 2+ hour running time flies by fast!Fuhrman however, completely steals the show here, as she establishes a new standard for child performances in horror movies. Her portrayal of the character is deep, manipulating, charming, dark and most of all disturbing - to think that she was just 10 years old during the production is mind-blowing, but was just what the movie needed to pull off some of its more unbelievable and perfunctory parts.If you can stomach it, then Orphan (2009) comes highly recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Actually pretty impressive.,"I will be honest, I did not have high expectations for this movie. For one thing, I was concerned over how thrilling it could be let alone be able to show any originality within the plot.At the start of the movie, it does feel that way. It isn't all eye popping or creepy at all, and even felt really tame. However, once you reach little more than half-way into the movie it completely changes - the twist was really original, and phenomenal! Towards the end of the movie I was definitely at the edge of my seat, because for once you actually don't know who will by the next murdered victim of Esther. In a lot of previous movies, the obvious characters tend to survive or die. But not this! The actress who plays Esther was absolutely amazing and talented. Overall, take a chance with this movie - it really is something, especially during the last half. The plot twist is no doubt the highlight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You'll wish the ending was not so laughably absurd,"After the loss of their third child, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) still want to have a child and decide to adopt. They want a girl, and after a visit to a local girls' orphanage, decide on the nine-year-old Russian Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). She seems to know a lot for a kid her age, and acts more incredibly polite and proper than anyone could ever expect. But as strange and bizarre things begin to occur, Kate begins to think Esther is not exactly who they thought she was.For a movie as standard sounding and looking as Orphan, I was expecting a predictable movie with a few scares. I was told the ending well before seeing it, but even with expecting the twist, I still was fairly impressed by just how well done the film was. The film manages to work in solemn reverence of films about evil children that have come before, but adds its own stroke of frights and excitement. It aims to be bizarre and horrify, and it mostly manages to pull this small task off. The storyline stays consistent until the ending, adding layers of baffling questions on top of each other. We really feel for Kate as her whole moral fabric begins to fall apart trying to figure out Esther's past, and we really learn to hate Esther for all the games she keeps playing with the family.But then the ending comes, and it feels like a bullet train collided with your brain head on. I was prepared for the most unlikely twist I have ever heard, but knowing does not nearly prepare you for how laughably ludicrous it is. It just comes as so unlikely, so unpredictable and is played out so silly that you realize why it is so unique and why no one even bothered to think of it before. The only reason it works the way it is, is because of how original an idea it is, and how totally unexpected it comes after watching the rest of the film. I can only imagine how baffled people who knew nothing about the ending felt after the twist was revealed. It is not as earth shattering an event as finding out who Keyser Soze was in The Usual Suspects or the real relationship between the Narrator and Tyler Durdan in Fight Club, but it does make you briefly want to reconsider everything that happens in the film up to that point.In a way, the out-of-left-field ending actually ruins the film. Up to that point, it is a tense thriller that manages to disturb in ways few films can (with its surprisingly obscene violence and fairly enigmatic villain). But after that point, it just descends into being ridiculous and borders on self parody. I realize the effect the filmmakers were going for, but it just transcends into not being anywhere near as worthwhile an idea as it should. The audience should be mortified by the truth, not paralyzed into laughter. Even with the events that come after the big reveal, all you can do is laugh at what the movie quickly becomes. While I cannot really think of any better way to end the film, it just seems so off-putting letting the filmmakers get away with something so preposterous. It is the worst kind of cheat; one that does away with anything the film had going for it. And for a low key horror film like this, it makes for a truly disappointing final product.The film is not all triumph before the ending. While I enjoyed the slow build of revealing the secrets of how troubled the family was prior to Esther's adoption, the entire plot line of Kate trying to figure out Esther's past is a bit hit or miss. Watching everyone doubt Kate over and over again got a bit tedious, and got rather annoying after awhile. Watching the kids act out of fear for their lives was great, but watching the adults otherwise completely ignore their outright cries for help (sometimes literal cries) was nearly as silly as the ending. The film manages to wrap itself so well that these little tidbits just work against it deeply.Farmiga and Sarsgaard work fairly well together, delivering believable performances as a couple in crisis. On his own, Sarsgaard spends a lot of time basically going through the motions, giving the expected responses without an immense amount of emotion for the most part. This is a little disheartening to note, as Farmiga is a force to be reckoned with throughout the film. She has not been on the Hollywood scene for long, and has already acted in a similar evil child film (Joshua with Sam Rockwell), but she really proves her chops here. She rises above the material, looking every bit as worn and tired as her character is. It takes awhile to learn just what is wrong with her, but it is worth every moment you wait simply to see how she reacts to what happens.The children fare even better. Jimmy Bennett does a great job swapping tones and body language, and Aryana Engineer is simply magnificent as the deaf-mute daughter. Really impressive work here on the filmmakers' part by adding in a significant emphasis on the use of sign language by the characters (and totally muted scenes). But Fuhrman is the reason to watch the film. This twelve-year-old delivers the scariest child performance in a long time, and is reason enough to watch the film. She just has an aura all her own that makes every moment she pops up more memorable than the next. If she does not get more work because of this film, then there is simply no justice left in the system. The film may become a train wreck, but watching it get there with Fuhrman in control is the only way it stays watchable.7/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I guess I'm  just different?,"**SPOILERS** After her newborn child-who was to be named Jeniffer-died during a failed delivery at the hospital the mother Kate Coleman, Vera Farmia, went into a deep depression and started to hit the bottle.It's now two years later and both Kate an her husband John, Peter Sarsgaard, adopt nine year-old Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, from a local Catholic orphanage in the hope she'll replaced Jenniffer; The daughter that they never had the chance of knowing. As things were to turn out this was to become a big big mistake on the part of the unsuspecting Colemans! Esther was not what she at first seemed to be but it would take a number of horrific incidents for the Coleman's to finally realize it! But by them it may well have been to late for them and their two young children the deft and mute Maxine, Aryana Engineer, and Danny, Jimmy Bennett, as well as anyone else who just happened to get in Esther's way! Including the Sister Superior of the orphanage that Esther came from Sister Abigal,CCH Pounder.Even though the film is compared to ""The Omem"" and ""the Bad Seed"" it's really a one of a kind horror flick where you don't realize-like in the previous two child horror films-what's behind sweet little Esther's horrid actions! That's until the shocking secret of her past is reviled, from far off Estonia no less, to the audience as well as Kate that comes to light in the last ten or so minutes left in the movie!***SPOILER ALERT*** There's something very strange about Esther and you notice it almost as soon as you, and the Coleman's, meet her at the orphanage! She's pretty smart even, when she wants to be, adoring but there's something very unnerving about her in how unusually mature, both in knowledge and emotion, she is for nine year-old girl. That something is what Esther has been keeping under raps, or better yet ribbons, all throughout the movie! It's a little something that she took with her out for her home in Estonia, not Russia like she has people think, that will reveal the true nature of her character as well as mental state!Extremely disturbing movie that has as it's villain, little Esther, one of the most cold blooded and manipulative psycho killers in motion picture history! It's not that Esther is at first a sweet and innocent-looking child. It's that she's just too perfect in both committing and covering up the horrors that she perpetrates in the film! Like she's had from previous experience in doing these same horrible acts before!It's Kate who starts to put the missing pieces of the puzzle together in just who Esther really is and how she's been so successful in covering up her past! A cover-up that even fooled Esther's, or the Coleman family, psychiatrist Dr Browning, Margo Mantindale. It's later when Esther tries to silence Kate, by having her declared insane or murdered, that even her very naive husband John finally realizes just what he's up against! Something or someone that he, and almost every one else in the film, had been completely fooled by!

Too disturbing for me to watch,"This film is about a young charming girl who got adopted by a family of four. However, the girl turns out to be a lot less charming than she looks.""Orphan"" is not quite a horror story, but a disturbing story. I felt so disturbed after watching 70 minutes that I could not watch it anymore. The plot may be simple, but the delivery of it is definitely hauntingly effective. It leaves me unsettled and deeply disturbed. I also feel unhappy as the story may put people off adoption, hence robbing innocent and needy children's chance of having a loving family. In short, I wish I could undo watching even just the 70 minutes I watched, because it disturbed me too much.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"There is nothing wrong with esther,the problem is with the movie","If i have come here for writing this review. That is only because i liked this charming little girl isabelle fuhrman who played esther. i didn't like the way her role was portrayed and got wasted in the middle when she was carrying the movie so very well. i was with esther (isabelle) all the time watching her do her job amazingly well when the movie was going from bad to worse with their mindless horror and slasher movie routines. Vera farmiga also had some scenes of good acting but was totally over powered by esther. Isabelle fuhrmans( acted when she was only 10 or 11 ) charm, exuberance and acting saves this movie from being a classic disaster. and some little thoughts for those Hollywood big wigs out there. please spare us from these kind of sleazy cheesy horror packages. you may be having an audience of your own.but they are also bound to get bored someday. next time try to make a horror movie with some aesthetic appeal which i expected from this movie but in vain. this kind of money spinning formulaic Hollywood nonsense are not going to work all the time.they are going to catch you someday.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disturbing and impressively acted.,"This review contain 1 minor spoiler to this film, it has nothing to do with the ending though, it's just something that happens.In Orphan, a 30 something couple lose their baby through a miscarriage. They both are in grief, so they decide to adopt a child from an Orphanage. The come across a rather charming Russian girl named Esther. The couple are very drawn towards this girl, everything about her seems perfect, they decide to adopt her. The mother slowly starts to realize that she isn't as perfect as she thought, but no one else realizes. And now we have Orphan.As you can tell, the films not exactly the most original piece the horror genre has ever seen, but it is however very well written, which is certainly refreshing considering recent horror films of the past few years. The good writing comes with the character of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), she is very menacing and some of the things she does are really shocking, you really feel that she is evil. The character of Kate is also well written, I always felt very sympathetic towards her throughout the events of the film. Things like this are what make Orphan stick out amongst the crowd of horror films, you're usually not sympathetic towards the main character, or intimidated by the villain, but Orphan hit's the nail on the head in this aspect.Orphan also sticks out very much in another aspect, the acting. It's refreshing enough to see an average performance in a horror film, so you could imagine how happy I was with the way above average performances in Orphan. Isabelle Fuhrman is just terrifying as Esther. Her real stick out scene is when she purposely breaks her hand, it was completely believable. In my opinion her performance as Esther completely overshadows Linda Blair as Regan in The Exorcist. She was only about 11 or 12 when the film was being shot and she completely pulls off this grim, complex and harrowing character. Vera Farmiga, who I always liked as an actress, also completely pulls off her character.The film is also nicely directed which was sort of surprising I suppose. The cinematography was very nice looking too, this in turn gives the film a very stylish look, which kind of suited the tone. The script is solid mostly, but does have some bad moments at times.I don't really have any big problems with Orphan other than it's sometimes over the top moments. I highly recommend it too any horror fan looking for a good creepy movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The story was detailed to the line. The acting was remarkably good. Every scene was into the story and there were no fillers.This movie should be a template for future wants to come.

"Movie of the day: ""Orphan""","OK, so I'll admit that I didn't go into ""Orphan"" expecting much. I originally didn't want to see the film, I had absolutely zero interest in seeing it, but I had the opportunity to see it with a girl I liked, so what the hell? I'll take a chance, and $10.25 at the local theater. I don't think ""Orphan"" is nearly as bad as it could have been, or as bad as people are making it out to be.Yes, the film does concern Esther (Isabelle Furhman), a cute 9-year-old Russian girl who is adopted by the Colemans, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who already have a young son and deaf-mute daughter. But pretty soon, the new addition to the family reveals a much darker and twisted side to her personality as a murderous psychopath that has been well-advertised in the commercials.The movie has caused some controversy in the weeks leading up to its release, stemming from the ""myths"" about people adopting older children. My response is that ""Orphan"" is just a movie; it's a work of fiction and I don't think this movie will put people off from adopting older children.The movie brings back memories of such ""evil child"" movies such as ""The Omen"" and ""The Bad Seed,"" so we know where the plot is going to take us before it has a chance to waste our time and patience arriving at that moment. The film's big ""plot twist"" revealing the truth about Esther's murderous dark side two-thirds of the way through ""Orphan"" will not be a surprise to more thoughtful viewers, but at least it's made believable within the context of the film.There are also some funny parts in the movie as well, though I'm unsure if they were intentional or not on the part of the filmmakers, particularly director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenwriter David Johnson. Maybe it was intentional or not, but maybe it's because the laughs were aimed at the people who were two rows in front of us and who were whooping and hollering and screaming at the screen every time something scary happened...6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I only have 1 word for this movie...WOW!!!!!!,"This movie can only be described in 1 word: WOW!!! Finally a horror movie that is original, and not a remake of classics or foreign films. Whoever rated this movie a 1 to me are just complete morons. Even if if you didn't enjoy it, it Definitely did not deserve a 1. This movie contained suspense, superb acting, and a fantastic script. I neverthought children at that age can act so realistically. The movie's twist is up there with the ending of Saw and Sleepaway Camp. If you are looking a great roller-coaster ride watch this. Do one of the two things: either watch in theaters or wait till it comes out on DVD and watch on a big screen with blue ray. For those of who compare it to the Omen, I don't agree. As far as the genre and plot, if anything it is closer to The Good Son but better. Can't wait for the Blue Ray DVD.

Cliché,"So there are two good things about this film and I will start with them. First, it creates a good atmosphere and causes the viewer emotions of sympathy for the ""good guys"" and fear and anger for the ""bad guy"". Second, it contains a clever twist that could not be foreseen, although some guesses will come close. Then, there's the bad things. This film is full of every cliché in the book. Every character you have ever seen in a similar film in the past is present. The one person who suspects the truth but whose skeletons in the closet make them non-credible. The person who is completely ignorant to the truth and thinks the other is crazy. The one who knows the truth but is swayed into not telling anything. And the one who decides to expose the truth and pays for it. And the villain who is evil for the sake of being evil and does evil things because they are so very evil. If one removes the sentiment of deja-vu that this film casts on its viewers, what is left is a film that maintains a certain degree of interest but has nothing to offer that has not been done before and better. Granted, the acting is credible, the cinematography is good and the ending is satisfying. However, there are just so many clichés in this film that half-way through, any experienced viewer of the genre will have figured the rest of the film out, with the exception of the one clever twist.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A clever, twisted, campy and fun Horror film!","Orphan could have played it one of two ways. Either a subtle, psychological suspense thriller or a campy, funny and very entertaining horror-revenge film. While it has elements of both, it mostly chooses the latter, and for that I am glad. While I do like some slow, creepy films, I always feel that when it comes to horror plots like these, we need to have fun. The screenplay does have it's amount of clichés, but it plays them out in such enjoyable and devilish ways that I did not mind. The film does have it's touching moments, and when it does, it is very effective, mostly because of Vera Farmiga. She gives a great performance here, adding a lot of heart and depth into this film, and adding a tone of seriousness. Isabelle Fuhrman is also very impressive, and her performance is wickedly enjoyable. Both of these actresses deserve some award buzz at least. Peter Sarsgaard is good, but his character really annoyed me to no end. I went off the rails when he did not believe Kate, but of course, it was all done for the purpose of the story. The film contains some decent amount of humor, which I loved. Some genuinely funny scenes in this film. The director Jaume Collet-Serra really knew how to play with this film, and how to give audiences what they wanted. The twist was WICKED! Of course, I knew it beforehand, since this twist is bound to be let out, but very clever twist. Orphan is a very entertaining, very fun thriller/horror that is more action and less suspense.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This girl is giving this family a nightmare. The woman's husband is constantly protecting this girl against his wife. Horror and suspense elements are used well in the movie.

"Surprisingly entertaining, shocking twist ending","In a world where horror movies have pushed the gore dial to 11, there is little that shocks and scares anymore. This film has scary in spades. Visually, of course, there are your standard creepy fare; large foreboding house, children that should have been named ""ominous"" and tension building soundtrack. The psychological thrill from this movie however, comes from the fact that the child actors performances are all 10s. This isn't a case of Star Wars: Episode I, far from it. Esther (played by Isabelle Fuhrman) is deeply engaging and complex. Of course we know the premise of the movie, she is evil! But rather than take the easy way out and use music and creative editing to hint at her intentions, the acting stands all on its own.Some friends and I went to see a sneak preview yesterday and we were not expecting much. When we were an hour into the film, everyone in the theater was engaged with the plot. The script makes you feel for all the characters, even Esther. Each member of the family has some kind of vice that fits perfectly into the story, and getting the audience up to speed with the family's current problems was done effortlessly. And to round out all the frights, there's plenty of laughs to keep the mood from getting too dark.All in all, a very well balanced, highly entertaining and unique film.

But why did the writer make a very very stupid husband character?He is so passive, dull, blindly trust Esther, and blindly untrust the wife..
Very annoying and stupid character, who makes the plot story very annoying too..If the husband character was kinda wise and objective, the story will end very quick..
But because of that character, the story develops very annoyingly..
I guess that's what the writer wants..And also why max and Daniel didn't tell the mom?They can easily tell the mom secretly and then they together tell the stupid husband, maybe during Esther school time, so that she doesn't know...And the story can finish peacefully..But once again, I think the writer want s the viewers got annoyed in the entire of the story..Other than that, the other aspects are quite good..",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I have not seen a decent horror film in a long time, but this one is definitely worth the money. Be sure to use the restrooms before the start of the movie, as it is very riveting and suspenseful. Except for one sex scene between the husband and wife, this film can be viewed by mature children accompanied by an adult. It is very well written, and well-balanced. Personally I found this film very entertaining, suspenseful, and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else, this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses, her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly.

Gripping till the climax!! One of the best horror movies since The omen.,"Orphan is the biggest relief for horror fans after a very long time. Period!!Note: I'm not going to reveal any suspense here.The movie does not contain much gore or violence or cheap horror which most of the horror movies do (sadly!)This movie I rented after seeing an ad on HBO ( I don't want movies in HBO as they cut a lot) . I don't remember this ever being released in India.Coming to the movie. The movie scares you building atmospheric tension like many successful first class movies like The omen(1976.. not 2006 ) , The exorcist, Yaavarum nalam (13B ).The casting is excellent! Especially Isabelle Fuhrman (just 10) , Vera Farmiga and Aryana Engineer ( who played the hearing impaired kid).The movie storyline is revealed much in the trailer; ""Family adopts a girl and something is wrong about her"".The story of how each person gets suspicion about Esther, is given more detail and in a tensed way. The ways of finding more truth about Esther is done slow and makes us gripped to the story.The twists are few but will surely blow your mind!!The sceneries are perfect. The cold weather and snow covered locations add more chill to the movie.I can't write any more as they will just reveal much about the movie.

"Chilling, Mysterious & Delightfully Creepy","A confidently crafted, patiently narrated & brilliantly acted psychological horror that makes terrific use of available resources to create a sense of foreboding, Orphan brings its chilling, mysterious & delightfully creepy tale to life with incredible restraint, and is a much welcome entry in the world of horror that manages to effectively sustain its ominous atmosphere from the first frame to the last.The story of Orphan concerns a couple who are coping with the recent loss of their unborn child, and decide to adopt one from the local orphanage. Enchanted by the grown-up demeanour of a 9- year old Russian girl, they decide to make her the newest member of their family. Things go quite smooth for a while but soon, a series of disturbing events start unfolding in & around their house.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, whose latest feature film was The Shallows, Orphan places much more emphasis on creating an aura that reeks of mystery & palpable tension rather than relying on jump scares to deliver the chills. Collet-Serra keeps the narrative tight & engaging throughout its runtime, and the script is no slouch either, for its characters are embedded with some personality.Further amplifying its grim tone & unsettling feel is its remote setting & cold surroundings. Camera is expertly utilised on the set and its fluid movements, controlled zooms & sharp focus add shades of its own while the cold colour palette & apt lighting further enhance those images. Editing keeps the pace consistent from beginning to end while John Ottman's muted score silently complements the narrative.Coming to the performances, Orphan features a fabulous cast in Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard & Isabelle Fuhrman, with the ladies stealing the show with effortless ease. Farmiga plays the role of wife & mother in accordance with the scene requirements and contributes with a well-measured input. Sarsgaard does well with what he's given, while Fuhrman is absolutely diabolical in her role and her performance is equally eerie & compelling.On an overall scale, Orphan begins with a nightmarish sequence and concludes on a violent note, but keeps the plot consistently tense & gripping in the middle. The ending isn't entirely satisfying, for it heads into a familiar territory and becomes quite predictable but the positives do outweigh the negatives in this well-made chiller and Isabelle Fuhrman's knockout rendition single-handedly elevates it above your average horror film. Definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Esther, the little girl in the movie, freaked me out, but I gotta be honest with you - not as much as that Peter Sarsguaard fella.

Twisted Film with Depraved Undertones,"By all means never never let children see this film. I was drawn into an early morning viewing of Orphan when I saw Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard in an initial scene. They are marvelous actors and typically in movies worth watching, and, at first, the plot seemed intriguing. Then the movie starts spinning its tale of this evil child worse than the Omen's Damien. But that's not what makes the film awful, it's the manipulation of both the children and the audience as it builds the beyond belief evilness of the title character.On top of the depravity towards the end of the film which I will not ""spoil"" nor do I want to discuss further, the film deteriorates into down right silliness, which would make you laugh if it weren't so morbid.

entertaining little horror flick,"I saw this movie last night and despite mixed reviews (some were positive to the point of excellent whilst some denounced it as boring trash with a silly secret) i was pleasantly surprised at the decency of this movie - I'm not calling it a masterpiece, I've seen better movies in general, but nor would i rubbish it either. The twist ending is in fact not the best part of 'Orphan'... despite the ending being quite intelligent and original. The movie develops in two distinct halves, the first part we have a very subtle, psychological, dark film with emphasis placed on characterisation, we see and understand the motivations behind the characters and in terms of letting the mood develop, it has a dark, edgy vibe that works well, ditto the creepy Esther is introduced to us and she proceeds to intrigue us, whilst we learn nothing about her. The second part of the movie moves on from the subtleness and into terror, as we begin to see exactly what this little girl is all about. The violence eventually goes over the top and in the end, it becomes incomprehensible, but OTT cannot ruin what came before, the early parts of the film an excellent way to utilise suspense in an interesting and intriguing manner. Overall I'm giving the movie 7/10, the story was good and kept me interested, whilst the performance from 12year old Isabelle Furhmann as Esther is astonishing. that child is definitely one to watch.

An excellent movie that only gets lost right in the end.,"This thriller tells the story of a couple who, unable to have more children, decides to adopt a child and gives preference to a seemingly intelligent and docile Russian girl, but she quickly turns out to be much more dangerous than she looks. I loved the story, the central idea of ​​the plot and the way the film develops it in an increasingly clear mood of tension and discomfort. The film does not scare, it prefers to leave us groundless, uncomfortable and worried, easily creating a link between the audience and the main female character, Kate (Vera Farmiga). The final twist plot also pleased me a lot, being something really unexpected and intense. Unfortunately, the film gets lost after that, with an unrealistic and predictable ending. Farmiga is undoubtedly the most notorious actress, with a very psychological and strong interpretation; Isabelle Fuhrman also shone as Esther, alternating between intoxicating sweetness and absolute insensitivity.

"such films can change the history of thrillers ..amazing ,,!!!","orphan starts like any other thriller,however it develops into something addictive, tasteful. and not clichéd that will force you to watch and leave with u with nothing but great respect for the cast that have delivered the best ,some films were made in the last few years with the same suburban concept but none had succeeded in staying with the viewer like this masterpiece .what helped achieve the success is the original script and how deep it was and how it created the characters rather than the shallow tackling that we see in horror thrillers in which every role has limited part to play and could never be charismatic like the cast of orphan . Vera Farmiga was amazing and believable . the little girl was also original . cinematography did justice to the story and added more mystery and suspense which in-return made the cast look valid and relevant . i recommend this film to anyone who is after original thrillers ,juicy stories ,and acting that will haunt you for weeks .just give it a chance and you will see . thanks for reading this .",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
hmm...Another Russian villain,"The movie isn't about a 9 year old orphan. They lied to you.Here's something to think about. In a way, adopted parents manipulate orphans first, promising love and a family. The movie premise is actually pretty good, the execution is just meh.I started to get annoyed at the film. Some critical information, like he background, needed to be presented sooner.For a movie titled the orphan, we hardly know anything about her until the very end.I literally can't find a similar film, where the person that survives at the end, is a male character. It's always a femaleOrphan 2009 is an overrated mediocre slasher film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best straight horror film in quite a while,"When I was younger, I was a scaredy-cat when it came to a great many movies. I saw Peter Jackson's The Frighteners at a young age which left me with a solid week worth of sleepless nights, I was terrified of the evil vines in Jumanji and I even had a fear of serial snipers after watching Dirty Harry. However as I grew, I became braver and less haunted even by horror films until I finally became numb to almost everything. Certainly the odd scene of a fright flick would give me a start and perhaps even a bad dream, but few films have been able to recapture the restless nights of my youth. Until I saw Orphan.While perhaps not as great a compliment as it once was with Hollywood's iron grip on the horror industry, Orphan is the downright creepiest and most frightening pure horror film in a many, many years. The Orphanage (similar name a coincidence, I assure you) from last year gave me some haunted evenings but is more of a dramatic thriller. Countless films have capitalized on the evil child angle as a platform for the scares, in fact with the now even more relatively awful The Unborn coming out this very year. But those who have crafted such a film intelligently and to a genuinely disturbing end are sparse and in between. In the case of Orphan a much of this success is due to young Isabelle Furhman, who gives an incredibly intense and disturbingly authentic portrayal as Esther, the Russian orphan. Complimenting that role are four other outstanding performances by Aryana Engineer and Jimmy Bennett as Esther's now sister and brother, and Vera Farmiga and Peter Starsgaard as the adopting parents. If there have been better performances in a horror film I haven't been privy.Finally recovering after the devastating loss of their unborn child, Kate and John Coleman (Farmiga and Starsgaard) feel it is time to welcome some new life into their home and settle on the different but charming and incredible gifted 10 year old Esther. Things could not be better for this broken family, Esther bonds immediately with young Max who is a mute, and fits wonderfully in with her two loving parents. But then, strange occurrences begin to arise, and Esther always seems to be there and soon Kate begins to think, as the movie's tagline of the film implies, there's something wrong with her.In almost every horror film ever made, we have a central protagonist who is scoffed at by everyone and their mother at their wild claims of a killer, an alien, strange occurrences etc. In Orphan it is Kate who is the sole voice of desperation, but what makes this film work besides the wonderful acting job by Farmiga is the back-story of loss and her former alcoholism which sheds doubts on her suspicions. This coupled with Esther's seemingly endless cunning and manipulation of Kate's children makes for a frustratingly disturbing series of events. Director Juan Collet-Serra, who helmed 2005's House of Wax, chooses to keep the gore restrained, tension high and focus on some equally tragic human elements about a broken marriage and what broke it apart. Collet-Serra holds no punches, and is unafraid to go all the way into truly disturbing territory and includes many elements of the anti-Hollywood horror film and is fairly light on the clichés. The final twist is shocking (if you say you knew it you're lying) and brilliantly explains all the former questions the audience demands. Be warned, just because Orphan is not as bloody as some makes it no less disturbing and I applaud its ability to give me an uneasy sleep and a shot of much needed nostalgia.Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nice little thriller with a good twist.,"From that 70's horror classic that started it all (The Omen), right up until 2009's ""Case 39"", the 'evil kid' plot line has been steadily evolving into a whole new genre. As such, we have seen several times before, how a cute and apparently sweet child manipulates and brutally murders all that stands in the way of a pre-conceived, albeit evil plan. Having just watched ""Case 39"" recently, I was expecting the same experience here. Boy, was I wrong! Unlike the aforementioned films, what works here is the strength of stellar acting combined with a plot that escalates into a crescendo of suspense. David Leslie Johnson's script starts with a horrific prologue where the lovely and very talented Vera Farmiga is heavily pregnant, as Kate Coleman. In the presence of her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), their third pregnancy ends in a bloody mess, quite literally. Although a vital segment of the plot, I must say the prologue has a very B movie feel to it, made worse with soft focus camera work, confusing the viewer into believing this to be Kate's nightmare. But apparently it did happen, and almost a year later, Kate is still suffering the loss of what would have been their third child. In filling an ever increasing void, Kate and John decide to adopt Esther, a 9 year old Russian orphan with remarkable charm and intellect for her age. As Esther settles into her new home, her bond with Kate's deaf-mute daughter is instantaneous, while her step-brother is less cordial and is the first to sense her ominous personality. Before long, Esther turns out to be an odd-ball in school, even as Kate discovers at an alarming rate, that adopting her may have been a bad decision. On the other hand, John disagrees, causing a rift between the couple and opening old wounds. Just as the situation starts to boil over, Kate uncovers Esther's deep dark secret and must do all she can to protect the lives of her family.After slipping under the radar, past his directional debut remaking ""House of Wax"" (2005, featuring Paris Hilton), Jaume Collet-Serra re-emerges here darker and stronger in only his third film and second attempt at the horror/thriller genre. From a directional standpoint, Collet-Serra delivers a neatly done package, complete with tight acting, solid build up of suspense through great pacing, and a perfectly timed twist most viewers won't see coming. His pacing of the plot allows enough time for considerable character development. Essentially, this is what draws us into the lives of Kate and John and their little family, up until they adopt Esther. After this point, the pace increases with a lot of focus (or obscurity) into the mystery behind Esther and her motives. Not but until the end, when the twist emerges, are we left guessing Esther's true motives and origins: evil incarnate or just a child deprived of affection. Either or neither, the answer is astounding, and Johnson's concept is fresh, despite our temptation to compare Esther with Macaulay Culkin's sinister Henry Evans, in ""The Good Son"". Collet-Serra also dares to go where other directors tread lightly, especially since the very nature of this film is taboo when considering the storm it has stirred amongst parents with adopted children. Then there is the controversy of what a child actor can and cannot do or say in front of a camera. Again, this is what differentiates ""Orphan"" from similar films, because the direction here is bold, structured and clever, and pushes all boundaries. Of all the positives I can think of, the list topper will definitely have to be the exceptional performances from Farmiga and little known Isabelle Fuhrman as the antagonist. I will let you be the judge when I say that Fuhrman steals the show from the moment you see her and carries that uncanny charisma all through to the end. Step aside Dakota Fanning; make way for Isabelle Fuhrman as a force to reckon with. Aside from these two, Sarsgaard puts in his usual sleepy-eyed performance but is shadowed by Aryana Engineer as the couple's deaf-mute daughter; good input from another child actor.All said and done, the near perfect script is not without some blaring clichés and unnecessary tributes. As with most recent thrillers, you can expect some jumpy moments, predictable one-liners and that chilly atmosphere snowy cinematography gives to horror thrillers. Co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, look out for a scene here in tribute to his final scene in ""Titanic"". Farmiga's one-liner in the last scene is also reminiscent of Harrison Ford 'kicking' Gary Oldman off his airplane in ""Air Force One"". While most viewers may find this movie original enough to be conceptually shocking, there will those who may find it a tad bit contrived. Even so, this is a movie about children, and for the most part, acted out by children. But given the MPAA rating of R, this one is strictly adults only.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scary film, greatly acted, and enjoyed every minute!","This film at first was something I did not want to see. I am adopted and I really thought it gave adoption a bad name.That being said I have finally seen this film tonight when it came to the dollar show by me. I figured if it did what I thought it was going to do and make adoption look bad I wouldn't be mad losing a dollar.I was amazed by this film. It actually shows the dark side of family life as it is today. A lot of families probably go through some of the things this family went through though not all at once.The girl who plays Esther did such a remarkable job I cannot wait to see her in something else.Although I wanted to strangle the parents through most of the movie for being such idiots in life and not deserving children to begin with it makes you think Thank god that isn't my family.Made me wonder how some people even get through the system and end up able to adopt. Those people should have NEVER been able to.GREAT movie though and the twist I NEVER saw coming. I thought this was just an updated version of the BAD SEED. But NOPE BAM! SHOCKER! Definitely a must see! I did see a family bring 3 kids who looked about 14, 12 & 8. DO NOT BRING ANYONE UNDER 16 YEARS OLD. It is rated R for a reason people!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The story and the plot twist were so good, original and unique.To me Esther's secret was spoiled before I went to see the movie (I wont do that), so I didn't think It would carry enough suspense for me, but it did anyway. If the secret had not been spoiled, I would have died of a heart attack with all tense. I have never seen a horror/thriller that could give me so many scares and heart stopping moments.

"Evil Adoption Roller Coaster Ride, well worth the ticket!","Caught this on DVD, got it from Blockbuster's discount rack...which is never a good sign. That said, I have to tell you...this was a fun, fun ride! It's a horror film that knows just the right doses of information and set up, it's a simple story that takes on some complicated issues and does such a fantastic job of it all.The little actress who plays Esther, the orphan of the title, is so amazing she puts all the other actors in the cast to shame. How she will ever move on to another role is almost impossible to imagine, but with as much talent as she has on display here I'd be willing to wager she'll do it, and that she has an Oscar in her future acting endeavors.I'm sure it's not easy to be an orphan looking for adoptive parents, and this film will not make it any easier! When a young couple decided to take in a little girl they get far more than they bargained for and soon, people start turning up dead and those who aren't dead...are in constant jeopardy! It's an adoption roller coaster ride with a twist ending I will not mention here as it was one of my favorite bits in the film...makes the girl allllll the creepier.Thumbs up all around, except Peter Sarsgaard, who I must admit I've never been a fan of. He seems to be working so hard all the time, and I'm of the opinion the acting should be unnoticed...and if it is, it should at least look easy. Sarsgaard turns acting into a backbreaking chore...and over the course of a 90 minute film the audience starts to take on some of that work. He's more or less put to shame by Isabelle Furhman's Esther.I hate to heap too much praise on the film, not because it doesn't deserve it...but so as not to raise the bar too much for those of you who haven't seen it yet. I suspect part of what I loved so much about it was I wasn't expecting much and then discovered a little gem.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan,"GREAT! This movie kicks other horror movies' asses. It has a great plot, with secrets that you'll never guess. :) Esther is 9, and is adopted by Jon and Kate, who just lost a child. Once she starts to move in...things basically go downhill from there (in one part, things literally go downhill). The performances I enjoyed the most in this movie were by Vera Farmiga and Isabelle Fuhrman. Isabelle Fuhrman's character Esther has a great Russian accent (probably since she actually is Russian). They built up suspension so you know exactly what the extremely clever Esther is capable of. Vera Farmiga's character, Kate, is the one who everyone doesn't believe. She is the one who thinks Esther is bad...which isn't good, since Esther will take down anyone in her path.Overall, ORPHAN was a very well done movie. 9.5/10 P.S. the fact that the movie took place in the winter was great to enhance the look of the blood and was greatly used later in the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hands down the best thriller I've seen this year.,"I've seen a few thrillers over the years of visiting the theater but none of them really captured my interest or gripped me like wet rope. When I first saw the trailers for this, I thought ""I am so gonna see this"" so I came into this with high expectations. And you know what? This film not only met them but exceeded them tremendously. Most thrillers jump straight into the film with no build up; here it makes a huge impression by letting us get to know the characters and their inner struggles nicely sprinkled with interesting back stories that gives the film added gravity. I suppose some are impatient to the slow build up but I had no problem at all of the film going from a slow start and it really pays off. No thriller has ever kept me on the edge of my seat like this one. It's intelligently directed and written with best performances; the real standout being of course Isabel Furhman, who gives one hell of a villainous role that rivals that of Kathy Bates's character in ""Misery"". One of the best parts of the film is the visual cues during certain scenes that are clearly a reflection of the dark inner psyche of a truly tormented ""young"" soul. I'm not gonna spoil any plot details in this review but I will say that you should definitely see ""Orphan"" because it's one of the best psychological thrillers of the year.10 stars all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I just can't understand why anyone liked this movie.,"I just came from the theater and I'm so frustrated I don't know where to start. This is the first time i write a review in IMDb because the movie was so bad i need to express it and share it with someone.I will try not to write any spoilers in case you still want to see the movie after reading this.The hole plot of the movie is a copy of ""The good son"", except that it has a girl instead of a boy, and that it is much worse in every sense. The problem is not the acting, its the script. If you expect a horror movie: It's not scary at all, the only way they try to scare you is with cheap and lame ""jump"" scenes that add nothing to the plot, and make not much sense at all.If you expect an intelligent drama: The plot itself is lame, most of the characters are plain stupid, they act in ways people with at least two neurons wouldn't. I heard many times in the theater people saying ""how can this guy be so stupid to do that?"". This makes it impossible for you to feel pity for them when and if they die. The problem is that every single character acts stupid.I usually don't see the twists coming in movies, but in this movie i could see most twists from a hundred miles away... all so cliché.If you like not-believable movies, with dumb characters, predictable twists, and slow pace.... then this is the movie for you.Otherwise, don't spend any money in this or you will feel scammed like me.Thank you for reading this and letting my frustration go out.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Horror film, born again","(sorry about the approximate language, I'm nor American nor English)Remember how in the 70's horror movies were all about tearing down consensus and social values?Well this one does it quite well.I don't have children yet, but most of my friends and family have. Don't watch this if you have kids.I've seen a lot of twisted and sick films (eg:irreversible, centipede, Serbian film, etc...none of which I recommend unless you feel like having your soul and spirit f**ked with, but then again you have to be curious about everything about life), but I found this one unrelentless.It's pretty long too, so get ready for anything.It's not gory or anything but it's psychologically very violent and harassing, it destroys family values in a way that anything I've ever seen so far never did. As a horror film (and it is a horror film), it hits the spot.Very well made, the actors, cinematography and production are top notch, which makes it all the more unsettling. Even the storyline is uncommonly well written, especially if you are used to clichéd and poorly spewed bullcrap the last ten years of horror flicks have fed us up with. I'll try not to spoil anything, but it's about this cute little orphan that finds a new family.Sounds like Hollywood feelgood crap, but it's all the opposite.Hence, once again, a brilliant horror film. There are quite a few aspects I didn't feel comfortable with, so this is why I feel it's a great horror movie. It's not made to make you feel comfortable. HERE BE SPOILERS------------ 1/ As with The Exorcist, it's pretty weird watching a film were a child does everything he's not meant to do. I felt sorry for the kid (Esther) that went through all of this, and I hope she didn't really understand the cruelty and sheer evil she had to portray. This movie deals with such cruel and merciless concepts that it's bound to leave a youngster scarred for life (if she got it, and I'm afraid she has). 2/ I can't help but feel the director has some serious issues with women, and his relationship with them. I found it was profoundly misogynistic.But he (the director, sorry can't remember his name) manages to get away with it by having a very strong female counterpart (allthough not the best actor in the film, but close).That was smart, otherwise he would have had his head caved in by bloodthirsty femen (BTW, I'm a dude).This bugged me throuhout the film and apart from a few moments were ""suspension of disbelief"" tended to fade away (but the plot is smart enough so that by the end twist, it kinda makes sense), I found it was one of the best horror film I've seen in years. Maybe in decades.Brilliant, smart, filled with meanings about human (female?) perversity, it's definitely a must see for all you f*ùked-up horror fans fans out there that were wondering if the genre hadn't died 15 years ago.I didn't expect much of it at first, and in this way it was very efficient. Without the gender bashing issue, this would have got a 7 by my book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock-Esquire Thriller,"Watched this expecting a so-so remake of ""Bad Seed The"" but was Very surprised and glad how wrong I was. You already know its abut adoption and the child is bad but that does not even begin to scratch the surface of this MAJOR spine chiller. ""Silence of the Lambs"" creepy? 8MM creepy? Big yes, but in a different way this is creepier. No shat, really. The major surprise is so mind blowing I was stunned! This movie and story is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock.

A very different kind of horror movie,"After seen that mediocre (to put it lightly ), unoriginal and full of gore horror movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday THE 13TH receive very good comments (and even get remade ) I quit the genre until I was invited to the pre-screening of ORPHAN and was greatly surprised. ORPHAN was directed by an European director I barely heard about; Jaume Collet-Serra (and I see hundreds of European movies every year). He directed GOAL II a movie and HOUSE OF WAX. I saw part of the first in a plane years ago; without paying much attention because I am not fond of sports movies. To my surprise; ORPHAN does not rely on easy scares or heavy gore to get the thrills. It uses kids as the main victims; and just for that we are already frightened; but the perfectly staged scenes involving them like the tree house or the car going down the cliff are the most terrifying scenes I saw in years. Pure cinema and camera work. This is an American produced movie with European pace. Is more interested in create suspense; as it will become horror later; thus the two hours direction.If this movie has a problem are very little. The tension becomes exhausting sometimes; however there are not fillings; just a lot of ideas and a crescendo that obviously require some extra time. The end is sadly on USA standards and damages and almost perfect movie; but it will probably satisfy most of the public",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Finally, an excellent mainstream horror...and its actually original!","When I first saw the trailer for this I did not think much of it, it just looked like an average slasher with a little girl as the villain. But I was totally wrong, this is a horror, yes, but it is more of a drama/horror than straight horror. Not only does it go for two hours (very rare for a horror film, especially mainstream), but it has a great cast who portray characters with some depth who we actually care about...well, most of them anyway. The story itself is very simple, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) have two children, but lost their third child during pregnancy. Therefore, they decide to adopt, and while at the orphanage stumble across a nine year old girl on her own, Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Both Kate and John bond with her instantly, and three weeks later she is part of the family. However, it does not take long before Esther's dark side shows, and the only person who sees this is the mother, but who would suspect innocent Esther of foul play? This is the set-up for a suspenseful, dark, disturbing horror film that packs an excellent twist and some truly frightening scenes. There is an excellent scene in a playground, in which Esther stalks a bully through a maze, and a very tense final ten minutes which I shan't reveal! However, these scenes feature some cheap false scares accompanied by a loud sound. These are very tired, and for most horror fans are not the least bit effective. It is a shame they are relied on throughout this movie, because director Jaume Collet-Serra (who directed the 2005 slasher remake of House of Wax) builds up tension very well, but spoils with scares which are hokey and outdated.That was really my only problem with the film, nothing else bothered me at all. If I were to nitpick, Sarsgaard's John Coleman was written to be a little to naive I think, because it was fairly obvious that Esther was troubled. This is not Sarsgaard's fault, he does a great job, this was the writer's one and only fault.The acting was outstanding, Farmiga is excellent as the mother. She basically carries the movie, and plays a strong female character who is easy to sympathise with. It is revealed she drunk after the death of her baby which led to an unfortunate accident. Not only does this lead almost everyone else to think ill of her, but leaves her to unravel Esther's past by herself. Fuhrman is simply amazing as Esther, playing a two-sided character so well at such a young age is kind of scary. Going from sweet little angel to scary-as-shite murderess is her specialty, and I can see her in many horror movies to come.Many people say Orphan loses momentum towards the end and turns into a derivative slasher, but I could not disagree more. I think the end is perfect, with the twist being revealed with perfect timing to allow for a heart-racing finale. It ended perfectly, and even better, in a way which does not indicate sequel (I hate sequel-friendly endings very much).Although it is not a perfect movie, it is a damn entertaining one, and for a horror movie, is surprisingly intelligent. It does go for awhile, but no scenes drag on, they all have a purpose in developing character and heightening the tension until the very end.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If you're a horror fan you'll like Esther...,"If one watches enough horror movies, one gets to know the territory pretty well.

Nevertheless, despite many similarities to the usual cliché-bound dime-a-dozen penny-dreadfuls one sees so much of in the course of exploring the horror genre, this movie actually has something. The acting is good-to-excellent and the script and direction suspenseful above the average, but there's an extra element of uncertainty which makes it genuinely creepy.

"Well directed, acted and written--one of the best recent horror films...","ISABELLE FUHRMAN, VERA FARMIGA and PETER SARSGAARD are hardly household names to me but they do a superb job of carrying the main suspense ingredients of ORPHAN--as does the atmospheric photography filmed among snowy Canadian landscapes.So do all the other members of the cast--all very convincing in their roles, especially the little deaf girl ARYANA ENGINEER. She's adorable and becomes a pawn in the manipulations of Esther (Fuhrman), the orphan adopted into the household before a background check can reveal the truth about her past.Of course, anyone familiar with the pattern of most horror films of this ilk can spot some of the usual set-ups: a husband who is clueless about seriously suspecting the orphan can be evil, the wife whom nobody believes because she has a drinking problem, the little brother who resents the intrusion of a ""different"" kind of girl, the well meaning nun whose social worker instincts will lead to her downfall.But many other aspects of the plot come as a surprise and are, to say the least, unexpected and shockingly gruesome.And some threads of the plot can be suspected pretty early on. Still, the final twist at the end is shocking and satisfying, thanks to the performance Fuhrman has so convincingly given. She plays the role with such sweet and sometimes sinister maturity that the final revelation is acceptable.ORPHAN delivers the chills, all staged brilliantly and turning it into a horror film that is just as chilly as the ever snowy weather with frozen ponds and feathery flakes making the indoor sets of a rustic cabin look most inviting.Good direction and superior art decoration, as well as strong performances, makes this an above average thriller.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I liked it, but I don't know why","So a couple adopts a young girl and she turns out to be a psycho. I am not about to delve into the plot, but I will highlight my thoughts on this film.I'll start with the good. Above all, this film works because it is different. In probably the most predictable and lackluster genres these days, Orphan definitely stands out, purely because it is different. Now that is not to say that it doesn't have clichés, as it is full of them. But the idea of having the killer being part of your family is something new that I really appreciated. Next, I thought the performance by Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays the killer orphan, Esther, to be fantastic. I was taken aback by how she nailed everything from the believability right down to the accent. I also loved Aryana Engineer, who plays the sister, Max. Now this may be because she is just so adorable, but I'm fine with it either way.Now, for the bad. The twist. The over-hyped ridiculously outrageous twist. Was it original? Yes. Did I like it? No. Twist endings for me almost always make or break the film. Thankfully, however bad the twist was, it did not break this film. But come on. I am not going to give the twist away, but let's just say it made no sense at all. I feel that twist endings should be used for films that can be watched and understood differently on multiple viewings. For example, Fight Club, the Sixth Sense, and Shutter Island would be some films with twist endings that really work. After knowing the twist ending in Orphan, it makes the film seem really stupid. Alright, besides the twist, the dialog was poor and unrealistic in quite a few scenes. The jump scare scenes were pretty bad as well, especially considering half of them were fake jump scenes.So the film was far from perfect, but I still enjoyed it for some reason. Hopefully this will be the start of some good new horror scripts coming out soon. Probably not, but we can always hope.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Female Damian manipulates,"Trying to forget that this film remains another version of an old ""formula"" (psycho "" child"" and a family in danger) and the stupidity of the main male character (even though it's obvious that something go wrong with this child from the beginning of the film), there is still a good effort from an unknown (to me) director with a nearly clever twist at the end and sub plots that focused on the characters and their reactions. An entertaining psychological (and horrible in a good way) thriller with an above-average believable performance from Farmiga as the adoptive mother (and very sexy too). P.S. I prefer the alternate ending",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best Thriller movies i've seen in ages! In fact probably the best!,"I saw the trailer for ""Orphan"" a while back. I remember thinking it would just be another decent Thriller/Horror movie, but, boy, was I wrong! The actress who plays Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, is so talented! Finally, a kid who knows how to act! She was so good and talented and spooky! All the acting was good, all round! It's the story of a Mother and a Father who decide to finally adopt a child. They already have children of their own, but they decide to want to adopt. So they came out of the Orphange with a girl called Esther. Cute girl, well mannered, but little do they know there's something very wrong with her. For example, injuring school bullies, threatening to kill people etc. The direction was great and the story builds itself nicely into a nice unexpected twist.Great thriller movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of thing! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Nothing great, but not horrible.","Alright, this is the FIRST time IMDb actually failed me. This movie is not a 7.2. I think what happened here is some kids found out how to use IMDb ratings from their parents and began to soak up some bandwidth with horribly proportioned reviews. So let's set the record straight.This movie was not 7.2. I consider something from IMDb with a 7+ to be pretty amazing. My own score is a 6, because it's nothing I'd go out of my own wallet to see again or really enjoy watching twice. However if a buddy wants to turn it on during a boring point of the day or night, it's not gonna make you want to rip your own face off.First off let's just state the obvious. This movie has NO SCARY PARTS in it. I like to think I am very easily scared. I didn't jump at all. I looked to my brother and asked 'who the hell said this was scary?' and he replied, 'I think it's supposed to be suspenseful.' Wrong. I was more so laughing and commentating through the bulk of the movie.Second Off, this isn't a rip off of the Omen or the good son. The ending of this movie is what made it jump from a 4 to a 6. If you see the ending coming, good for you. I didn't see it coming (although I wasn't getting to involved with the story) and it was a pretty awesome revelation.The characters were also well done. I enjoyed every character and each one served their purpose. This movie also doesn't give the heroes a butt ton of ex-machina (like most movies seem to have plenty in stock). Nope, they generally do it to it on their own without the help of crappy writers, which make the more tense situations, more believable.Either way, this movie isn't all that, but it certainly isn't horrible either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Outstanding - Esther will freak you out!,"A remarkable thriller- What a breath of fresh air. This story has so many twist and turns I was drained midway. Peter Saarsgard and Vera Farmiga give remarkable performances - kudos for these two indie gems as you shine bright in this picture. Don't want to give anything away for its one of those pictures that you really have to go into it not knowing as much as you can about it. That's why I chose to avoid reading reviews. From the trailers, I knew I would be in for a special treat. I think JOSHUA (the kid from the film JOSHUA) and Esther would made a wonderful couple! What I specially loved about this movie is how well written and orchestrated it was. It all made good sense while it kept you on your toes guessing what was going to happen next. This is the sort of materials good movies and made of and to all those critics who panned this film, its time to retire! obviously you have been going at it for so long you don't know good from bad anymore!

"""Do you want to play?""","She calls herself Esther. She wears ribbons round her wrists. And she gives the whole concept of adoption a bad name. (No way is this film a sly dig at a certain pop star.) Overshadowed by some ludicrous controversy, and undermined by a cheesy ad campaign – ""You'll never guess her secret""? Let's define 'never' in the age of Google, shall we? – the real reveal is how much fun this psycho-thriller actually is.Like its subject, Orphan's a precocious brat of a movie, boasting smart subtexts and performances that have no right being as good as they are, including a genuinely disquieting turn from Isabelle Fuhrman. Little girls, of course, are absolutely terrifying. That's why Kubrick used not one but two of them in The Shining.Only trouble is, like all little show-offs, it eventually starts playing up, pratting about, and ultimately outstays its welcome.

"Maybe the scariest evil kid movie since ""The Omen""","""The Good Son"", ""Joshua"", ""The Children""... I don't really have high expectation when it comes to evil kids movies. In my opinion, people are scared way too quickly by ""creepy"" kids. The plots of those movies are often stupid, the kids themselves underwhelming in their supposed creepiness. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, however, has managed to breathe some fresh air into the concept with last year's ""Orphan"".The movie isn't scary so much as it is thrilling. It's actually more in the tradition of films like ""Night Of The Hunter"" or ""The Stepfather"", in which an outsider joins a perfectly fine family and destroys it from the inside. Of course, in ""Orphan"" the new family member isn't a grown up, strong man, but an apparently lovable 9-year-old called Esther (played by the astonishing Isabelle Fuhrmann who jumps back and forth between cute and evil as naturally as if she was already an old veteran in the business).Sure, it's a story we've seen many times before, but Collet-Serra puts her own spin on it. She takes a long, but never boring time to set the plot up and fills every frame with atmosphere. The main characters are believable (for the most part) and played well by Peter Sarsgaard and the always great Vera Farmiga. On top of that, ""Orphan"" has a twist that I didn't see coming. Maybe it's got to do with the fact that I knew very little about the movie beforehand and didn't expect any twist at all. I still found it to be an enjoyable little extra to the end, and it's actually kinda creepy, too.""Orphan"" isn't anything special, but it's a more than solid thriller. For an evil child flick it comes pretty close to being a masterpiece. Just steer clear of making any sequels, please.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One word-moronic,"There comes a point when people should be banned from making movies. When you make an atrocity like ""Orphan"", there is no redemption. I really don't know where to start.

Or even better, sickening flirtation with child pornography,and mindless, suspense less violence. People are entitled to make a mistake or make a bad, even awful movie.

There was a nice blend of things being very creepy and kids just being cute. While the kids are just being cute kids doing cute things you get sort of lulled to sleep and the Orphan springs into action. It was hard to really figure her out and what her problem was and why is she acting like such a psycho. In the end you'll be pleasantly surprised and I really liked the ending.

Arayanna Engineer and Jimmy Bennett must of had guts to take on Esther let alone giving up their life's to protect each other and their family.

Best Thriller in Many Years,"I was more than pleasantly surprised by this movie. Based on the title and the trailer, I was expecting a typical soft gut Hollywood formula thriller with a few cheap scares and a namby-pamby pseudo-cathartic ending. What I got was a top notch seat of your pants white-knuckle joy ride.Everything about this film is top of the line, from the beautifully paced screenplay by David Johnson, with rich characters and more suspense than you'd find in your usual Hollywood thriller, based on a great story by Alex Mace.The casting and performances are uniformly superb, but most notable are the three main female characters, who are a bit more complex than you normally get in a genre film from Tinseltown.Vera Farmiga is a fine actress who's been impressive in past roles, but this is a stand-out role that will have everyone remembering her name. Her young co-stars are both outstanding as well. Newcomer Aryanna Engineer is a charming newcomer and Isabelle Fuhrman as the mysterious orphan was simply amazing in this role.Director Jaume Collet-Serra is great not only with the actors but with action and pacing as well. Like Paul Verhoeven, he's one of those rare European directors who handles Hollywood style action better than most American directors.With several top producers on board, including Joel Silver, Don Carmody and Susan Downey, it's not a surprise that the production values are excellent, from the score to the costumes to the efx make-up and stunts.If you're a fan of the thriller genre, this is one you can't miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of those irritating horror flicks.,"The movie starts out at its strongest and then begins to slow down at around the halfway point. By the time the ending has been reached, the entire movie has fallen apart and will only completely irritate and annoy any avid movie goer. The mother (Vera Farmiga) proves to only constantly endanger her children and takes very little initiative, which creates a very weak and predictable ending. The father (Peter Sarsgaard) is even more dull than the mother and adds very little to the story. Collet- Serra's directing is very Hollywood style and is just okay. If someone is bored and wants to watch a mindless average horror film, then this movie will suffice. However, if someone is looking for a good horror film with complex and interesting characters with a strong screenplay, then this is not the film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Adult, Character Driven Horror Film","Orphan (2009)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A couple (Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard) who recently lost a child, adopt a young girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) from Russia. At first everything seems to be going fine but soon the mother seems to think the new addition to their home has a few secrets. I remember seeing the trailer for this thing many months ago and rolling my eyes asking myself why anyone would think we needed yet another bad child movie. Well, this is just more proof that one should never think something has been done to death because if someone is willing to go out there than they can deliver something unlike anything we've seen before. Outside a couple flaws here and there, this is without question the best adult horror film for many, many years. I saw adult because any horror movie can have a R-rating but that doesn't mean adult as usually it's just gore and violence for teenagers. This film here is first and foremost a drama because that's where all the character development comes from. We learn to care for this family because of everything going on and the actors perfectly bring these characters to life to the point where we see their lives go through various ups and downs. It's this caring that makes the horror elements work so well. I've seen so many trashy horror movies over the years that I've become quite jaded but that was erased here because this is certainly one of the most chilling and haunting horror films in decades. There are certain lines that don't get crossed in any movie but they're crossed here several times. Just when you think you know what's going on, something will happen and that will have you hanging off the edge of your seat because you know that the film is willing to take you places that most won't. The big twist, which I won't reveal, worked masterfully well. That's all I'll say about it. The performances are what really makes the drama work so well with Farmiga delivering another great one. She was impressive in THE DEPARTED and just keeps getting better and better. The raw emotions that she displays are brilliant. Sarsgaard also comes off wonderfully well as does character actress CCH Pounder. Jimmy Bennett and especially Aryana Engineer are great as the children. Then there's Isabelle Fuhrman as the bad one. She's masterfully perfect here and some will compare her to the breakthrough of Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST but I thought she was even better. Her character is a mature one and an intelligent one and one false step would have ruined this but the young actress nails it perfectly and comes off quite terrifying. The film does have a few flaws including the needlessly bloody opening sequence as well as some fake scares that really weren't needed. The entire film has a wonderfully dark and creepy atmosphere with the final thirty-minutes packing one terrific punch in terms of suspense.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Good and worth watching, but not great (despite some impressive features).","The Horror sub-genre that could be titled ""evil children"" has been around for some time now (since about the mid-20th century), and by now it appears authors and screenwriters alike have exhausted their idea bank. The antagonist child, causing troubles ranging between mischief and actual murders, is either suffering from a mental illness (more often than not it's Antisocial Personality Disorder, aka Psychopathy) or is one way or another involved in an ordeal both supernatural and sinister.Without risking any potential spoilers and sticking strictly to what viewers were told in trailers, teasers and plot descriptions - Orphan offers nothing new in this regard.The story is basic and generic to the point of being bluntly unoriginal. A family who's suffered a tragedy looks to adopt a child who appears picture perfect at first and becomes increasingly menacing as the plot unfolds. If this sounds all too familiar to you even though you are yet to watch the film - rest easy, you're not at fault, as anyone would be hard pressed not to be able to come up with at least one other title presenting the same premise.And yet, there is absolutely something special about Orphan, making it quite memorable even after over a decade. Here are a few examples:-The antagonist is menacing, creepy, discomforting and at time plain horrifying. This is a combination of very clever character design by writers Mace and Johnson-McGoldrick, and the very impressive Isabelle Fuhrman (her acting, physical features and the costume and makeup design sum up to a nightmarish character).-The supporting cast is absolutely incredible! First and foremost Vera Farmiga does an impeccable job playing the role of mother Kate, a tragic, vulnerable and emotionally unstable recovering alcoholic (if you've seen her in The Departed you know just how different the two characters are, yet she does amazingly well in both titles, showing true superstar qualities). Second, children Jimmy Bennett (Daniel) and Aryana Engineer (Max) are the perfect addition to the family list of those victimized.-The Horror effect is achieved by utilizing two of the genre's defining features, which very seldom coexist in the same title. On the one hand, plain old ""fear"", achieved by the characteristics and actions of the antagonist and the helplessness of the victims; and on the other, the more modern discomfort, achieved by the severe ""gaslighting"" the mother has to go through and her sheer frustration when nobody believes her and she is left helpless against the system (and even some of those closest to her).So, what's the problem? Well, some of the key features of the film were unnecessary and made no sense, to the point of being foolish and even comic (something you cannot ever allow to happen in a Horror film which isn't of an initially somewhat comic sub-genre like Slashers):-The big plot twist is based on a certain illness which one of the characters suffers from. I checked the name, it is in fact ""true"" (there is such an illness and the described symptoms do exist), but it is still such a rare condition with such specific symptoms that the entire twist feels forced, out of place and unprofessional. Mess up the plot twist and you've messed up the entire film.-Throughout the film the antagonist is seemingly unbeatable in pretty much any aspect. Omniscient and omnipotent, she reminded me of classic Slasher films where the walking killer is faster than a sprinting teenage athlete. Of course it's ""scary"" when the antagonist suddenly appears behind your favourite character, or when she manages to perform impossible tasks in a manner devoid of any basic logic - but it's also annoying and unprofessional.All in all? I was very happy to see a Horror film get such a high rating here on IMDB (7/10? This almost never happens, even with titles deserving of higher ratings which are stuck at 4-5/10). I believe it's the first time in my life that I've rated a Horror film lower than its IMDB average. I also think Orphan is rewarding in its own way and is absolutely worth watching for Horror fans and casual viewers alike. I just hate to see such wasted potential and the blunt use of so many ""cheats"". I do recommend it, but don't expect to be mind-blown, as this won't be the best Horror film you've watched this year. Or this month.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Girl Behaving Badly,"Just a couple of weeks before I saw this film an American couple was in the news because they sent their adopted child back to Russia on a plane citing, in a note, psychological problems with the kid. That kid probably had nothing on the adopted child in this film. ""Orphans"" trades on the fear that, when you adopt a child from a former Soviet Bloc country you really don't know what you're getting. Unfair, yes, but a juicy premise for a thriller.Vera Farmiga effectively portrays the gradual, growing hysteria of her character, Kate, who has lost her third child in a miscarriage and decides to do a very fine and noble thing - give the love she would have given to her baby to an adopted child instead. Imagine her hurt and anger as she gradually discovers that this charmingly eccentric kid, Esther, has completely and savagely betrayed her. Esther is remarkably intelligent and intuitive, and ""freaky"" in more ways than one. She knows how to disrupt the family, manipulating Kate's husband, John, and using fear tactics to keep Kate's two birth children under her thumb. The household becomes an arena of suspicion, fear and dread. It's the old ""fox in the chicken coop"" story.The twist, believe me, is a zinger! If you're anything like me and get so caught up in the story that you dismiss the clues you won't see it coming. The twist not only ramps up the creepiness and danger, but also creates an alarming new dimension which the film-makers could have explored with more zeal and created a more gratifying movie monster - but didn't. Essentially, we've seen this movie before, the stepfather / nanny / roommate, etc. from hell, with a paint-by-numbers plot and a big go-for-broke fight at the end. For what it is it's okay, but it plays it safe and doesn't take us to those dark places where a film-maker like, say, Neil Jordan would have (see ""In Dreams"").",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid and creepy,"In this fine suspense/psychological horror film, an affluent couple in Connecticut decides to adopt a new child (she already has two children, one deaf, and has just lose her third in a miscarriage) and settles in an orphanage for a seemingly charming and very precocious nine year old Russian girl named Esther. Soon, though, the new member of the family shows a maturity well beyond her years and starts making terrible mischief with an escalating maliciousness that knows no boundaries, manipulating every member of the family to turn against each other and soon involving herself in real (as opposed to merely psychological) violence. Her adopted mother starts to suspect a terrible secret lies behind her. Eventually, things will escalate to murder. Well filmed (though there are too many false suspense moments) and especially well scripted, this movie has a final twist that I will not discuss here as not to spoil it to future viewers, but let me say that it is very nifty, it makes a lot of sense of what we just see before and puts this movie well above other run of the mill demon child stories. The performance by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhmann as an evil woman hiding inside a 9 year old girl is just mind blowing.

As a boy mom, there's no planet on which my son would be allowed to ignore his newly adopted sister on the day she arrived and mess around with friends instead of participating - that's disrespect (he also seemed clearly sad about losing the attention which his dad ignored).2.)

"Murderous adopted daughters are scary, the fractured psyche of a mother is scarier.","I wanted to like this more and parts of it I did, those parts that seem to have by accident escaped from a different more intelligent sort of movie, one that doesn't fill its inspirational gaps with contrivance and the usual clichés we've seen in a thousand similar movies, but the movie constantly urged me to treat it worse than it may have deserved by sucking out almost any trace of psychological ambiguity from the get go and filling those gaps with the same old slasherish hijinks. By the end the movie can no longer support itself. It needs the jolt of two twists to keep it from going into cardiac arrest.And then it does just that, by going off in the ice to have a prolonged knife fight whose outcome is rendered irrelevant by the same plot point it's called to replace. For Kate to be killed by her adopted daughter is a much lighter fate than to be estranged by her own family, locked up in a rehab clinic, knowing Esther lives under the same roof with her children. It's Kate's predicament the most intriguing thing in the movie for me. When her son goes into cardiac arrest and she comes out of the hospital room and slaps Esther in the face, forcing the nurses to subdue her while her husband leads Esther to safety, there's a fundamental break in communication there that I find the most horrifying. What if Esther was completely innocent and she projected her own guilt to her? Of course we know she's not, because the movie has painted Esther the ""VILLAIN!!"" from the get go for the benefit of an audience that shouldn't be challenged by modern horror films exactly because ""hey, it's only a horror film"". So everything is very literal here which immediately makes for a lesser movie.And there lies Orphan's failure: it never allows for that frightening glimpse into a psyche fractured by trauma to gestate and mature. Because it never breaks free from literal horror to peer behind the veil. Like its cheap jump scares, Orphan's shock twists last only for a second. Plot must be pushed on after that. ""So, she didn't come from an orphanage at all, what's next?"". Orphan then falters not because it presents the frightening trauma of losing a child (even an unborn one) and then relegates it in the background and constantly tip-toes around it but because it fails to realize what's the scariest thing here. In the end Kate saves her daughter and all is well. But what if the loss of her unborn child broke something in her that can't be made right again? The director ought to have taken a very good look at Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now before he made this.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Conclusive Twist - Untwisted Before I Got Comfortable In My Chair,"Firstly I don't mean to shun any other good viewer who saw this film to the end and were left dumbstruck. The unspoken twist is a great element directors use to immerse the viewer, and it works most of the time, but when it comes to certain themes (a la murderous knife-wielding youngsters), there are not many plausible hooks available to keep those who are guessing still guessing to the end. While this was indeed an original idea, I am one (and undoubtedly not the only one) who saw through the ruse before the first 20 minutes. When it was finally revealed I threw my arms up, decried ""Holy ****, I knew it"" and slouched back into my couch in disappointment.Otherwise, despite the unneeded and constant use of false alarms and blatant unadaptive stupidity (I'm looking at you, Daddy) I am not one to rag on this film. The deviousness out of our brilliantly-talented Esther is ingenuitive enough to keep her innocence at bay, and with the mounting personal troubles of our protagonists making it all the more easier (at times, too easy) to manipulate, made for an entertaining and somewhat bloody hour.I did notice plot holes (e.g. Esther's implausible travels around the world) and areas that should have been elaborated further. These are included into my final rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: Orphan,"The Orphan belongs to the ""demonic-kid"" genre of horror films, and recent antagonists such as Damien from the Omen remake, and Joshua, just cannot hold a candle to what Esther the Orphan here can do. Perhaps the more frightening aspects that this film dished out, is how they're sans supernatural elements, and contained pretty much what someone can accomplish with just a cunning mind, and a merciless heart.Then again, full credit goes to Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther. She has enough creepiness in her when she glints at you with that unsmiling face, or can do an about turn when she requires some sympathy points. Fuhrman is THE reason to watch the film as she fleshes out her role with wicked perfection, the kid from hell with an angelic face. Being an ace manipulator, the horror that she dished out is on all levels, from the emotional, psychological and right down to causing physical distress as well, I cannot think of a more multi-faceted evil character that's intelligent to know how to play the cards right at every step of the way. I suppose Esther could become Fuhrman's calling card, just like how The Professional became Natalie Portman's, and would probably garner as much attention this point on.But that's not to say that the rest of the cast didn't do their part in this Alex Mace story, directed by Spaniard Jaume Collet-Serra. Peter Sarsgaard (one of my favourite contemporary character actors) and Vera Farmiga (who spent time in the other genre film Joshua) play John and Kate Coleman, a couple who lost a child, and are looking to adopting another to add to their family of Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Aryana Engineer, extremely cute as a button, and hearing impaired in real life). So in comes a mysterious 9 year old girl Esther (Fuhrman) into their lives, and while all may seem to be fine and dandy with Esther needing time to settle into her new household, their lives soon turn upside down, with acts of violence committed against children and adults alike, some of which will shock because of the unflinching camera-work.Collet-Serra directed this with as much shrewdness as Esther too in a way, able to manipulate the audience along the journey. You'll be hard pressed not to cheer at appropriate times, or feel exasperated when characters refuse to heed warning signs and listen. You'll be pretty much engaged while watching the film, and kudos to the director for keeping the narrative tight and stylishly executed with wondrous cinematography set in a snow filled landscape.However, he relied too much on the soundtrack to give the audience a heightened sense of alert and expectation that something would appear behind an open door, or a mirror, or just around the corner, which 99% of the time turned out to be nothing but red herrings. While it may be novel for a start, it soon wears on for far too longer than welcomed, and you'll soon find this trick being too tiresome that it could well be omitted from the film as it serves no purpose than to set your heartbeat racing.Despite that, Orphan is a top notch thriller despite its B-grade type genre that would put you at the edge of your seat as it builds a crescendo to the finale. It's been some time since I've had a positive experience with the genre, and Orphan firmly sets itself out as an instant classic, with a memorable villain. Definitely highly recommended, and probable to make it to my shortlist of the top this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Also in the end her motives etcetera felt kind of cheap.This was very thrilling, even though I knew the plot already. I think I just had a different point of view on things compared to when you watch this movie for the first time without knowing. Even though I knew almost everything there was to know, I felt really thrilled during the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.So in the end, typical story with original details.

Still remains one of the best horrors to date,"'Orphan' is a truly incredible viewing experience in every way. Not only does it benefit from a talented cast of actors and actresses that all deliver strong performances (including the child actors), but the mystery and tension is built up slowly leading to a mind-blowing conclusion that no one could see coming.Isabelle Fuhrman gives an excellent performance as Esther, bringing an element of sweetness and innocence to her, but also a sinister quality too. Vera Famiga is excellent as always and remains one of my favourite modern day actresses in the horror genre. Whilst the entire cast give worthy performances, Isabelle and Vera's stand out and really took the movie to another level.As for the plot itself, it's incredible. The trap that most horrors fall into is one of predictability. 'Orphan' remains to this day one of the only movies whereby I was unable to predict the ending and was completely blown away by the twist. The twist is strengthened by the fact that despite how shocking it is, it feels very realistic and not at all far-fetched (even if it is somewhat unlikely).The pacing is just right, with the pieces of the puzzle being slowly revealed and the tone growing darker and darker as the movie progresses, all leading up to the very satisfying conclusion. The inclusion of children in the main cast is a smart move as it adds to the disturbing quality of the movie with them bearing witness to some pretty disturbing stuff.All in all 'Orphan' is an unforgettable movie that is original and haunting, with fantastic performances to further expand upon it's impact. In my opinion, it's a must see for all horror or thriller fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
There's something wrong with Esther,"I know there is a good amount of people who like this movie out there, but I can see people not liking this movie for the certain topics they focus on, and that it can feel like other horror thrillers that have come out before it. I thought the movie Orphan (2009) was a good horror thriller that was creepy, had good acting, dark topics, and brutal kills when they happen; what makes the movie good other than the performance from Vera Farmiga as the mother, is 12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman as the 9-year-old girl Esther giving a believable creepy performance as this character.Vera Farmiga as the mother gives a believable performance; you believe she is a mother who lost her third baby after her other two children were born, and his dealing with the pain and trauma of it making you be on her side in the movie once you are piecing things together on what is the deal Esther is. Along with Peter Sarsgaard as the husband and the kids having good performances, especially the kids giving good performances for being child actors. You feel the grief and issues this family has had, and once Esther comes to their family it starts fine but slowly goes downhill as weird stuff will start happening to them affecting them, and you watching.The best performance in the movie was Isabelle Fuhrman as the 9-year-old girl Esther; she starts out cute and innocent, but once she does more things that makes you suspicious of her, you get creeped out from the many things she does in the movie either being threatening to others, or just creepy in general by the way she acts throughout the movie. By the third act they reveal a big twist that I was not expecting that was creepy and disturbing watching play out as the movie kept going; I honestly thought it was an interesting way to take the movie, even though the movie has horror movie cliches, but they did that to not have twist be obvious where you can see it coming, but instead be surprised by it and maybe shocked by it.The movie was suspenseful and creepy with good acting, a good twist, and a suitable number of kills to keep you on your toes on what Esther is going to do next. Orphan (2009) was a good horror thriller that I would recommend watching once, because knowing the big twist of the movie on your second viewing could ruin the fun of watching the movie; I thought it could be shorter, but then I thought with its two-hour runtime it can build up to the upcoming twist and to leave you satisfied by the end of the movie. You will either like this movie or you will not, it depends on if you can handle the tough topics they focus on in the movie, or if you can handle a movie that can be brutal or dark at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Top Notch Horror Film,"A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a 9-year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be.Aside from some very, very minor complaints on the script, this film is practically flawless -- constantly suspenseful, creepy and well-acted throughout. The kids (especially the girls) were incredible, and should both have bright futures ahead of them if they stay in the business.As I said, the film is suspenseful ,and it is this tense nature that delivers. While there are some releases, the tension more or less builds throughout... and as the mother/wife becomes more and more alienated, we feel her frustration. The film is strong because while it has some traditional horror elements (bloody murder), it also has a very strong mental undercurrent.Roger Ebert says, ""You want a good horror film about a child from hell, you got one."" And that is exactly right. I went into this film expecting some sort of ""Omen"" ripoff. Not at all. Besides the fact they both have evil children, there is no similarity. Maybe closer to ""The Good Son"". But of the three, this one is hands-down the creepiest and best picture.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Twisted Tale with a Chilling Twist,"The original ""Orphan"" (2009) deserves credit for crafting a sinister and unsettling atmosphere, anchored by Isabelle Fuhrman's outstanding performance as Esther, a seemingly innocent child with a dark secret. Fuhrman's portrayal is both haunting and compelling, successfully bringing to life one of the most memorable horror characters in recent years.The film's strength lies in its psychological tension and disturbing build-up, as the audience slowly uncovers the truth about Esther's character. It elevates the movie from a standard horror into something much more memorable, even if it stretches believability at times.Despite these strong elements, ""Orphan"" is not without its flaws. The pacing can be uneven, with some scenes dragging on and losing the film's initial momentum. Moreover, some of the supporting characters, including the parents, feel underdeveloped, which limits the emotional impact of the film's darker moments.While not a perfect horror film, ""Orphan"" is a unique psychological thriller with enough twists and tension to keep viewers engaged. It may not fully live up to its potential, but Fuhrman's unforgettable performance and the shocking twist make it a worthwhile watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Super creepy,"What carries this film is a certain original, gothic slant on a familiar genre. There are many familiar plot and suspense tropes typical of this genre, but the story is intelligent and well thought out, induces genuine empathy for the main character of the mother, and provides a credible emotional logic. These elements allow for a kind of two-fold effect where the viewer can become engrossed in the story and characters as an adult drama involving adoption and the psychological/emotional factors involved in that, as well as a scare and thrill ride.The screenplay expertly and ghoulishly plays on the risks and mysteries of adoption by conjuring up a peculiarly dark, murky, and original scenario. The title character is uniquely multidimensional in her creepiness. I felt at first like the story was unnecessarily sketchy, jerky and cryptic in the beginning, but then came to feel that this approach served an important purpose in the overall effect, mirroring the distressed emotional state of the parents as they kind of blindly blunder into adoption. The pacing is really good, and a sense of suspense and discovery/revelation is maintained to the very end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie didn't really work for me and felt like a huge step down from The Good Son which I would strongly recommend over this,"The Orphan (2009) is currently available on Tubi and tells the tale of a family who has had some tragedy in their past but decides it's time to add a new little one in their lives and adopt a nine year old little girl. Shortly after arriving she has some unique nuances where half the house feels it's peculiar and half the house feels she's just adjusting to her new environment. As the two sides of the family divide the orphan girl sees how far she can press her actions. This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) and stars Peter Sarsgaard (Jarhead), Vera Farmiga (The Departed), Isabelle Fuhrman (The Hunger Games) and CCH Pounder (RoboCop 3). The storyline for this picture is fairly straightforward and unfolded well. This movie had a not as good ""The Good Son"" feel to it with its own unique twist on the ending. The horror elements were just okay and fed more off the premise of the storyline rather than relying on gore or intensity. The acting was solid and you could see the characters trying to work well together, or give eachother the benefit of the doubt...but not working well together at all. The cast did a good job delivering that element. In the end this movie didn't really work for me and felt like a huge step down from The Good Son which I would strongly recommend over this.

Isabelle Fuhrman Is Spectacular. Great Horror Film.,"There is a documentary about the family of a missing child that found him years later, in France. When they found him, he's now a teenager, he's traumatized, and he didn't t talk much. It turned out he was an imposter - a 30-something year old ex-convict and con-man that worked the system in several countries. He depended on bad record keeping, human laziness, and the desperation of the family. 'The Imposter' (2012).This is a well-executed and unique horror tale. There probably should have been more sexuality, but the actress, Isabelle Fuhrman, is way underage at the time of filming. Despite the lack of actual sex, Isabelle Fuhrman carries the film and is the definition of outstanding; considering Vera Farmiga is the lead actress, Isabelle's performance is quite an accomplishment.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Orphan from beyondthegore,"""There's something wrong with Ester"", and after watching this I will vouch for that! This film has always been in the background for me and it's always been one of those that I've never really been interested in watching however after someone's recommendation I thought I would give it a go. To be fair I was not disappointed.The gore is effective where used, yes there's not bucket loads but what we do see is pretty brutal and it's clear that Ester is no stranger to drawing blood. Without ruining the plot ill stop there, I will say that the ending definitely caught me off guard. Even as it was happening I was pretty shocked. Yes the haters will say it's ridiculous and not feasible but I like it. Call it Marmite if you will! I thought the acting was solid, no cheesy one liners or cringe worthy script in sight! Everything was very well thought through production value was very good and location was spot on. I really am struggling to find many negatives and I think that speaks a good volume. Even the plot padding didn't bother me, for once I thought it was necessary to tell the story.Read the full review at: beyondthegore",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
OK what the hell,"How is this piece of crap at 7.1? Did we watch the same movie? I absolutely hated this movie. Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.First off, the performances are pretty good.That's the only thing that I really liked.The film starts out alright. It's an interesting, if familiar premise. First off, this film is not frightening. It's not scary. It's not thrilling. It's just dull. The last 30 minutes are just your typical mindless horror flick. It also has a lot of classic clichés, like how nobody ever listens to the main character even though (s)he is always right.Then it ends with one of the worst endings that I have EVER SEEN! The ending makes no sense, it's offensive, it's unnecessary and it's just stupid. In fact it's laughable. I was seriously laughing when the twist was revealed. It's so ridiculous. How could anyone take this film seriously after the twist? I guess you people saw something that I didn't. I still hated this garbage.

Not a waste of time!,"Seems like I am in the mood for yet another wondrous night of chills, thrills and scares. All is set, and all I have to do now is allow the movie to unveil its goriest plot all over and scare the heaven out of me..Score! The introductory scene at the hospital just turned my stomach inside out as the bloody infant was removed from the mothers' womb! Jessica who was not blessed to see the light of the world passed on inside her mothers' womb weeks before delivery. Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) since the loss of Jessica feels a void in her soul and needs for it to be filled.John(Peter Sarsgaard) and Kate along with their kids Daniel(Jimmy Bennett) and the little princess Max(Aryana Engineer) are quite a normal family up until Kate and John bring home Esther (Isabella Fuhrman) from an orphanage. Esther who is introduced as a Russian girl has been put in the orphanage since the tragic accidental fire that took the lives of her foster parents. An exceptionally polite and intelligent girl, she deeply appreciates the fact that she finally has a family and that she is being loved by John and Kate alike. In the most dignified of terms I will try to explain what I feel for what takes place next. ""You do not drop your excrement where you eat"". I am sure you all have heard a more familiarized version to it. Well this is exactly what 9 year old Esther tries to do. Ungrateful as she turns out to be, she seems to suddenly have come out with an agenda of her own, this by the way is exactly how the movie has been intended to unfold.Isabella Fuhrman; where did they discover her from? This brilliant young star that is very fresh to the widescreen has just a handful of appearances on TV shows to her name. A wondrous discovery she is to Hollywood. She stands out like a drunk driver at the Grand Prix, and just is scary as hell. I have never been to hell but I am quite sure it's full of little Esthers! Whoever has signed her up or whoever is her agent at this point of time has sure made some wise calls with the young actress, if she is diverse in her talent and is not limited to just this role in the ORPHAN , she may become one of the greats of tomorrow.Absolutely a phenomenon of a movie, yet another innovative approach, of course there are similarities with the plot of a psychotic killer on a blood thirsty spree, however a different adaptation altogether when considering the murder factor.THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A WASTE TIME!Title: OrphanDirected by: Jaume Collet-SerraStarring: Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and Isabelle FuhrmanRated: Rated R for disturbing violent content, some sexuality and language Rating: 07/10123 Minutes",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Wonderfully Acted and Well Done Thriller.,"The most important thing to know when going into this movie is expect a thriller, and not a horror movie. I remember when I first saw this marketed, it seemed to be the latter, but a horror fan will likely be very disappointed. Indeed it feels like studio executives were determined that it must be that way, as the only real ""horror"" in the film consists of a handful shoehorned jump scares. That, and a lackluster (but sufficient) ending are all that really keeps this film from making the top 250.The acting is incredible, particularly that of Isabelle Fuhrman. She's only 18 at the time of this review, but I hope to see her in many future films because she has true talent.All of the characters are unique, and have real issues they deal with. The opening rivaled Up in terms of how touching and sad it was.If you're looking for a great edge of your seat thriller, don't pass this one up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An unholy melding of ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Fatal Attraction""","The darker more evil side to the seemingly cute, innocent side of children is hardly an innovative conceit in horror movies and thrillers. Like puppets and clowns the more macabre of these has been explored in Hollywood features and no doubt within renowned pieces of literature for decades. And even on the contemporary side the more malicious side of children has lamentably become all the more closer to reality than we would care to admit. Films going as far back as the 1960 big screen adaptation of the psychological thriller ""The Bad Seed"" with 1976 ""The Omen"" and more on mass with ""The Children of the Corn"".Where last years ""Orphan"" fits in to this bracket is a bit more complex given the films jaw-dropping denouement although it neatly exploits the more grim, lurid side behind the seemingly angelic, innocuous veneer. The film tells the story of Kate and John Coleman (Vera Faramiga and Peter Sarsgaard) who are attempting to build their family life back together (Kate more so) after the death of their unborn child who Kate was carrying. With their two existing offspring, Daniel and Max(Jimmy Bennett and Aryana Engineer)who are their more immediate priority to take in to consideration they strive to push on and put the tragic event behind them. In a bold yet well meaning step to fill the void left by the death of their unborn baby the couple choose to adopt a child. At their nearest Orphanage where they visit they come across nine-year old Estonian orphan, Esther a beguiling and sweet little girl who they instantly fall in love with. It's not long before with John and Kate's minds made up Esther has a brand new home and family. But the ostensibly charming young lady finds fitting in and adapting to her new surroundings difficult. She is teased at her new school to the point where he adoptive brother Daniel spurns her although she forms a bond with the death and mute Max. But with the kids and at school and Daniel turning against Esther her more manipulative, vindictive and violent nature creep gradually to the fore. She assumes a serpentine hold on her pseudo-sister who is forced in to aiding and abetting her commit the most horrendous of acts and the relative serenity is thrown in to nightmarish chaos and she begins to play off John and Kate off against one another. Only when the devil child's new found mother begins to delve in to the girls past does the full horror of Esthers dark past gradually begin to come to light.A haunting and some what innovative film given it's chilling and sublime twist ending. ""Orphan"" takes the unnerving, unease that can be equated with children and neatly exploits it. Although not an entirely original premise and with it's script undoubtedly lumbered with the inevitable, trite clichés that are associated with movies of this ilk. It's material is never the less adeptly handled by Spanish director Juame Collet-Serra who previously helm-ed the less satisfying, horror remake ""House of Wax"" in 2005. It's unsettling twist provokes a sense of paranoia and makes us question out own potential obtuse preconceptions of both identity and arguably even sexuality which makes one uncomfortable scenario as it edges towards it's climax all the more shocking yet feasible within the context of the final starling revelation. Although It might be fair comment as a sidenote that John in the movie doesn't completely come off entirely well. He is is arguably a little too obtuse and moronic when he fails to begin to put two and two together and ultimately little sympathy can be found for him when the truth of events become ever more apparent. Though perhaps that's what the film-makers were striving towards.But still, an unholy melding of ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Orphan"" boasts an awe inspiring performance from young Thespian Isabelle Fuhrman who was in fact about two or three years older than her precocious title antagonist. She impressively leads a cast of relative unknowns who more than exemplify that a movie doesn't need to have an a-list cast of Brad Pitts or Angelina Jolies to create a sound, solid two-hour Hollywood picture. She is beautifully understated and for goes the oh so burdensome trap of slipping in to gruesome caricature. Never overdoing the smiles and the angelic god natured facade which might have metamorphosed in to a miniature reject from ""The Stepford Wives"". As her adoptive parents Vera Faramiga and Peter Sarsgaard give solid performances, bringing the eclectic range of emotive acting for their respective roles which eventually make them excellent foils for one another when events within the movies storyline requires their protagonists to clash. As the two Coleman siblings Jimmy Bennett and Aryana Engineer demonstrate an an uncanny ability for emotive dramatic acting beyond their years and never dip in to becoming irritating as can occasionally be the case with child actors in roles. They are more than merely the obligatory cutesy tykes. Veteran supporting actress CCH Pounder, arguably the most recognisable face amongst the cast also offer stirring support as the saintly nun who works within the orphanage where Esther is adopted from.Not entirely the most innovative of films brought to celluloid although it's unsettling climax and resolution are one of the most singular brought to the screen. ""Orphan"" although far from reaching the dizzying heights of being declared a masterpiece of the genre is never the less a chilling picture that will no doubt may alter your perception as to how you might view those unknown children you come across in day to day life.

All-round great thriller/horror but a bit derivative,"You've probably seen at least a couple of ""evil children"" movies before so this one won't offer you much that is new or unique. With a running time of two hours, it also could have been a little shorter but the pacing and suspense will keep you engaged. What places this well-above the standard thriller is the acting, character development and the unusual ending. I'll be honest, I wanted to scream like a little girl (no pun intended) when I realised the twisted secret.The movie opens with a nightmarish scene, which (in hindsight) seemed a little out of place. This isn't a ""horror"" film, it's more of a psychological thriller with a lot of great drama and humour thrown in. The latter seems unintentional at times but adds a layer of complexity to the film because it makes the horrific scenes more disturbing, and complements the maniacal orphan character perfectly.The storyline is pretty straightforward. A woman (Kate Coleman) loses a child due to a miscarriage and, after years of guilt and torment, she and her husband (John) decide to adopt a girl. The orphan, Esther, is a shy but intelligent Russian girl with a real talent for painting but a mysterious past. There's also a sinister undercurrent to Kate's idyllic home-life as we soon learn that she was an alcoholic and this may have been the cause of her miscarriage. Her husband, John, is no saint either as we find out that he was unfaithful to her. Her daughter had always wanted a sister and immediately latches onto Esther but her son is apprehensive about the new girl. She dresses funny and seems cold and methodical.The last half hour of this movie really ratchets up the tension and the scene where John is lying on the sofa after getting drunk on wine, still makes me uneasy. I think guys will be more unnerved by this scene than girls.Just thinking of it again... Oh God, it's so creepy. There is no other word for it.

The moment you see a little girl dressed like she just stepped out of a haunted Victorian boarding school, you run. But no, they find her ""adorable."" Naturally, things go downhill fast.From the moment Esther arrives, you know this kid doesn't belong in a fairytale. This isn't Cinderella-this is Snake in Disguise. Esther manipulates, spies, and if she had a lightsaber, she'd wipe out an entire elementary school in two days. Isabelle Fuhrman is chilling: a mix of sweetness and pure malice that makes you want to double-check your locks before bed. She's like Chucky, but in cosplay as the perfect little angel.Director Jaume Collet-Serra knows you don't need gore in every frame to terrify audiences. Esther is more Psycho than Saw. The scenes are as taut as a violin string, and every shot is meticulously calculated to suffocate you bit by bit. No ghosts, no laughable CGI monsters-just a devious little menace who cranks up the tension until you're squirming in your seat.Now, let's talk about the real issue: the parents are clueless. Kate senses right away that Esther is a budding psychopath, but John? The guy's blind. He could have a decaying zombie sitting on his couch, and he'd be like, ""He's just tired."" Thank God for Kate holding the fort, or Esther would've turned their house into a full-on Resident Evil mansion.And that twist-oh boy. If you saw it coming, congrats, you're a genius. If not, welcome to the club. They hid it so well that when the big reveal drops, you'll want to rewind the whole film and spot the clues you missed. It's like finding out Bruce Willis was dead the whole time in The Sixth Sense-it hits hard and leaves you stunned.Esther is a masterclass in psychological thrillers. A terrifying child, perfectly timed tension, and a finale that slaps you across the face. Jaume Collet-Serra proves that with a solid script and the right atmosphere, you don't need zombies or demons lurking around every corner. One last piece of advice: if you ever meet a kid who's too well-behaved and smiles too much-run.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A totally unexpected twist in the end,"It's great overall, but let's be honest, the unexpected twist in the end is what truly makes it great. It's uniqueness among the horror genre. It's good. A bit dark and twisted but that's just the way I like em.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's alright,"It is a decent movie, the plot doesn't really make any sense what so ever but since this takes place in a sorta-fictional world it doesn't have to make sense. The plot is somewhat absurd and seems to be deliberately stretched out to seem longer and more complex, I wouldn't ever see myself rewatching this movie, sure I would recommend it to a certain crowd of people, but I wouldn't think of it first thing when someone asks me for movie suggestions, it is sort of a decent, kinda overrated, common late 2000s movie, nothing much to it, but it isn't bad by any means.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definition of fragile worlds,"It is difficult to define it. A good script, a brilliant Isabelle Fuehrman, a new story, a very special thriller, a special way to say a well know tall. And, more that, subtle science to drive the viewer in a dark labyrinth. Spectacular in details and art to use ordinary pieces, the film has slices of social crisis and family problems, self definition and daily illusions. So, the secret is more that an explanation for incidents or key of secrets. The evil is not fruit of scary gestures or devil games. And the grains of another movies has different essence. The masks are faces and the final happy-end only new brick for deep tension. It is not a geometrical figure. This is price for definition of fragile world and its lost soul. It is not really a thriller. But a analysis of relationship and image of another. A drama about trust and roots of desire.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""The Others"" (2001)","On a sleepless night, I found myself drawn to the TV for company. On the table sat my brother's copy of 'Orphan' which he had just gotten for Christmas. I looked down at the DVD and knew it was about to be watched. I am a horror film lover and I will contend that there is no better time to watch a horror movie than at around 1am, alone, in the dark. And so I sat down with Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Orphan.""The set up has been done before, many times – ""The Omen"" (1976), ""Child's Play 2,"" (1990) ""The Good Son"" (1993), to name a few antecedents – a struggling family decides the best thing for it would be to adopt a child with a troubled past. Lo and behold, the child not only has a troubled past but turns out to be just plain trouble.There can be no doubt: ""Orphan"" is a dark film. Thankfully, it is not overly clustered with action and horror like so many contemporary counterparts. Instead it lets the horror rise and rise until the final, genuinely creepy climax. Of course there are the typical fake outs to juice up the audience for the real scares - a woman opens a mirrored medicine cabinet. When she closes it, someone is standing behind her (gasp!). And then there's Esther, the creepy orphan of the title who holds the real horror of the film in the palm of her hand.As you can likely infer from what I've already written, the plot doesn't need too much elaboration. Vera Farmiga plays Kate Coleman, a recovered alcoholic who has recently suffered a miscarriage. Kate and her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide it would be best to adopt a child. Now, I'm pretty young and have no children, but it seems to me that adopting a child in the wake of a miscarriage might be predicated on faulty logic – a hasty cure for the mourning heart.Well, despite my reservations, Kate and John adopt Esther, a young orphan from Russia. Esther is an instant hit with the family, befriending Kate's younger and partially deaf daughter Max and her older son Daniel. Esther even seems to have an Oedipal (or ElectrapalElectric?) love for her father. Cute enough.But as can be imagined, things start to go awry. A girl has a conspicuous fall from a playground. A car's emergency break is mysteriously released. A nun is found bludgeoned to deathKate is the only one who can fit these pieces together. She is the only one who sees the common thread between all these tragic incidents is Esther. But no one believes her of course, because how could a child do such a thing?Children in the movies are much like dogs. They can be cute and funny as easily as they can be vicious and creepy. Esther, played by newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman, is a powerhouse of a creeper. She delivers on scary material that would be tough for any child actor to make believable. At 3am when the film ended, I couldn't help but wonder how they made this film with such strict child-actor laws in place. This movie actually creeped me out.Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""The Others"" (2001)Rationalization:In these, the waning days of M. Night Shymalan, it is very hard to come across a twist ending where you don't feel used and didn't see it coming from eight miles away. Nowadays we often come into a horror movie expecting there will be a game changing twist tagged on at the very end. In a case like Shymalan's ""The Village"" (2004), which I loved for the first half, the twist made me want to puke and then write a heated letter to someone who would listen. But with a movie like ""The Others,"" and now ""Orphan,"" the twist is organic, makes sense, and adds a brand new dimension of scariness to the rest of the film. At the end of ""The Village"" I felt like I need to take a sponge bath to scrub off Shymalan's twist and egomania. Not so at the end of ""Orphan.""(Also, if you're watching this on DVD and can check out the alternative ending, do so. The part of me that despises closure loved the alternative ending)http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Somewhat overrated but worth watching.,"Going into this movie I had heard a lot about it from various people. Having actually watched it myself, I feel a little slighted. While it is a decent movie it's not the best I've ever seen and it certainly isn't particularly frightening. So many people had made this out to be the thriller of all thrillers I guess I expected far more then the movie could ever have provided.It does manage to create a good atmosphere, it's well acted, well scripted and very well shot. What it lacks is any real culmination to the build up. It's one of those...it's coming...it's coming...oh. I'm sure you've seen the type of movie I'm referring to and if you haven't, check this one out because it's as good an initiation into the anti-climactic thriller as any. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, the ending is actually decent and everything is explained well but without the ""make you jump"" moments, it seems like the movie just misses it's mark.I'll say one thing though and I say this without hesitation. Isabelle Fuhrman is a wonderful actress and is completely captivating. I never doubted for one second that she was Esther. I'd love to see more from her in the future, particularly in this genre because she has fantastic potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Modern Horror Triumph,"Jaume Collet-Serra's *Orphan* revisits familiar territory with a fresh twist on the classic ""evil child"" narrative seen in *The Bad Seed*, *The Good Son*, and *The Omen*. Despite the echoes of its predecessors, *Orphan* stands out with its unique surprises and unexpected originality, particularly regarding Esther's secret.While it may not surpass those iconic films, *Orphan* is a notable improvement over more recent attempts like *Joshua*-another film starring Vera Farmiga in a similar motherly role. Don't be misled by the trailer into thinking this is just another generic horror flick; *Orphan* offers much more depth and intrigue.Both my audience and I found it to be one of the more compelling horror films in recent times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This Turns Out To Be Surprisingly Exciting,"This movie is certainly not a good commercial to promote the adoption of older children! I know that for that very reason it sparked a bit of negative comment from the ""adoption community"" for exploiting that angle. Having said that - as a member of that community, I can't see any reason that this particular subject matter should be declared off limits to Hollywood. The only issue for me as someone who watched this is whether or not it's a good movie. In fact, it is. It's well constructed, and moves the viewer logically but unpredictably toward a very violent and climactic ending, with a twist that was completely unforeseen. By the last 20 minutes or so, this actually had me on the edge of my seat.As the adoptive parents, Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard were effective - Farmiga moreso, I thought. Sarsgaard's character came across as a bit of a dunce, quite frankly, and I wasn't especially sympathetic toward him. That's not Sarsgaard's fault, of course. He played the character that was written. It's just that Farmiga as the embattled mom Kate was the one who garners the sympathy and concern of the viewer, and I wondered throughout how she was going to avoid taking the blame for everything that was happening. In the end, though, the performance that stands out is neither of those. It's young Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, the adoptee who ends up destroying the family. Fuhrman was absolutely brilliant - especially considering her age and lack of experience.Fuhrman's performance aside, what I appreciated was the way director Jaume Collet-Serra kept building the suspense. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. At first, my expectation was that this was going to be some sort of supernatural ""spawn of the devil"" sort of film, and had very low expectations. Then it seemed to settle in as being little more than a story about a child raised in a Russian orphanage with all the assorted problems that can create. Then it seemed to become a psychological thriller, as Esther starts to seem less like a well-adjusted child and more like a truly insane and depraved child. Then there's the final twist that I won't reveal but that truly did shock me. After that revelation, though, the movie does become extremely violent - although given what we learn about Esther's background, the violence is to be expected. Overall, this is excellent. A movie that keeps me on my toes with twists and turns and leaves me on the edge of my seat has done something very right!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Some basic explanations,"This movie is actually a good movie in my opinion and it is a good suggestion for those who are usually looking for a mystery movie and some kind of surprise, but one thing about this movie is that this movie is known as a horror genre,But it has no scary scenes and only a series of exciting scenes. The story of the movie is interesting and I do not recommend it to those who are looking for action scenes. The only thing that drew my attention to this movie is actually a story that the director of the movie is hiding from the audience and reveals it at the end of the movie... I am very picky in choosing movies and I don't like every movies, But this movie is so good that I give it a score of seven, I'm not saying it's a great movie, but it's worth watching and I hope you enjoy it like I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hold Your Breath!!,"A mother (Vera Farmiga) in a dying labor pain looks up when doctors say her child has died. Doctors and the mother look at the blood-soaked baby in shock when it starts crying. Above all that, the husband shows up with a camcorder. Now that is one bone-chilling creation from a twisted writer, or in this case a pair of writers (David Johnson and Alex Mace). Not sure if that was a necessary introduction for this cleverly written violent opera (Orphan) but honestly it is not the time to judge yet. Not for the sake of saving writers and director's (Jaume Collet-Serra) plea for freedom of expression but for the explanation in the end.It is tough to find a decent thriller. If you agree the last three best thrillers were James Wan's Saw (2004) and Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000). Orphan, a tale of a couple who adopt a girl from an orphanage only to get thrown into a world of mis-deeds, mis-fortunes and mis-takes, could be added as the fourth cleverly twisted thriller of the past two decades. For that not only the writer and director but the shining star of this film Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) should be appreciated with a round of applause. It is not just the idea that is the primary force behind the success but the screenplay fits well to the dark ambiance. The argument of the violence justification perhaps will render itself un-necessary. The writing is hypnotic and shocking. The director does not fail to justice the screenplay. The false impression of ghostly possession of the protagonist leading to a conclusion is very 'Hitchcockian'. In fact the director makes a homage to the famous stop-light-confrontation of the leading lady by her boss in Psycho (1960), if stretched further to Butch-Marcellus confrontation in Pulp Fiction (1994). Another memorable scene is when camera sits next to sleeping Max (Aryana Engineer) in the dark room and the lightning flash from the window shows her adopted sister Esther standing next to her bed. Director accomplishes a horrifying tone to this thriller throughout. Watch for the modification of the studio logos in the beginning of the film.Isabelle Fuhrman hovers over the film with a winning smile. This 12 yr old actor has a great potential and will help her in her upcoming career. Alongside Aryana Engineer and Jimmy Bennett as siblings have shined as well. Especially Aryana. Wonder how director executed the chilling scenes without affecting all the child stars. Maybe Mr. Kubrick attended the filming in spirit and gave suggestions from The Shining (1980). Finally the parents, play the roles of a believer and a non-believer in each other's theories. Posing as opposing thought invokers for the audience. This is also the writers' achievement.In a nutshell, if you haven't been scared intelligently then Orphan is waiting for you. Just sit back and bite your nails because you may not find time to chew on the popcorn.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"an inaccurate, brain meltingly boring and often laughable copy cat","For a generous 7/10 IMDb threshold for watching movies I expect to enjoy myself when I watch one, but yet again deceived by the over-fed-fat-5-year-old-kid generosity this film has received from reviewers I feel compelled to write this review. About 30 minutes into the film, about the time when the sweet little Russian orphan girl is introduced to her new home a car-crash-like-memory-whiplash wounds my fragile mind and it hits me that this movie bears a striking resemblance to a movie I'd watched several weeks ago – case 39! Except, that this movie turned out to be a demented killer kid/""adult"" (yes... BIG QUOTATION MARKS - ""adult"") version of the devil's sprog story – reeeeeaaaaallll original Alex Mace (writer (fool)).Most of the time I was bored and stared out of my window at the dark field I live next to hoping I'd see some real monsters out there and rest of the time I spent predicting the script. It seems writers these days all go to McDonalds and get their movie ideas off the backs of happy meals. I think I'm still being generous giving this movie a ""3"". The adorable little daughter (Aryana Engineer) and a very well played part by Isabelle Fuhrman are definitely the only salient features. The frustrated crazy woman act is as dead as the knights templars (or are they?) and the little girl manipulating dopey-old-I-give-a-crap daddy act is as dry as a sun dried humerus in the Sahara desert (that's the arm bone that's connected to the shoulder bone - for all you Americans (don't forget to sing along)).Finally, as you may know I have a thing against medical inaccuracies in movies and I can see it now, my poor friends the endocrinologists tearing their £7 haircuts out at the obscene drooling melaena spewing from the mouth of the ""doctor"" in the movie regarding Esther (I'll let you find out for yourself). Another word of advice Alex, try AT LEAST reading Wikipedia before you write (by the way melaena is...oh I can't be bothered look it up yourself) Overall, a pretty boring movie, a waste of 2 hours or however long it was, but if you want to watch a medically unrealistic, anti-Russian/pro-BS-American ""ideals"" propaganda movie, promoting child deviance and anti-social behaviour be my guest – because you're all going to hell!

A Chilling and Suspenseful Thriller with a Dark Twist,"'Orphan' is an unsettling psychological horror that keeps you on edge with its eerie atmosphere and slow-building tension. From the very beginning, the film establishes a sense of unease, and as the story unfolds, it only gets darker. The cinematography and score do a great job of heightening the suspense, making even the quieter moments feel ominous.Isabelle Fuhrman delivers a standout performance as Esther, bringing a level of intensity that makes the character truly disturbing. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard also give strong performances, adding depth to the family dynamics that are at the heart of the story. The film balances psychological horror with shocking moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout.While 'Orphan' is an effective thriller, it does rely on some familiar horror tropes, and a few plot points feel slightly predictable.

Loved this great horror movie!,"Orphan (2009) really is a great horror film! The acting, the storyline/plot, and the execution of that plot is all done very very well, and all in an entertaining way! The movie revolves around Esther, a 9 year old orphan girl who is adopted by a married couple with 2 children. They decide to adopt because their 3rd child was a stillborn. Vera Farmiga turns in a terrific performance as Kate Coleman, and so does Peter Sarsgaard as John Coleman. And Isabelle Fuhrman is awesome as Esther!! I mean she really does give it her all in this starring role, she's menacing, innocent seeming when she needs to be, and shows great potential for such a young actress. The plot seems pretty cut and dry at first, family adopts killer evil kid, there certainly has been killer kid movies before, but this one sets itself apart from movies like case 39, or The Omen, you'll have to go and watch it though, I never spoil movies in reviews. The movie is successful in keeping the suspense and chill going throughout the entire movie.

"No masterpiece, but unique story","When I saw the first scene (the hospital), I automatically started to think that it was something like ""Unborn"", stupid and meaningless. The first 20 minutes were boring, because I still didn't know what kind of film I was dealing with, but after the first murder, I got interested and decided to watch it to the end.The story is simply shocking and may even cause you to be more cautious when dealing with little kids! Maybe they're not kids at all! I cannot say this film was a masterpiece. If you're going to watch it, it's mainly because of the story. It's a novel one. The film is very simple and the events take place in winter, so it might make you feel a bit sleepy. There are no gruesome scenes or even blood. The film lasts two hours and it makes it even more boring.If you are interested in watching a seemingly little kid commit murder, you're going to love this film. There are no plot holes. The dialogues are OK, although the way the husband ignores his wife's warnings will start to get on your nerves.This film is not suitable for children at all and it contains mature content.If you wants to see a film with a coherent plot that makes sense, this is a good choice.

An under-appreciated film,"When I first saw the previews for Orphan, I immediately decided I would not be seeing it. However, my mother asked me to see a movie with her recently and we don't spend much quality time together lately, so I agreed. Orphan has received some mixed reviews but I was very impressed. Some would think this is just another ""disturbed child"" movie, and they'd be wrong.Three things stood out most for me. First, the acting in this film is excellent. The main cast gave superb performances, especially Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and Isabelle Fuhrman. These children played their parts with perfection and have very promising acting careers ahead of them.Second, I've noticed that most horror/suspense films employ a tired formula. Characters tend to be very naive and lacking in common sense. But director Jaume Collet-Serra seems to have taken a more realistic approach, allowing the characters to be intelligent and resourceful without losing their vulnerability to the plights of the story.Lastly, this film is not what you would expect. (POSSIBLE SPOILER?) Orphan starts out as just another ""troubled child"" movie, but contains a shocking and incredible plot twist that certainly deviates from the norm.To sum up, this is not a film you should write off at first glance.

"Generic, by-the-numbers suspenser","In motion pictures, it's a widespread belief that children are the embodiment of pure evil. Perhaps not all kids are the spawn of Satan, but horror filmmakers realise that evil disguised behind the eyes of a seemingly innocent child is an effective way of amplifying the scare factor. Into this genre now steps 2009's Orphan. Instead of being an overly effective suspense piece, however, this is a predominantly boring, meandering film which suffers from repetition and poor scripting. If the creepy kid horror genre is in need of resuscitation, this subpar affair will not provide it.The plot, in a nutshell, concerns Kate (Farmiga) and John (Sarsgaard). They're married with two kids, but Kate's recent miscarriage has put a strain on their relationship that's already burdened by John's infidelity and Kate's battle with alcoholic tendencies. Seeking to introduce a new child into their family, the couple decide to adopt. During a visit to the local orphanage, John connects with a strange yet astonishingly intelligent 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther (Fuhrman). As you may or may not have guessed, Esther is no ordinary child, and seems to have been specially ordered from the Eastern European School of Creepy Kids. She distinguishes herself from those around her not only because she's mature beyond her years, but because she also appears trapped in a 19th Century time-warp with her fondness for Victorian doll dresses and ribbons. For her introductory scenes, Esther of course appears beguiling and innocent. Once she's adopted by John and Kate, the film then sets out to defy our preconceptions of how eerie and horrifying this little girl can be. And good heavens, is she creepy.If it means anything - and in dealing with the consistently awful creepy kid subgenre, it likely does - Orphan is not the worst of its kind. It's atmospheric enough and contains a number of generally unsettling sequences, not to mention there's a solid attempt to delve into the characters' lives so that they comes across as more than blood-spurting automatons. Yet, in spite of these strengths, the film remains a ridiculous, by-the-numbers horror show. Spanish director Jaume Collet- Serra poorly orchestrates so many clichéd ""boo!"" moments designed to make the audience jump (such as mirror reveals), on top of faux scares in which a viewer believes they're about to jump but - surprise! - nothing's there. The repetition is irritating and laughable. These moments are hardly effective, too, since the music, with its rising disharmonies and sudden crashes, suggests there's a ""scare"" on the way. Orphan is also predictable from a narrative standpoint. It's easy to guess Esther's next move well before she makes it. And for the climax, the filmmakers call upon the most embarrassing genre convention imaginable: giving superhuman abilities to a weak character. At least the final showdown is relatively entertaining. Highly predictable, yet still satisfying nonetheless.In addition to all this, the characters tend to act in whatever way serves the plot best. For example, it makes no sense for Kate and John to adopt Esther when she's clearly out of synch with the rest of the family. Furthermore, Kate is sometimes a raging alcoholic, but at other times an overly caring mother. Infidelity issues are raised in the first half, but they hardly surface again. At times, John is a trusting, loving husband and father, but at other times he's both ignorant and disloyal. Not to mention these characters are so stupid. What parents never see their child undress? What parents allow their child to skip dental appointments, and basically live in solitude in a mansion-like home? Why would no-one question Esther's ribbon accessories or her anti- social behaviour? Furthermore, John sets a new standard for Horror Movie Dumbass - he's bizarrely enamoured with this Russian girl (even when she rats him out for flirting with their neighbour!) and ignores his wife's desperate warnings. All of this is coupled with a major violation of Roger Ebert's main tenets for an unsuccessful narrative: if the main plot-point could be easily resolved - in this case, a mandatory medical examination should've been conducted by a state-run child protective services agency prior to approving the adoption - everything falls apart.Credit where credit is due - in the acting department, things aren't too shabby at all. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard share solid chemistry which makes their relationship believable. Isabelle Fuhrman is a terrific find: she's cute and charming, which makes her behaviour far more unsettling. The convincing Russian accent adds to her unnerving presence as well. For a horror movie of this type to boast such terrific performances is nothing short of a miracle. Yet, if one sets aside the solid acting, the interesting final plot twist, a few effective set- pieces and the fact it still works on a pretty basic level, Orphan remains a generic, cliché-ridden suspense film that strains credulity to breaking break. If you're in the midst of a strained marriage and are considering adopting a Soviet child, you may find this to be a terrific horror outing. As for everyone else...nah, it ain't worth the effort to get through these two distinctly mediocre hours.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,"'Orphan' is a great horror movie! It is made all the more effective in the fact that the characters are three dimensional and complex. This is one of the few recent movies where I was more interested in the characters than the action on screen.It would have been easy to have had the evil orphan, Esther, move into the perfect family and disrupt their harmony, but the family in this film has such dysfunction that the destruction caused by her is more dramatic. The horror of the situation is made all the more palpable because you care about the family members, especially the mother, who has lost a great deal of reliability as a result of her alcoholism. This also makes the scenes where she can't get anyone to believe her about Esther's true nature more authentic as opposed to being a plot device.The movie also has a plot twist that would seem implausible, but, because the film-makers have kept you sold on the reality of the situation, you buy it. In light of what I call the 'Sixth Sense' phenomenon, I usually roll my eyes when a film does a plot twist that changes the entire context of the story. This time, however, it's like a kick in the gut!The final 20 minutes of this movie are so intense that audience I saw it with got very vocal in response to what they were seeing on the screen. In addition to that, Esther is such a malevolent force of nature that the entire audience clapped when she finally got her comeuppance. My advice: see this movie with someone you can grab onto during the many moments of suspense!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"great premise, legit scary moments but is a misfire in execution as it tailspins to cliches","Orphan has a great premise, legit scary moments but is a misfire in execution as it tailspins to cliches in the second half. The film is an exploration about loss of a child and how it drives the mother, in this case Kate, played by Vera Farmiga, and her attempts to grow from that trauma by adopting a child. It starts off great, but never coheres. Her trauma is never fully resolved as it becomes subservient to the narrative in building Esther, the film's antagonist. Tropes such as horror character from eastern Europe and mistrusting husband are present. The acting is good in many cases. Farmiga aptly portrays a grieving mother. Isabelle Fuhrman is exceptional playing an mentally disabled antisocial serial killer pretending to be kid, who in reality is an adult. Overall, Orphan is good but nothing special.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely creepy and disturbing,"'Orphan' is certainly one of my favourite horror movies. I love a good unexpected twist and this film has one of the best. I certainly didn't see it coming and it makes for an enthralling ending packed full of tension and drama. 'Orphan' keeps you guessing until the very end and does a great job at keeping the viewer intrigued.There are some disturbing scenes in this movie, not so much scary but certainly creepy. It is very suspenseful, especially after the twist is revealed and the film really starts to get exciting and intense. The acting and script are both excellent and make the storyline believable.This is an extremely creepy horror film with a brilliant twist. The plot is compelling and the movie as a whole is put together very well. It will keep you guessing until the very end. 'Orphan' is a great horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Another master class terror movie from a Spanish director.,"Orphan is one of this horror movies where the script and the direction have created a superb movie. Let's go to say that this Spanish director, Jaume Collet-Serra, has been taken any single detail, like a big issue. The result is clearly a movie where the cheap blood and frights are not part of the ""horror"", the horror comes from the plot. This little orphan girl will stick you into the sofa from the start to finish. Her target will be to take control of her new family life, anyone interferes will have to face her. The best of this movie is the fact you will never guess what is going to happened. If you like good and elegant horror movies, this is one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An outstanding film!,"I didn't expect this film can reach this level. normally I don't expect a horror film can be very impressive.the filming team did a wonderful job like writing, photographing, directing, casting....this is a successful team, watch it then you will believe.I am very satisfied generally.there is no disgusting bloody scene, no ghost stuff, but you will feel strong tension everywhere between powerful evil and vulnerable victims.I was actually engulfed by huge horror when watching the movie, but it only made me excited.I recommend this movie to you if you are a thriller fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
oh yeah...,"Maybe my expectations for this movie were to high, because the whole storyline is full of ""stupid"" moments that have nothing to do with elementary logics. If not for the plot full of stupidity the movie would be perfect, but all those mistakes were killing me all the movie, and half of the movie was spoiled by thoughts like: ""do they seriously think anyone could fall for that?"". Still the acting is almost perfect and i believe it was the best acting i could ever see especially Max. Ant one more rock in the garden... Ending is very similar to most horror movies or action movies of the 90's and it would be way better to give people something new.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
New Twist on an Old Standard,"I LOVED Orphan and was completely blown away by how unexpectedly good and suspenseful and touching and well.. brilliant it was. Yes, the concept of an evil child wreaking havoc on a family is nothing new but please don't roll your eyes and assume that the movie is unoriginal too. The basis for the movie may not be unique but there is an original twist which has never done before regarding Esther, aka the evil child and even without that crazy twist, the actual movie held it's own. The acting was fabulous and the ending, without giving anything away was not one made of rainbows and puppies and everything sweet which is always a plus in my book since sunshine endings make me roll my eyes.Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther, the adopted evil child was nothing short of fantastic. She plays this part masterfully and when the twist is revealed, transforms herself into a whole 'nother character and sells that aspect as well. I hope to see her get more work in the future. She was amazing.Speaking of amazing, the little girl, Maxine, played by in real life, hard of hearing, Aryana Engineer, stole basically every scene she was in. Aside from being adorable, she really was a great little actress for someone with little to no experience. She's a standout.Peter Saarsgard and Vera Farmiga are great as the parents and Jimmy Bennet, who plays the son, was also good.I definitely recommend this thriller. I went into this expecting a run of the mill Omen like movie with some evil kid and the havoc being unleashed on the family but what I got was an original, well written, fantastically acted thrill ride that was above and beyond what I could have asked for when I chose the flick.9/10 Now go watch it!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan,"I had a problem with this right from the start. Just how this young girl from eastern Europe managed to get herself placed in a wealthy American family without any semblance of blood or DNA checks to establish - for real - that she was who the father ""John"" (Peter Sarsgaard) desperately wanted her to be. Though I did enjoy the film thereafter, that implausibility was never far from the back of my mind as we see the monster that is ""Esther"" (a strong performance from Isabelle Fuhrman) develop around us causing havoc and mayhem for the ""Coleman"" family - recently recovering from their own tragic bereavement. The concept is fascinating - an adult (and a ruthless and unstable one at that) in the persona of a child using innocence as the ultimate tool for deception is cleverly delivered by the cast and from the pen of Alex Mace. The wintry scenario and the John Ottman score also contribute well to a genuine sense of menace as those who get in her way are unceremoniously snuffed out. She even manages to ensnare the services of a young and vulnerable accomplice, too! It's a perfect example of hiding in plain sight, and is certainly one of the more effective role-playing, psychological, horror films I have seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy thriller,"For those of you that like thrillers like ""Single White Female,"" ""Fatal Attraction,"" or ""Audition,"" this is another shocker in the same vein. Although ""Orphan"" has some genuine thrills and scares, it made me feel a little unclean at times.When ""Orphan"" begins, we meet the Colemans: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Saargard), and their children Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Arayana Engineer). After the stillborn death of their third child, Kate and John decide to adopt one. At the orphanage, they become enchanted with a little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). At first, she appears the child from heaven: she immediately bonds with Max, and learning sign language to communicate with her (Max is deaf). But strange things start happening around Esther...This is what ""The Good Son"" could have been, had it been better written and acted. Yet, even though it rectifies the main fault I had with that movie (nothing the psychotic Macauley Culkin character did was really evil enough), that comes at a price. Children (specifically Esther) act violently in this film, and at times it crosses the line between suspense-building and unsettling. While I'll agree that having a child commit this crimes gives the film an extra punch, some (though not all) of the scenes left me feeling dirty and violated.Still, all in all, this is an impressive thriller. The most important part of a thriller is a good villain, and Esther is truly frightening. At age 12, Isabelle Fuhrman has quite the capability to scare the living hell out of anyone. She's right up there with Jennifer Jason Leigh and Eihi Shiina, or more applicably, Jacob Kogan from ""Joshua,"" which coincidentally also starred Vera Farmiga. The other cast members acquit themselves well too. Vera Farmiga is in top-form as Kate, though she's been here before (in fact, she plays almost the exact same character as she did in ""Joshua""). Peter Saarsgard, a talented actor from the independent film circuit, plays a type, but he does solid work. However, the script calls for him to be dumber than is realistically plausible, and Saarsgard can't make us believe that his character is really that oblivious. The child actors are great as well. Jimmy Bennett is solid in an unspectacular part of Daniel. He's not really excited to have a new sister, and his friends make fun of him for how Esther acts. But Arayana Engineer is perfect as Max. She's adorable, and although very young, Engineer draws our sympathy like a magnet. We never stop rooting for her.Apart from the amorality of some of the scenes, not everything that director Jaume Collet-Serra does works. He attempts to create scares where they have no place, and the failures of these elicited laughs from the audience. Speaking of laughs, there is a bit of humor in the film, and that works. However, one of the scenes is so over-the-top that it's unintentionally hilarious.I recommend it, if you've got a thick skin for this sort of thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not bad,"The name of the fishless is not a bad horror story! It is necessary to write at least about something new.Beautifully shot, the actors (even the children) play well. I liked my adopted daughter the most. It's rare to find a child actor outplaying all the adults around.The film is not scary, but if you watch it alone, you may like it. To be honest, I'm already tired of poking around in a bunch of unreleased film products while I'm looking for something at least of an average level.You can also add on your own that despite the well-left hook in the plot, which clearly hinted at the next part in the form of a prequel, the authors decided to delay this for too long.Not only did the actress grow old indecently for the role of a child, but the film itself was garbage.It's kind of disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psychological Thriller,"That was good psychological thriller! It keeps you at the edge of your sit for the whole 2 hours. My only issue with it is the father. How can a person be so stupid?

Let's All Scream For ORPHAN!!,"Yes, Orphan is far from perfect but it delivers the goods and builds the suspense in the film very well.

Bad Seed meets Play Misty for Me....,"Although I shouldn't, I often like to read critic reviews before I go see a movie. The critics either went way low or higher than expected on their ratings, but they all seemed to describe themes throughout the movie that didn't seem to jive with what I saw. The two most common being that this film was unintentionally funny(dark humor) and that the ""twist"" was disappointing. First, I'm a huge fan of the Cohen Brothers and Tarentino, and I didn't see any ""dark comedy"" in this film. Second, I would not say the ending was truly a ""twist"" in the Sixth Sense type of way. Granted, from the outset, we all know something is ""wrong with Esther""!! I more say the films ending is a ""revalation"" than a ""twist"".The movie centers on a couple (Farmiga and Sarsgard) who are struggling with the aftermath of a stillborn child. They decide to adopt an Orphan (fuhrman) and things go downhill from there.Farmiga is always solid and is no different here. She is believable as a recovering alcoholic, struggling with guilt that goes way beyond the death of her unborn baby. She has an exceptionally touching scene in which she uses sign language to read her partially deaf daughter Max(Aryana Engineer) a bedtime story. Sarsgard is sufficient as the overly naive father. And then there is Esther, portrayed quite powerfully by Isabelle Fuhrman. I have not seen her in anything else but this girl has got some BIG talent. The interactions she has with her ""new"" family are creepy and very convincing!!This is a well made horror/thriller that should not be compared to The Omen or The Excorcist, those movies where about Demonic Possession, this one is not. I would more describe it as ""Bad Seed"" meets ""Play Misty for Me"". ENJOY!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Would-be chiller with a pint-sized Bela Lugosi,"Another 'evil kid' horror film that's content to repeat the same old plot elements and tricks from earlier, better films like THE OMEN. I admit I was looking forward to ORPHAN, as it had been a while since I'd sat down with a traditional horror film and I was looking forward to being scared. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.The film does have a couple of things going in its favour. Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (who made his name with the lamentable HOUSE OF WAX remake) crafts a good-looking film with a stylishness it doesn't really deserve. Isabelle Fuhrman, as the sinister girl at the heart of the story, is excellent in the role and would be effective if given more taxing characters (Anne Frank, for instance).Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends. The characters of the parents are particularly irritating, with Peter Sarsgaard playing an oblivious bore and Vera Farmiga a thoroughly annoying mother. Farmiga, so good in a supporting role in THE DEPARTED, also gives a bad performance that displays none of the talent she showed in the Scorsese film. Only old hand CCH Pounder is any good, and she's virtually wasted.The rest of the movie plays out by rote, with the expected deaths, manipulation and betrayal, before the script throws in a ludicrous twist ending which is so laughable as to be unbelievable. It's a shame, because on occasion ORPHAN comes close to being a decent film, but in the end it just doesn't cut the mustard.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan - Didn't see that coming.,"When I first saw this move I said, ah, finally a classic horror film not with monsters and demons, but with people. Orphan is one of those movies that you don't need special effects to create a riveting film to hold the attention of movie goers. Orphan, however, will not appeal to every movie goer, it will only appeal to those who want to be drawn into the story line of and where Esther comes from and what makes here tick. This movie will keep you glued to you seat until the very end, which you will not see coming. If you like classic horror, drama and a psychological thriller, Orphan is for your.

Intense and brilliant,"This was a great movie, top to bottom. The acting is superb all around, especially Esther! For such a young girl she really sells the whole evil orphan thing just as well as the sweet innocent girl she pretends to be. The movie grabs your attention right from the start and keeps it for the entire length of the film.It's not, however, like ""Omen"" or other evil-child movies. It's not really even a horror movie as there's not a lot of genuine scares in it but it does keep a delicious high-tension vibe and a ton of fake outs.

very nice,The film is creative.Isabelle Fuhrman played the role very well.Despite the film's 32 years old state of 12 years old Esther really surprised me.She seems 32 years old.

In this way she is rescuing the children but her husband is dying. But her husband believed not Kate's and John readied himself end. Manager is very successful. script is very beautiful.

A very well done under the radar genre flick.,"I have some respect for Director Jaume Collet-Serra. He directed HOUSE OF WAX which turned into a Warner Bros attempt to cash in on Paris Hilton's 15 seconds. The movie could have easily been a train wreck of an epic magnitude, but instead turned out to be a respectable genre piece and I think should be considered pretty well when taken as such.THE ORPHAN Good movie. It is what I thought it would be, but that is mostly because of the positive buzz I've been hearing form from genre fans. (The filmmakers and studio must be psyched about this. Usually word of mouth kills horror movies.) The cast was excellent. One is likely to hear much ado about aged 12 Isabelle Fuhrman. Fuhrman was dead on creepy and had an honest but subtly consistent Russian accent that would put many Hollywood mainstays to shame. It appears that she is going to be in a remake of CHILDREN OF THE CORN, so we could be witnessing the birth of a new scream queen - or scream creep. It's a shame to type cast so early, but she was that good.This movie was very much Vera Farmiga's (The Wife) as well. She's a veteran actor that's seen some screen time in THE DEPARTED and a bunch of smaller movies and TV roles. I have to admit that I don't remember her from THE DEPARTED, but she did enough in ORPHAN to warrant a revisiting of some of her work. At aged 36, Farmiga is real world attractive and brings a convincing knack for nuanced method acting to the film. Her emotionally unstable and self doubting character is a sale right from the start and that wonderful vividness plays with kinetic appeal when joined by Fuhrman.The plot of the movie is not dissimilar from others in this sub-genre. What ORPHAN brings to the mix is well paced tension and some neat visuals by way of camera work and concept (the black light images were wonderfully malevolent). The seemingly single-shot playground sequence was inspired even though you probably know what's going to happen. The film seemed a little long and The Husband (Peter Sarsgaard) a trifling bit generic. However the climax is enough to make one forget that the film is pushing an hour fifty when it starts; and Sarsgaard pulls off several good scenes in the climax for a mini redemption.As a genre film, I would have to admit ORPHAN is a startling surprise from a movie that was not even in orbit around my radar. Even better, I would have to call it a pretty good movie all around. The movie has some re-baked ideas, but the recipe is different enough to keep it interesting and tasty!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best 'naughty little kid' movie I've seen!,"There's something unnatural and haunting when we see children in film (or in any context) that abandon the ideal of innocence and virtue we're used to seeing in Disney movies. Still, we're compelled to watch as the children on screen defy our perception as they grab that kitchen knife or the sickle in the cornfield. I admit, it's a paradox that I'm always eager to experience. I've seen and enjoyed The Bad Seed, The Good Son, Pet Cemetery, Children of the Corn, and even the low-budget varieties like Milo and the recent Whisper.Orphan took an all-too-familiar concept and gave us something unique. I dare say that Esther will quickly earn her spot in the elite group of super-villains that have risen to legendary status. Yes, Esther is still haunting me the morning after, and that's extremely tough to do to me. I think the most terrifying element of this character is how angelic she appears. There are parts of the film where you actually don't want to believe she's evil. You start to have compassion for her troubled life as an orphan. Oh, Daddy Warbucks, how lucky you are to have a girl like Annie.The films greatest achievement is the character development. While most movies in this sub-genre move from kill to kill like checking off a grocery list, forgetting to allow us to connect to the cast, Orphan lets us inside the Coleman household, as we discover their most intimate histories and struggles. You understand and identify with every motive of each character. As the film presses on, the person you cheered for, you start to despise. And just when you start to despise them, you realize they still don't deserve what Esther has planned for them, and you begin to cheer for them all over again.The tension in the film almost never lets up. There are times we get to stretch for a moment, only to resume the position at the edge of the seat. As a chronic nail-biter, I was left with nothing but stubs by the end credits. As we long for just dessert to be served, the film steamrolls on, as evil continues to prevail. It's a torture that almost made me want to sneak into Aliens in the Attic playing on the other side of the wall. And after all the shouting at the screen, we realize we knew exactly what we were getting into. Well, not EXACTLY. Esther's secret hits us like a Shyamalan ending (pre-The Happening), and we soon fear the worst.Given the suspense, the character development, the great cinematography and transparent score, this is an excellent thriller. And it is definitely my favorite 'Kid Killer' movie, with the Omen at a close second. The only reason it's not a perfect '10' to me is because the plot, while done in a unique, refreshing way, is still a familiar one. Some scenes are more like carbon-copies of its predecessors than original thoughts. I also would've liked another five minutes of closure before the credits, but I'm still satisfied with the ending. This movie definitely made my wife and I think twice about taking home cute freckle-faced orphans. Hurry and see it in the theaters!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
not even awful is deserved,"The worst, stupidest movie I've seen for a long time. It doesn't even deserves 3 points. Do NOT waste 2 hours to watch it! The movie contains all the clichés we are all sick seeing. The horror element is created only by the sound effects and some poor well known director techniques. It is full of impossible events, I know its just a movie but if it wasn't a horror not even the 12 year old children would believe it. The acting is not bad but having in mind all the other bad parts it doesn't deserve watching. There are bunch of other much better movies in the same genre with much less rating. The whole idea is already kind of worn off. The movie creates the feeling that you know what's going to happen in the next few minutes and HOW, and it actually happens as you thought it would. As a conclusion - the worst 2 hours I've recently spent for a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A very dark and effective, but cliché horror film.","Orphan is a horror thriller about a couple who decide to adopt a kid after having a miscarriage, so they decide to adopt Esther, a wonderful, talented and gifted child. After some bad things start to happen they eventually realize that there is probably something wrong with Esther. Telling you what's wrong with Esther would be a spoiler but I have to say it was the best twist I've seen all year and if anyone says that they saw it coming then they're lying. There's no way anyone saw that coming. Yes, the plot is extremely over the top and cliché for a horror film but I happen to think that the cheese factor really helps to keep this movie entertaining.I'm now going to talk about the performances in Orphan. The movie stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard who really are two of the best actors in Hollywood today. For this type of horror movie, you really wouldn't expect such respected actors. However, they really seem to be very into their roles, which is terrific and they were never over the top. It's even produced by Leonardo Di Caprio, so maybe it isn't just going to be a mindless horror film with terrible acting and it really didn't. Esther was played by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhrman. It certainly helps that she isn't a big name child actress, so that she is more believable and terrifying as Esther. Her Russian accent really adds to her creepiness. The things that she did in this movie were insane and hopefully she will be able to become a classic horror villain.Even though I enjoyed the movie, there were some parts that I laughing at the silliness of it. This is not a perfect movie and it has some major flaws. First of all, almost everything about this movie was extremely cliché and not entirely original. The plot of an evil child and bad seed was been done many times before and it's been done a lot better, such as in The Omen. There's a few scenes in the movie where a woman opens the mirror and no one's there, but when she closes the mirror someone appears and it's supposed to scare us. That cliché has been overdone to the max, to the point that it's not scary anymore. They did the same thing with a refrigerator and even used music. It was a very anti-climatic scare. The movie wasn't that realistic either. I don't actually think that they would have kept Esther for such a long time after all the bad things that kept happening. You have to just go with the movie, even if it's in a realistic world. Not everything is going to make sense and if you keep that mentality then you can enjoy the entertainment. The twist, however, was probably the most original thing about the movie as unrealistic as it may be. I actually knew about the twist before I saw the movie because I didn't think I was going to see it. I definitely regret that, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. If you can, don't find out the twist before you see the movie because you'll have a better time.Orphan is a very effective and delightfully dark horror movie that you should definitely try to see and it's just an easy way to escape from reality and be entertained for 2 hours. I'm going to give this an 8/10. You should see this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great horror movie after long time...,"I think it is a little hard to decide how to vote for this movie. If it was a ""normal"" movie (I think no-horror), it will be 6 points from me. But ...But this is real horror. This is real drama about normal peoples problems, normal things which can (with a little dope of fantasy) really happen. Movies like this are not common at all, today we may see every of those super-expensive ghost stories with full 3D and I do not know what everything... This movie, movies like that, is real fresh breeze for horror movies.But, why I did not vote for 10/10. I may vote, but only, if that movie starts 5 minutes later after start and ends 10 minutes before starts. I think that were the worst parts of movie.Bad things, which I did not like: Too fairy beginning -- after which I thought there was another 3/10 horror movie Illogicalities -- Stupid pathos at one of very last scenesGood things I liked!

What a truly terrific film,"I saw the poster for this and was intrigued. I decided to watch and was pleasantly impressed. The gloomy, dark settings and the fact the family house was practically in the middle of nowhere gave the sense this was definitely a film to send shivers down your spine.And send it did. There were scenes where I couldn't watch; I hid behind my cushion because the little girl was that, well, scary. The fact she seemed so angelic but evidently wasn't was unsettling, what with her dark hair in pigtails and deep, disturbing stare.CCH Pounder was pretty good as the sister, Vera (not sure her surname) was definitely good as the wife, and I'll refer to him as a younger Kiefer Sutherland (let's face it, he was a bit of a spitting image) was also good as the disbelieving husband. I adored the lil deaf girl, who was too terrified to say or do anything, in case of getting hurt by who she thought was a delight as an older sister.I wont give anything away, but you have to watch this movie. If only for the shocking twist.Brilliantly acted, really worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Proof that not ALL child actors are bad!,"I've just watched 'Orphan' for the fourth time and, as usual, I'm left pretty speechless at the performance the titular 'orphan' Esther (played by the extraordinarily-capable Isabelle Fuhrman). It's one thing to cast kids in a movie FOR kids. Children don't really pay much attention to 'acting ability' and it's up to the adults in the cinema audience to cringe and roll their eyes at what they're forced to watch. However, so many times when child actors are used in a film for an older audience, they can quite often bring down an otherwise good film. I'm so glad to say that the reverse happened here.A brief summary of the plot would be that a family (mother and father played respectively by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) adopt a child to add to their existing two children. The girl in question is - you guessed it - Esther and, it's fair to say that they get more than they bargained for.I didn't know anything about this film before I sat down to watch and I definitely recommend you know as little as possible before seeing it. The marketing surrounding it kind of makes it look like a horror film, but, trust me, it's nothing like your standard 'hack 'n slash' affair (it's much better than that!).Maybe it was destined to be average, but Isabelle Fuhrman just elevates it to exceptional levels. I almost found it quite difficult to believe that a child could pull off such a part. It's worth watching for her alone.If you like horror/thriller films in general, you should definitely check this out. Just don't find out too much before hand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Be careful with the child you adopted,"A couple adopted a 9-year-old daughter. However, a series of strange events and caused the husband and wife to get an unexpected attack.Orphan becamean incredible f ilm horror. Fromthe beginning of the film, we get such a strong sense and impression of horror. It dawns on us to feel the thrill of fear from this film. There are many scenes in which we are made to think as if there would be a sudden appearance. However, we are deceived and it is precisely the sudden appearance that comes at an unthinkable time. Orphan has a nice, dense story premise. The film has a slow tempo to give space in providing terror and strangeness that occurs in the house. Also by giving space to look deeper into the conflict they are facing. Scenes that are able to give a nuance and frightening. In addition to horror, the film also carries a powerful mystery story.

"Starts off well, falters spectacularly at the end.","""I don't think Mommy likes me very much.""I know the ""evil child"" movie has been done to death, but that doesn't mean that another one worth watching doesn't come along on occasion. I thought Orphan was going to to be one of those worthwhile flicks...until the last act.A family with a troubled past that's only recently managed to move past a tragic miscarriage decides to welcome a new child named Esther into their home. Esther initially seems like a bright, lovely nine-year-old, but soon troubling events make the mother (Vera Farmiga) and Esther's two new siblings suspicious of the girl. And for good reason. Esther has plans for her new family, and deadly things happen when her plans are threatened.Isabelle Fuhrman is perfect as Esther, whether she's being adorably charming, or completely sociopathic. This kind of movie succeeds or fails based on whether the characters involved draw you into the story, or make you laugh at the absurdity of the premise. Largely because of young Isabella, Orphan fell into the later category for me.Up until the ending, that is. I'll be honest, I though the finale was outright terrible. The word ""inexplicable"" comes to mind. It really hurt a movie that up to that point was fairly good. I guess the silly twist was made in order to make Orphan more believable, but it achieved the exact opposite effect.It's not really a horror movie, so don't expect lots of chills. But as a pretty dark thriller, Orphan works for its first hundred minutes. The twisty (and unnecessary) shenanigans near the end, though, hurt the movie a lot. It's been a while since my opinion of a film nosedived so quickly while I was watching it.

No way, Jose.And, that, my friends, is why, in my books, this Horror/Thriller lost itself so many points.There's no plausible way that Esther could've ever kept up her devious, little deception for such an extended period of time, especially when you mix into this poisonous recipe the messy ingredient of her committing multiple murders and actually getting away with it for so long.From a standpoint of rational thinking, that was just too much for this viewer to accept.And, besides all of that, Orphan was one of those films that could've certainly used some serious editing.At its 2.5-hour running time, I had grown so bored of the whole charade that by the time Esther's true identity was finally revealed, I honestly couldn't have given a sweet damn about it, at all.In fact, this revelation was almost anti-climatic in nature.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Isabelle Fuhrman astounds in a fierce psychological horror-thriller,"In all the time it's taken me to get around to watching this, the one aspect I concretely heard of with high praise was the performance of Isabelle Fuhrman. That reputation is no joke - only 12 years old at the time 'Orphan' was released, Fuhrman demonstrates the acting skill of someone much older. In a role that's very adult. It's not just that she exhibits range, nuance, physicality, and force of personality - she brings a stark intensity to Esther's coldest moments that's earnestly disturbing, a startling ferocity to the instances of most heightened emotions, yet also a disarming sweetness that's delectable for the contrast. As fine a film as this is generally, there can be no doubt that Fuhrman is a major contributor to its success; this is worth watching for her alone.While Fuhrman represents the most substantial value here, she's not alone. David Leslie Johnson's screenplay is extraordinary in giving us characters with fabulous complexity. More than that: even as the audience is well aware of Esther's nature, the narrative and scene writing does a fantastic job of slowly building piece by piece the sinister tapestry of the girl's psychopathy; just as we think she can't go any further, she does. 'Orphan' carries wonderfully strong horror vibes not just in the wild danger Esther poses, and her violence, but in her manipulation, and the disintegrating effect she has on the health and especially the mental states of those around her. It's taut, harrowing, and thrilling, and distinctly horrifying at its best - while also cementing in early scenes that for as fearsome as Esther is, some of the most boorish of typical behavior of ordinary school age children really isn't that far removed.I don't know if it needed to be two hours - the length could have been reined in a bit. Some of Jaume Collet-Serra's choices as director are also excessive, such as the way some shots are arranged, or the inclusion of multiple red herring moment, meant to raise suspense only to show us ""oh, there's nothing here after all."" Yet for as excellent as this is in every other regard, these considerations feel very minor. Though Fuhrman shines brightest of all the rest of the cast are no slouches; Vera Farmiga and Aryana Engineer certainly stand out. The stunt work is exceptional, with art direction, production design, and effects not far behind. While I tend to keep an eye out for it anyway, I think the costume design and hair and makeup work deserve special mention in this case, too. But again - there's very little in 'Orphan' that I think could be meaningfully criticized in the first place, as it's just that good.Content warnings are perhaps necessary for animal cruelty, and violence with children involved, and of course strong violence broadly. These aside, personal preferences vary and this won't appeal to all comers. Yet even as I knew it was well regarded, and that I'd surely enjoy it, still I'm roundly impressed with this picture, and above all with Fuhrman. It can't be overstated what a phenomenal performance she gives, commanding a dazzling presence and skill set that exceeds her youth, and I hope she continues to enjoy a robust career. 'Orphan' is a jarring, compelling, greatly satisfying horror flick that remains well worth checking out if you have the chance, and I'm so very glad I finally did so myself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Bloody, Gory, Chaotic Child Slasher!¡!","Orphan is one of the handful of decent child slashers that quickly gained a cult following due to its ability to stand alone against other films with the same premise. Most of these slashers that we're partial to can't create the same dramatic and equally horrifying atmosphere that Orphan did. In this psychological thriller, married couple, Kate and John attempt to mend their broken hearts by adopting a child after their baby is stillborn. They are immediately drawn to the charisma of an orphan named Esther. She is a reserved little lady with a secret and a mean streak that her adoptive mother quickly becomes aware of. The family is turned upside down when Kate's battle to protect her children against Esther is viewed as a relapse into her alcoholism... Vera Farmiga, who played Kate Coleman, has the ability to portray this intense grief and sadness that few actors can. Her performance was reminiscent of Toni Collette in Hereditary (2018). Those actresses can effortlessly deliver these tear-jerking, gut-wrenching, OSCAR-worthy performances! Isabelle Fuhrman was also brilliant, as Esther. She gave a violent, raw, and gritty performance. I absolutely respect the dedication that she had to such a complex character at such a young age! Not to mention, this film had one of the biggest plot twists and dramatic reveals in recent horror... About 15 minutes could have been shaved off of the first half of the film to aid its pacing, but the last half serves as a fast-paced frenzy of suspenseful, premeditated thrills... Chances are that if you saw Orphan, you either loved it or hated it. Despite the mixed reviews, I was thoroughly entertained during the entire film, its chaos, and all of its bloody, gory violence. 78%",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A suspenseful psychological horror dominated by Isabelle Fuhrman's chilling portrayal of Esther, and Aryana Engineer's genuine innocence shining as Max.","I have heard of Orphan for a while, and the title poster made me think it was another horror involving a Satanic kid, or an Omen-movie. However, there are similarities to other horror movies, Orphan is well-directed and very well acted. Isabelle Fuhrman's titular orphan is both evil but sympathetic. I rooted for her till the end, and as her past is revealed slowly, I even empathize with her more. On top of that, Fuhrman's foil is Max, played by Aryana Engineer. Engineer's Max is pure innocence, and angelic. Before Furhman's Esther is revealed, I was already rooting for Max. Max is so adorable, innocent, and vulnerable. The fact that she is half deaf and communicates with sign language establishes the emotional core of the movie. Immediately, knowing this is a horror movie, I was already dreading what may happen to Max. This dynamic is played well through the movie, and every scene Fuhrman shares with Engineer is almost unbearable because of the dread I feel for Max. It is amazing that Engineer, as an actor was too young to understand what was going on and just thought it was a game, so her innocence is genuine. Whereas Fuhrman fully owned the role, and her interviews shows how well she understood the character. Vera Farmiga, and Peter Sasgard play the role of Esther's adoptive parents, and their backstories are interesting. They are characters you care for, and seem genuinely loving. All this is what helps make Orphan so scary. It is not the gore, but the thought of what may happen to them. The beginning of the movie set the tone of the movie, though it was less subtle. In fact, Esther enters the scene quite late in the movie, but the dread has been established much earlier. The camera work was important too. The first person perspective shots brought a sense of mystery, and allowed the audience to see the world through the character's eyes. Because of the steady build up, when a violent scene occurs, it feels very powerful. I must say that though Vera Farmiga and Peter Sasgard's performances are believable, they are over-shadowed by Isabelle Fuhrman's chilling portrayal of the titular orphan, and Aryana Engineer's wide-eyed innocence. I am looking forward to the prequel, and hope both Fuhrman and Engineer get good roles in future. Especially Fuhrman. In short, Orphan is a suspenseful psychological horror dominated by child actors that make you root for them till the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Successfully Horrifying Horror,"The Orphan: Horror that is truly horrifying
Review by Denise NoeA horror movie is meant to horrify and The Orphan is first-rate horror. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick authored the script based on a story by Alex Mace and Jaume Collet-Serra directed the film. It begins with Kate (Vera Farmiga), accompanied by husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) rushing through hospital doors so Kate can deliver her baby. From a conversation with a nurse, we soon learn that it is her third child. But . . . Alarm bells start to ring. Something appears to have gone wrong with the pregnancy. She is told the baby is dead and she protests that she feels movement. A nurse hands her a body soaked in blood.Then she wakes up. Soon the story comes out that Kate and John are parents to a daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer) and a son, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett). Family members have learned Sign Language since Max is deaf. Kate gave a third baby that was stillborn. There are tensions in the marriage as Kate once had a drinking problem and there is a decade-old infidelity on John's part. However, the couple are solidly affluent and can easily afford another child. The couple believe adopting a youngster might soothe the aching void left by the stillbirth.Kate and John visit an orphanage where they talk to Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) about the children up for adoption. The couple notice a pretty nine-year-old girl, Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), who is from Russia. Esther likes to paint and they are impressed by her painting. The nun praises her as a ""mature"" child and seemingly very well-adjusted despite tragedies in her background. In addition to having been orphaned in Russia, little Esther has already been adopted by an American family. Sister Abigail recalls that her adoptive family died in a house fire. Luckily, Esther made it out.Kate and John decide that Esther will make a good addition to their family. They take her home with them. At first Max and Daniel appear delighted to have a new sister although Daniel is a bit standoffish, fearing she is ""weird."" For example, she wants to dress in manner more formal than usually done in elementary school.Esther shows an interest in Kate's piano. Mom and new daughter bond over piano lessons. Then Kate comes across Esther playing the piano in a manner that shows years of training. She fibbed about not knowing how to play the piano . . . Could she have fibbed about other things?Awful events start occurring. A child is seriously injured in a fall from a slide when Esther is nearby. Kate suspects Esther may have pushed the other child. She fears she and her new daughter are failing to bond. However, Esther seems to want to be close to her new daddy. When Kate shares concerns, John defends little Esther. Other events follow and Kate becomes increasingly confused. Just what is going on? Most importantly, who is little Esther?Moving along at a crisp pace, The Orphan draws us in from the opening scene to the last. Collet-Serra knows precisely when to give us a break and when to ratchet up the tension. Performances are excellent throughout with Isabelle Fuhrman deserving special kudos. Only a twelve-year-old child when she played Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman inhabits this singularly odd character with the professionalism of the finest adult performer.The Orphan is a top-notch motion picture that is sure to keep the viewer interested and intrigued.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Orphan (2009),"A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt Esther a 9-year-old Russian orphan girl who seem to be the perfect child at first glance. Esther is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be.Once in awhile a film will come out that tries to be different and put out an original story. Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra has done just that with feature film Orphan. While this sub-genre of horror usually means some sort of demonic-possession or some sort of mental or genetic abnormality causing for their psychotic or sociopath behavior, in Orphan an interesting reason was given to the nature of it's titular character.12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrmann (in 2009) does an excellent job portraying the sociopath and manipulative Esther. It is difficult to believe that a child actor of her age able to tackle such a dark role and actually pull it off without making the character too over-the-top or campy. In fact, no matter how one thinks of the performances of the rest of the film's cast (Very attractive Vera Farmiga is particularly convincing as Kate, a caring mother and loving wife with evident depth with Sarsgaard turning in an above average performance as the hapless and clueless husband) this film is totally Fuhrmann's and she sticks the landing. Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut would have approved of Furmann's form :) .Orphan tackles some complex issues that add depth. The film builds great suspense with some eye-opening disturbing violence consisting of successful and attempted murders, while others are injured and self-mutilation occurs. Various scenes of that have bloody results. Orphan is the Real McCoy for horror-hound.Well made, well Acted, surprisingly great horror-thriller! Orphan is a cut above most spooky-kid movies, with a twist that sets it apart. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The bad seed plus,"Ok it was kind of late and I live watching a good horror film for the first time, As long as it's not a dumb one and there's a lot of them on that I just ignore. But I had a gut instinct that this one would be awesome and I was right. First off the main star; Vera Farmiga from the conjuring movies. She's great in everything. So that's a plus. There's a lot of good shock scenes and sort of a twist ending. No spoilers, But think Bad Seed, The good Son, and 2009's The Children. Puts a scary spin on adopting a child. But damn this movie gave me goosebumps, And I'm usually immune to most horror movies getting to me like orphan did. I cannot believe I did not catch this back in 2009. I'm giving this the highest rating. And I'm going to view it again. When you look at the few past horror films like the nun and annabelle comes home which to me were pretty lackluster. Orphan is not to be missed by any horror fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Truly scary little girl Excellent Horror/Thriller,"I haven't seen a good horror/thriller film in a while and this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire ride, the plot was fairly realistic and even more so when the clever plot twist is thrown in at the end which ties the whole thing together. Excellent acting from the Isabelle Fuhrman playing Esther the orphan girl. She played her role well very mature for her age and sweet and innocent when need be... I think the comparisons made to Natalie Portman's performance in ""The Professional"" and Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview with a Vampire."" is very accurate. (As stated on her IMDb biography trivia page). I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger audiences there was a lot of violence and it was a scary movie with a couple of sexual scenes in it but I will say it did have a twisted sort of ""happy""-ish ending where it didn't leave me feeling depressed about the way things turned out but it wasn't some unrealistic everything is cheery either.

Orphan: Psycho-drama and horror for family fun,"This was one of the best surprises in recent years. As horror stories go, I usually expect ""more of the same"". When seeing posters and trailers, I thought pretty much ""more of the same"". But I am glad to report, this was not ""more of the same"".The story was extremely well written with twists and turns that easily kept my attention. I'll admit there were some pretty slow moments that made me think it had peaked out early, but I was wrong. Stay with the movie as it squeezes out the last of your disbelief. Just don't believe everything you see and your reward will be the unforeseeable twist. Even if you think they can't be serious, the explanation is justified and real.I liked how the movie was done, almost seeming like ""Damien"" may have had a sister (btw, she was one ""twisted sister""). At first feeling like a Brady Bunch movie gone bad, it soon became more like a docu-drama for discouraging adoption. While this movie could easily become competition for Psycho, Friday the 13th and The Omen I felt this movie was a lot smarter. I never expected the big twist. I certainly appreciated the explanation. Without the explanation, this would have been a major disappointment. Is it realistic? - I don't know. I only know I went in doubtful and came out a believer.Again I loved the writing, the camera work, the twists, the suspenseful events. And even minor disappointments fit in extremely well. I have to say, I didn't like the final moments but you will have to just take that and do with it what you will.While all the actors did very well, I think Isabelle Fuhrman had the biggest challenge and she pulled it off extremely well. She has ""disturbing"" down perfectly.8 of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nope.,"5 / 10I watched this movie end not even an hour ago, and yet the movie is not fresh in my mind. This is the first thing that came into my head when I thought ""What did I think of the film?"" Perhaps I didn't think. The movie was not particularly good, to say the least.Sure it could have been good, engaging, and possibly even touching (something it didn't occur to me to do with my feminine viewing partner here while watching this ""masterpiece""), had I cared about the characters all that much. I called the ""twist"" (I don't think they were going for M Night here, if you know what I mean, but i guess that's what i'll call it) at least 30 minutes before it aired on-screen. This movie could have been better in that it could have been made before, or I'm even willing to go with after, my time on this earth.A 7.2 on IMDb should say ""this movie is probably enjoyable no matter who you are"" not ""this movie is probably enjoyable no matter where you are ...other than in the theater it's playing.""It was reasonably well-acted and good production value. I usually give films at least a 5 if they are made and presented decently. It had a story, although I could watch doctors, nurses, and other personnel try to figure out who a Jane Doe is and get about the same enjoyment out of it. Not engaging, nothing new, not scary, BUT very dramatic. This movie tries to have scary moments that simply aren't and doesn't have the story to make you care enough about the characters to make them so. I could see anyone who has known protective feelings toward a child, and emotional-feeling people enjoying, or gripping their seat at, this film.... Not many others.5 / 10 - Five out of ten.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
There's something wrong with Esther.,"The tragic loss of their unborn child has devastated Kate and John, taking a toll on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and haunted by demons from her past. Struggling to regain some semblance of normalcy in their lives, the couple decides to adopt another child. At the local orphanage, both John and Kate find themselves strangely drawn to a young girl named Esther. Almost as soon as they welcome Esther into their home, however, an alarming series of events begins to unfold, leading Kate to believe that there's something wrong with Esther—this seemingly angelic little girl is not what she appears to be.I just literally came back from a screening of ORPHAN and forgive me, I'm still soaking in what was in the film. Wow. This was a messed up movie. Really, some of the things in here are just flat out wrong and the fact that the filmmakers had the gumption to do what they did, from the twist to the taboos, I applaud them. ORPHAN has what usually most horror movies have, from the music cue waiting to have people jump out of their seats to the character who is clueless from what's going on. I believe the movie is self aware of itself and other horror films and uses that to its advantage to have fun with the clichés. However, what sets this apart from other films is that it pushed the boundaries. After the movie ends, you can't help but have an uncomfortable feeling lingering as you drive home.But I won't say anymore about what boundaries the film pushed, because that ruins the fun. The film has a running time of barely over two hours, which is longer than most films these days, let alone horror films. Fortunately, this isn't a bad thing because the first half of the film was like a great character study. There is more character development in the first ten minutes of this film compared to all of most other horror movies. I was taken off guard. I appreciated that, making most of the characters people who you would root for.Surprisingly, there is a lot of dark humor. I laughed out loud more than I thought I would and I'm sure the audience I was with was surprised too. When the film started, the audience was quiet, because they weren't sure how the film will play out. By the end, everyone seemed to have the time of their lives. I know I did. With its shares of dark humor, the film also produces some tense and unsettling scenes. This is mostly due to Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed the remake of HOUSE OF WAX, one of my favorite slashers. He sets everything up nicely, while using sound to make the audience uncomfortable. Be on the look out for him in the future. He has a big career in front of him. I know it.The film has its strong performances...and I mean from everyone. Even the kids have strong performances, which is saying a lot. I didn't feel annoyed by them. A film like this must be carried well by the evil kid herself, and she absolutely rises to the task. Isabelle Fuhrman does such a fantastic job playing the evil Esther. After saying that, it still feels like an understatement. Remember Damien? You know, the Devil's child? Well, he seems like a nice kid now. The film is also supported by two great leads, played by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard. Farmiga plays well as the sympathetic mother that nobody but herself believes while Sarsgaard feels like a clueless father and a great one at that.The film also has a great score composed by John Ottman, along with some nice production values, which give the film a slick look. Overall, if you want to see an evil kid causing havoc, here's the movie. The film mixes the dark humor and tense scenes really well. There's also a twist in the movie towards the end which sets itself apart from other evil kid movies. The twist is not improbable at all, which is a great thing. The film is pure entertainment from beginning to end and it works because of the fantastic Isabelle Fuhrman. I can't praise her enough. Finally, all I have to say is this: Esther is just an evil little kid. Pity, because she's such a great well-mannered artist who can play Tchaikovsky flawlessly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Boring, Unoriginal, Old Dog out of tricks","I left the movie after 20 mins, this is how boring it is. Some called it building up the suspense. I call it a hollow script based on nothing that doesn't need 1.5 hrs to tell the story.Director wasted the first 20 mins to show you a few things: woman lost her baby, she got a deaf daughter, got a architech husband, worked at harvard but got kicked out b/c of alcoholism. That took 20 mins!!! After my cigarate break, washroom break, calling on my cell for the next 15 mins, a kid got adopted. Then I decided I gave enough credits of doubts to the director and enjoyed my nap nap in on the coach.Then someone woke me up when the kid's real identity was revealed. Sadly, it's just a cheap Hollywood gimick stole the core idea from a french movie ""He loves me, he loves me not"" (À la folie... pas du tout (2002)).Totally disappointed and waste of time.

Not your typical Post-1980s horror movie,"I'll admit I was a bit skeptical believing all the hype about this movie. I've had very little interest in watching horror films that have come out in the past couple of decades, as they're all virtually the same. Blood, sex, and no plot recycled with a new title over and over again. Orphan was different.Although from the beginning you don't really fall in love with Esther, you really have no idea until the tail end of the movie when it's revealed where she's really coming from. I really enjoyed this movie, and would give kudos to the girl who played Esther; she's got a bright future ahead of her.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great new horror movie.,"Horror has been real stale for a long time now, with only foreign movies like (REC) and the borderline-horror Let the Right One In bringing anything worthwhile to the table. But what about America, the country that spawned the most popular icons of the genre? It's mostly been wallowing in silly remakes of shitty Japanese movies or bad PG 13 ghost stories - and let's not even mention SAW and Hostel - since the last half of the 90s. It's time for a real turn-around movie to bring America back to the forefront. The Descent was good, and those horror comedies like Planet Terror and SLiTHER were nice distractions, but we need a really good, kickass return to why horror is good in the first place. With that said...Orphan.I mean, good god. Where did this even come from? It's the most terrifying, depraved, downright evil movie I've seen out of a mainstream US theater in years! This movie is ballsy, not afraid at all to take risks or make you feel completely hopeless. I had no idea what was going to happen next at any turn in this movie; everything was shot in the dark and masterfully suspenseful. And yeah, of course the kid is evil, but she's built up in a way that makes you like her and feel sorry for her at first - something that even a good movie like Omen didn't do.I was honestly completely surprised at a lot of the things this movie did, from the twisted opening sequence to the final bloody chase through the snow. This movie is brutal and does not hold back, and I like that a lot about it. It doesn't even try to sugar coat the children from harm - I'm obviously not going to say I like this about it, but that's what makes it so goddamn SCARY, and that is why it rules. Where other movies would come off as silly doing some of the stuff here, and while some of it is a bit ""been there done that,"" it's all just executed so well that I can't say no.Oh, and there are even a few comedic moments scattered throughout, adding an unexpected element of humor to the darkly chimeric mix here. They aren't too prevalent, but they're definitely noticeable. It doesn't lighten the mood, it just makes the movie more real. That's what any humor in a movie like this should do.Yeah, there are a few dull moments, and a few kind of generic scares, but those are in the minority. This movie is just supremely good, definitely the best horror movie I've seen out of the US this decade. Highly recommended to those of you who can't turn down a good headtrip every now and then.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Please Stop Criticising this Great Movie..Its Must Watch If You Are Looking For Horror..,"There is a strange way with critics.They go on slashing every second horror movie because its 'nothing different'.At least to that extent,I agree but what else they want.I went into theater expecting an evil adopted child type slasher movie. with no character development and some cheap shocks,well i was shocked but in a quite positive way..People who say this is offensive to orphans should stop watching movies,If thats the case then every movie made in a hospital is offensive for doctors and so on.Come on Guys and Gals,The team of this movie has given us very different after a long time.Its no Jig-saw-influenced-supervillian -effort at all,rather this movie till a Very surprising ending (won't reveal because thats the best part of the movie) keeps you shivering because all its scares you see are not different,but the focus is different,an Orphan 9 year old from Russia..The story or basic plot can be read anywhere so I wont go there.But I definitely want to recommend it to everyone who wants a genuinely different scary stuff.The acting performances top of all by the orphan girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) is something never seen by a child in a horror movie.The only such performances by children in horrors can be compared to 1961 ""Innocents"" and 2001 ""The Others"".Vera Farmiga as Alcoholic-neurotic-loving mom has given a very mature performance.Peter Saarsgard is OK too..Camera Angles,Lighting and the general atmosphere of the movie is on par for what it was meant to be..No one can conclude the review of this movie without mentioning one of greatest Twist Endings of all.I am a doctor and I didn't see it coming.(You will know when you watch it),it really left my mouth open for a while..So the final verdict is if you missed this movie in theaters,buy the DVD when its out.Your money won't be wasted,its a very very mature,original,horror movie which takes itself very seriously and there is nothing offensive about it at all..Don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Welcome back to good horror.,"After years of pointless slasher movies that like to pass themselves off as horror, and movies about haunted houses that couldn't scare a child, I was hesitant about seeing orphan, but after the almost two hours I spent at the theater I can gladly admit, this movie was money very well spent. Its a clever blend of deep psychological thriller, with the right amount of horrific detail to leave you on the edge of your seat, horrified at what you have just seen, but begging for more. What can I say about Esther? The young actress who played her, will most certainly be winning Oscars in years to come, for a young girl of 12, she acts with the experience of someone 2 or 3 times her own age, delivering some truly memorable lines and some horrific scenes. Her portrayal of Esther is chilling, memorable, and believable, much like the movie itself. The first scene sets the tone for the movie, giving just enough insight to what has happened, while not dwelling forever on what will happen, and then the story progresses seamlessly into the main plot. The plot advances on a slowly moving, but well timed frame, and every scene sets up the next perfectly. The end comes right on cue, not too early or late, with the right amount of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Do not hesitate, get to this movie now, and be prepared for the best horror thriller suspense movie since 1995.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Annie she ain't!,"Orphan not only belongs to the 'evil kid' category of horror (The Bad Seed, Bloody Birthday, Village of the Damned, The Omen), but is also part of the 'cuckoo in the nest' sub-genre (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, The Stepfather, Pacific Heights, The Good Son), where an outsider is accepted into a household only to destroy it from within. In this case, a couple coming to terms with the still-birth of third child Jessica have their lives shattered after adopting Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a seemingly perfect nine-year-old Russian-born orphan girl, who inevitably turns out to be a manipulative, home-wrecking psycho with a terrifying secret.The format may seem familiar, the script is occasionally predictable (that rose bush was destined to get trashed!), and the film might rely rather too heavily on formulaic false scares to keep the tension running high, but Orphan is still a winner thanks to some brilliant performances (particularly from the young and very talented Fuhrman, who is definitely 'one to watch'), slick direction from Jaume Collet-Serra, and one hell of a twisted denouement that goes to prove that Hollywood still has the power to shock when it really wants to.At just over two hours, the film takes a fairly leisurely approach for much of its running time, allowing viewers to get to know the family intimately before the nasty stuff begins: we learn that mother Kate (Vera Farmiga) is a recovering alcoholic whose booze addiction was almost responsible for the death of her deaf daughter Max (Aryana Engineer), and that father John (Peter Sarsgaard) has not long admitted to having an extra-marital fling. Meanwhile, son Daniel is at the age where he is desperate to be accepted by his peers and is jealous of the attention lavished on the newest member of the family. Despite these characters' weaknesses, however, they are all extremely likable individuals, which makes it all the more horrifying when Esther begins to exploit the cracks in their relationships to terrifying effect.Towards the end of the film, Collet-Serra picks up the pace, dropping the psychological horror in favour of slasher-style scares, complete with a house plunged into darkness, bloody knife attacks, and a seemingly dead Esther repeatedly returning for a few more stabs; but with flawless execution, a few genuinely unforeseen deaths, and a twist ending that, although perhaps a little preposterous, is both inventive and perverse, Orphan is a real treat for fans of frightfully freaky films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This film restores my faith in contemporary horror thrillers!!!,"Horror thrillers are going everywhere, I tell you. From gruesome accidents, to supernatural and nightmarish creatures, to psychos, to ghosts...there's a horror film about everything. It seems like ages ago since I saw a film that made children- children, for chrissake- look truly demonic and terrorizing. That film was, of course, ""The Omen"" (1976), but Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Orphan"" (2009) has sparked again that fear. In fact, the 'terrifyingly evil' child in ""Orphan"", I dare say, is at least ten times more fiendishly demonic than the child Antichrist Damian in ""The Omen"".Having said that, this film is about a couple: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who have two children but are emotionally recovering after the death of their third child, a stillborn. They both have issues, and that is a huge understatement. They try to live a nice, suburban life and at times they seem very, very happy. Their eldest, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) is your typical pre-tween playing Rock Band with his friends after school, playing pranks, and sneaking up to his tree-house to browse through Playboy magazines. Their youngest, Max (Aryana Engineer) is a cute, timid girl that's gone almost completely deaf. Kate is having the most problems trying to cope with the death of her baby, so she seeks constant help from her shrink (Margo Martindale, thankfully leaving behind her Hannah Montana's granny role), and she's quickly becoming your typical pill popper.Anyway, Kate and John decide they want to adopt a child, and they go to this orphanage where they're immediately impressed by Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a cute young girl who dresses like Little Bo Beep (like one of her cruel classmates points out), who has an amazing talent for painting, who's extremely polite, and has a smile that wins you over instantly. Kate and John learn from the orphanage's mother superior that Esther was brought here from Russia, where her house caught fire and her parents died. Altruisticly, our main heroes adopt the adorable Esther and take her home.Everything is fine at first. But, then again, this is a horror film. Esther doesn't seem to be the cute little girl we all thought her to be. She knows and uses a variety of bad words, has no problem killing small animals, roams around the house at night and watches her new parents have sex, pushes other children off tall garden sets, antagonizes Kate against her husband and just about disturbs everyone around her. And when the orphanage's mother superior discovers some really disturbing info on Esther's past, she really pulls out the big guns.As I watched this, I gasped and groaned in terror at how conniving, evil and downright loathe-able this Esther child was. Isabelle Fuhrman has really outdone herself with her role, showing us what I believe is the most hate-able and terrifying villain this century has seen. And Vera Farmiga gives a perfect performance too, as the helpless mother who sees through Esther's diabolic mind but whom no one believes. Sparks constantly fly between these two: the evil and protected child against the resolute but helpless mother. It was a nice change in family roles, and I found it refreshing. Also, this thriller doesn't follow the same formula for scares and thrills every other horror film nowadays pulls out. It bases its horror on the character of Esther herself, and we find chills running down our spine because of the things Esther says and does.The screenplay is, besides the child's superb acting, the strongest point of the film. It's perfectly developed, it has no plot holes I could discover, and in fact, it has the emotional depth and the pitch-perfect character development that reminded me of an M. Night Shyamalan film. You find yourself engrossed in the events unfolding on screen, and relating to the couple and feeling frustrated and irate because of the problems this devil child is bringing on them. And that's one of the things recent horror films fail to understand: that the power of truly psychological horror and tension is NOT a result of gore, or grotesque beasts, or ghostly entities or sudden shocks, but of the drama and tension between the characters. This film, basically, revived my hopes for contemporary horror thrillers.""Orphan"" is not the best picture of the year. But it is one of the best movie-going experiences you'll have this year. And the end has a terrifyingly disturbing twist that audiences have gone nuts over. See it! You won't be disappointed.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better than it has any right to be,"Orphan is one of the most confounding movies of the year. Not the movie itself mind you, but the process behind which it was made. Ya know how films are cut and trimmed after the filming process is complete. Orphan seems to buck that trend. Everything concept, plot device, cliché, and genre rule within the story's grasp is gobbled up and spit out on screen. I laughed, was shocked, jumped, was legitimately terrified, appalled, and just leveled by how shameless a production this is.The acting is good. Vera Farmiga could be a Oscar-contender yearly if she so chooses. Peter Sarsgaard seemed to have so much fun deploying his role as unsympathetic, wrong in the head husband. The children nail the suspense give their characters a vulnerable feel. Esther is just...great! Orphan is a film not for a critic or just or you or me.

Orphan is an example that if you get good actresses to do horror/thriller movie they'll bring something of their own which you rarely experience in regular horror/thriller movies. Vera Farmiga as grieving mother gave an incredible performance. Her breakdown moments are worth watching. New young Isabelle Fuhrman is truly a remarkable as how she pulled such a difficult demented role. The Peter Sarsgaard did a fine job along with the kids.

There are not a lot of horror films out now that have the kind of creepy suspenseful vibe of the classics, but this one has it! I think the real challenge of the film was that you know from the get go that the orphan is something evil. The trailers show it, the poster implies it. The trick was to make you wonder how the family was going to handle it. They did a great job, I am usually pretty good at guessing the twist, but I didn't guess this one. I wasn't even looking! I also really loved the fact that this film didn't rely on gore or sex to drive the show.

We are gonna hear big things of this girl in the future !!!Of course you get the genre-typical ""Why did not anybody see that?"" or ""That's just not possible"" moments once in a while. But those moments are never utterly made up, and the later revealed truth about Esther is a plausible explanation for most of them..I am very happy to have seen this, it's not often that I watch a horror-movie without regretting it afterwards.

Not Recommended,"This movie was ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Although the actors and actresses were pretty good, especially the little girl who played Max, the movie was full of unnecessary sexual scenes and cursing. This was not a scary movie. We watched it in a full theater, and throughout the entire movie, the audience was laughing, even during the ""scary"" parts of the movie. The only way this movie scares you is through cheap ""make you jump"" scares. While we were walking out of the theater, we could hear people saying how dumb and stupid the movie was. Maybe this is just our opinion, but I know the whole theater that we were in felt this way too.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"In the ""Wicked"" Tradition","If nothing else the disparate viewer reactions to ""The Orphan"" make for interesting reading on these comment pages. My advice for potential viewers is to disregard the most extreme love-hate stuff; the film is neither as good nor as bad as a lot of people are saying.It is basically a slightly more bent and graphic version of Julia Stiles' 1998 film ""Wicked"". Both films revolve around ruthless jockeying for household supremacy; both have an erotic subtext that people seem to be afraid to discuss, and both push the envelope of the ""Bad Seed"" (1956) genre-reflecting the more extreme attitudes of current fans of the psychological horror genre.""Orphan"" has a much bigger budget than the earlier films which is quite skillfully utilized in useful areas like production design and cinematography. It is very creative in these areas and Esther (the latest ""demon seed"" nicely overplayed by Isabelle Fuhrman) gets a nice dimensionality from the regular showcasing of her art. The painting of the burning orphanage is especially well done and extremely effective; being as creepy as any visual image I have ever seen.I would certainly recommend the film to fans of ""Wicked"" (and vice versa) and to even causal fans of the horror genre. I think it is too extreme for crossover fans, who would be wise to avoid the film or at least to be prepared to bail at some point because it gets increasingly twisted as it progresses. Unless you are willing to suspend disbelief during a number of plot developments you won't enjoy the viewing. It is a bit like ""May"" (2002) in this regard, where a lot of viewers enjoy the premise and the set-up but lose interest when the characters get too extreme or too stupid for audience identification.It is a long film (slightly over two hours), which would not be a problem if they had focused more on solving the mystery of Esther's background. Because the film offers viewers minimal cerebral exercises like this, their attention wonders to plot holes and the film begins to get a bit tedious.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

A Great Creepy Horror Film!!!,"This movie had some pretty good scare scenes, and an awesome storyline about a couple named Kate and John Coleman who lose their 3rd child. They have a son named Daniel and a deaf daughter named Max. They decide to adopt a little girl named Esther. (Isabelle Fuhrman did an awesome job as Esther! She was cute and scary at the same time) Esther begins to do bad things like pushing a girl who teased her in class off a slide, having temper tantrums, drives Kate crazy, threatening to slice off Daniel's manhood, and even killing someone!

I enter the theater with a great hope that I will see something scary. But somehow, that hope was thrashed. Along the way, another kind of satisfaction came to replace my disappointment.

Worthy of an Oscar,"After watching this in the theater and then on DVD, I'm convinced Miss Fuhrman deserves a Supporting Actress nomination.Think not? I challenge you to view this and ""Atonement"" at one sitting and consider which child gives a more powerful, richly nuanced and emotionally devastating performance. If Miss Ronan was nominated, surely should Miss Fuhrman.Watch her eyes in the dinner table scene when the family discusses her classmate's tumble from the play structure. The little girl covers the soul-wrenching subtexts in all of the vivid spectrum of emotions.And if you're not moved by the brief scene when Esther goes to her little sister and pleas for help when the evil nun comes to take her away -- again, watch her eyes -- then you have no heart.Moreover, the girl's courage in confronting the Last Great Taboo not only of cinema but of Western civilization must assure us that she holds the key to a career that promises monumental achievement.I know I was not alone when I left my first screening of ""Interview With The Vampire"" convinced I had watched Miss Dunst give the Best Supporting Actress performance.

wildest twist ending to any movie I've seen,"I actually liked this movie. Just from the title, you expect some movie about a demon child, but there was more to it.

We learn why later in the movie.Soon, Esther starts causing problems between Kate and John and she always seems to be present around accidents. The nun from the orphanage tells Kate about Esther's past being linked to many accidents and her last family dying in a fire. Soon, Esther starts being really evil and manipulating Max. Evan after trying to burn Daniel alive, John still gives her the benefit of the doubt, but Kate is on to her and starts investigating Esther's past from Russia.

Orphan (2009) ***1/2,"I expected this to be just another ""evil child"" film, but it turned into a very pleasant surprise and is one of the finest new horror movies I've seen in quite awhile, from the maker of 2005's HOUSE OF WAX (which I also enjoyed). A young couple with two children adopt a very unique little Russian girl who turns out to be a terror with a past history nobody could have known. The first half hour or so plays like a typical ""bad seed"" formula movie, but once it kicks into gear it remains intense, intriguing, and frightening, with a twist. Performances are top notch all the way around, with young Isabelle Fuhrman especially effective as the title character. I'm not sure whether or not this is a remake of anything that's gone before, but if it is it's a damn good one. Also contains one memorable movie quote delivered by the Orphan one evening when she confronts her new stepbrother in his room. ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Strong thriller made highly watchable by Farmiga and especially young Fuhrman.,"After losing her baby at child birth, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and her husband Jon (Peter Sarsgaard) decides to adopt an nine year old little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Kate and Jon have two kids of their own, the oldest is Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Aryana Engineer). At first, Esther seems to be an normal happy little girl. But Esther isn't what she seems to be. She is highly intelligent, manipulative person, who looks wise beyond her eyes. Very little slowly, the family discovers that Esther is hiding an truly dark nasty secret from them.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Goal 2:Living the Dream, House of Wax ""2005"") made an entertaining, scary, sometimes darkly humorous thriller in the vain of ""The Bad Seed"" and ""The Good Son"". Strong performances by Farmiga and especially young Fuhrman makes this sometimes flawed thriller worth watching.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes deleted scenes and alternate ending. The Blu-ray includes an featurette and an digital copy. If you haven't seen this thriller, don't miss one of the most underrated movies of 2009.

Surprisingly Awesome,"I thought the movie would be a cheesy but entertaining 2 hours at the movies. I wasn't necessarily wrong, but it was a lot less cheesy than I expected and a lot more shocking.I know everyone keeps talking about the twist ending, but it really deserves to be talked about. When the marketing campaign featured the statement, ""You'll never guess her secret,"" I remember thinking that was a fairly bold statement to make. Well, they were right. The twist is brilliant and puts this movie into a level higher than it would have been otherwise.The young girl who played Esther was really incredible. It's a shame she won't get any serious recognition for this movie because I definitely think it was the best acting I've seen all year, and that is quite a feat considering she's only 12 years old. Her performance alone makes this movie worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A thoughtful commentary on Adoption in America,"In early 2009, America was mired in an epidemic: adoption fever. From Madonna to Branjelina, to Tom Cruise to Michelle Pfeiffer, Americans were at odds with the notion of traditional parenthood. Instead, they traveled afar, to the impoverished nations of Africa and Asia in search of children. The more impoverished the child, the greater the status symbol. It seemed as if the party would never end, and that America would continue to fuel its adoption-binge with foreign babies.Americans were given a sobering expose on the risks of adoption when The Orphan was released in theaters nationwide. The story of Esther (based on true events that took place in 1980s Nevada), gave a reality check to hopeful couples - couples who were caught up in the furor of adoption-mania. Esther's story should serve as a profound reminder of the tribulations all parents face.Sure, kids are cute. They make nice accessories when you're looking to fill seats in your minivan. But every once in a while, they'll set the house on fire, or bludgeon you to death with a hammer. And Esther's story brings these notions to the forefront of our collective consciousness.A must-see for couples looking to adopt.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A disturbing thriller full of surprises.,"Kate and John Coleman are attempting to rebuild their marriage. They recently lost a baby, and adopt a 9-year old girl called Esther. Both parents, along with their deaf daughter, Max, instantly fall in love with Esther. She appears very well educated. Kate starts to fell that Esther is psychologically disturbed, while John takes no notice. Kate looks deeper into Esther's past, and realises that she isn't the young innocent girl she appears to be.The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, successfully created this film to be chilling and to thrill the viewer. The good thing about this film is that it is about a regular families life, turned to hell. Simply about a wife, husband, son and daughter, with the addition of a mentally disturbed child.This film isn't some badly rated film, it is rated R for a reason. It is very disturbing at parts, and gets quite gruesome. The basic plot is great. The film also contains several sub-plots which work well. ""Orphan"" isn't too much or too little. Perfectly structured.All the actors played their individual parts very well, but my favourite character was Esther, played by the fantastic Isabelle Fuhrman. Her performance was fantastic. Every move she makes being perfect. Fuhrman is one of my top favourite actresses in the world, and this film proved that even more.There is a twist at the end, making it even more surprising. I give it 9/10. Full of horror, thrills, chills and gore. Amazing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Esther's unique problem makes for a great film.,"There was something wrong with Esther, and that something is pretty interesting as far as plot twists go. Pretty effective psycho kid flick, with a young lady (Isabelle Fuhrman) giving an exceptional performance as a little girl with a big secret. The only blemishes is the standard plot clichés that sometimes make you pull your hair out (certain people don't believe the kid is evil, put their heads in the sand, don't want to see the obvious etc....) It's sometimes silly that most movies of this genre have to follow this predictable line, but I guess it's a necessary evil. Regardless, the movie rests on the shoulders of girl power (Farmiga and Fuhrman) who are, again, both very strong in their roles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Impressive!,"This movie has a great plot. It starts out a little slow, but it definitely picks up. The creepy scenes were VERY creepy! I rarely see anything in movies that I find TRULY creepy, so I just can't emphasize that enough. I wish there had been more creepy scenes, but that might have been over kill.There is some really good acting too. You notice right away how talented the main character is, but the deaf little girl is good too, acting only w/ her facial expressions. The mom was very believable as well. I like the way that the audience is introduced to (and gets to know) the family. It has a realistic element. It also has a few laugh-out-loud parts. And I REALLY like the fact that things are not overly explained. Sometimes obvious things will be told (and re-told) to a movie audience as if we wouldn't be able to pick up on it otherwise.

The film was frustrating to watch, Vera Farmiga played a character that you really wished the best for but you know things are going to go bad in a huge way just based on the fact it is a horror movie. When the peril arrives it is worse because it involves kids.

Soon after a small animal is killed the orphan bashing begins. Now I know about the whole uproar about people saying this movie portrays orphans badly but they haven't seen it because there's a twist ending(I already seen it coming)The one thing I didn't care for was the direction, the director would try every chance he got to try for a jump scare that just says ""We meant to put something else here but we decided to go with an old cliché instead.""

Brilliant!,"The trailer makes this movie look like it will be similar to The Omen, which I guess it kind of is. However I thought it was a better film than that and possibly more believable once you know why the little girl is doing such horrible things.The acting of the girl in this film (Isabelle Fuhrman) is absolutely phenomenal I thought and quite compelling to watch. It might even be Oscar worthy I would have thought, not that this type of film usually gets nominations I would guess.Some of the scenes are perhaps quite disturbing without getting too gruesome. Morever the suspense and slight horror feel are both maintained throughout the film. A good film with a satisfying story line, nothing amazing I would say but definitely worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My View,"When I got this movie as a gift I was not looking forward to another dull, not scary, lame, ""horror"" movie. But I was surprised by how good this movie was, I enjoyed the movie. Its about a family a recovering alcoholic mother, a father, and their two children their teen son and hearing impaired young daughter that adopt a 9-year-old girl names Ester from an orphanage. Ester is a talented artist, that seems to fit in the family and get along with her siblings then Ester starts to display some strange behavior the mother starts to think something is wrong with Ester, the father thinks its Ester just adjusting. Who is right? And what is really going on with Ester?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly true to its genre.,"There are way too many ""horror"" movies out in the world. Such of them (like House of Wax (2005), Blood of Dracula's Castle, The Uninvited, The Stepfather, Diary of the Dead, Prom Night (2008), etc.) that are honestly not scary at all. They don't stay true to their genre, and more of just a money-making fad that just attracts stupid teenagers into wasting their money by watching a horrible rendition of an over-used idea.This is what I thought when I was first planning on watching Orphan. In fact, the first time I saw it (which I only watched only the first 10 minutes) I was like ""Oh dear, it's how I thought."" However, I should have given it more of a look. So I did.To my absolute surprise, this movie was actually very good. To everyone who says the horror genre is dead, it's not entirely true. Orphan provides what most horror movie-filmmakers would be jealous of--depth of character and suspense. When I saw the dinner table scene where Daniel drops the F-bomb on the parents, I totally felt the emotion come from this little actor. Of course, Jimmy Bennett has had a very good career start (examples such as Star Trek, Hostage, and Polar Express). Engineer as Max was just so great, she could pull of a sad emotion like she was actually in the situation herself.Fuhrman was excellently rolled. She had the guts to pull off a nearly unmissable Romanian accent. I would for sure have to compliment on her anger towards Farminga's Kate. Her acting has surpassed all my expectations for teenage actors.If you haven't seen Orphan yet, I would highly recommend that you watch it. As Ebert has said, do not let your children see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Masterpiece of Black Horror Comedy,"This film opens with a nightmarish and very disturbing scene where mother is reliving the tragedy of the baby she lost. Everything is blurred and sinister looking. This scene ends and the real story begins. I have to say that opening a movie with a dream/nightmare sequence is a highly innovative and refreshing idea. We usually have to wait so damn long, for character development, for story arks, blah blah blah. But this movie truly delivers the goods right from the get go.The couple have a son but have lost their second child. They decide to adopt. There is this real cute Russian girl painting upstairs and the husband is charmed into adopting. Creepy things start to go wrong throughout the movie between the little girl and her mother. The girl very nearly drives her adoptive mother to psychosis. It is too late by the end however. The film has some great comic touches. The son sharing Perfect 10 sneakily out of a secret stash up in his tree house. There is a scene near the end which is such a deadly comic device that the whole theatre were squirming in a majestic evil ecstasy. To give away the end however would be cruel. The movie is very twisted and I mean VERY twisted. There is a kind of cunning humour running through its cinematic veins such as when she warns her step brother not to tell 'or I'll cut your pee-pee off before you know what it's for!!!! Wonderfully bizarre, bizarrely erotic and mad as f**k",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
