""" The  Greatest  Trick  The  Devil  Ever  Pulled""","Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The most enjoyment you'll have seeing a movie for the *second* time,"Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
the American thriller of the nineties,"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches ""the Usual Suspects"" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this ""coup de theatre"" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's a brilliant Thriller.,"When you think of 90's thrillers, you will probably think of Heat, Pulp Fiction, Silence of The Lambs and many more, and whilst Goodfellas is perhaps my favourite of them, but close behind is The Usual Suspects.It's a wonderful, clever thriller, it's full of twists and turns, with surprises galore, it's a film that makes you think. Just when you think you know all, they pull the rug from under you, and make you think again. Direction is taut, the script is impressive.I would argue this is one of Spacey's best ever performances, if not the best of the lot, he is phenomenal here, and really does stand out in a crowd of immense talent, hopefully he'll get his career back on track.Gabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite shine, as does Stephen Baldwin, a time where that handsome brotherhood seemed to pop up everywhere, but he was excellent also.It's a super slick production, with some pretty fine special effects, and good use of pyrotechnics, a polished production, one that's not overdone.This is one of those movies that you can watch and watch again, it simply doesn't diminish or lose any of its intrigue. You know there's a twist coming, you'll sit there waiting for it, and the first time round your jaw may drop, it's a very well delivered moment. The ending of this film is fabulous.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not enough good things to say,"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spacey's Best,"The interrogation, the lineup, and the story telling are all intricate to this film and really is what makes this a great movie and a 90's classic.The lineup scene is iconic and absolutely a fan favourite no doubt.

Relies too much on its twist,"The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"At first, wasn't the biggest fan but.....","I couldn't help but set rather high expectations for 'The Usual Suspects' as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than the sum of its parts,"The Usual Suspects is two movies in one.  Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.  The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer.  It requires a certain amount of commitment, though.  Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea.  The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before.  That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic.  The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man.  He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Usual Suspects,"The Usual Suspects remains a style of it's own. It a masterpiece of suspense and putting wonder into the audience. This film has great performances, dialogue, and story elements. The film's twist is the perfect. It makes the viewer unlearn everything they have learned throughout the film, as most of it fabricated, coming from an unreliable source, who is thought to be the man behind it all.
Is Verbal Kint actually Keyzer Soze? Or is Verbal Kint one of Keyzer Soze's men. Or did Verbal use the myth of Keyzer Soze to get away? Or is Kobayashi Keyzer Soze? Even Keaton could be Keyzer Soze? It's not definitive. This film is a high achievement, it entertains with dialogue, flashbacks, suspense, shocking moments of realization followed by more shocking moments of realization. Most of the plot relys on the flashbacks told by Verbal Kint, leaving the audience stunned after viewing it. As Keyzer Soze is the myth the criminals fear, and may or may not be real.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""and like that...he was gone.""","Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: ""How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?"" The characters, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship.What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game.The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze.Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives.The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: ""and like that...he was gone.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"MOST Definitely... NOT Your ""USUAL"" Movie!","""The Usual Suspects"" certainly defies pigeon holing or labeling! Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Psychodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!)But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout, painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames.The shadowy figure then casually walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, ""I piss on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen.Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...10* STARS! YOU MUST GET IT AND WATCH IT... CAREFULLY!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Keaton always said, ""I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."" Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.","The Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pay close attention to every detail.,"'The Usual Suspects' is a rather unusual film. There's so much detail here that it definitely would benefit from more than just one viewing.The entire cast gives wonderful performances, but Kevin Spacey stood out among the rest with a stunning performance. He stars as Verbal, and the entire film is based on his version of events.This is the type of film where you very carefully have to pay attention to every detail, and every bit of dialogue. This will make you understand everything much better as it can be confusing if you don't follow closely. The film revolves around a group of criminals who came together to pull off an impossible job, and the events leading to that fateful night.The characterization is excellent as we deal with five very different characters, and we're told about each character in a way we can make up our own minds whether we're rooting for them or not.

There isn't enough chamomile tea in the world...,".... to calm me down after watching this thriller. It's absolutely perfect, an edge of the seat experience. I usually don't hand out perfect grades, but from beginning to end it takes you on a wild ride. And you will want to see it again to see if there are any ""tells"" you missed the first time. Somewhat like the fantastic ""Prestige"" of ten years later, except that was in the realm of magic and this is a thriller/heist film.Five guys who have absolutely nothing in common but a criminal background meet during a line-up over a hijacked truck full of gun parts and then team up in two different heists and then a third job on a boat. The first two heists they do willingly, the last job they are compelled to do. What do I mean by compelled ?- Watch and find out.The first five minutes are confusing - You see two characters on a boat, one in full view, one whispering and seen only in shadowy profile. One shoots the other with the victim's seeming complete consent. The shadowy profile then sets the boat ablaze, escapes, and then the boat explodes. The film then starts out answering the question of what exactly it is you've just seen, and for that matter, what it is you haven't just seen.I wish I could say more, but I really can't without spoiling it, at least to a degree. With a brooding score full of regret, a first class ensemble cast, and the point being the power of story, I wouldn't suggest you watch this close to bedtime if you intend to sleep.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Brilliant execution from the rest of the cast, each bringing their piece to the table.

The police interrogate the witness and hear an unbelievable tale of a drug kingpin and a band of misfits who come together to pull off a heist like the department has never heard of...This movie is directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men) and stars Kevin Spacey (House of Cards), Gabriel Byrne (End of Days), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Stephen Baldwin (Fred Clause), Benicio Del Toro (Crash) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Town).The storyline and characters for this picture is brilliantly written and presented to the audience in a perfectly paced manner. The cast is well selected and everyone executed their character perfectly, especially Spacey who delivers my all time favorite performance of his. The sub plots were very well developed and presented to the audience and police officers. The interrogation scenes are so good. The soundtrack is also epic and the conclusion is cinematic gold.Overall this is a masterpiece and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great movie,"I started this movie a few years ago but didn't get past the first 15 minutes. I found the jail and lineup scenes hard to follow me quite slow.

The Usual Overrated Suspects,"This movie is way overrated. It doesn't deserve a 8.7 rating, 6 should be the highest for it. Guess IMDb's ratings are not that accurate.

The Film That Made Kevin Spacey a Star,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
More than usual,"Another day, another rewatch. A classic in the thriller genre, with a cast that is exceptional. But also with a script that can be considered tight. It does hinge on something that actually is able to bring the whole house down. Considering what the aim was or one of the target in the movie, certain things seem to make not much sense.But suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride (and keep guessing where it's going) the first time around. After that you can watch it again (and again?) to see the clues and disect the movie in your head. Try to connect the dots and maybe understand what really went down .. then again, considering the premise and the twist, are we actually able to tell? You'll understand once you've seen it ... because it does leave a lot in the open. It does however also have lots of clash between characters and the spite they have for each other ... I won't go into detail, but there are certain convenient (timing wise) incidents. Just accept them and don't overthink them ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Who is Keyser Söze?,"After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie.

A different gangster story.,"A different gangster story.I watched the film with an open mind. I did not watch the trailer or read the plot. After watching 'The Usual Suspects', I can now say it is now one of my favourite films.I was confused at the beginning; the film switches from the past to the present so often which made it difficult to follow. They lay out the backstory and how the group forms quickly; this gives the viewer context and the film is able to jump straight into the story. Pacing is one of the film's fortes; it moves swiftly with not a tedious moment. We are introduced to the characters and their backstories instantly. The main focus of the film then moves to a police interview between Verbal (Kevin Spacey) and Dave Kujan (Chazz Palmintetri). This is the narrative. Everything that happens is explained through this interview.The story is compelling and entertaining right from the start. With an amazing performance from Kevin Spacey. We are taken through many sequences in which we see the characters' relationships build and the plot slowly builds up to a climax. The characters seem to develop close relationships; they form trust, friendship and a sense of love between each other. Ultimately, the character development is something that also stands out to me. As the film progresses the characters become more likeable. Developing the plot further through every story told, we are introduced to the bigger picture of how their gang works.The cinematography matches the film very well as does the colouring. It gives the film a mysterious effect whilst giving it a dark aesthetic that matches the tone. The mood shifts around the middle when we are introduced to a character: Keyser Soze. He is portrayed as a demonic figure, someone everyone should fear. The Usual Suspects are made to do a job for him. Infiltrating a drug trade (this is the climax) is the final scene where everything happens.The final sequences are exciting and engaging with the big question being asked: who is Keyser Soze? No one knew. As anyone who knew his identity would be killed immediately. As the interview between Verbal and Dave slowly comes to an end, a very big plot twist is revealed and it leaves us questioning everything about the whole story. The film then ends with perhaps one of the best lines in cinema history: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he wasn't real"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
when its identity is revealed the devil is disappeared,"a very great film . contains so much twists and turns u wont believe. The only main thing is who is the devil, Kyzer soze. He is keeping his identity secret and playing his games right in heart of the underworld. He himself using 5 brave but misguided and frustrated young men by exploiting their weaknesses and compulsions. In the whole movie you will keep on wondering who is kyzer soze in reality and when u know in the end u will be taken aback and shocked , on the other hand u ll also praise his genius of deception and elusiveness. This film contains suspense with action in a far better way the stereo type action movies contain. The most inspiring actors are here Kevin spacey and Gabriel Byrne.

"""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""","What a movie. It has a story from beginning to end with a lot of sense and intelligence.

I got a little confused at first (probably because I was sleepy) but that doesn't make the film worse, it's just a detail that happened to me. Just like I said before, if you don't pay attention you will get lost in the story. Probably one of the best movie endings I've ever seen in my life without exaggeration. Of course I couldn't help but comment on the plot twist, probably one of the best I've ever seen but I won't say what it is, I'll leave it for you to see 😉.

Magnificent film that deserves to be re-watched over and over,"As an avid cinephile, who watches a lot of films to help me to be distracted from the pressures of everyday life, old and new and of all genres (have never had a bias against any genre and never love older films and dismiss new films, or vice versa), 'The Usual Suspects' was one of the finest films personally seen in a while.Other films to have that effect on me (and garnered 10/10 ratings, a rare rating for me these days) are 'LA Confidential', 'Amores Perros', Orson Welles' version of 'The Trial', 'City of God' and 'The Song of Bernadette', though some films came close as well as re-watches of favourites like 'Se7en', 'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993) and 'The Remains of the Day'.Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense.

Left handed Soze,"OK. In the movie they show several time that Soze's character is left handed. Do you think they do this to try and throw you off who Soze actually is? I know the first time i saw it i was watching for the left hander. Another thing that i don't understand is why does Kobayashi have such a strange accent in the movie? He's an English guy and i think it's mentioned in the movie that he is English/British. I just couldn't make out where the accent was supposed to be from and why he would have it, so you think he may be Soze? Turkish nationality? Before i leave i want to say i really love this movie, but let's think about the plot for a moment. This is Soze's plan all along to get rid of an eye witness on board the vessil right? He goes to ALL that trouble to shoot the witness and in the end the police, everyone knows what Soze looks like anyway as they had the sketch faxed while he was being questioned.

"Great Film, One of the Best Crime Movies","'The Usual Suspects' is a classic. A great crime movie with a great director and a great cast. Plenty of twists and turns, with the ultimate twist being what makes this film so entertaining when realising for the first time or rewatching and knowing all along, making the movie that more impressive.Stephen Baldwins performance as 'Micheal McManus' was funny and entertaining. Learning that the lineup scene was unscripted made watching it so much more entertaining. This was also the case with Benicio Del Toro's 'Fred Fenster' character whose brilliant mannerisms and memorable lines shows top tier acting.This film made Kevin Spacey, his performance as 'Verbal' was interesting and iconic, making the ultimate twist that more satisfying to watch.

Composition,"Subtlety is a very important thing in any good thriller. Not only does subtlety reduce the ridiculous amount of ""in-your-face-quality"" that today's thrillers seem to love, which effectively makes then just plain old action movies, subtlety shows that a film has respect for its audience. It doesn't feel like it has to explain everything at every step of the way since it knows that an interested audience will be on the lookout for hints as to what is going on. That's what makes films like this enjoyable. In fact, that what makes any film enjoyable. It isn't just a barrage of images, but rather an engaging sequence of them. This sequence can be unchronologically organized or in any number of ways obscured to create suspense, but as long as it is engaging, the audience will be happy.""The Usual Suspects"" is such a thriller. It can be enjoyed with the eyes as much as the brain. There are numerous hints as to what is really going on and the final climatic twist is really a great one. Even then, upon seeing the whole film, the second viewing only gets better as that is when a keen viewer will pick up on all those subtleties that hint at the result which they are now familiar with. These subtleties are not just obscurely placed props but are woven into the film's montage with clever camera angles along with certain key objects seen on screen. It is a thriller worthy of Hitchcock or the best of DePalma. Nothing is in needless excess and even the profanity is well written and there are no pointless macho wisecracks. Simply put, everything works in this movie. And it works very well. Even upon multiple viewings the film captivates with its clever composition and that can only be a good sign. --- 10/10Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Really masterful ending; a touch difficult to watch in the present day,"I went into watching this movie knowing only two things about it: I knew it was a project that launched Kevin Spacey's career (and say what you will about him as a human being, but he did a damn good job acting in this movie), and that there's a mind-blowing twist at the end that is pretty much the dictionary definition of a twist ending. And I will say, it's very difficult to discuss the film at any length without giving away the ending. The script is good, the visuals are fantastic at points (that shot of the shattering coffee mug will live rent-free in my head for quite some time), and the acting is pretty spot on. You can tell these boys had a fun time making this movie. I will say though-some gripes that I'm not faulting the movie itself for, since it was made in 1995-it's difficult in the year 2022 to watch a movie with so much unchecked casual homophobia, and it's genuinely a little hard to differentiate five individual main characters when they are all white men.All told, though, this movie is good. As a screenwriter myself, I'm definitely taking notes on how to craft a satisfying ending that ties just enough up to be satisfying and still leaves you with a lot of questions. The last 15 minutes of the film alone are worth the price of admission. I'll be curious to watch it a second time knowing the ending and see what I pick up on that I didn't on this first time through.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pretentious,"A fine example of a movie trying really hard to be a Rubik's Cube.  When a movie starts tripping over itself just for the sake of complicating the plot--that's when I throw up my hands and say, ""Enough already!""  It stops being entertaining and enjoyable and begins to be nothing but a chore.  I tried to like this movie, but after being introduced to about 300 characters who all look and act alike (their names even rhyme, for God's sake!), and when the plot demands that we memorize all sorts of details about each one of them to follow the story, that when it stops being fun.  I felt like I was working overtime just to keep up with this mess.When the ending is finally sprung, and I thought about it in the context of the rest of the movie, it should have all made sense, justifying the over-complicated story, but it didn't.  Holes opened up large enough for houses to fall through.  It seemed as if the writer just threw in the most unlikely possibility to astonish the audience.

Brilliance in Movie Making,"The film ""the usual suspects"" is brilliant by means of many different facets of film making; and brought together perfectly to comprise one of the most historic and critically acclaimed films of all time. To start, the plot alone is intelligent and baffling, so much that the general public is challenged to piece together a seemingly surrealistic account of mystery and murder. However, there's more to this movie than just the mere genius behind the plot. For starters, the cinematography, editing, and acting are captured perfectly to not only portray a story, but involve the audience as though they were to experience the story themselves. Additionally, the actors are brilliant and capture each character as precise as necessary to accurately forshadow the climactic point of the movie that leaves audiences breathless.However, behind the brilliance of the film, the editing, the acting, the storyline, the script, and the cinematography; are the ingenious facts hidden within the movie's composition.

"An entertaining, if unbelievable plot","It's a crime movie set in the 1990s in New York City and Los Angeles, California. It rests almost entirely on the plot rather than on developed characters. It follows five criminals who seem to be thrown together by circumstance. Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro) are two hardened criminals who have worked together for five years. Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack) is a loner. Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a former bent cop who spent five years in prison and continued in crime but is now trying to escape the underworld because of his lawyer girlfriend, Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis). The fifth hood is a seemingly low-level con man, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who limps because of a twisted foot and crippled hand.Crooked cops set up the five for a crime in New York City, but they are released. They take revenge against the police and head to California to fence the jewelry they stole. There, they encounter a fence named Redfoot (Peter Greene), a lawyer named Kobayashi (Peter Postlethwaite), and hear of a Turkish crime godfather named Kayser Söze, who involves them in a climactic caper that results in 27 deaths, and only one of the five survives. As the only survivor, Verbal Kint is interviewed by LAPD Sgt: Jeff Rabin (Dan Hedaya) and Federal agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). The film follows this interview, interspersed with flashbacks to events going back to New York City. Verbal spins a very complex story to Kujan, who leads the interrogation. The movie's ending reframes everyone's assumptions about what has just been seen.""The Usual Suspects"" is an entertaining, if unbelievable plot. Spacey is excellent as the ""everyman"" who is not what he appears to be. One reviewer compared this film to ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it doesn't come close. In this film, the viewer needs to work to track the plot, and at the end, you scratch your head at gaping logical holes. But Spacey's performance under interrogation is worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Less than meets the eye,"Watching The Usual Suspects gave me a feeling of emptiness.  There was so much happening on the screen, such good acting, so many plot twists.  Yet it all adds up to much less than it appears, largely because everything about the plot, the characters, and the dialogue turns out to be completely arbitrary.  What is it about, really? I can try to describe what it seems to be about.  I am afraid I will fail to cover all the bases, because this is the kind of movie that requires much notetaking, index cards, organization charts and detailed presentations to keep track of the plot.  5 men meet when they find themselves in the same holding cell after being arrested for various petty offenses.  They swap war stories about their various lines of work, and one of them brings up the fact that he stumbled across a startling piece of information: plainclothes detectives are using unmarked cars to provide armed transport for mafia bosses willing to shell out good money for this service.  After being let out they set one of these cars on fire, to draw media attention to this fact.  This sort of thing is the stuff of male bonding, I guess, because they decide they like working together. A mysterious man shows up (Pete Postlethwaite, in a nice performance). He offers them a lot of money to do a job for his ""client"".  The job involves stealing cargo from a European freighter docked in the city harbor. It comes out that it is really an excuse to get the men aboard to eliminate a witness who could put his ""client"" at risk.  Eventually, the client, they are told, is Kayser Sozay, a notorious Hungarian crime lord whose very name causes stark fear in those who speak it.  Legend has it that he killed his own wife and children when rival drug lords attempted to drive him out of town. If I have missed anything, please excuse me, but I believe in doing so I have made my point.  The Usual Suspects is the kind of movie that demonstrates what it means when critics say a film has too much plot for its own good.  There are many twists and turns, and surprises.  I am not averse to surprises but in the end I felt manipulated, as though there was no way to sort out all the details to make sense of what had transpired.  The ending suggests that everything we have seen may never have happened.  Did it?  I felt as if I didn't care.  If the filmmakers don't care enough about their own plot I can hardly be expected to. It's too bad, because the movie wastes a good cast.  Kevin Spacey is fascinating, Gabriel Byrne does a good job with his role, as do Pollack and Postlethwaite.  I enjoyed Chaz Palminteri as the detective assigned the joyless task of discovering who Sozay is.  But it takes too much energy to follow this, and the performances are lost in a maze of plot devices.  Enjoy it for the acting, but take along a notebook if you plan to piece together the story afterward.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This guy is spoken of like he was Satan himself and of course the police want him big time also.I can't say much more because the plotting of The Usual Suspects is so intricate and filled with unexpected twists that to spoil this film would be a crime itself. Some here like Stephen Baldwin give their best performances on screen. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar, this one in the Best Supporting Actor category. The category has me stumped because it's his character that's the key to the whole film. The other Oscar The Usual Suspects won was for Christopher McQuarrie for one highly original Screenplay.The Usual Suspects has enough action for those who crave that, especially when we do see the final battle on that freighter and it's also some highly literate dialog for those who appreciate that. It's best compared to that granddaddy of all caper films The Asphalt Jungle, it's that good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You'll Never See it Coming,"As I was watching The Usual Suspects, I found it enjoyable, but not quite at a 5 star rating. But as it progressed, I changed my mind. It's an airtight movie with so many small details and clues that create a sense of misdirection to the twist near the end, and the storytelling itself is amazing. And that twist gets twisted with more details and clues, ultimately making this the perfect crime/mystery. The comedy lands correctly when its needed. Every character is great, and the actors all sell their roles perfectly. I love this movie, and it's a major recommendation from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
one of my favorite interrogations,"A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca ""The Usual Suspect"" is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re- run of the movie to be sure that I don't miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.Written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser Söze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser Söze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name Söze is Turkish which is translated as ""talk too much.""The Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.The movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.This series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.Done with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser Söze.The Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good film , if not a little too over hyped.","The Usual Suspect is one of those films which tell you that seeing is believing. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and I am glad I finally got the chance to see it but with critics going on and on about it, they kind of kill the magic of the movie. However that really did not hinder my enjoyment as I decided to treat this just like any other movie. Basic concept of 5 cons on various heist missions until one goes terribly wrong and then the authorities try to establish what went wrong hearing this from the account of one of the crippled crooks (Kevin Spacey). Gabreil Bryne was a excellent in his role as the lead crook and Benico Del Toro was also a stand out performance but we all know that Kevin Spacey was the man who took joy in playing the audience like a piano. A film can start of slow but the ending is the most important thing in the whole thing and I am glad to say that this ending was nothing short of a slap in the face.THE USUAL SUSPECTS - 8.1 OUT 10THE GREATEST TRICK THAT THE DEVIL EVER PULLED WAS CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T EXHIST AND JUST LIKE THAT.....

What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already?,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's an absolute classic, even when, after repeated viewings, I realize more and more that it's nothing but a one-trick pony. Still, it's strangely compelling, and I'm always waiting for that ending to come again.

The rest of the characters make a beautiful team, and I wish we had a little more banter between them.

Not all its cranked up to be,"while this is certainly not a bad film, i would not consider this movie to be classic material. it doesn't deserve the 8.7 or so rating is has here currentlywhile the plot twists are clever, the film always strikes me as distinctly hollow. mainly because Keyser Sozes' motivations are never given any clarity or urgency. we really have no real idea why this man has gone to all this incredible trouble to maintain anonymity. the background of the character could have been given more substance without compromising the mysteryon the flip side of that, if the aim was to maintain an air of mystery or the supernatural.. then the film falls short on that count also. the ending in particular is distinctly flawed. this man of mystery with no acquaintances would surely disappear independently. blend in to the background. not get a lift home afterin addition to that, i find some of the acting in this movie to be second rate. spacey plays more or less the same character he played in seven, and no one else here is exceptionaloverall this is still a good quality movie, but i would not regard it as a classic.one movie deserving of that accolade that was around shortly before this one, and a film that suspects borrows from rather massively (as did many movies made around that time) is pulp fiction. now that is a classic film. it has style, great acting and a substance and momentum that suspects truly lacks",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Good, but not THAT good","For some reason, I didn't get round to seeing this film until quite recently (just one of those weird things). I was excited to finally see it since I'd heard so many people rave about it, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Without question it is an entertaining, surprising, and well-acted film, but I can't see why it gets quite such high ratings on here.Kevin Spacey does a fine job of playing the part of Verbal, and Gabriel Byrne is okay too, but otherwise there were no outstanding performances. Similarly, while the plot was clever, it was nothing that amazing, and I saw the twists coming a mile off. Unlike something like Reservoir Dogs, which gave the gangster film a much-needed injection of not taking itself seriously, the crims in The Usual Suspects are just the typical bad-boys-who-fancy-themselves. Also, maybe Americans can accept Pete Postlethwaite's bizarre accent and make-up, but for me it really detracted from the film - what WAS he supposed to be? Indian??? If so, why on earth didn't they get an Asian actor? Sorry, I don't mean to slag off a film that I know a lot of people really like, I'm just giving my honest opinions. I suspect if I'd seen it when it came out, I too would have found it an amazing groundbreaking piece of cinema, but IMHO it hasn't really stood the test of time.Still, it was a decent way to pass a couple of hours, so I've given it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Gripping!!,"The problems with movies like ""The usual Suspects"" is that they are taken too seriously. People flock to identify a hidden meaning, a socially relevant message or a reflection of time when it was made. While a good movie may and, sometimes, does have one or more of these attributes, still the basic point of every good movie is to entertain. If the movie has involved me in it, made me suspend my disbelief to move along enthusiastically with the story, it has done its job. The Usual Suspects does just that. You may sit comfortably long after the movie is over and think about how some parts make no sense or are improbable. But, while watching it just sweeps you, partly because of its same improbability and also because of its pace. The pace is just right, not fast enough to make you lose track of what is happening, or slow enough to second-guess the motives and figure out the plot twists. The way the movie unfolded and ended was enough to keep me interested throughout. The ending is a classic, even if you guess it a little before you are expected. Of course, the delight in watching it the second time is immense as armed with the revelation at the end, you can view a lot of scenes with an investigative interest and come off totally consumed. Besides its plot, TUS has brilliant performances to keep you entertained and some great dialogs. It is one of those movies form which you can take nothing home, apart from the pleasure while watching it. I say, thats enough!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Making a simple plan complicated doesn't make one brilliant,"******SPOILERS****** Highly overdone movie about a mass killing in a shoot-out and explosion of a ship docked at San Pedro Harbor with connections to a notorious Hungarian drug gang. As well as a crew of hoods recruited out of NYC who tried to rip the gang off of the 91 million dollars of coke on the ship. Added to that a mysterious mob kingpin who set up the whole operation, for very personal reasons, to use as cover for him to knock off a witness on the ship that was to be turned over by the gang to the FBI as a witness against him that could land the mob kingpin behind bars for life.All this is seen in flashback, at the San Pedro Police Station, with Special US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, Chazz Palmintri, interviewing Roger Verbal (Kevin Spacey),the only survivor of this holocaust, for what seems like the time you would have sat through an old movie triple-feature with cartoons newsreels and coming attractions added on. We're bombarded by Verbal's story that goes on endlessly about how he and his fellow hoods were recruited by Mr. Kobayashi, Pete Postiethwaite, back in New York City some six weeks earlier to do a job for the mysterious Kayser Soze (?) ,whom they are told by Kobayashi that they are in debt to. Verbal goes on endlessly talking about this very strange and confusing plan that the Kayser concocted which in the end turns out to be an elaborate hit, by himself, of a protected government witness.You would think if this Kayser Soze was as smart as the movie makes him out to be why didn't he or his mouthpiece, Kabayashi, tell these hoods just to knock off the witness instead of having all this killing going on at the San Pedro Harbor as well as all over the country with all of them ending up dead except Verbal? And even more important why did he, The Kayser, have to kill the witness himself leaving himself open to being killed or captured by the Hungarian drug gang as well as the recruited hoods themselves if they ever found out who he was, and what he was planing for them, or the police?Another thing that doesn't make sense about the movie ""The Usual Suspects"" is that this Kayser Soze who is so unknown and secretive even to his fellow mobsters, it seemed that only Mr. Kobayashi knew just who he was, would be that well known by the FBI or local police to be identified and arrested? And who would their protected witness know who to finger if this Kayser Soze was so unidentifiable? What was so important about this person that the Kayser was dealing with, and wanted to knock off, that he would reveal his real identity and place of residents to him where he would blow the cover that he so painstakingly built up over the years? Was this individual involved in preparing the Kysers Federal and State Income Tax returns?Even at the end of the film when it was finally revealed just who the Kyser was you still didn't really know who he was since he was using an allies just like the name Kayser Soze itself obviously was. And even if the FBI and local police really knew who he was and where he was and went to arrest him would the murderous and cunning Kayser Soze just stay there and let himself be taken into custody? With all the avenues of escape and control with his mob's vast resources available to him?The ending of the movie shocked you only because it seemed to make sense at the time that you were exposed to it but after getting over the shock and realizing just how irrational it was, as well as the whole film, you began to see that's all it really was: An end to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

You will be drawn to the mystery in the film noir,"This film is mysterious from the beginnig. Night on the deck of a ship strewn with bodies, apparently an aftermath of a shoot-out, a wounded man, who later we know is a criminal Keaton, resignedly looking up at a figure who he calls Keyser, then Keyser aims a gun at him, and bang, bang.Then it is exploring what has lead to the culmination. U.S. Customs agent Kujan sets up an unofficial investigation into a survivor Verbal, through whose statement we follow the series of events that he, Keaton and other three fellows went through for weeks.The five men's mug-shot scene, six weeks before the ship and just after a truck-hijacking, is iconic. I already know in terms of plot, Keaton and Verbal are the main, and other three are something like supportive. But each man is equally attractive as a character. I love especially Fenster's babbling. And each man is a man who 'never bend over for anybody'.After released, the five men go on to the next heist, and next. But pursueing is somehow turning into being pursued and manipulated. A lawyer calling himself Kobayashi shows up, and alleges his employer is Keyser Söze, who is told in the fearsome underground urben myth.The plot is so complicated that you will hardly keep track of everything. But no matter how well you comprehend the plot, you will be drawn to the mystery anyway. As Keyser Soze's invisible influence is looming, their fate become desperate. This is a film noir, all about the misery of criminals, and that is poignant joy to us viewers.I'm sure it must have been very astonishing Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal was, as he was much less known back then. His expression is interpretable as A or B, which in turn irritates Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri, who is also excellent. It often uses close-up shots, and every character's close-up face is tight and powerful. The suspense will never loosen you up to the ending, one of the best ending scenes I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Timeless Masterpiece, Intricate Storytelling, Fantastic Performances and Directing","The usual suspects is an absolute masterpiece of cinema that delivers a riveting and thought-provoking story with incredible performances and masterful directing.What makes this film so impressive is the way it weaves together its complex narrative, with cleverly placed clues and red herrings that keep you guessing right until the very end. The writing is fantastic, with sharp dialogue and a well-crafted screenplay that makes for an engaging and thrilling watch.The performances from the entire cast are outstanding, with Kevin Spacey giving, what is is my eyes, his career-defining performance. His subtle nuances and mannerisms add depth and intrigue to his character, and he delivers some of the film's most memorable lines.

"""I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze""","Wait a minute... five criminals in one lineup? There's something wrong here, right? Right... In ""The Usual Suspects,"" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts. Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it. The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - ""the devil,"" Keyser Söze. You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time. Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur). You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser Söze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor. And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first)... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around.This masterpiece of cinema deservedly won the best screenplay Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar for the wonderful Kevin Spacey in 1995. The film is a modern day classic with all the elements of great film making coming together. A fantastic script combined with brilliant direction and a cast that seemed to be thoroughly enjoying itself, this is 1940's film noir at its very best, brought thoroughly up to date for the 1990's, combining clever little references to the past with very modern settings at that time.

"As an avid cinephile,","Who watches a lot of films to help me to be distracted from the pressures of everyday life, old and new and of all genres (have never had a bias against any genre and never love older films and dismiss new films, or vice versa), 'The Usual Suspects' was one of the finest films personally seen in a while.Other films to have that effect on me (and garnered 10/10 ratings, a rare rating for me these days) are 'LA Confidential', 'Amores Perros', Orson Welles' version of 'The Trial', 'City of God' and 'The Song of Bernadette', though some films came close as well as re-watches of favourites like 'Se7en', 'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993) and 'The Remains of the Day'.Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense.

A Detective Tries to Solve an Important Case While Interrogating an Invalid Witness Who Has Won Immunity,"This is a stylishly made, crime film noir with a surprisingly brilliant script that will literally sneak up on you in how detailed and creative it is. I think that word- creative- is what so many people like about this film. It takes risks and has the gall to stick to them, and that seems to be something that has tended to work in this genre with the favorites it generates.For those who dismiss this as a one-watch film, they are sure missing out. I was one of the skeptics who felt it may not be rewatchable originally, but the truth is that the script writing is that good that it holds up in quality on repeat viewings.Another misconception some have noted is that they have concluded that ""none of the story was true"", which is not the case at all. The detective is investigating the crime scene at the dock. He even details who was on the boat and how they were connected to the ringleader, the infamous Kaiser Soze.In addition to the scriptwriting, this film uses understated and subtle music and camerawork that distinguishes it from a majority of other run-of-the-mill heist or crime films, but where it really excels is its handling of its mysteries, revelations, and its own mythology.When watching this film, you may enjoy the conventional crime suspense as you would in the genre, but what you may love is how it messes with your head. With so many remakes, clichés, and dumbed down movies that have all been done before, real movie lovers sometimes have an innate desire for a film to totally screw with their head, and the way the Usual Suspects does it is not through horror, excess gore, or outlandish jump scares or CGI; it does it through intelligence, subtleties, and outstanding film editing overlapped with unforgettable musical scores that all can combine to send chills down your spine.But to make it even more eerie and somewhat profound, it even includes classic lines like this: ""Dean Keaton once said, 'I don't believe in God, but I fear him. Well, I believe in God, and the only thing in this world that scares me is Kaiser Soze"" and ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""This crime world blends elements from the underworlds of Argentina, Hungary, Russia, and elsewhere, as mythological, notorious villain, Kaiser Soze, makes chess moves around the globe to protect his assets, as well as his identity. His underlings handle all of his dirty work, as would likely be the case in the mob hierarchy, so there is definitely an element of realism within the story and script. But with his obscure existence, can Detective Kujan identify him with the help of the one person who may be able to finger him in a lineup?This is a low budget, indie hit that won't be for everybody, but most fans of artistically-made original movies will probably like it. Strong performances by Chazz Palmieri, Gabrielle Byrne, Giancarlo Esposito, and Kevin Spacey, as well as a creatively strange one by Benicio Tel Toro carry this unusual entry to the crime thriller genre. Hold onto your hats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Brilliant,"The Usual Suspects takes a little while to come into its own but once it does it really excels.The 5 central characters are all pretty intriguing, with an interesting chemistry and solid performances behind all of them.The story is strong, with a non linear, flash back style, told by an unreliable narrator. This is what really marks the film out as something special. The way the story unfolds and how it is told is very clever and entertaining, building towards a fantastic ending.Several elements and stylistic choices haven't aged awfully well in the 27 years since release, but this is a minor point.A terrific crime thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great criminal,"When I first watched this movie, it seemed a bit confusing to me, which did not diminish my delight. In my opinion, it should be watched at least twice to appreciate the incredible plot presented and the involvement of all the characters.We learn the stories in the form of a retrospective, from the mouth of one of the criminals, and although we know the end of their action, we still feel the excitement during the preparations.A great design, rightly appreciated by the Academy, which awarded an Oscar for the screenplay. Kevin is brilliant, but Gabriel Byrne partners him well.I can recommend this film to everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Many twists and turns superbly done,"This is an all time favourite!Almost any discussion with any detail risks spoilers so let's keep it generic if we can.It won two Academy Awards (Original Screenplay, Supporting Actor) and it is easy to see why.During interrogation Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the story of how five normally solo criminals are lured into a plot by a criminal mastermind.As the plot unfolds via many twists and turns the audience are driven on with these five to an amazing and much admired final twist.Each of the characters gets a clear moment to show more of what they are about. And the set piece ""major event"" is shown from so many perspectives - superb.Oh, and have a go to at deciphering (the great) Pete Postlethwaite's accent!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The best ever twist to a film,First watched this masterpiece when it first came out and I have to watch it at least once a year. The first time I watched it I was mind blown.

Very clever but rather empty,"Well, I waited a long time to see this...and I'm left shrugging my shoulders. On the plus side, it's fast-paced, wonderfully acted (Kevin Spacey doing something that little bit different and oh so well), with exceptional camera work and lighting. But, but, but. The twist is a classic, sending you back to the rest of the movie with all kinds of questions. I just wish those questions extended beyond the details of the plot or the nature of the plotting. As an enquiry into the nature of telling a story, it languishes in the remedial class, opting for a cute but rather cheap revelation rather than any serious interrogation into the nature of a thriller, which is what it seems to want to be.A good watch and never dull or dragging, but a movie which leaves me with a rather hollow feeling. Disappointing, particularly for something which came heaped with so much critical praise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Crime Thriller gone right,"This is one of the classic Crime Thriller movies and is responsible for shooting its lead Kevin Spacey to the top, as well as shooting the genre in the limelight of other filmmakers. The beginning of the movie is a bit convoluted, but it resolves itself out as it goes on. The strongest part about the movie is that the climax doesn't feel either uncanny or unpredictable, and yet it still manages to pack a punch of surprise.

An absolute beauty!!,I went to watch the usual suspects and was thrilled! The movie was amazing. I loved the way Kevin spacey acted throughout this movie. I didn't give it 10 out of 10 because of one huge reason. I went to watch this movie with someone under 18 years old. The amount of bad language in this movie should have been less. I don't know why people put so much bad words. If you use foul languages a few times its okay but you cant say it in every minute. Anyways leaving that aside the movie was brilliant.

The Usual Suspects should be a classic someday.,"This movie was directed by Bryan Singer and was released in 1995. This is a great action, drama, mystery movie all wrapped up into one. It is a movie about five criminals that are well known in New York. These five criminals were initially brought in for a police lineup but then the movie really builds from there. These five criminals all vow to get back at the police force. This takes them on a journey of criminal activity. First they get back at the cops by exposing dirty cops. Then they start working other various jobs together. Then one turning point in the film is that they are called upon by Kaiser Sosa to take on a dangerous job. Kaiser Sozas character is then built as spooky, vicious underworld figure that even the most notorious criminals are afraid of.There are five main characters that this movie is based around. Verbal Klint, played by Kevin Spacey is a crippled conman that doesn't like violence. Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, is a top level entry man that is deemed to be a little psychotic. Todd Hockney, played be Kevin Pollak, is a hardened criminal wise cracker. Fred Fenster, played by Benicio Del Toro, is a partner of Michael McManus. Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, was and ex cop turned notorious crook.The movie goes throw many flashbacks to give you pieces to the big puzzle that unfolds. There are many details in this movie and after watching it 30+ times I still don't understand all of it. Maybe Bryan Singer wanted it that way, to keep you intrigued and wondering.The movie really was edited and directed in very sophisticated way. All scenes were masterfully directed. The lighting was great in various sense throughout the moving. This lighting really accentuated the scenes. All of these aspects gave the film a great visual style and a truly grandiouse feel.This movie continually builds to the conclusion. In the end of the movie Kevin Spacey pulls off a great performance. He is being interrogated by agent Kujan. Verbal Klint is making up a very details story about what he is being interrogated about. As soon as Verbal is released Kujan realizes that he had been duped. Virbal then enlightens the viewers that he is the notorious non gimpy criminal called Kaiser Sosa.This movie really doesn't have a parity that I am aware of. It is unique, intriguing and keeps you mentally engaged throughout the movie. One quote and really the central theme to this movie is: ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn't exist"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Nothing Usual About it!,"I save this for the movies that truly deserve it and this one does.Its a Masterpiece.The performances are among the best of all time but on this occasion they come second to the story, both writing and directing, for the tale that is woven.FIlm noir is one of my favourite genres and this is the best of the lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Quite ingenious crime film that lets you in and then doesn't give you so much as a sniff unless you can spot all the visual clues and then some more.,"Only a film as cryptic as The Usual Suspects could keep you coming back for more and more. A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around. The mere fact the ending and whole idea has featured in these other texts only confirms The Usual Suspects' cult status and is really just an appreciation or 'acceptance' that it is truly a fantastic film.The film is an all over the place (in the nicest possible way), crime drenched neo-noir which cuts back and forth from police station to detective trying to get to the bottom of a supposed drug deal gone wrong on one equilibrium; but also to the flashbacks which are the making of the drug deal on another equilibrium. The film sees visual references, audio references, what characters do as well as general dialogue drop hints as to what is coming and what the truth really is  hell; in one instance, where a certain character looks is an important clue. But The Usual Suspects is more than a series of tricks and gimmicks masquerading under a decent cast and a well shot, well lit crime saga. It is a journey into a world of the detective; it is a race against time and it is a non-linear crime saga revolving around organised crime, criminals and drug lords.I have to admit that I didn't fully understand the film first time I saw it, but with the added aid of research and DVD extras, The Usual Suspects quickly became one of my favourite films in terms of atmosphere, narrative and the general pacing of the story being unfolded. The film also carries a certain air of manipulation and ambiguity in its presentation, forcing us to think one thing; forcing us to recognise with seemingly the most unnecessary things imaginable: the way a certain character speaks nearer the beginning; the direction a certain character looks and what they're looking at as well as what certain characters are telling other characters and how they're reacting to it despite the fact we've already seen it.If it all sounds complicated then that's because it is, but that's the beauty of the film when it comes to multiple viewings. Everything is set up in a fast and urgent manner after a more sedate and much more calmer opening in which the aftermath of a shoot out on a boat introduces the prologue to the main strand of the film: an interrogation (or a 'friendly chat' according to the interrogating police man) between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and the officer, David Kujan (Palminteri). The brilliance in the delivery of Kint's story to Kujan lies in its parallel placing with the scenes revolving around the rounding up of the criminals which culminates in that famous line up shot; the developing of their friendship/hatred; the jobs that they do for a mysterious figure known as Redfoot (Greene) and the situation they all find themselves in once crime king Keyser Söze (can't put actor's name in brackets) catches up with them.If we look at how the criminals consisting of McManus (Baldwin); Keaton (Byrne); Fenster (del Toro); Hockney (Pollak) and Kint are rounded up in the first place, we can see that out of all the arrests Keaton's is given the most dramatic and most coveted. When he is arrested, he is in an expensive restaurant indulging in a rich conversation as opposed to the others whom are crudely rounded up on street corners and in garages. From here Keaton is made to look, perhaps not the most criminal, but certainly the most intelligent of the band but the rest of them are petty criminals or in Kint's case, crippled. This immediately places a higher opinion on Keaton in our minds and already, the film is attempting to brainwash us with its 'who's who'. The extensive dialogue later on constantly keeping Keaton in the dark as to who he could really be helps maintain this doubt as does his scrachy background and his failure to get a business empire off the ground.Then there is the manipulation of the supporting characters. I mentioned Redfoot being mysterious, something the film establishes with eerie music as his car rolls up to the gang. They meet amongst some odd looking Japanese mise-en-scene definitely un-associated with the location they're currently in: Los Angles, further adding to the bizarre and somewhat surreal nature of both the scene and the film. But there are several incidences where what you think was right, indeed wasn't and as the film develops things become increasingly dramatic culminating in a scene involving a notice board that still chills me even after so many viewings. Quite simply; The Usual Suspects is a smart and engaging film, the likes of which can be revisited time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Riveting stuff, even after its umpteenth viewing","Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.After what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).While the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.The now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Convoluted Crime with a Great Escape,"The Usual Suspects is a 1995 Crime-Thriller directed by Bryan Singer. The film stars Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak as the film's group of hardened criminals. The film follows Kevin Spacey's character, Roger ""Verbal"" Knit as he narrates a series of crimes to the Police to find the truth of a high scale massacre.The acting in the film is hit or miss. For the most part, the main cast does a great job in the portrayal of their characters. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Verbal is well done. Verbal has a physical disability and is considered to be stupid. Spacey displays a convincing lack of mobility in the film. Simultaneously, Spacey's body language is believably timid and mild manner. Moreover, Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of Fred Fenster was fantastic. Del Toro engrains Fenster with a thick accent that lends a realistic and natural spirit to the character. Gabriel Byrne plays Dean Keaton, serving as the assumed leader of the criminals. Byrne's portrayal of Keaton grants the film levity and a cooler head. Byrne's facial expressions are really well done. Keaton is a character tormented by his past. Despite being haunted, Keaton serves as the straight man, driven by love as opposed to gain. Chazz Palminteri acts as Officer, Dave Kujan. Palminteri does a great job showcasing intensity and grit when needed. He drives the film by answering the questions when needed. Despite moments of great acting, the dialogue suffers from poor writing and delivery in some aspects.Some characters are one-dimensional. Certain actors deliver their lines with too much force and intensity. Verbal has the best dialogue in the film. ""The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was making people believe he didn't exist,"" is an incredible line. The police officers in the film are also afforded some great lines, and engaging moments of discourse. At times, anger throughout the film feels unnecessary. In terms of being written, specific characters are very dumb, whereas others are brilliant. The aggression in the film is heavy handed at moments, diluting the story's progression. Up until the conclusion, the story is convoluted and predictable. The time jumps and flashbacks are placed poorly at moments. The story could've benefited from more ""present day"" moments, rather than flashbacks. On the other hand, the ending makes up for a lot of these issues by being so impactful. The convolution of the story is a testament to who is truly narrating it.The cinematography is decent for its time. Mostly, there's no unique style to be had in the cinematography. The camera work is atypical for an action film in the 90s. The best shot moments in the film come from the conclusion. The action in this film is decent. The audio mixing is bright toward the end of the film. However, the soundtrack is very bland, making the film feel like a direct to TV movie, as opposed to a theatrical release.Overall, The Usual Suspects is confusing at first, but recoups with an iconic and memorable ending. The Usual Suspects is a good crime-thriller driven by great acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This was not so...the film had its moments, but without giving anything away, it was all too fantastic (the villain).The acting is pretty well done, Kevin Spacey was convincing (like always) and the other supporting cast members were also good.

Don't take two hours out of your life and waste on this total screw-up,"Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing ""The Usual Suspects"" with ""L.A. Confidential"", which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than ""L.A. Confidential"".I'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.The reason is, many fabulous elements in ""L.A. Confidential"", or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From ""L.A. Confidential"", we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporter So many impressive roles there. But what is in ""The Usual Suspects""? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.Second of all, the conflict. In ""L.A. Confidential"", conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in ""The Usual Suspects"", without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.The third one, ambiance. In ""L.A. Confidential"", I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifying.Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.I don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like ""L.A. Confidential"".

The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...,"1995's beautifully structured ""The Usual Suspects"" is really a very simple story. One of only two survivors of a ship explosion (Kevin Spacey) tells a story to the police detective (Chazz Palminteri) in charge of the case about how five career criminals - the ""usual suspects"" - met in a lineup and wound up working for the man whose very name strikes terror into the hearts of men - Keyser Soze.As a result, two names were on everybody's lips for some months to come: Kevin Spacey and Keyser Soze.With a crackerjack script by Christopher Quarrie, great direction by Bryan Singer and terrific performances, The Usual Suspects couldn't miss. And it doesn't. Thirteen years later, I remember it as vividly as the day I saw it. I just saw it again, and it's as good as ever.Its other stars are the handsome Gabriel Byrne as Keaton, a bad cop who at one point faked his death to avoid criminal charges; and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, still a distance from stardom, Kevin Pollak, and Giancarlo Esposito as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's persuasive assistant.As a scared, not very bright gimpy man, Kevin Spacey is a knockout and well-deserving of his Oscar, his Golden Globe, his SAG Award, his New York Film Critics Award and all his other honors. The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter. The Usual Suspects is a modern classic.The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist...and then he's gone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Okay start, great ending","This was a weird one for me. Not gonna lie it was pretty slow, weird and boring the first half of the movie. The characters and ending is what really drives this movie home.Acting:
Great cast and acting. The whole ""gang"" of guys are hilarious and full of charisma. The jokes and lines they have are a real smile jerker. Kevin spacey did especially wonderful. Overall this was a really strong point of the film.Story:
The story was really weird, slow and boring the first half at least for me anyway. The plot direction and scenes made it hard to follow and dive into. But once you dive into it and get past the first half it becomes really interesting. The characters are great and funny which does help tremendously. The ending is a twist, very iconic and very good.Summary:
I know this is a cult classic and most will probably disagree with my review but this movie isnt perfect. As I've stated this is somewhat boring but does pick up. I would reccomend this if you really want to watch a cult classic and a piece of cinematic history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The greatest trick the Devil ever played...,"""The Usual Suspects"" made Kevin Spacey a household name, and rightfully so. One of the cleverest movies ever made, the ending is more than a shocker. The plot of course involves customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogating hoodlum Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) to try and find out what happened at a crime scene earlier. But this is no ordinary interrogation; what we find out here may be the end of normalcy as we know it. And I don't just mean what we find out about Keyser Soze (whether early on or at the end); this movie has more twists and turns than Lombard St. With perfect performances from Spacey and Palminteri - and from Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and Dan Hedaya - this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.Every time when I'm talking about this movie with someone, I start...well, doing what we find out about at the movie's end.

The best thriller of the '90s,"The first and best reason to remember The Usual Suspects is one single line, spoken by low-level crook Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey): ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"". The cult phrase refers to Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal mastermind who, while unseen (or not, depending on the point of view), dominates the events of Bryan Singer's small yet massive masterpiece, the most accomplished entry in the thriller genre made during the '90s.Christopher McQuarrie's complex, intelligent and Oscar-winning script (lots of flashbacks in this one) kicks off with the final stage of a massacre, culminating in the execution of a certain Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and the explosion of the boat on which 27 people were brutally murdered. The sole survivor, the aforementioned Verbal, tells Detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone stole a truck, and five ""usual suspects"" were lined up and arrested. These included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), the dim-witted McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and the latter's lover, the hard-to-understand Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, who apparently really had problems when it came to making his lines intelligible).Now, as Keaton pointed out then and Verbal points out now, the usual strategy is putting one real criminal alongside four random buffoons who practically participate in line-ups for a living. Why were those five sharing a cell, then? The answer pops up after their release: the five suspects are contacted by a sinister attorney who goes by the name Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and told that they have to fulfil an assignment for Keyser Soze, otherwise they will all die. As the story proceeds, the incredulous police come to realize they're not dealing with the usual crime, or the usual perpetrators for that matter.The film is clearly an independent production (all scenes were filmed in a limited number of locations, mostly indoors, and the director himself famously appeared in front of the camera in some of the close-ups), but it certainly thinks big, like most smaller films from the late '80s and early '90s. The title is of course an explicit homage to Casablanca, one of Singer's favorite movies, and the intricate plotting is blockbuster-worthy (if only most blockbusters were written this well). What it lacks in size it makes up for in mood and tension, both of which are provided largely through John Ottman's editing and music.The other key attraction, sort of inevitably with such a cast, is the acting: Del Toro's performance promised a very bright future (and Traffic and 21 Grams have done nothing to prove him wrong), Byrne, Baldwin and Pollak delivered the last truly memorable silver-screen work of their careers (not that Baldwin had that much to speak of in the first place), and in the crippled, verbose Kint Spacey found the perfect role to impose himself as one of the fundamental screen presences of our time. And that's without mentioning the elusive figure of Keyser Soze: whether he's physically portrayed by someone or not, he is rightfully remembered as one of the most enduring cinema villains ever created. Not bad for a guy who hardly has any screen-time at all (or does he?).Alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, The Usual Suspects qualifies as the most intelligent and enjoyable thriller of the '90s. The extra points it scores are all due to the particular nature of its ""central"" villain: even more than Hannibal Lecter, Keyser Soze and his tricks won't leave your mind very easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A tremendously woven plot,"As film is a medium for telling stories, this film has the finest story translated to the medium of film. The film appears to be a nicely put together heist movie.

Genius thriller with career best performances from most concerned,"A lot can be said about the Usual Suspects that makes you wonder just what kind of film it is: epic twists, killer dialogue, excellent performances, hardcore action and much more. All of these beg the modern question... who did the director steal his best ideas from? Well that's just it. Although Suspects does owe a debt of gratitude to many films, Casablanca being one example, it was made a long time before the recent crop of films created by directors nicking their best ideas of other people.This is no Tarantino-esquire film because it was made before he hit the full heights of his popularity. It has no Shyamalan style twist because old M. Night probably got the idea from Suspects. In short, this was the film that provided the catalyst for an awful lot of what we now regard as standard in our noirish, modern films.For anyone who has yet to see this movie any talk of the plot would spoil the surprise, not just the one at the end but the genuine thrill of seeing every actor involved create an ensemble piece of such exquisite pace, tension and thrill. Whether it's Benicio Del Toro's bizarre Fenster, Kevin Pollack's bitter-sweet Hockney or even Stephen Baldwin's characteristic McManus, this film has a bunch of actors doing perhaps their best work to date, even beyond the five in the line up.There are a few minor quibbles. Continuity provides a problem in places as does the explanations for some characters' motives. The film jumps around different time-lines fairly unpredictably and you can be forgiven for wondering whether the whole thing is just a big shaggy dog story. On the other hand, as twisty turny thrillers go this one can't be beat.If you have yet to do so buy, not see or rent but buy, this film, watch it all the way through with no one (as they'll be hopping up and down on their seat desperately trying to explain the clever bits and pieces that Singer and co have strewn throughout) and enjoy one of the best examples of modern film making.

We then end up in interrogation room with Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended up on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events (mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the horrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other ex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and ended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne) who is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro who really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent brings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed buddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin).

Benicio Del Toro is unfortunately not at his best, while Kevin Spacey presents the top performance of the lot, and the rest of the cast gives only an acceptable one, but not much better.If you like criminal intrigue, you probably will like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A piece of crap!,"This movie is nothing but a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no logic in the story, the characters are boring and everything is mixed together and that makes the movie very confusing and extremely boring.Five stupid men are the main characters, and all they do is talk about stupid things in a boring way. Occasionally the director puts in a little stupid action which makes no particular sense.Overall: A very clumsy attempt to make a crime movie. And I'm sorry that it isn't possible to vote less than 1 for this movie failure. It's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.If you want to see a brilliant crime movie you should try ""Seven"" or ""The Silence Of The Lambs"". True classics!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
and just like that...hes gone,"No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Noir at its best,"Forget M. Night Shyamalan with his plot holes and fall-apart final acts, this film has, unarguably, the most well-executed finale of this sort, at least of the 90s!

Twist-Laden Story.,"Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement.

He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong...Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about.

Perfectly Simple / Simply perfect,"One month ago, I was at work finishing some boring reports. After finishing them, I surfed the web in order to find really good movies I haven't watched yet; more precisely on IMDb, when I checked the IMDb Top 250 list out . I knew most of the movies, at least I've watched the plot, nevertheless this didn't happen with Usual Suspects, I have never watched a trailer or read some synopsisNothing. Therefore I rented the movie which from my point of view started kind of slowly. Afterwards, I honestly felt confused about the combination of scenes in different timeline; you need to pay close attention to the unexpected and subtle movements on the storyline. Suspense, tension and psychological terror might be the exact words to describe this masterpiece, tangled story with several important characters whom cannot be ignored, with the masterly performance of Kevin Spacey who totally deserved the Oscar for best actor. You must stay hooked up to the screen because this film has in my opinion the best movie ending of all time. Only thing that sucks about this movie is that you can only watch it for the first time once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Proper Belter,"Truly one of the funniest non-comedy movies I've seen. Jokes aren't forced either, they come from the characters' personalities rather than injected for cheap laughs.
The script is amazing, one of my favourites ever. So quotable. it weaves together so well and there's so much call back, moving in an almost cyclical structure. The dialogue feels authentic and witty, especially how people like that usually would talk.
Kevin Spacey has got all the talent in the world, genuinely one of the greatest actors of his generation, possibly of all time. This movie shows that as not once does he break character for not even a shred. He shows every emotion through the course of the movie and portrays that slight angst that something isn't quite right, which ultimately there is.
The other actors are top notch as well. Namely Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kajun) as he portrays the thoughts and methodical actions of his work. I would say Benicio Del Toro smashes it, which he does, but it is a pain to try and understand what he is saying, and ultimately reading subtitles can suck you out if a movie (At least for me anyway).
The uncertainty throughout makes us question everything in the movie. This perfectly sets up the final act, in which there is one of the best plot twists for any movie.
The theme of trust is prevalent through the movie, no one truly trusts anyone, much less us for any characters emphasised by the untrustworthy narrator through the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An unforgettable masterpiece of a film.,"The Usual Suspects stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of crime thrillers. The movie will simply amaze you with its brilliantly woven narrative and an amazing cast that delivers exemplary performances.At the heart of the movie lies its unforgettable cast of characters. The entire cast all add depth and diversity to the group of criminals. Each character is distinctive and brings a unique dynamic to the narrative, making the interactions between them as captivating as the plot itself. Every actor played their part perfectly and I wouldn't change anyone in any role I do believe. The movie owes much of its success to the incredible cast, whose talents mesh seamlessly to create a gripping and unforgettable cinematic experience. Although I say all this I do not believe it's the best acting from anyone individually. But that's because it's a true testament to the fact that case members can all come together to make the acting far better than it would be individually. By this I mean to say if you take a single actor and separate them the acting may not seem amazing. But the perfect cast was assembled that all together make the movie's characters brilliant. They all complement each other to magnificent effect.Another brilliance of the movie is in its storytelling, which takes the audience on a thrilling ride through a labyrinth of deceit. The plot is constructed brilliantly with twists and turns that seamlessly fit together perfectly and don't seem pulled out of thin air adding nothing. All of this culminating in an astonishing revelation that leaves viewers in awe. The movie's ability to keep you speculating and engaged in discussions long after the credits roll is a testament to its intelligent and compelling narrative. Many a film have twists and turns that simply fall flat. So having twists/a twist doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. This is one such case of how it can work very well within a narrative. Utterly brilliant story. I feel the story will leave you both stunned and satisfied. Every piece of the puzzle falls perfectly into place, making it a cinematic experience unlike any other. Not a single moment in this movie bored me and made me want to skip ahead. This movie had me hooked from the first scene to the last. The movie encourages speculation and even if you managed to predict some aspects of the twists, the sheer brilliance of the storytelling and character development ensures that it remains an enthralling journey from start to finish.I am one such viewer that predicted the plot twist down to its most minuscule details. I predicted the final scene of the film as soon as it's possible to do so. Although this sounds like it's a negative, I had such fun throughout the movie and paused it several times to speak to myself for about 20 minutes on what I believe to be happening. The ending is one that I will always remember until I pass. It is truly one of the great movie endings.The soundtrack of the movie must have been brilliant. However I would like to admit I cannot remember it even after only just finishing thee cinematic masterpiece. I was so infatuated with every other part of the story that I didn't even pay attention to the soundtrack. I must assume it's good however as if it wasn't I feel I would be noticeable. Apologies on this front but if I said anything other than this I would be making up stuff to say.The runtime was a perfect length and the movie didn't ever feel like it was making itself longer simple to pad for length. Very well done to the director and their team for this.Overall the movie is a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its extraordinary cast, captivating characters, and masterfully crafted narrative make it a true masterpiece in the world of cinema. There is no room for criticism here as every aspect of the film is incredible. If you haven't experienced this cinematic triumph yet, it is a must-watch for any lover of thrillers and storytelling at its finest.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

One of Spacey's best performances,"Movies like this will make you yearn for the golden age of cinema that was the '90s, where seemingly Hollywood was just releasing instant classic after instant classic.This was sadly one of those movies that I overlooked when I was younger. In my haze of binging Netflix DVD rentals as a teen, I remember watching the first 20 minutes of this and turning it off, not knowing that I was missing out on probably one of the most intelligently-written films ever produced.Granted, it's nonlinear structure might be somewhat confusing, but the movie isn't as complicated as some people say it is. The movie essentially unwraps in a series of interesting scenes related to a heist. As Spacey's character Verbal narrates all these recollections in his life to Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), we learn more and more about the mysterious figure behind the madness, Keyser Söze. The only question we all have is: who is Keyser Söze?The funny thing is, I already knew who Söze was when I sat down with the intention to watch this film to its full conclusion, but that didn't detract me from appreciating the ending whatsoever. Nor did it stop me from appreciating the sharp screenwriting, excellent direction, and mesmerizing performance by Spacey, who rivals his role in Seven, which I previously thought was the top acting in his career.This is one of those classics you want to rewatch as soon as it's finished, just because you're so blown away by the time it's all finished that you want to re-examine the pieces and figure out how the filmmakers were able to pull one over you so cleverly.

The cinematography felt straightforward even if it did have a couple of creative shots, and the music was forgettable. Overall the only saving grace I see for this film is the cast, Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro are both excellent, I loved their performances and to help matters they were surrounded by a good ensemble.

Possibly The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made,"Rarely does a film of any genre rise to the level of perfection achieved in The Usual Suspects. The ultimate goal of any whodunit is to keep the audience guessing right up until the very end, perhaps even never quite answering the question with absolute certainty. This movie hits the proverbial bullseye with mind boggling precision. Someone jacks a truck loaded with guns in New York City but police have no leads. So they bring in five of the Big Apple's best known thieves to shake the underworld's tree. But unbeknownst to the police, or our ""suspects,"" there are greater forces at play. When it's all said and done, LAPD, NYPD, and the feds are left sifting through an abandoned cargo ship in an L.A. harbor with lots of bodies but not much else. All they have to go on is the shaky story of a talkative small-time crook named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for the role), and a dying victim of the shootout who claims to have seen the devil incarnate on the ship, a legendary criminal kingpin whose name sends shivers up the spines of police and lawbreakers alike. It may not sound like much, but every aspect of this film comes off so astoundingly well, from the morose cinematography and foreboding score, to the impeccable performances by its stars (Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro as the ""suspects"" and Chazz Palminteri as the federal agent trying to piece their story together), The Usual Suspects concludes with a classic stunner that only adds to its reputation as one of the greatest crime dramas ever filmed, if not the best ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Interesting, engrossing, but might have benefited from a stronger cast","Five disparate men, crooks involved in a drug heist gone awry, have their story unraveled by the sole survivor of the mishap. Colorfully profane screenplay done a disservice by the rather lackluster cast (particularly Chazz Palminteri, who does nothing fresh playing a smug investigator, and Stephen Baldwin as a cocky cut-up). Similarly, the direction also takes a while to warm up, although Kevin Spacey overcomes the awkward handling and won a Supporting Actor Oscar. Spacey, who often strikes an indifferent presence on-screen, is eerily haughty here and almost removed from the surroundings, yet his actorly tics are colorful and he works his hypnotic eyes with quiet drive. The movie has intriguing passages and certainly improves as it continues, but the twisty finish is more outlandish than surprising, especially as you consider all that came before it. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Somewhat wonderful?,"Usual Suspects made a long career for Bryan Singer, and an even larger reputation for itself. A crime-thriller that supposedly pioneered the 'shocking' twist, long before Shyamalan came on the scene. But what about watching a movie without any pre-conceived notions? I took the time to slip it into the DVD player with my old man besides me. After 2 hours of convoluted trickery, he was less than impressed with the film's main plot device. ""Well that was clever..... but is that it?""With a combination of tropes (the dog being the mastermind, crossed with unreliable narrator) the writers try to keep the audience guessing, but somewhat superficially, as the story gradually winds down to a less than mind-blowing finale. The direction is flashy and Scorsese-lite, with bright lighting, wide angles, and mysterious music to let the viewer feel he is being led astray. It works for the most part, but I felt like my buttons were being pressed unwillingly by the filmmaker, to make the mystery seem thicker than it was.The other problem was the narrator-bound narrative. It was essential for the plot, but also meant we never peek into the lives of these characters we're supposed to be attached to. The history between them is relegated to expository dialogue, and a love-interest's death is dealt out in an offhand fashion right at the climax. It made me realize that most of the story is built around this twist ending, and the rest of what happened in the film, all the mini-adventures the characters had, the elaborate trail they had been lead on, was all window-dressing to get me to the WOW shocker that had been promised all along.It's neat, artfully told, smooth film making, but the story seems like it could have been condensed into a 20 minute Twilight Zone episode and left at that. Not a 2 hour feature. My time wasn't exactly wasted, but there wasn't much meat to chew on, thematically or character-wise, and all it left me to ponder upon was a quote hijacked from French poet Charles Baudelair; ""The devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.""

One of the Best movies...EVER!!!!,"Well,  If you haven't seen this movie yet, boy are you missing out.This is an excellent movie, to say the least, I haven't yet gotten over who Keyser Soze is, but don't worry I won't give it away.But I do have to say that Mr. Kevin Spacey was amazing in his portrayal of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint a not-smart, crippled con-man who works with five other felons (who are all also excellent) to get back at the police for bringing them all in on a trumped up charge of stolen guns.

Bryan Singer masterfully crafts a narrative where appearances deceive, and truths are as elusive as smoke. It's a stark reminder that we often see what we expect rather than what is real.

"Very clever and superficially entertaining, but unsatisfying","Last week in a comparative literature class, we watched and discussed The Usual Suspects.  After listening to many perspectives on the film, I've arrived at this conclusion:  It's not challenging or difficult, it's impossible (or at least seems that way).I'm going to assume that anyone who reads this is at least familiar with the plot, so I won't summarize too much hear.  I also won't reveal the details of the ending, as not to spoil it for anyone.The Usual Suspects does have quite a bit going for it:  A clever and often funny screenplay, first rate acting, and direction that is generally very riveting.  Even though the characters are well acted, they are presented in relatively superficial manner; we never really know them accept on a surface level.  There isn't anything intrinsically wrong with that, but for this film it is a crucial flaw because it renders the conclusion unsatisfying.The story and plot are extremely complicated and the details are mind-numbingly intricate:  We get multiple perspectives and interpretations from at least two characters (sometimes simultaneously) of what happened during different times.  It is difficult to determine what flashbacks actually did happen and which are fallacies.  The plot is almost impossible to follow, even before the conclusion.  The conclusion is genuinely surprising (for MOST people, including me), but later doesn't seem to make sense.Throughout the film, it is suggested that Keyser Soce is the devil.  It is not clear if he literally is the devil, or just a PERSON so evil as to be like the devil.  Regardless of which assumption you make, the ending of the film isn't satisfying.  If Soce isn't the devil (and has no supernatural powers), the film does not work:  The pieces of the plot simply don't fit together (from what I can tell).  If you accept that Soce literally is the devil, then this premise gives the filmmakers license to do almost anything, regardless of whether it unfolds in a plausible manner.  This isn't satisfying either because it seems to render much of the plot irrelevant.If the viewer completely disregards all plot holes and only observes the surface, The Usual Suspects is an entertaining movie.  In that sense it is worth seeing.  The pleasure does seem to be entirely superficial.  It is clear that a great deal of thought went in to making this film, and it certainly isn't mindless.  However, the film is void of any depth of human element and any real meaning.  The plot may fit together if the film is closely and repeatedly examined, but it's shallow nature doesn't motivate the viewer to do so.  This makes The Usual Suspects a good, but not great film, and certainly not one of the best films of the 1990's.Note:  If anyone would like to e-mail me to agree, disagree, or make any other criticism, I'd be happy to hear from you (not petty complaints please).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Who IS Keyser Söze? Who freakin' cares?,"Released in 1995 and directed by Bryan Singer, ""The Usual Suspects"" is a crime drama/mystery about five thugs who decide to team up and get revenge on the police (Keven Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Baldwin, Keven Pollak and Benicio Del Toro). After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Söze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and he's interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Söze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Söze's right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs.This is a ""twist ending"" flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just ""wait for the twist,"" it isn't actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey's character is somewhat interesting. As such, it's next to impossible to care about them. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn't really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I'm not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren't worth it. The film didn't make me care enough to watch again.Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination. And, for me, the convoluted journey in ""The Usual Suspects"" is just dull and laborious. If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but that's not the case. Then there's something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing 'hip' tough-tawkin' hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign.I can't believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; the movie's seriously overrated.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City.GRADE: C-***SPOILER ALERT***I want to emphasize that this review does not criticize the film based on pretending to ""know the twist all along"" (as stated above, I was able to figure out who the mystery man likely was, but not the other details). The problem is that the entire movie is based around listening to a guy make up a bunch of stuff. Gee, so all we really know is there was a ship that got torched and Kevin Spacey's character doesn't really have a limp. Okay, thanks for wasting my time with everything else. Great storytelling (rolling my eyes).",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""","I've seen ""The Usual Suspects"" several times since its release so it's somewhat difficult for me to judge it now. After all, once one unravels the film's central mystery it cannot possibly produce the same reaction again. That being said, the film is one of those instances whereby a repeat viewing is rewarding since actions and events take on a different meaning.The cast is surprisingly good for a low-budget film. Securing Gabriel Byrne was a coup and Kevin Spacey delivered the goods in an Academy Award-winning performance. The rest of the cast includes dependable character actors like Pete Postlethwaite, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Esposito & Dan Hedaya. Benicio del Toro stands out in a memorable supporting role but I have to say that Stephen Baldwin & Kevin Pollak leave something to be desired. Nevertheless, on the whole, the acting is in good hands.However, it's the screenplay that justifiably gets most of the credit for making this film memorable. Opening with the aftermath of an apparent drug deal gone wrong, we're led through the preceding events as related by 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey). He tells of how the titular 'usual suspects' got together and how they came to be embroiled in a mystery that has the cops baffled. All of this leads to a climax that I can only say I hope no-one has spoiled for you.On the technical side, Bryan Singer's direction is well-handled as he manages to imbue the film with a distinct sense of style without going overboard. Editor John Ottman also scored the picture and he did a fine job on both counts. The efforts of Singer & Ottman give the film a polish that defies its relatively low budget.Ultimately, it's difficult for me to judge this film (or any film with a twist) since I've seen it multiple times. That being said, the fact that I have seen it multiple times shows that the vaunted twist is only a part of the film's appeal. Nevertheless, for a first time viewing I'd be tempted to bump the film's rating up to a 9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This alleged Emperor of Movies Has no clothes,"I first viewed The Usual Suspects a decade ago, lulled into the cinema by a plethora of pretentious critics and knowing smart alecs who claimed this was the most intelligent piece of film making in a generation.

I won't even begin to summarise the confusing plot if that is what you would care to call it. Fellow reviewers who try to do so are simply wasting their energy. Why bother to do so when it clearly makes no sense, has no structure,and is meaningless.Or perhaps writer and director McQuarrie and Singer have the guile of the tailors of the apocryphal emperors non existent clothes.

The Usual Suspects Review,"The Usual Suspects was released in 1995. Christopher McQuarrie was the writer and it was directed by Bryan Singer, and edited by John Ottman.In the movie there are five primary characters. Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) is a crippled man who serves as the brains. Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a former police officer. McManus (Stephen Baldwin) is extremely happy but crazy, and Tod Hockney (Kevin Pollack) is extremely odd and Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) has trouble speaking correctly. The twist of the film is that not all of the characters are who they are perceived to be. These five characters are forced in to a police lineup because they are suspicious. To get back at the cops they all join forces. They begin to take more jobs because they are offered money. They find out that the person who is hiring them is named Keyser Soze. Keyser Soze is believed to be the ultimate bad guy that everyone should be scared of.This film includes many visual references and flashbacks to previous scenes in order to tie in the current plot. The editing of the film seems to be extremely tasteful. Even though there are quick scene changes throughout the entire film, the editing never interrupts the flow of the story. In order for members of the audience to get the most out of this film, it is crucial to pay full attention to details. The story-line is fairly complex because of the many characters. The lighting of the film seems to be fairly natural but dark. Specifically when some of the characters encounter Keyser Soze, Keyser's face is completely hidden from to light to conceal his identity.The final scene of the movie is monumental. They close with a specific quote that summarizes the entire experience of watching the film. This movie is extremely well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A great film in all ways,"It's so pleasing to know that great films are still being made, if even on an far too infrequent basis. The Usual Suspects please on so many levels its hard to put into words. Bryan Singer comes out of nowhere to direct only his SECOND feature film and hits a home run. While he's now quite famous from his work on the X-Men films, what he did with the Usual Suspects is far beyond any expectations that could have been placed on him. Christopher McQuarrie (who also worked with Singer on his first film) also comes out of nowhere to write a script so well thought out and put together its sad to think he's only turned out an indie and Way of the Gun since. And lastly, the cast are terrific. Top to bottom (even Baldwin) are great. Benicio Del Toro steals every scene he is in with his awkward, mumbling way of talking. And this really marked the start of Kevin Spacey's ascent into A list stardom in Hollywood. In addition to his standout performance in this film, he quickly followed it with parts in Seven, A Time to Kill and LA Confidential.

People don't get it,"Every bad review of this film can be summed in one question: ""what's the point of watching the entire movie if it's all just made up?!""The problem with this view is, of course, that it fails to appreciate that The Usual Suspects is a MOVIE. Every movie has a narrator. Some narrators tell part of the story by talking (e.g. The Shawshank Redemption). Some tell part of the story by writing (e.g. Star Wars). The vast majority of narrators don't talk or write, they just show--no voice over, no text at the bottom of the screen saying ""Somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean."" A few movies have a narrator within the narration. The Princess Bride, for example, tells the story of a grandfather telling a story. We appreciate the story-within-a-story plot of that film because it draws us in from the beginning.But one thing that all these movies have in common is that they're movies. They are fictional stories told through a visual/auditory medium. The fact that none of it is true doesn't make a movie any less spectacular. Take Saving Private Ryan for example--does it take away from the movie knowing that the story behind it is completely fabricated?This is what the naysayers tend to miss about The Usual Suspects--like any movie, it tells a fiction...but UNLIKE most other movies, this one goes a step further and ADMITS that the whole story was made up. That is, the ""outer"" narrator (the all-seeing, all-knowing camera), shows you that the ""inner"" narrator (Verbal) was lying through his nose.This doesn't make the film worse...it makes it better. It reminds the viewer how gullible people are. The living proof is the people who criticize the movie for not being clear about what really happened. As if ""what really happened"" really happened. Newsflash: it didn't...this is fiction.Of the many reasons why The Usual Suspects is a great movie, here's the one that I'm trying to point out with this post: The film makes you believe that it is a story about a master criminal. Then you find out that it's a story about a master storyteller (who just happens to be a master criminal).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The film takes place almost entirely in the office of a police chief, and for the most part is given in the form of a story being told by Verbal Kint played by Kevin Spacey. This allows the film to have a non-linear plot progression, which is in my opinion one of the most interesting ways to display a narrative. It allows Singer to interweave various strands and smaller narratives into one composed work. It would be remiss to review this film and not mention Kevin Spacey's brilliant acting. After seeing Kevin Spacey in such strong and stern roles such as Francis Underwood in Beau Willmon's ""House of Cards'', Seeing him act as a weak easily frightened man with Cerebral Palsy is entirely game changing. Spacey convincingly creates and displays a feeling of weakness and cowardice. In conclusion, I think the Usual Suspects is one of the best executed and unique crime films of its time, and would greatly recommend watching it to anyone who enjoys crime dramas and non-linear storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good film with suspense - Stephen Baldwin was great in this,"We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control. He makes them steal drugs off a docked ship, and as we see in the beginning, the men all die save Verbal. Hmm, who could Keizer Soze be? How did all the people die? Who is Lara Croft? Oops, wrong tagline. ""The Usual Suspects"" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow. The ending, though surprising, doesn't really click together as well as some other films with surprises. I wasn't confused by the ending, I understood it, I just thought it was a bit shallow compared to some other flicks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Usual Suspects,"In the way of flashback, the whole film reveals the truth of a murder by knife. The whole film completely overthrows the audience's habitual logical thinking, and makes a story with complex plot full of dramatic tension, which is gripping from the beginning to the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Usual Suspects,"This is the no. 19 top movies in the world list in IMDb, thus I was eager to see it.The story is about 5 crooks who are on a mission to steal dope (drugs) and money from a ship on orders of a Kaizer Soze a super criminal legend. What happens is that 4 of them die and there is only one survivor who narrates the whole journey from the time they all were arrested for a crime they did not commit and how they end up dead  killed by Kaizer Soze. The police try to solve the mystery and find the murderer. Who is the murderer is the final twist in the tale  that is disclosed in the last two minutes.The only survivor is Verbal (Kevin Spacey) and the four other crooks are Michael McManus (Stephan Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). The interrogating customs officer Dave Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. All the actors have acted well and the movie holds interest till the last scene.But the movie does not live up to the suspense and expectation that it builds. The ending and disclosure of the murderer is childish. One laughs at the Director Bryan Singer on how he thinks of creating suspense  totally foolish. When there are characters who play role in the movie and engage audience in guessing  that make the movie interesting. But coming out with a stupid ending like this does not serve good for the creativity of being a director. With such dubious ending, the director could have taken any option totally unrelated to the movie and presented as if the mystery is solved.So was there a mystery. Obviously not!

Slick nonsense,"The more one thinks about this film, the more outlandish it becomes.  To me, this film falls into the thriller/mystery trap.  Create a bunch of cool characters, throw in a lot of swearing (I guess it makes them seem tougher) and then create a story that keeps boxing itself into the corner and then at the end throw in a twist so audacious that the audience in amazement at the filmmaker's arrogance will capitulate.  Well, not me.  I can't believe one bit of it.  Bryan Singer gets a good performance from his cast, the exception being Kevin Pollak who comes across a someone desperately trying to show how tough he is even though he isn't.  The film looks slick and stylish but sadly the ending is just too unbelievable to let me recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I imagine this film was superbly effective when it was first released,"Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is easily one of the most original and most talked-about films of the 1990s with a notorious ending-twist. Because of this and the fact that it was being advertised as a run-of-the-mill crime thriller back in 1995, I can only imagine what a shocker it was when no one knew about its surprising turn when walking into the threatre. You bet a lot of people must have spilled out their popcorn. Today, however, some of its riveting effect has subsided as the twist is so well-known and anticipated for new viewers. It becomes the whole film. It's setting itself up to be anti-climactic with such hype, and it just about makes it.However, The Usual Suspects is, first and foremost, a heist film about five men working together to pull of amazing jobs involving narcotics, money and hits. The story of these heists is told in flashbacks from one of these five men's perspective as he retells it in a police office, the day after they've been caught and killed. Kevin Spacey is this one man and he is definitely an eccentric character, and the way he tells the story is a real thrill -- the tiniest details have been meticulously crafted into the script, crammed with fast dialogue, sprinkled with equal doses of humour and suspense, featuring several story lines and a multitude of characters and names to remember, and it becomes a big mess that you can impossibly keep track of, even with a notepad. Just ask Roger Ebert.The Usual Suspects gets points for being uniquely constructed, and for sending shivers en masse down your spine at the end. But other than this, is it a greatly enjoyable movie? No, not really. It is actually borderline tedious and exhausting at times, and relies solely on its twist to be a good film. Like I say, it just about makes it but this is nothing I'd call the 15th greatest film of all time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A film that deserves to be revisited and remembered.,"I think it's unfair that this movie seems to be so forgotten nowadays, but maybe that's because of the intricate plot, loaded with flashbacks. I can understand that, but I think there are even more confusing films out there that have never gone out of style. Anyway, it's a quality film, with good actors and a story, to say the least, intriguing. A small note: the film took home both Oscars for which it was nominated (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor).It all starts when a group of men, apparently random, is taken by the police to participate in a line-up. What seems at first very casual, is not: all of them were criminals well known to the authorities, and most particularly one of them, who was also a policeman and seemed to have retired from crime and to be living an honest life. After this opening scene, the film shows the efforts of the police to capture those responsible for a shooting on a boat, with several dead and a single survivor, who will tell everything that happened. And I say no more because this script is one of those that gets better the less you know in advance.The cast is dominated by two great actors: Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey. Each in their respective character, but both very committed to their work, they steal the public's attention whenever they appear, ending up being, in a way, complementary: Spacey gives life to an apparently fragile and sick man who would be the most unlikely suspect, whereas Byrne is the typical ""tough guy"". I don't know if I can say that this film is Spacey's best so far, maybe that's premature, but it's safe that his work here opened doors for him to fly higher. Four years later, he would go on to win the Oscar for Best Actor with ""American Beauty"". Byrne, on the other hand, is one of those talented actors who never seem to have had their big moment in cinema. I also want to highlight the good work of Pete Postlethwaite, in yet another secondary character of strong relevance, two years after receiving his (only so far) Oscar nomination.Technically, I think it's worth praising the direction of Bryan Singer, who stayed true to the suspense and managed to resist the temptation to let the film slip into loud and noisy action scenes that weren't really necessary. The best thing about the film is the tense environment it builds, the enigmatic and mysterious way in which it tells its story, and this would have been partly lost if the director filled his film with random shootings and chases. Another point that deserves a note of praise is the soundtrack, and in particular the main theme, used in the opening and end credits, and which is perfectly atmospheric. The rest remains average, but is done without glaring errors. The only points I feel I should criticize negatively are the opening credits graphics, which look very dated now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I dont see it as a classic at all,"Though I see some twists. I found some of it predictable.

The endless office room interrogation filler is transparent and boring as hell, and just drags and drags and drags - interspersed with fantasy-like 'stuff blowing up' and 'intrigue' moments thrown in cut-and-paste retrospective style.

I can't believe people are duped into paying hard cash to watch this stuff at theaters.The names of 'suspects' are repeated ad-nauseum until you are just screaming at the screen SHUT UP!!!!

Brilliant!,"The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible.

A poster boy for the mystery thriller,"The 90's was a decade in film history where a new generation of soon-to-be-famous directors (notably Tarantino and Bryan Singer) stepped into the limelight alongside pros like Scorsese, Copolla and Spielberg. The Usual Suspects is a gem of this era, borrowing traits of the classic noir film and coupling them with a wonderfully convoluted plot to produce a movie for the ages.Having watched it twice, I find it remarkable that most of what impressed me on the first viewing retained the same quality the second time around.Although the effect of the twist ending was admittedly dulled having seen it once, this is clearly more a property of twists in general than a fault of the one in the film, which, is one that will truly blow you away. Despite being rather a one-trick pony of a plot, the beginning and middle of the narrative are vivid enough to keep the viewer engrossed, with a few refreshing moments of comic relief thrown in.Kevin Spacey's masterpiece in acting cannot go unmentioned. In a deservedly Oscar-winning performance as Verbal Kint, Spacey demonstrates his unique skill of portraying a very layered character. Looks may indeed be deceiving.John Ottman's score, at times chillingly suspenseful and at times eerily suggestive, is a perfect musical companion to the events that unfold. Inspiring numerous ripoffs including one sadly distasteful Bollywood remake, The Usual Suspects is as entertaining today as it must have been 25 years ago, a film that is a cult classic for a reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Two good actors, one good twist, everything else poor","I'm amazed that everyone raves about this film, I found it most annoying. Fortunately the last 10 minutes make the film worth watching, but still only enough to pull back up from the doldrums into a middling kind of position.Let's face it, the acting, on the whole, was useless. The only two exceptions would be the two who spend the most time in the office together having their ""I'm smarter than you"" battle (Verbal and Kujan). And neither of those were in any way challenging roles. I have nothing against Spacey, but that was _not_ demanding enough to be Oscar material.Plot-wise, it looked like lots of stuff was just thrown into the mix for the sake of it, not for any concrete coherent reason. My girlfriend and I played ""guess the next country mentioned"", after about 20 minutes, when we realised that the writer was just trying to make the thing sound as big and international as possible. Where were that Arabs? When I thought there'd be Arabs, there were Argentinians. When I thought there'd be Indians, there were Japanese. So I was wrong with my guesses, but I knew the unimaginative, yes unimaginative, writer would try to throw some more random countries into the plot for no good reason at all - and I was right. At least there was a brief mention of Pakistan, which made my girlfriend's guess partially right. (I remember playing ""guess the next death method"" in the Omen trilogy too, old habits die hard.)It's a film that's worth seeing exactly twice. Once to get bored to for an hour or so, and then have the fun of the twist at the end. The second time is to see if you were ""missing the point"" for the first hour of the first viewing, and conclude that you probably weren't, it is actually pretty tedious as you first thought.If you want twists, then Fight Club is head and shoulders beyond this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The very definition of a movie you have to watch twice,"""The Usual Suspects"" starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into an almost classic mystery. It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery. I've seen the film twice, but years apart, so my insight into the tremendous cinematic achievement of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie is there but limited.""Suspects"" is derived from a concept of a line-up of hardened criminals who have been brought in not with any evidence, but just because they are ""the usual suspects."" Their union, however, soon finds them all on a job that ends up with a giant boat explosion and only two survivors, one of them being only one of the criminals, ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey) a constantly rambling cripple who must explain the entire situation to the police. The story is told almost entirely from Kint's perspective, which already adds a shade of suspicion to the plot.The film lines up in strong cast with Spacey including Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Toro and Chazz Palminteri. Their characters, especially the criminals, all add an interesting dynamic to the film, keeping all the scenes interesting when the greater mystery is really the film's greatest asset.McQuarrie has lined the script full of gems so carefully that when he unloads one of the best twist endings in cinematic history, you are slapped across the face and filled with absolute glee. There's no other way to put it. Credit for this also should go to Singer and Spacey. There's no question that Singer's direction keeps up the intensity. It romanticizes the criminal lifestyle a bit, but it's necessary. Spacey's incredible portrayal of Kint, not only in his mannerisms but in his dramatic highs and lows keeps the storytelling engaging too.You simply have to watch this film and then watch it again. Then you will unquestionably like it to some degree. If you need a heavy dose of action in all your crime films, that degree will be lesser. This movie does rely heavily on script and character to keep your attention. However, as far as pure mystery goes, you can't beat ""The Usual Suspects.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Disappointing,"Upon watching The Usual Suspects, I was initially excited to see what all the hype was about however, I found the film to be somewhat of a letdown. That being said, I do think that there were some strong aspects to the movie.From a technical standpoint, The Usual Suspects was quite impressive. The camera direction by Bryan Singer was particularly noteworthy, especially given that this was only his second full-length feature film.Where the movie fell short for me was in the writing. While the dialogue and overall story were intriguing, the way they were executed left much to be desired. In particular, the first act of the film was disjointed and difficult to follow. The audience was thrown right into the middle with the suspected criminals, with little information given about their backstories or their connections to one another. As new characters were introduced, the plot became even more complex and convoluted, making it challenging to keep up with all the moving pieces. Once the film starts to conclude the second act, the pieces become a little more streamlined, which makes the back half of the movie much more enjoyable.In terms of acting, the performances were a bit of a mixed bag. Some actors, such as Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne, delivered grounded and impressive performances. However, other characters felt like overacted caricatures of quirky criminals, such as Benicio del Toro's character.One of the main selling points of The Usual Suspects is its ""incredible"" twist ending. However, I personally saw it coming from a mile away, which was a bit disappointing. It's possible that the film's score may improve upon a second viewing, but for now, I can only give it three stars. That rating is primarily due to the strong technical aspects of the movie, as without those, it would likely only receive two-and-a-half stars.Score: 56%

Review-The Usual Suspects,"Review: The Usual Suspects 'The Usual Suspects' a crime-drama mystery about a survivor telling a policeman about the events leading up to a shootout on a boat, which all started when five criminals met in a supposedly random police line-up. Directed by Bryan Singer and starring Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Posthlewaite, Steven Baldwin and Kevin Spacey. Released in 1995 it is a film with great characters and a very engaging story. The usual suspects starts out with 'Verbal' excellently played by Kevin Spacey' who is being grilled by a U.S customs agent after being one of two survivors of a catastrophic shootout on a boat. Verbal reluctantly recounts how he came to be on the boat starting with him meeting 4 other criminals in a seemingly random police line-up. Firstly what makes this film great is the acting especially Kevin Spacey's acting. My favourite scene in the film is the police line- up. It is a very iconic, well known scene. It is very funny. What makes it funny is that apparently it was supposed to be a serious scene but the actors were messing around and injecting a bit of humour into it. Even director Brian Singer adlibbed in a line: 'In English please?' I love the acting in this film. Benicio Del Toro's mumbling is appreciated. I enjoyed seeing Kevin Spacey's fast talking' innocent and shy manner is extremely captivating. Gabriel Byrne has a very convincing role as an ex-criminal trying to start fresh. Stephen Baldwin does a great job of playing the smart mouth, cocky professional of the group. Bryan Singer expertly uses tension and suspense to deliver a mind blowing twist at the end. I would absolutely recommend watching this film for a second time. Watching it again and seeing all the hints that the director had subtly snuck in is a very satisfying thing and enhances the overall experience. What I think makes this film great is the fact that it didn't have a huge budget, there's not any over the top special effects, the acting is great, it has a relatively easy to follow story line and then the ending is like the cherry on top.In conclusion I think everyone should see this film at least twice. The acting is excellent especially Kevin Spacey, the story is great and the twist is just right. Overall I give this film a 9/10. It's just so likable and re-watchable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Great thriller,"The Usual Suspects is a movie I've been meaning to watch since forever. My dad actually owns the DVD, but sometimes you have to rent a movie to actually see it - because you've paid for it and it would suck if you'd basically lose money and not see it.I didn't know much about The Usual Suspects. Story-wise I only knew that picture of the line up. I had avoided the spoilers almost perfectly. Just almost? I did know about the twist. I didn't know what it was, I just knew there was going to be a huge twist. Also I had seen that one Saturday Night Live sketch, which kind of gives something away. Even though I kind of knew something about the ending, I didn't know the story, and I didn't know how to get to the ending and what the ending would actually mean in the story, because a SNL sketch doesn't exactly explain the referenceIt's hard to get in the right mood with the movie. There's no hook before the opening credits, you just have to wait until they are over or maybe fast forward through them. They offer nothing except John Ottman's music, which is of course decent, but not any different from typical movie music. But when the movie begun, it just begun. It was a bit fast, unclear. What is happening, who are these people, oh now we're at now... When they start questioning Verbal it becomes clearer. Still flashbacks are a hard way to tell the story - they are very quick and the audience can feel like something was left out, except I think this is exactly what McQuarrie might've been after.But once you get used to the pace and the style of story telling, the movie turns into a very exciting thriller.I guess the only problem in watching this movie over 20 years later is that it's now easier to guess the big twist. It might be because of a certain actor, it might be because this kind of twist is now more common, or it's just the evolution of cinema. But at one point while watching this movie it all clicked together. Of course the SNL sketch helped, and so did that one scene from the first Scary Movie - which is something I haven't seen in ages but it just came to me and I realised that's where it's from!But figuring out a twist isn't exactly bad, you can also feel super victorious.All in all, The Usual Suspects is a good thriller, a bit slow but the end makes it so much better. It has definitely aged well. But after seeing it once I don't feel like watching it again any time soon. It might be like some other movies with major twist: once you know it, you can watch it maybe once more to like see it from the new perspective, but that's it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good but very overrated thriller,"The Usual Suspects has a great cast and good scenes, but falls short of it being spectacular for it's ending. I love to watch the film and I believe it is much easier to do than most would like to think. The ending is more about surprise, not suspense. Thses days films are more concerned with plot twists than not making sure they make any sense (""Along Came a Spider""). In the old hitchcocks, the film would go deeper into character and motives. Just because a film susrprises you, doesn't mean it deserves every award on the planet. Example, compare ""Scream"" to ""Psycho,"" and you'll get the idea. However, The Usual Suspects does answer one question, the most intriguing one, and that's why everyone loves it. And the film is just plain fun. This noir has comdey action and some suspense towards the end. You're drawn in to the world of these characters because of the intriguing and almost-mythical Keyser Soze. it's only entertainment to me, nothing more. After seeing this movie, I dare you to try to write down what actually happened and the motives of each character. Maybe you'll only get two or three motives.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"I wanted to love it, I ended up liking parts of it","Maybe it was because I was told it was one of the greatest thrillers ever made, maybe it was because I could see the twist coming a mile away, or maybe because the movie isn't as smart as it thinks it is- for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy The Usual Suspects as much as I wanted to. That being said, it isn't a bad movie, just an overstuffed film- with some other obvious issues as well. The film is very cool with its atmospheric tones, and intriguing with its large cast of interesting criminal characters, all of which provide excellent performances while on screen. The film is largely relying on the performance of Kevin Spacey, and he is more than up to the task, providing a nearly perfect performance for the role allotted. Gabriel Byrne also gives a very notable performance, and besides Spacey, is the obvious standout in the film, and he truly does give the role his all. The direction in the film is very well crafted, as well as the score and cinematography. To sum it up, the film looks good, acts good, and sounds good- but what it lacks is anything of much better value. At the center of it, the film feels empty, relying on plot twists, a convoluted plot, and a screenplay that doesn't seem to really be going anywhere =- or at least anywhere of any importance. The film can be very entertaining to watch at times, but it's the times where everything is getting set up and explained that is truly boring. I don't care for films that feed you information, I want to understand and see the story. In the end, The Usual Suspects may be a better time around the second time, but as well crafted as it can be at times, it has plenty of flaws that make it far messier than it has any right to be. Kevin Spacey gives a great performance and the film has a cool concept, but not much is delivered in the grand scheme of things, which will leave you feeling more satisfied than awed when the film finally reaches its long awaited conclusion.My Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

What is so amazing is how the writer managed to skillfully put in clues that could lead us to a conclusion but the references are so slight we might not notice it.

It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.,"Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing.

Who is Keyser Soze ?,"The title comes from a line in the classic film ""Casablanca"" (1942), where the corrupt police chief, anxious to cover up the murder of a Nazi officer, tells a subordinate to ""round up the usual suspects,"" meaning that the police should find a bunch of random criminals to be questioned. In the film, the usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges. Funny thing - the idea for this movie started only with the concept of a movie poster of five of guys in a lineup.""The Usual suspects "" is a modestly-budgeted piece . All the actors worked for less than their usual fees. It shows you their dedication to the project and seems impossible to make this film today , when almost every movie has a 200 mln budget. This movie doesn't have budget , but it has the thing that is really the most important in a movie – screenplay.The ending is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history . It's very simple and very effective . Simply unforgettable , when the truth hits you like a ton of bricks. The quote from the French poet Charles Baudelaire ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist"" appears in this movie and it's definitely one of the most famous lines in movie history.The story seems convoluted , but in the end makes perfect sense. It grabs you from the start with the mystery of what happened in the docks. There are more mysteries and twists along the way until the very end. Like every good criminal this movie does lose it's magic on repeated viewings , yet not quite. On repeated viewings you can see many clues you might have missed . You will also notice how well written the dialogues are.Kevin Spacey gives quite possibly the best performance of his career as fast-talking yet shy con artist crippled by cerebral palsy. He deserved Oscar . The rest of the cast shines too - Gabriel Byrne , Benicio Del Toro , Kevin Pollak , Chazz Palmintieri and even Stephen Baldwin. The music by John Ottman is underrated . It's very elegant and moody score. Bryan Singer directs with confidence and energy , never allowing the plot to be confusing.The only bad thing I can say about this movie that it's only a game . There's nothing , no message , no substance underneath this brilliant construction. It's just a pure entertainment and intelligent fun with the viewer , but who said that's a bad thing ?

The Last Great Mystery Thriller,"Sometimes the sum is greater than the parts. The parts are good, but when it all comes together, and fits, just right, there's something more. The Usual Suspects might be the perfect example of this. Nothing on its own stands out. But together, all the pieces fit.Told in flashback by Kevin Spacey, the audience follows the events leading up to a shoot-out and massacre on a boat. Following a group of 5 criminals (alternating lead between Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) from job to job, the plot is told straightforward but lays down layers of dense intricacy and relationships. The story becomes increasingly revolved around the mysterious legend, Keyser Soze.At its heart The Usual Suspects is merely a mystery told incredibly well. No scene is wasted- the film is tightly paced at just over an hour and a half- and the characterisation comes through immediately. Kevin Spacey's purposefully monotone voice-over is often merely exposition, but the framing device and the dialogue make it work without ever seeming dull.One should take a moment to bring up the dialogue, which is actually a lot better than many give it credit for. While the screenplay is better known for how it comes together at the end, the whole script is full of wit and slick lines. McQuarrie is well deserving of his Oscar.Yet one cannot really do a review of The Usual Suspects without reference to the ending. It's a film that relies on its ending to enhance the rest of it. Previous scenes have more meaning, and its cleverness becomes apparent. The main criticism one can see is if the ending is spoiled (which given its infamy is increasingly likely), it can neuter the impact.Aside from that, The Usual Suspects does no wrong. A giant puzzle with satisfying parts, which when complete reveals a jigsaw masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Review: The Usual Suspects,"The Usual Suspects is a twisty thriller with a dizzying storyline. The story is very manipulative, demands the viewer's full attention, constantly slithers around the characters, and boils until reaches its unexpected climax. The screenplay is structured as a complex puzzle and refuses to divulge any clues to its solution until the final piece is in place. The film is both challenging and rewarding. It plays with the audience's expectation until the very end when the viewer is finally rewarded by finding out about who Keyser Soze really is.The story is told via the narration and point of view of one of the suspects Verbal Kint (by Kevin Spacey) through flashbacks. The plot is about five cons, Kint, Keaton (by Gabriel Byrne), McManus (by Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (by Kevin Pollack), and Fenster (by Benicio Del Toro), that are trickily brought together to do a suicidal job for a mysterious figure, Keyser Soze, that will pay them $91 million. The central theme revolves around the mystical man, Soze, who is linked to the devil in the film. However, as the story prolongs, it is not clear whether he is a real person or just a legend.I watched the full screen version of the movie that delivers a sharp and beautifully defined image. The cinematography features drastic lighting and camera angles to create more or less tension for the scenes. Most of the scenes are played at night giving the film a dark sinister feel. Dark and bright lights accentuate on the drama and tension of the story, low-key lights give a dreary effect. The film features lots of bright white over the head shots. Tension is also created by extreme close-ups. The combination of lighting and camera shots create a shadowy underworld background. The low angle camera shots used to help the audience to understand the helplessness of the character. For example, in the opening scene a big part of the screen is covered by a man, whose identity remains a mystery until the very end, holding a gun on Keaton. Low camera angle accentuates on the height difference between the unknown man and Keaton, who is about to be killed. The low angle shots also emphasize on the importance and power of the unknown man in this scene. The audience only sees a portion of the mystery man and only from behind which adds to his secretive character.The cinematography also features an interesting interplay of colors, from the bright red shirt of Fenster to the dark color room scenes.The final scene, where everything comes together, is completely dependent on visuals and requires the viewer's full attention. The ending makes the audience want to see the movie again to explore the story-line for further understanding of the complicated labyrinth of the plot.The musical score driving the movie reinforces the story and instills even greater emotions in the audience. The score makes the climax of the film even more shocking. The tone of music creates a mysteries atmosphere. Slow songs represent sadness and faster beat represents action.Two other movies that I could link The Usual Suspects to are Reservoir Dogs and Identity. There are also a group of criminals brought together in Reservoir Dogs to do a job. Identity, just like The Usual Suspects, features lots of twists and turns with an unexpected ending.In conclusion, The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The multi-level plot structure assures that the viewer can find something new at each watch. The farther the movie goes, the more the audience realizes that not everything is what it seems. The plot circles around and keeps building and building before it hits the mark keeping the viewer pinned to their chair.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I didn't find The Usual Suspects especially entertaining (even the second time through - I did try) and it certainly has little feeling - it would have had more if the only (barely) sympathetic character hadn't turned out the way he did.The Usual Suspects isn't a great movie, it is simply a well-acted, solid crime drama (I wouldn't even call it a thriller - where's the suspense?). Watch it, and watch it again if you want to get the ending out of your mind - because it isn't worth pondering over the whole movie for too long....6 1/2 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Highly entertaining but not great,"The only thing that was great about this film was the ending the rest was good, but nothing really ""great"". I though it was a bit boring at parts and it did not hold my attention during it whole duration: I had to make an effort to watch it entirely, which is not expected from a film made in the 1990's (if it was a film from before 1977 (which means, before Star Wars changed the film industry), that would be alright: I gave 9/10 for Citizen Kane, but its finale was even better and the whole film had a better felling).I won't say it was a great film: it was entertaining but it is not a work of art and it shouldn't be in the top 250 list. I recommend it to those that like these mobster films, since this is essentially one of those films. I have, however, no preference towards this genre at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Very well scripted, and direction is very well done.

You won't even notice they are there. It is a must see, though slow at the beginning (for me, anyway; I was a little lost) and then like a roller-coaster of clues the next.

one of my favorite movies!!!,"The Usual Suspects is hands down one of the best movies ever. It is one of those movies where you don't realize what you've seen until the end. The story is flawless and leaves you on the edge of your seat, which explains why it won a best original screenplay Oscar. The film is Directed by Bryan Singer (in his second picture).The usual suspects has great ensemble cast. However, the one that shines the most is Kevin Spacey(who won a best supporting actor Oscar for the role)Spacey plays the cripple Verbal Kintwho is the only survivor of the boat incident. The film is told through the verbals flashbacks. Verbal flashbacks tell the story of 5 criminals who meet in a line up, which they think was no coincidence. The 5 criminals decide to pull a couple cons together, but when a they learn that a under ground drug-lord could be pulling the strings things start going terribly wrong.The one thing I don't understand is why this movie did not get nominated for a best picture or director academy award.

Middle,"""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) is a gripping and twist-filled crime thriller directed by Bryan Singer. The film follows a group of criminals who are brought together for a mysterious job by the enigmatic criminal mastermind Keyser Söze. As they navigate through a web of deception and betrayal, led by the unreliable narrator Verbal Kint, played by Kevin Spacey, the audience is kept on the edge of their seats until the shocking climax. The film's nonlinear storytelling and unreliable narrator add layers of complexity to its narrative, keeping viewers guessing until the very end. Spacey's performance is particularly mesmerizing, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. With its intricate plot, memorable characters, and iconic twist ending, ""The Usual Suspects"" is a modern classic that continues to captivate audiences with its masterful storytelling and suspenseful atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Godfather of all movies..,"When I read the comment on ""The silence of the lambs"" at IMDb.COM there was a phrase that said; ""This is the Godfather of thrillers"" Well i'd like to repeat that phrase when i am commenting on THE USUAL SUSPECTS with only a small difference; this is the godfather of all the movies ever made. If we watched the same movie you wouldn't think that i exaggerated at all. With so few explosions and action scenes, we yet have the most riveting script with many twists.(the end maybe the best one we ever came across) The acting is superb, as if those guys were made for their roles. Baldwin is as if living his character, along with Del Toro. Spacey is also amazing.

Testosterone thriller cleverly done,"The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in ""Throw Mama from the Train."" But this is not a comedy. It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either. It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody. The title is the tip off.""Round up the usual suspects"" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know. Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says ""round up the usual suspects"" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order. It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but. The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types. The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film. In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley). Consider these similarities: In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an ""at your throat"" style. In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane. In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs. These guys are not your run of the mill actors. They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies. They know how to look and act authentic.But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue. In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different. In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play. Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody ""Mister"" like an English butler. And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist."" Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak. And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois. That will help to unravel the plot. The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics. But it's a little better than that. And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem. While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience. Personally I thought the movie was a laugh. I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it. But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it. Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology. They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f-you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world. And there's some truth to it.Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified. He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else. I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre. A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint. You might want to write one yourself.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

memorable,"Gripping thriller from director Bryan Singer about a group of vengeful career criminals falsely detained for a crime they didn't commit. Told from the perspective of a lone but crippled survivor, we learn how they take measures to exact revenge against the police only to find that they're being controlled by the underworld's most feared and ruthless criminal kingpin—a shadowy figure whose very existence is thought to be pure myth. One of a kind thriller with stylish direction, well-drawn characters, strong performances, and a unique script that throws out one new twist after another. Credibility of the finale is controversial, but it certainly is memorable in keeping with the film's intricate theme. ***",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"One of the best thrillers I've ever seen, including a story which consists of twists that will amaze you","""The Usual Suspects"" is by far one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. The movie tells about 5 crooks, who are brought together for questioning because of a truck hijack in New York. This is followed by a period of events and eventually they all are left with a mission, which a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze has arranged for them because they all have wronged Soze in certain points of their criminal careers. They have no other choice than do the mission, because they're obviously being blackmailed and also because they just simply have to pay back what they've done in the past. It doesn't go as planned and the whole story is told by one of the crooks, Roger 'Verbal' Kint. What really happened on the job and is there even a man named Keyser Soze?The screenplay's just amazing, the whole plot consists of twists that are just so surprising that it makes you stare at the emptiness leaving you dribbling all over the place like you were being in a some kind of a mental institution. It progresses in a definite flow, leaving you concentrating so much that you don't want to miss one second of the movie itself. It's interesting, it's exciting, it's thrilling and it's just brilliant. The directing compliments the whole screenplay, by being so witty that it feels like you were watching a real live action crime happening, having a very nice cinematography as a backup. Some of the angles and the ways how some things are shot is just so significant for the movie that it's just, like mentioned above, so brilliant.The music isn't beautiful and phenomenal in purpose to make you cry, it's in purpose of giving you a guaranteed entertainment and a thrilling motion picture experience, composed by John Ottman. I mean, the music's just so fitting that it gives you this specific familiar smile on your face which says ""Yeah, awesome, that's how you do it."" Well, you get the point, it's the kind of music you want for a thriller, giving the movie that required thriller edge to it.Despite the amazing screenplay, the things that make this movie so fantastic are the characters and the role performances done by the actors. Taking for example the five crooks, there's the bad ass Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, who I haven't actually seen doing a better role performance than as McManus. Then there's the cold and intelligent Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, who really fits for the role like a strawberry for a pancake. Then there's Fred Fenster, the associate of McManus and the one ""with the looks"", played by Benicio Del Toro, who's always enjoyable, yet usually in a weird role. Then there's Todd Hockney, the explosions expert and the one who just doesn't give a damn about anyone, played by Kevin Pollack, doing one of his best role performances yet to date. And finally, there is Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a cripple man who is in no use for anyone, being irrelevant, wanting to be a better crook, played by Kevin Spacey, who also does one of his best (if not The Best) role performances yet to date. Spacey's just so good that he's the movie's essence. Those are a few characters to name, but there are a whole bunch of others, played by actors who are at their best, making the movie so fantastic in every aspect.All in all ""The Usual Suspects"" is a fantastic film everyone should see. It has some of the best story twists ever written to a motion picture, making you that mental institution patient right till the end titles, where you keep on being that patient until you wake up in the real world realising that the movie's a celebration of fantastic characters and actors, an amazing screenplay and superb directing. Great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""The Usual Suspects"" is not the *Usual* mid-1990s crime-thriller...","I have a strange history with the 1995 neo-noir crime-thriller ""The Usual Suspects.""I saw the film for the first time when I was in middle school; I remember being thoroughly impressed with the picture and I may (or may not) have rented it a few times from Blockbuster Video (I entered middle school in the late 1990s). And then I never really saw it again, but I do remember that ""The Usual Suspects"" always stuck with me, even if 15 years has passed since I last saw it. And then on a whim, I watched the movie again today. My opinion has not changed on this movie at all, but today's viewing has only reaffirmed my glowing praise for this picture.The other reason that this movie stuck with me for so long was because this film made the reputation of its director, a then-29-year-old Bryan Singer. I came to know Bryan Singer through his work on the ""X-Men"" movies - ""X-Men"" (2000) and its superior sequel, ""X2"" (2003). Although I won't go into the details why, I've long been a fan of the X-Men superhero team and I've long believed that Singer - through certain aspects of his personal background - was the perfect director for the first two films in that series and he brought those particular aspects of his personal background to make those films his own. That is something I'll always be thankful to him for, and ""X2"" is my personal favorite film that he's ever done (if not necessarily his best).But still, let's go back to the film that started it all for Bryan Singer...Let me just say that I consider ""The Usual Suspects"" to be the best crime-thriller of the '90s. Yes, I said it, ""The Usual Suspects"" is even better than ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); while I like Quentin Tarantino, I've never truly liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and have considered that to be Tarantino's weakest effort - yet Tarantino won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, so he obviously did something right. I don't think that it's any coincidence that a year after Tarantino won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his script for ""The Usual Suspects,"" which I obviously feel is the better of the two. I've just found ""The Usual Suspects"" to be far more inventive - and watchable - in its story and characters, and complex and involving story-line.""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the most compelling, original, frightening, and (occasionally) blackly humorous thrillers ever made, with one of the greatest, and shocking, plot twists in cinematic history. The film begins in the aftermath of a mysterious ship explosion and firefight in San Pedro Bay in Los Angeles, California. The police arrest cripple and con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance here), who was only one of two survivors. While being interrogated by U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Kint reveals that six weeks earlier in New York City, he and four other small-time criminals - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt ex-cop who's since been trying to go straight; professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin); McManus's partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro); and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker and explosives expert - were arrested and interrogated by the New York City Police Department on trumped-up charges in connection to a gun shipment robbery.Kint goes on to further explain a rich and complicated back-story, in which the five of them enter into a series of complex criminal schemes that eventually brings the attention of a mysterious crime figure named ""Keyser Soze,"" whose criminal exploits and ruthless reputation are so feared that he has earned a near-mythical status in the criminal underworld. It all leads to a shocking revelation of just who it is that's been pulling the five men's strings the whole time - Keyser Soze, or someone else?I have to admit that I loved every moment of ""The Usual Suspects."" This movie definitely earned every bit of praise heaped upon it by the mainstream and independent movie press upon its release in 1995; just as an aside, this film was released into theaters three days after my tenth birthday in 1995. Kevin Spacey earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor here in one of the great performances of the '90s. Though the work of the four principal actors cannot be discounted - Gabriel Byrne is by far the most sympathetic of the quintet as their de-facto, albeit highly reluctant, leader, Dean Keaton; Stephen Baldwin (whom I personally took the greatest liking to) as Michael McManus and this is probably his best-known film role before his career took a hit in the late '90s and early 2000s; Benicio Del Toro as the mangled-English-speaking Fred Fenster, who would go on to become an Oscar-winner himself in just a few short years (for ""Traffic"" in 2000); and Kevin Pollak as the one true common-man of the group, Todd Hockney.Neo-noir crime-thrillers were big in the 1990s after ""Pulp Fiction"" almost single-handedly reinvented the cinematic medium; ""The Usual Suspects,"" with its gripping story and characters, and snappy dialogue, was the next (and arguably) greatest thing to come from that era. It's a brilliant, mesmerizing viewing experience from a film-making team that struck cinematic gold. And how can anyone not mention John Ottman's touching, occasionally brooding and mysterious film score? I just had to mention that also before I finally close this out.""The Usual Suspects"" is certainly not your ""Usual"" mid-1990s thriller...10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"There aren't Several Twists, Only One....","The only reason this movie achieved the status it did was because of the one twist it had. The whole movie is just a buildup for this same twist and that is why once it occurs, it concludes so quickly. It was a cleverely thought out TWIST. The only thing I liked about the movie was how he incorporated the set pieces in the Interrorgation Room to twist the story to suit his purposes. Actually delving into the ""story"" was a waste of time and pointless. I would have felt the same way if the movie was 30 minutes long and he didn't eleaborate on the story the way he did. Wether he went on for 5 hourse or 30 minutes on the actual story makes no difference to the movies climax and conclusion. This is hardly good filmaking, and isn't even great Entertainment, plus it does not have any genius behind it. What it does have is a ""I would have never seen it coming"" climax/twist that most people just wouldn't have figured out because hardly any clues where given in the first place. Does it require second viewing? HELL NO!!! Once the twist is known, there is nothing more to the movie, everything else is just a buildup to this.And I think Kevin Spacey is a very mediocre actor personally. American Beauty was an excellent film, but hardly because of him. Spacey to me, has a pretty emotionless face, and only seemed to portray on screen emotion that was appropriate in the movie K-pax. He certainly did not deserve an Oscar for Usual Suspects as the movie didn't determine any real acting skills whatsoever, I mean, 75% of his time is in an office relating a story, anyone can do this...",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Film!...but the hype is too much.,"I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday. I had no idea of the plot, all that I knew was that it was a ""must see"". After seeing the film I couldn't help but feel a little let down. I really enjoyed the film, but wasn't blown away. I am still attempting to reconstruct where I've seen this plot-line played out before. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and I have a feeling it is from a film from his ""Lady Vanishes"" days. If you are one of the reviewers that would give this film a ""10"", I would suggest you look into more Hitch films. Don't get me wrong, this is a great film. The acting is great, as are the cinematography, and script. However, it just isn't the masterpiece that many claim. I can provide no commentary for any underlying themes or standout scenes.

I used to trust the IMDb ratings (8.7/10 for this movie at the time I write this review) but now I definitely won't judge how good a movie is on the user ratings ever again. Personally, I hate when movie producers think they're so good that they can just throw random incomprehensible stuff to the viewer and we are supposed to just gather all this information for no purpose until the second half of the movie, where you start to understand SOME of the things. Also, as English is not my first language, I couldn't understand the accents of some characters and it was gibberish to me so if you're looking for a movie to improve your English skills, don't choose this one because you won't understand what's going on and eventually get bored.

"A dark, crooked masterpiece worthy of much more than a mere Oscar","Thought I'm only 18 years old, I've watched this movie about 14 times now. And I'm proud to say that this movie has never lost its luster and excitement every time I watch it. The plot itself is a stroke of genius, well-followed by an ending that I can only describe quoting my best friend, who said it was ""a kick in the balls"". A crude way to describe it, but it was very apt; I can still recall how my eyes had first widened when the interrogation was coming to a close but I remember more vividly of how my jaw had hung as if someone loosened every screw in my head when I saw the ending.""The Usual Suspects"" is not only one of the best movies by far, but I think it sets a standard for any criminal-related movie that seems to be ignored a lot of the time. It's a story of power and manipulation, true guts and will and cunning and cleverness - all characteristics of what I believe to be the ""perfect criminal."" And five crooks, all of who have their own very, very distinct personalities, quirks, and stories that you just can't help but admire and laugh with/at simultaneously. Bryan Singer did a very good job with this movie and that includes all the hiccups from the actors that he worked with --- personally, I wouldn't have had it any other way. You get the moments of chuckles and of surprise throughout the movie and times where you can't help but express sympathy for the characters, especially for Dean Keaton (at least for me, anyway).When you watch this movie, keep in mind it is not just for light enjoyment like you'd see from any other 2-3.5 star movie that Hollywood likes to put out these days.

Throughout the whole movie, little details were presented and at the end, they all connected. The cinematography was very well done for the '90's. I have to say that some parts were very confusing because of all of the different characters. It's hard for me to memorize ever character's name in a short period of time. That's why I'll be watching it again. The scene where all of the suspects are brought in is a classic gem. It had me laughing hard.

A Very Memorable Crime Thriller,"Five Suspects, one line up, and a puppet master pulling their strings. The Story is told by Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) while being questioned by the police. The Line up is no coincidence, and the usual suspects are all suspicious, and we, the viewers are deeply confused.The Cast is simply brilliant (Kevin Spacey's first Oscar was well deserved) and no-one's performance is weak. The Direction by Bryan Singer is quite incredible, this is not an easy film to make work, it really is very complicated and the truth is very well guarded.Despite your enjoyment, you will feel confused for much of the time, puzzling over the various plot elements as they intertwine and twist you around, but its all down to the clever direction, there are not many movies out there, like this one.

One of the best crime dramas EVER,"A poll in Entertainment Weekly magazine a couple of years ago listed, among other things, the Top 10 movies to watch over and over. The Usual Suspects came in 2nd, right behind The Shawshank Redemption. And that says it all... this is a movie that can be watched over and over again. Even if you've seen the ending dozens of times, you like to pretend that you're watching it for the first time. It's just that good.The first time I ever saw this movie was on cable in the early part of the evening. I was so floored by the way the movie ended, I went out and rented it, and watched it again that very night. As a veteran film-goer, I can think of no other movie that has affected me like this.I watch this film now and I wonder how this story would have been adapted to film had it been made in the days of B/W. Veteran crime drama actors like Bogart or Cagney could have slipped into these roles like a glove. It's not a stretch to imagine the type of dialogue or the score that was prevalent in crime dramas of the time; this story is a great mystery for any era.The acting in this film is absolutely first-rate. Spacey earns his well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, a character so obviously deeper than the two-dimensional crippled crook that he PRETENDS to be. Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, corrupt, ruthless and possessing a conscience that you need a microscope to see, still manages to SOMEHOW generate sympathy. Steven Baldwin? Who'd've thought that anyone associated with Bio-Dome had such a performance in him? The list goes on... Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palmintieri, and my personal favorite, Pete Postlethwaite as the enigmatic Kobayashi. (Side note: I love that not one person noticed or even commented on the fact that a British lawyer had a Japanese name, but that of course tied into the ending!)The atmosphere of the movie is tense and taut, like a great crime drama should be. The camera work is top-notch, and the score is absolutely perfect. The script is superb, rife with memorable lines and even more memorable characters. (I would have awarded McQuarrie the Oscar just for coming up with the name Keyser Soze; I mean, is that a great name for an omnipresent bad guy or what??)This film is the exception to many rules. Usually, a film dome mostly in flashbacks is lame and predictable... not this one. Films where the bad guy wins, which are rare, usually leave the viewer with a sour taste in their mouth... not this one. (Of course, when 95% of the characters in a movie are bad guys or, at the very least, people of questionable character, it's not hard to root for them! ""Payback"" is another example.)I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, even if they already know how the movie ends. If you've only seen it once, see it again. This is a movie that gets better with multiple viewings, not worse.

A cinematic trick pulled off in high style,"Yes, it's a trick, an elaborate set-up for an ending which is actually not quite an ending.Yet, I find ""The Usual Suspects"" to be enormously entertaining, and I am a very discriminating moviegoer. I am picky to a fault, and have exasperated friends for over thirty years with my instant 2-star reviews of films they thought ""brilliant"" as we emerged from the theatre. But all of us have varied movie tastes, and simply because we have no emotional involvement or interest in a film doesn't make it a bad film or its fans stupid.On my first viewing, I was hooked from the opening bars of the John Ottman score -- I find it impressive that he was also the film's cinematographer. ""The Usual Suspects"" is so well-lit and its look so uncluttered, with a color palette appropriately devoid of almost any primary colors.I could listen to Pete Postlethwhaite read the phone book while watching that dome-like, idiosyncratic face; I find Chazz Palminteri to be perpetually underrated, and wonder what the hell has happened to Kevin Spacey's film career? Sometimes a movie is wildly overpraised on first release; an example that jumps immediately to mind is ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"" in 1966. Four Oscar nominations? Including Best Picture? I mean, come on.And so it may have been for ""The Usual Suspects."" At least Christopher McQuarrie chose to create something a little outré, a script that stands apart from more conventional detective mysteries. The bones of the story may be a Hammett or Chandler retread, but it's the flesh on those bones that have gained ""Suspects"" a legion of fans.For all those reasons and more, I'll continue to enjoy ""The Usual Suspects,"" and revel in introducing the unsuspecting to its not inconsiderable pleasures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A movie that completely takes you by surprise,""" Keaton always said, I don't believe in God but he scares me.  Well I believe in God and the only thing that frightens me is Kaizer Sauze. "" Verbal KintSo is one the coolest lines in the movie.  And it is a line that sums up how this movie is great at playing with your mind and your emotions and takes you on a journey from point A to point B, then C and then Z and all points in between.As the story goes 5 cons are brought together suspiciously in a line up and are eventually thrust into a crime spree together.  But what happens later after their apparent one job is completed, puts all of their lives in danger.  They may have been hired by the mythical "" Kaizer Sauze "" ( who strikes fear in mens hearts just by the mere mention of his name ) to complete one further job where, if they succeed, will be free to divide up 91 million dollars in drug money.  Quite the tempting proposition.  But the story is just one of the elements that make this film work.The men chosen to play the roles of Keaton ( Byrne ) Hockney ( Pollack ) Fenster ( Del Torro ) McManus ( Baldwin ) and Verbal Kint ( Spacey ) were probably done so because they were not major Hollywood players.  Even Kevin Spacey at this time was a B actor at best.  This was before his academy award and before Seven.  And the budget for this film was not that large. But what the casting did by having these actors play the roles of these five men was create excellent characters that are now so familiar to us that I don't believe anyone could have played the roles better.  The energy and charisma that they have together is amazing and watching certain jarring sessions between men is like watching Shakespeare ( if you're into that sort of thing. )Of course the most brilliant thing about the film is how it is summed up at the end and if you do figure it out before they tell you everything, hats off to you.

Simply Amazing,"This film should be 15 years by now but I recently watched it again yesterday evening on TV and the impact was still the same.Simply put, ""The Usual Suspect"" is one of the most amazing films in cinematic history. Few films with such entertainment value that I can compare with TUS include the Shawshank Redempion, the Godfather(without the twist),Gladiator etc.This film is a classic which spawned a lot of mediocre ""twist"" movies such as Basic, Hide & Seek, etc.From the opening scenes of the corpses on a burning boat to the last astonishing scene, the film grabs you and never lets you go.Bryon Singer has never directed such a better movie since and here, he did a masterful job. All the actors gave powerful performances but the outstanding ones were Chazz Palmenteri, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Bryne. Of course, Bryne is one of the most intense and yet underrated actors who would have been my preferred choice as the amnesiac assassin in the Jason Bourne series.I heard Al Pacino turned down the role played by Chazz due to a scheduling conflict. A great loss but Chazz still held his own and gave a wonderful performance.But the person deserves the most credit is the screenplay writer, Christopher McQuarrie.

Summary,"The 1995 movie, Usual Suspects is a suspense thriller that will keep you guessing right up until the very end. This movie starts out with a robbery and a murder in the dead of night on a cargo ship. Special agent Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) is investigating the hijacking of a truck full of guns. The movie follows the interrogations of a group of well known thugs; McManus (Stephen Bladwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Torro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal (Kevin Spacey).The Usual Suspects is suspenseful movies that could be a modern day Hitchcock thriller. Nothing is as it seems as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his accounts of the previous days before the robbery on the cargo ship to special agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Verbal, a week and meager man that seems out of place in the company of the other vicious group of thugs accused of the truck and gun heist gives a detailed story of the time leading up to robbery. Keyser Soze, a mythical character in the movie is a violent, fearless, heartless man that is feared by many even though no one can say what Keyser Soze actually looks like. He is the boogie man that is pulling the strings behind the scenesor is he?This movie uses lighting and shadows to physically pull you into the suspense of each plot twist and turn. The shadows make the movie more suspenseful because it shows you just enough to make you think you know what's going on but enough darkness to make you wonder. It will have you changing your mind every second wondering who is behind the mask of darkness hiding in the shadows.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Kevin Spacey as Supporting Actor?,"I watched this film a few months ago and I was very impressed with Spacey's performance, as always. There is one thing that bothers me though- why was he supporting actor? It is true that he does not do very much in the narrative, which occupies the main core of the film, yet he is the narrator (like Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Leading Actor, and there was a debate about whether it should have been Tim Robbins), and given that he is the latent villain as well, should he not have been nominated as Best Leading Actor? Does anyone agree with me here? I am convinced that if he had been nominated for Best Leading Actor, he would have won the Oscar because his portrayal of the apparently weak yet sophisticated Verbal Kint was very powerful, especially since his role was very difficult to play (harder than his role as Lester Burnham in American Beauty, in my opinion).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.,"This is The Usual Suspects, a mystery crime neo-noir film directed by Bryan Singer who directed the X-Men films and has a good cast like Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite. This movie follows on five usual suspects who are arrested for a trumped up charge on hijacked truck with guns. And wouldn't you know it? A mysterious crime lord who is Turkish named Keyser Söze which I will not give information about that character. One of my favourite scenes from this movie is when those five criminals get arrested they have to say the tagline they've been given called ""Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker."" This is the memorable line in the entire film.Todd Hockney: ""Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.""
Michael McManus: ""Give me the f£$king keys, you f£$king c**ksucker, motherf£$ker...""
Fred Fenster: ""Hand me the keys, you c**ksucker."" Hand me the f£$king keys, you c**ksucker. What the f£$k?""
Dean Keaton: ""Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.""
Verbal Kint: ""Hand me the keys, you f£$king c**ksucker.""The characters what I get into is the one I love is The Usual Suspects and the only one I got into is Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin. Why is that? Well, he's hilariously cocky and smart mouthed and he says the tagline which I really love and I kinda laughed and chuckled at is my favourite line and that is, ""Give me the f£$king keys, you f£$king c**ksucker, motherf£$ker..."" and he does gets a good line. I guess the only factor here is that Kevin Spacey did a great performance as Verbal Kint and yes, he won an Oscar for that and he in the interrogation with Dave Kujan who asks Kint questions about Keyser Söze, the dope on the boat and Dean Keaton. I once watched it just to concentrate on Kevin's performance through the entire film. Well, of course everybody remembers the most is the ending. It really adds a twist that who is the real Keyser Söze and the fact that everyone believed it, it really is Keyser Söze. Okay, now this is an thrill ride experience of The Usual Suspects.

Basically, the last few minutes of the movie are saying to us: ""we tried to dupe you into believing all of this is true, but now you have to go back, watch the whole thing again, and differentiate between realty and a fantasy story as told by a twisted, compulsive-lying, self-perceived genius"".But when you watch the whole thing again, you (at least if you are remotely analytical) realize that the vast majority of the movie up to the last few minutes is the fantasy story as told by the twisted self-perceived genius, and only a small portion is realty. So you come to understand that only the small portion that is reality can be believed and that the entire rest of the movie that is the recollection of the twisted self-perceived genius is most likely a big LIE. But then so many people love this movie that I suppose the vast majority of us enjoy getting duped.But ask yourself this: what would you think if, at the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne woke up next to his wife and said to her ""Honey, you won't believe the dream I just had. It was a dream, wasn't it?"" And she just lay there motionless not saying anything. And you wonder - was it real or was it Memorex?Well, do you get it now? Probably not.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The Usual Suspect,"A classic suspense film, an almost seamless lie, a brilliant deception. The narrative of the film is very successful, and the suspense of appropriately shaking the burden tightly captures the audience's attention from beginning to end. The answer was revealed at the last moment, leaving one stunned and leaving a lasting impression. The moral of the story is also thought-provoking: there is no equal sign between a fierce appearance and great evil. Perhaps cunning lies combined with a pitiful appearance are the standards of the devil. This is a film that never gets tired of, slowly chewing on the hidden connections left by the dialogue and plot, and the brilliance is breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Funny, wicked, scary, and intelligent; a brilliant mystery","This has essentially every thing you want in a crime drama: interesting and fun anti-heroes, a wicked sense of humor, well thought-out plot, and an intriguing atmosphere. The performances are all outstanding. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel gives the appropriate hues of light and dark in every scene. John Ottman's score is a true classic noir piece; brilliant especially compared to his more recent mediocre efforts but I'll save that for another review.Now I have heard a lot of flack over the ending which I will not be cruel enough to give away. (You hear that, MST 3k?) But no matter how many times I see it, it is the proverbial middle finger that everyone claims it to be. I find it wonderfully and mischievously in keeping with what was established previously.That being said, Keyser Soze is one of the best film villains there is primarily because he is a bogeyman. Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to keep him the shadows for most of the picture and even his life story is just hearsay. To me, there is nothing more scarier than what you don't know and understand. How can such an enemy be defeated? This totally raises the stakes. This is pure movie magic right here.It makes me sad that Christopher McQuarrie never really wrote anything else. And as much as I like Singer's superhero movies, the day he decides to make another mystery/drama, I will jump for joy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The best movie I have ever seen, bar none.",A masterpiece of complexity and misdirection.  It takes several viewings to figure how carefully the viewer is led astray.  Beautiful double-take ending.  A perfectly excellent movie.  Best I've ever seen.  17 on a scale of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Absolutely Brilliant.....,"I am a huge fan of the crime movies having watched classics like Reservoir Dogs, Heat, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather Part 1 and 2 and Scarface among others. I must say that The Usual Suspects is not only lives up to the names of these films but it is one the best films in the entire Genre.The plot is about an incident that takes place on a pier in California leaving all criminals dead, with only two survivors, one is an Hungarian who is badly injured and burned and the second person is a Cripple, Verbal Kint. Kint describes the events that led to the incident and what actually happened during it, to the Cops. There is a dangerous crime lord who maybe involved in the center of this incident. That's all I can say about the plot without spoiling.The plot starts out slow but picks up eventually & retains the viewer's interest in what will happen next. There are many many mysterious things which are revealed in the present about the pier incident as Verbal continues to tell the story which will also keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. The plot is rounded off by an absolutely brilliant twist and an awesome ending. The movie also tries its best to swerve the viewer and succeeds very well. The ending is not only brilliant and fantastic but it also leaves a lot of room for interpretations and discussions, which is clearly what the developers had in mind.The dialogue in The Usual Suspects is absolutely brilliant and it also has very funny and memorable scenes and the exchanges between the main characters are always interesting, even the brief heists that are shown have good action. And switching back and forth between past and present is a brilliant method of story telling. The music and sound effects are absolutely spot on and fit scenes naturally.The acting is top notch, Kevin Spacey who gets the majority of the screen time steals the show as Verbal Kint, Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as Dean Keaton, Chazz Palminteri actually fits really well in his role as Kujan and acts excellently, this role was offered to the likes of Christoper Walken & Robert De Niro but they turned it down, but Chazz took such a tough character and played it brilliantly. Peth Postlethwaite is just spot on with his lines and just feels natural as Kobayashi. Out of the other three criminals Stepehan Baldwin is fantastic as MacManus with the screen time he is given, whereas the actors who portrayed Hokeney and Fenster do not stand out compared to the others but they still did a decent job.The Usual Suspects is so entertaining to watch that you will feel like watching it again and again and still have a great time. Several scenes in the movie specially the ending sequence will just give you the chills and make you want to watch them again see how perfect the music, dialogue, the acting, the delivery everything perfectly fit the situation. The film is a masterpiece, and one of the very best in its genre, if you are a fan of crime or thriller, do yourself a favor and watch The Usual Suspects.Overall: 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
My All Time Favorite Film,"I've seen many mixed reviews on 'The Usual Suspects'. Many reviews criticise the film because it is too 'Predictable'. I personally believe this film is one of the least predictable and well scripted films of all time.Upon the first viewing I was left stunned. The plot hit me like a train and left me speechless. I wondered around my house trying to piece together my broken mind. I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone but if you haven't watched this film already I think you are missing out on something beautiful. This film has the ability to confuse you and leave you in utter shock at the end. 'Does the Usual suspects have the best film ending of all time?' ; I think it does. Without a doubt this film has left me in a state that no other film has.Upon the second viewing I was hitting my past self. 'How did I miss that' and 'Its obvious now' kept coming into my mind. The attention to detail in this film is gob-smacking and its possible to watch it multiple times and always realise something new. The camera angles are all thought out and seem to have meaning. This film defiantly deserves its place in the top 250 films of all time.The acting is also some of the best I've seen ; the cast are perfectly chosen for there roles and it all adds to the immersion in the plot that the audience feels. The script is expertly written and each character comes at a contrast to each other character. Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are both amazing actors, and as we all know this is the film that made Kevin Spacey as an actor.All in all if you haven't watched this film watch it, its absolutely amazing. However, if you have watched it , watch it again because I guarantee the second sitting is as good as the first.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great crime classic- fresh, original, and suspenseful","The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies ever made, but you won't know that until the final credits roll. While there are many good films that possess the potential to be great but whose ending diminishes their story and film quality (Chinatown, for example, in this genre), the Usual Suspects is one of those rare ones whose quality and film score actually both elevate due to its ending. All in all, you have a fresh, original, and incredibly unique film that still twenty years later separates itself from all others in its genre.Everybody likes a mystery, and The Usual Suspects easily has one of the best endings of any movie ever. The first time I watched it, I thought it was pretty good but nothing too special, but the ending was so fresh and original that it immediately became one of my favorite movies ever. Rewatching it, you appreciate the story and acting even more, and the ending never fails or disappoints due to the amazing editing and meticulous unveiling of the mystery. For me, this is an easy 10/10 because it's a well made movie that is totally different, original, and nothing was truly made quite like it before it or since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You Haven't Lived If You Never Seen This Movie,"First time when i witched this movie, i could not get up from my seat. The movie had me high and i was unable to move. This is one of the movie's that comes out only once in ten to twenty years. this is about a group of criminals, who gang up to make some money and end up working for a man ""Kaizer Soze"", Who is so dangerous and mysterious that many compare him to the devil.The twist in the movie are incredible. You never see them coming and bam!!! It hits ya. Probably a perfect ending.This movie is a must-must see movie and very well done. And if you haven't seen it. The go and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Usual Suspects,"No wonder Kevin Spacey is so good in crime movies; he's a real-life criminal! He's perfect for the part! No long review for this as I just sort of sat down, turned my brain off, and watched. Loved this one though! The acting is amazing, and the storyline is good. A bit predictable at times, but the action is great, and this is a fun movie to watch; it's just fun, I mean, that's all I can really say! Nothing absolutely exceptional about it besides the fact that I thought I knew the ending but turns out I was completely wrong. NEVER MIND TURNS OUT I WAS RIGHT OH MY GOSH THAT JUS RAISED THE RATING BY.5 STARS!! (Writing during the movie) I enjoyed it! Will definitely be rewatching! Also, Benecio Del Toro The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" Five criminals are pulled in for a bogus police line-up, only for them to be set up to do a job by the feared & infamous keyser soze; they're hatching their own plan. But what is the real truth in Singer's noir masterpiece. Unmissable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
nice,"The usual suspects is a great movie. It doesn't get old. If the audience remembers who Caesar soze is, the effect will be diminished, but this is still the best film of its kind. Kevin spacey isn't famous, and Bryan singer is just starting his acting career, but his directing and acting is top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written suspense films in the history of cinema, and the result is a wonderful film, which I personally prefer",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Amazing,"You know ""the one that got away""? Everybody has one. For most people, that would refer to a failed romance. For your avid fisherman, it would refer to a fish. To law enforcement professionals, what do you think it means?The film begins on a ship in San Pedro Bay. One man, Dean Keaton (played by Gabriel Byrne) is sitting down and informs someone who proffers a generic ""how you doing, Keaton?"" that he can't feel his legs and identifies him as Keyser. Keaton asks the man what time it is and, after answering, the unidentified man shoots him in the head. Said identified man then ignites a trail of gasoline that causes the ship to explode. Cut to a deposition where Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) explains that the events were the ultimate result of a lineup in New York. Dean Keaton (Byrne), a former police officer and a ""white whale"" of sorts for Special Agent Dave Kujan from the U.S Customs Bureau (played by Chazz Palminteri) is arrested in front of potential investors, thwarting his foray into legitimate business. Another criminal, Michael McManus (played by Stephen Baldwin) is arrested in his bed and doesn't bother to open his eyes, let alone stand up or run, when the police break down his door. His partner, Fred Fenster (played by Benicio del Toro) is arrested on the street and does attempt to evade arrest but the attempt itself is rather feeble. Todd Hockney (played by Kevin Pollak) is working on a car in a garage when he is arrested. The police inform him that he is under arrest and Hockney, not very concerned by the presence of the police, reaches under the car for a rag to wipe his face. The police draw their guns, he wipes his face and asks, ""Are you sure you brought enough guys?"" We are then shown the lineup and the interrogations that followed. Back in the present, the boat Keaton was on is destroyed and anyone who was on it is dead, or are they?I love, love, love, this movie. Spacey as Verbal is amazing. This is one of those occasions where I have no problem with the awarding of an Oscar. Baldwin was never this good before and, to my knowledge, hasn't been since. The story requires constant attention and, at the same time, only serves to set up the twist at the end. Palminteri's character is relentless in his pursuit of Keaton and the result of that dogged pursuit is a major moment in American cinematic history. Other critics, among them the late, lamented Roger Ebert, were not fans of this film. While I don't wish to disrespect them, they could not be more wrong. If you haven't seen it, you should. Right now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
