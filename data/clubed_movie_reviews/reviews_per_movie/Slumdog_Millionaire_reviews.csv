The little movie that will wow audiences this year,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A. R. Rahman, with contributions from M. I. A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Must-See,"This is an extraordinary film. From the original concept of the novel on which it is based (Q&A by Vikas Swarup), the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Full Monty) but especially the masterful creation and direction of the film by Danny Boyle. From the opening moments until the final scene, the audience was fully engaged. I was completely lost in the world that Danny Boyle created. This is not a story that has been told and retold, hashed and rehashed. It is fresh and engaging - all at once quickly moving, romantic, violent, culturally insightful, desperate and slightly fantastic. There are some comic elements to the film but to describe it as a ""comedy"" seems inappropriate. The film was shot on location in India, mostly in Mumbai. Slumdog Millionaire is yet another testament to depth and range of Boyle's artistic talent who has directed such diverse films as Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.I saw the film on at the 2008 Telluride Film Festival as a ""sneak preview."" The film was introduced by Boyle who said that the official opening of the film would be the next weekend at the Toronto Film Festival. He also said that there may be some final tweaking of the film prior to Toronto.In the discussion after the film Boyle strongly recommended three Indian made films: Satya, Company and Black Friday. He described each as superb. Boyle also stated that a portion of the Slumdog Millionaire was shot with a Canon EOS still camera, especially around the Taj Mahal, rather than a proper movie camera which creates unwanted attention while filming at popular tourist locations in India.8.2",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the best cinema offered in 2008,"Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.The tale of two brothers' lives is told to us through episodic flashbacks tied to an episode of India's ""Who Wants to be a millionaire?"". At first, the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation to find out whether he is being truthful about some knowledge that might be relevant to the game. As he answers the questions, we discover that this young man's life story might be more interesting than we originally expected.There is an element of freshness in the way the story is presented, as we accompany Jamal through his life odyssey from a young child in the slums to a man who is determined to save those he loves. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium. He knows that the perfect mix of a great story and the respective imagery can provoke unforgettable memories in its audience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good movie, Highly overrated","I FULLY AGREE that it is a good movie, no doubt about it, but it is highly overrated. If u people like this, there are 100s of other Indian Movies that are made much better than this(Both old and NEW). As for Rahman's music, it is GREAT (again no doubt). But this is definitely not his best. Pls go hear ""dil se"" and u'll know what i am talking about! Compare this movie to previous Oscar winners like American beauty, and well, u'll know wat i mean.Verdict : To everyone who has still not seen the film, It's definitely a one time watch. Good music,Good story and Good (kind hearted if i may add) cast and crew. But i request you to watch it with an open mind. And by the way, Mumbai is not just a ""slum area"". :-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A stunning achievement: The best film of the year and one of the most exhilarating film-going experiences,"I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a gritty, realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely, if ever, seen in mainstream movies, a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are rare. They are things of beauty, works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with ""Millions"" (2004), which also, coincidentally, was about a young boy and money; and now with ""Slumdog Millionaire.""This is Boyle's masterpiece - a stunningly original piece of film-making.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film, usually an independent movie, that comes along, takes everyone by surprise, then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (2002), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) - though I did not care much for it - and ""Juno"" (2007) are such films. But, frankly, those films can't hold a candle to ""Slumdog Millionaire.""What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. (And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense!) Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you, either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive, vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG-13. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should never have received an R rating. (This film should be mandatory viewing for young people, especially those in industrialized nations.)Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi, instead, is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime, sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment - and I shan't spoil it for anyone, but you will know it when you see it - that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors, Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasi-father figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal, playing with confidence, bringing a wonderful swagger to his role, as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And, of course, there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast, they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal, Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace, yet none of the cinematic flair - and there is plenty - seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral, genuine crowd-pleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful, knowing you've just seen something very special.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is, without any doubt, one of the ten best films of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Slumdog"" beautifully bridges life in India and Western film","It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine"") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. ""Slumdog"" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
City of God Has One Vital Thing Slumdog Millionaire Does Not,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008 but the hype surrounding it is a bit undeserved. Don't get me wrong, this is at the very least a good movie and is quite a terrific movie 2/3 the way through. What the movie does though in the last 1/3 is make the fatal mistake of turning into a Hollywood or maybe in this case a Bollywood movie. It takes away from that genuine and satisfying feeling.The acting all around was very good particularly from Dev Patel and the small kids. There performance are probably the only thing that is overlooked in this film. Without much of these very good performances the movie would not have been at the level it was at.The directing of Danny Boyle was his best yet. The look of the film was amazing and many screen shots of India were breathtaking. The musical score was very fitting to the style of the movie. It was one of the best scores of 2008. Where this film fell apart was at the writing. Towards the end its withdrew into a standard romance. It was no longer the great and amazing adventure we had witnessed for most of the movie. The complex relations seemed to be over simplified and it does the safe thing to do in the approach of tone but if taken into a drastically different direction could have lead it to be a real classic. Yet instead of ever peaking or sky rocketing to greatness it had plateaued and didn't deliver the way I had hoped it would, this largely in part by the failure of the screenplay.Many people have compared this film to City of God because the film are actually similar in many ways. Yet City of God has something Slumdog Millionaire does not have which is depth and character motivations. These things are vital to these kind of movies being successful. City of God seemed to have a more plausible story because the story was more linear. Events took place as a result of other events. This did not happen in Slumdog Millionaire, the story was more chopped up and too many of the events just seemed to pop up out of no where. Slumdog Millionaire did take a very ambitious approach in the way it was made which is commendable. Is this a 1st rate movie though? The answer to that is no.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Wow, I really wasn't expecting what I saw.....","This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen so far at the Toronto International Film Festival. This film is beautifully filmed as Danny Boyle can do. He is a film master. The acting is magnificent as well. Imagine using 3 children under the age of 7 to tell the early part of the story plot. The film uses past tense, and present tense to tell the whole story, which is also seamless. Filming took place in India as well. Their was a question and answer after the showing of this film at TIFF-Toronto International Film Festival. Please go and see this film. This film is has and exceptional cast, and should be seen in the theaters. It was magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Film That Works Better As An Inspiration Rather Than A Film,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is a movie that's a victim of its marketing . The screenplay is adapted by Simon Beaufoy from a novel by Indian writer Vikas Swarup . These two things should be remembered before watching the film . Beaufoy was the writer of THE FULL MONTY a film that was marketed as a comedy of sorts when in fact it was a rather downbeat gloomy narrative saved only by the upbeat ending . SLUMDOG is the same type of movie except it's even more gloomy , not to mention violent at some points . "" The feel good movie of the year "" ? yes but you'll have to wade through a lot of misery to get thereThe entire subtext revolves around the Hindu philosophy of Karma ie things happen for a reason , even the worst things happen for a reason and it's important to remember this . This is the only thing you should think of before watching the movie . The plot turns are not coincidences because Karma has chosen Jamal Malik for great things but first he must undergo heart breaking soul destroying things that he can never forget . In short this film is easier to respect than to enjoy or even like but the fundamental core of the story is food for the soul . You suffer heart breaking divorce ? Take comfort that in a future part of your life that you're free to live your life the way you want . You have no life , no friends , no future and every day is composed of watching dire movies ? Slag off the films on a website and someone will you give you Roger Ebert's job . Make a film set in Indian slums with subtitles and expect it to go straight to DVD because there's no way no one will watch it or nominate it for awards. Or will they ?Anything is possible screams SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE and anything is . It's not a film that's likable and while Danny Boyle is an exceptional film maker I doubt if this is his masterwork , certainly 28 DAYS LATER and TRAINSPOTTING were better films . But as far as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE goes it's a reminder that the future is unwritten and perhaps maybe destiny has great plans for all of us",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
for all those giving less than stellar reviews...,"Just because part of this movie is un-realistic does not mean that the entire movie needs to be realistic. This movie was absolutely fantastic, spellbinding and I loved it from start to finish. A perfect combination of fiction and non-fiction, that's how I saw it. It wasn't depressingly realistic or completely phony, in my humble opinion it had the perfect balance. It was a 'fairy tale' as many have said with some very grisly realities injected into the 'childhood' portion of the movie. This movie does not claim to be a 'true story' and deliver bogus depictions of factual events, so get over it. This movie was made for the joy of viewers world-wide and I believe that it has accomplished that goal.. A perfect fusion of bolly-Hollywood which should win the Oscar for best movie this year, I feel that aside from Hollywood politics and politically correct biopics made by actors for a sure-fire shot at an Oscar (Milk) that this was the most enjoyable movie of 2008.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"An energetic, stylish and engaging fairytale that has enough about it to cover the main weaknesses it has while you are watching","This film came to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and critical praise and I was looking forward to see it even though the reasons ""why"" it was good seemed a bit vague to me. On one hand it seems to be set in the gritty poverty of India, with descriptions of some very unpleasant scenes but then, on the other hand it was described as being uplifting and the feel-good movie of the year. I was curious how this conflicting information resolves itself within one film without off-balancing it.The overall sweep of the film is very much a rag-to-riches story with love being the real heart of the film even if ""money"" (or a game-show for money) is the narrative driver and essentially it is modern day fairytale. In this regard it is an excellent film because you are engaged throughout, are totally on the side of the main characters and ultimately the viewer would give anything if they could only end the film happily. In this way it is uplifting and (ultimately) a really cheering film that is worth seeing with an audience because it is one of those things that unites an audience with a common feeling of cheer and goodwill. The method of delivery really helps the plot work because it is colourful, frantic and stylish.I really enjoyed the fragmented time structure that uses the re-watching of the Millionaire questions in the police station as a trigger for flashbacks. This means we are gripped by several threads/times rather than it being a straight flow. It is not an amazingly unique device but the manner of it being put together prevents it ever being clumsy or obvious by how it transitions from one time to the other. Speaking of delivery and style, the film is understandably an Oscar contender generally thanks to its upbeat nature (after darker material last year and the current downturn in the world, Oscar probably will look for some feel-good stuff) but the areas I think it stands a great chance are those of cinematography, editing and direction. I say this because visually the film is a treat. It captures the colour of India with great camera work that puts us right in the scene. An example is the early chase through the slum, with a frantic camera, plenty of colour (in terms of palate, places and people) and a great visual style with the sun hitting the camera from above as it moves and other effective devices. With this much movement in the camera throughout the film, the editing is key in making these scenes work and it is excellent throughout  even putting the subtitles in a stylish and arresting fashion which helped sell the use of Hindi but does also match the style of the film more than standard text would have. As director Boyle delivers on all this and his use of music is great as well. It does feel like we have the grit and style of City of God but yet also the warm uplifting story of the very best the ""underdog"" genre can provide.That it achieves this is a testament to how well the film is delivered because it does have to overcome the fact that the majority of the film presents us with a terrible world of poverty and suffering and then gradually pulls the main characters out of it. This is a problem that the delivery covers but ultimately the viewer is left with some fairly harrowing realities that haven't gone away by the end of the film. I totally understand those who love the film unquestioningly but I do agree with those that take pause on this issue and note that it is an aspect of the film that really doesn't stand up in the cold light of day. You see, it is gritty and it is unpleasant and, although not based on a true story, this is a reality in our world and to see so much of it in a film that ultimately leaves you feeling good about life and happy that everything worked out alright is not a mix that sat particularly well with me. It isn't helped by the dance number over the end credits, which involved lots of people and pushed the ""isn't everything great"" idea more than the proper conclusion of the story did. I didn't like this part of the credits for this reason and also it would have been nice to see a film based in India that didn't feel it had to ""do"" Bollywood.The cast mostly play to the ""fairytale"" side of the film more than the grit, although the young children are very impressive in the first sections of the story. Patel took a minute to grow on me but, although not the most charismatic of performers, he is really steady as the underdog who is driven. Kapoor is a great villain, driven by a hate that says a lot about the class system in place. Pinto is stunning and has a much stronger presence than Patel. Khan works the investigation scenes well, which was important as these are where the story is told from. There are no real weak links in the performances  the fairy-tale nature of the tale means everyone has to focus on that side of it but they are still good.The film is not as perfect as you will hear but it is still very good at what it does. It is a wonderfully stylish and slick romantic fairytale that is cheering and uplifting but of course this does give the slight problem that it is a stylish, slick and uplifting film that features horribly real images of cruelty and poverty. It doesn't manage to reconcile this but it is strong enough to make you ignore this for the vast majority of the time, leaving you tense, hopeful and weepy.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This is a very violent film which is guaranteed to move you,"This is a somewhat predictable but lovely film which combines an honest look at poverty in India with one of the best love stories in recent years.Jamal who wants to find his long lost love Latika, goes on a game show called ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". After he's suspected of cheating, he's interrogated and he starts to explain how he knew all the answers.To say that this is expertly shot would be an understatement. It would be nearly impossible for another movie to win ""Best Picture"" over it. Every shot is amazing and not a single one seems worse than the last.The clever structure of the film uses the backstory to explain how he knew each of the answers to show what life is like for much of India's population. Even some of the more disturbing things that go on are detailed very well in the movie.The actors all did a great job. Especially the younger cast which is rather surprising considering that this is their first time acting for many of them. They acted well and I was sold in the first 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the film's strength falters near the end. Blaming plot contrivances on ""fate"" seemed lazy and the happy ending felt a bit hollow to me. But besides this, this is still a powerful and moving film which will entertain you all throughout it.This is a great movie. It has great acting and it was expertly shot.

It's About the Girl,"Young Jamal (Dev Patel) is a contestant on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" How it is it possible that orphaned ""slumdog"" Jamal can answer all the questions so far, when so many others have failed? Sergeant Srinivas (stalwart Saurabh Shukla) would also like to know, in his interrogation of suspected cheat Jamal. I had heard about much of the storyline of Director Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" prior to finally seeing it. The ""Millionaire"" game show plot device initially on the surface seems contrived, as a way for Writer Simon Beaufoy to explore the story of Jamal through a series of riveting and captivating flashbacks.However, about half an hour through the movie I got it: ""It's about the girl."" Perhaps, midway through, there is a scene of movie magic where direction, story, and performance culminate together. Jamal waits for the love of his life Latika (stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto) at the train station. Jamal is distraught thinking Latika has dismissed him. Suddenly, she arrives. She looks up and sees Jamal, and lets out a smile. Not a word is spoken. It's about the girl.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a timeless love story, and the best movie of the year. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" follows the story of Jamal, Latika, and Jamal's older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) from the time they were orphaned children to now. Theirs is a story of tragedy, innocence lost, courage, and love. Danny Boyle is the mesmerizing and poignant storyteller. Simon Beaufoy's screenplay based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup is beautiful and touching. All the actors, who play the lead characters at various stages of their lives, are amazing and authentic. Boyle generates the enrolling spirit throughout ""Slumdog Millionaire""-- the story he tells is passionate and inspiring.Jamal and Salim become orphans as children following a Muslim massacre. They befriend orphaned Latika. Latika is destined to become the love of Jamal's life. They are all taken in by a ruthless group that enslaves children as beggars. Jamal and Salim manage to escape, but lose Latika. Years later Jamal and Salim rescue Latika, but at the cost of Salim's very soul. Salim chooses the dark path, one from which he can not return. Jamal is really now alone. His redemption may lie in ""Millionaire"", but not for the obvious reasons. His is for love and for Latika.Eventually, Jamal reunites with Salim and grown up Latika. Life has not turned out as all had envisioned. At the story arc Jamal confesses to Latika, ""I love you."" She replies, ""It's too late."" She implores Jamal, ""Forget me."" Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are amazing, and the heart and soul of ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Yes, it's about the girl. More to the point: it's about the power of the human spirit, and love. There is tremendous pain and suffering, and at the same time deep compassion, selfless sacrifice, and redemption. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a very special movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Deserved The Oscar For Cinematography,"I thought the best part of this movie was the photography. Check this film out on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity: it's magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! I'm glad it won the Oscar for cinematography. Scene after scene is gorgeous.Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of ""City Of God,"" about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" quiz show, but the host here in this Indian version is no lovable Regis Philbin. You won't like him.Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that.

"An excellent celebration of life, destiny, and the power of love","Walking out of this movie will be the worst part of the experience because you won't want to leave the amazing world of Slumdog Millionaire. Danny Boyle has created a portrait of humanity not seen in a long time. This epic rags to riches story is a testament to the power of love and the truth. With breathtaking cinematography, stupendous acting, and an amazing screenplay from Simon Beaufoy, we are dropped into the mind of Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai. Through his eyes we see the pain of poor orphans, tricks played on various tourists, and the how organized crime has evolved in India's maturing society.

one of the greatest films of all time,"If you were expecting this reviewer to simply say this is a great Indian film, you have come to the wrong review.Whether acknowledged as such or not, one of the greatest films of all time:* perfect script. At the same time a drama, a coming of age story, a story of personal triumph, and oh-wow a love story for the ages* perfect casting and acting. Launched Patel (later seen on House, among others)* direction to die for. After you see it, the strong emotional scenes (the beggar king who removes eyeballs to increase profits) will haunt you. Not to mention the outhouse scene. And the cell phone scene at the end.* the lesser arcs fight for prominence. Even the whispered asides from the TV host have layers of meaning. The cop who goes from torture to philosophy and back again.* restraint beyond belief. (Saved the dance scene for the credits. Imagine how hard that was!)Have seen it several times. It is timeless. It is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"If this film had a flaw, it was that it had to end.","Slumdog Millionaire is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. Not only is it simply sublime overall (which I will get into later) but it overcomes so many hurdles with such grace and ease, it is worthy of even more admiration. Mirroring director Danny Boyle's genre hopping career is Slumdog's story which seamlessly blends romance, comedy, drama, elements of mystery, action and a devastating portrait of the Mumbai slums. Along with this achievement, it is simultaneously rousing and uplifting, while being intimate and true starring unknown actors, yet has achieved mainstream success in spite of itself. And where so many films this year have failed, the ending, Slumdog only becomes more rewarding. Movies like this come along only once in a blue moon, and are something to be cherished, shared and loved.Following his successful excursion into Sci-Fi with Sunshine, Danny Boyle has teamed up with Bollywood director Loveleen Tandan and the duo have crafted a film that echoes Boyle's character intimacy and artistic style while being richly textured with Tandan's complex love and acceptance of her homeland's tragic dogmata. Framing the narrative is some of the best camera work and art direction of the year, impeccably placed original music and a buoyant score. Taking full advantage of their collective skill, the director's have used hand-held cameras to impeccable results, boasting kinetic energy along with a polish and steadiness that only masters could pull off. From this, the shots open up into breathtaking panoramas of the slums; rich, gritty and beautiful but never in a condescending or exploitative way.Who wants to be a millionaire? Want to or not, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is one question away from winning ten million rupees on the Indian version of the widely popular American gameshow. In between episodes, Jamal is whisked away into a police van and interrogated on a suspicion that he is cheating. For how could an uneducated 'slumdog' brought up from poverty make it so far? In custody, Jamal tells the story of how his life's journey along with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and friend and secret love Latika (The stunning Freida Pinto) through tragedy, betrayal and danger had led him to know the answers and how, and truth behind why, he is on the show.The performances of all those involved are nothing short of flawless. From the child stars playing the three leads, to the matured versions, Patel, Mittal and Pinto all should have glowing careers ahead. If this film had a failing, it is that it had to end. For Slumdog Millionaire is such a roar and vibrant celebration of the true nature of the human spirit, and the true cost and meaning of love, it is a film that is both alright to, and effortless to love.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One Question One Experience,"This was a very well thought out movie which deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture in '2008. Based on an impoverished citizen from India who went on to be a contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", the whole plot manufactures a very ironic correlation. It appeared as though any question that the ""slumdog"" was compelled to answer on this show, ultimately became a supercilious reflection of some kind of experience in his precarious life. As the plot thickened, so did the depiction relating to the intensity of oppression and emotional disarray that besieged the ""slumdog"" with regards to his whole dubious environment.This American film, which had a lot of Indian actors and actresses, as well as many Indian producers, wound up being one of the best American films ever made in recent history. The cinematography was sensational, the acting was thoroughly believable, and the directing was emphatically first rate! Any film which wins the Academy Award for best picture in the year it is made, will often times make a concerted effort to purport a unique ideological perspective to the movie audience. I thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was the well deserved recipient of the Academy Award for best film in '2008! I firmly believe this to be true mostly on account of the fact that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" cleverly articulated a pejorative authenticity with it's set of prevailing circumstances!! Anyone who is interested in seeing one of the best films in American history, they should view ""Slumdog Millionaire"" See this movie!! Five stars!! Definitely!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Unadulterated India,"I've watched the movie a few times and loved every bit of it. Unadulterated India, which Indian directors are scared to showcase. Bollywood only likes to show glamorous India, because the other side of India is what 95% of us lives in, and hence would not like to see a movie with the same backdrop. Whats different about this is that it starts of grabbing you in the Gut with almost nauseating imagery and gradually turns it into a ravishing delicacy and leaves you mouth watering for more. A true masterpiece captured with stunning visuals and exhilarating music to match. Definitely one of the 100 films you must see before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An overrated movie....,"Though the movie was commendable in portraying the real India, but the script was all too dreamy to cast any effect on the viewers. It was clearly evident that it is made by foreign guys who only knew one thing about India that it is poor and poor people abuse. Direction was good and so was the camera work. The kids who portrayed the younger version were so brilliant that you won't believe that they are kids. Though the main character was well chosen but I guess the casting people were too busy on the lead that they forgot to take interest on other characters.The script had too many loopholes but I guess the slum-boy turning to millionaire sympathy saved the movie. Overall it is a nice entertainment with some excellent music score by A.R. Rehman, but don't go expecting too much while watching the movie. Overall I will give only 6/10 to this movie with credits to the lead actor, direction, music and excellent camera work and the producers should blame the script writers and poor casting for loosing the magic figure of 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not just one of the best films of the year...One of the best films of all time,"I'm not going to talk about the originality of a gritty subject matter, or a love story, or a coming of age story. The late, great Joseph Campbell once said that we have only a finite pool of human stories to tell, and we continue to retell them throughout the ages. What makes a story truly unique is its telling through the eyes and experiences of particular generations. What I am going to talk about is this particular version of a love story, a slum story, a coming of age story, a story of fate, and a story of perseverance.Jamal Malik: the films hero, is the Indian Oliver Twist: A boy from such tragic and unfortunate circumstances, and yet at the same time so persevering, so pure of heart, you can't help but root for him. His love for an idealized fallen woman, is so chivalrously unwavering, that you cannot help but be overcome with such intense longing for its bittersweet culmination. The characters are so well developed, that the strong performances seem like hooks that immerse the audience deeper into the multi-sensory experience of this film.The genius of this film however, is in the method of its telling. It is an old story retold through the eyes of Jamal Malik and his experiences. The film's most creative points are in its narrative: its use of flashbacks, its editing, the seamless use of montage to mark the passage of time, its use of color and sound, and its ability to use all of these elements to create a dynamic film experience.I will also tell you precisely why this film will go down in history as one of the best ever made. It is an emotionally arresting modern fairy tale, that will obliterate every cynical cell in your body. (believe me I have MORE than my fair share of cynicism.) I find that this film takes you on a journey through tragedy and depravity, and shows you the only solution to enduring the barren landscape of this world. And that solution is through believing firmly in the human connections we make with one another. That despite the tragedies we endure, if we believe in love and those we love whole-heartedly, we can overcome anything. This is a film that shines a light on the parts of our soul that are called upon in hard times; a unifying factor that pervades us all. And THAT my friends, is what makes a GREAT film.Forget film to be what it often is: a tool to convey reality, to convince you of a story's believability. Instead remember that film is merely a medium through which truly beautiful art can be created. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" made a hopeless romantic out of me, and anyone who sees this film will not be able to help themselves but follow suit with me, and the throngs of fans who flock to see this film over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Slum Dogma,"Bless us all, Danny Boyle is in his prime. His ""Sunshine"" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.Here, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by ""Sunshine""s failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.But the cinematic bits are more than enough.Quite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three ""City of God"" types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that ""City of God"" stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two ""personalities.""Here it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.The beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

You cannot possibly miss the opportunity to see this one. It is 100% worth the price of admission. If anybody has seen City of God, this movie moves very similar to that one.

Phenomenal... Absolutely Brilliant,"I'm born and brought up in Bombay, and when I first heard about this movie I was skeptical. I've seen plenty of the local Hindi movies depicting the city in all kinds of ways, be it good or bad. But this is the first film I've seen on my hometown that has really blown me away. As a fairly well off Mumbaikar, I've never really known how life is in the poorer parts of the city, and just how hard it can be. This movie showed me things I never knew about my own home. Anil Kapoor has never been an actor I'm particularly excited about, and I generally avoid his Hindi films. But he played the part of the game show host brilliantly, and I can now say I have respect for him. Another absolutely brilliant performance was from the slum kids playing the roles of young Jamal and young Salim. With an award winning story and script, this movie is easily the best and most moving film I've seen this year. Two thumbs up to a fantastic film that everyone the world over will love for its entertainment and emotional value, and it'll even tell you a thing or two about a mesmerizing city that no homegrown local would know...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
get schooled!!,"Times have changed, love stories are not what they used to be and princes are not either. Once upon a time we would talk about Men with money and a tender heart, nowadays in this globalist world money is more than ever out there (even in this time of crisis). So power and wealth stopped being a Noble feature.Intelligence was once considered the new Nobility, possessing knowledge was considered a virtue, knowledge which can be acquired by anyone at any time. Now things are different, values, pure heart, self respect are virtues that not everyone has access to, and Jamal the star of this tale has them. As Jamal said... it was written, things had to work out at the end, he deserved nothing less.This marvelous movie was made to touch your deepest emotions, to show us how love should be.

"Interesting and compelling,but I don't fully buy it","Jamir(Dev Patel,who should be bracing himself for plenty of work offers here in the states and shortly)has had anything but an easy young life. At eighteen,he's witnessed his mother get killed,his brothers get separated from him and lost contact with a girl who'd become the love of his life AT LEAST twice. He's been beaten,kidnapped,robbed and humiliated in various ways and has had to scrape and scratch for every rupee,pound and rupee as he's made his way to a safe,if perhaps lowly and disrespected ,job at a call center not far from his hometown province in Mumbai.So when he's able to somehow correctly ""guess"" his way through the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" on his way to a fortune(20 million rupees,which I'm guessing would equal about $5 Million American),there is more than a little suspicion and skepticism as to this ""Slumdog""'s conquest of the show.Firstly,I have to say I'm probably far more aligned with those who've reviewed this that were NOT in love with this film,and I'll dispense with my reasons first and thusly: this film's central struggle--the boy Jamir's calm,almost mystic and improbably march toward the grad prize on the game show--taxes my own personal suspension of disbelief to the point of snapping. EVERY single one of the questions has a cosmic ""connection"" to his life to that point,and his completely uncanny ability to divine the answers through that,while it may make for an interesting,compelling and,yes,romantic story,it leaves a less stock-committed viewer(such as myself)gawed in disbelief through much of it. Also,the pacing of this movie moves in such herky-jerky,stop-and-start patterns that unless a viewer is fully invested in it(which I gather many people have been),then one is either going to be agitated,distracted or even drowsy(as I was,I must confess,at one point)trying to keep up with the weaved or blended story lines.It's most principally in those reasons(plus the decidedly cultural disconnect of the sort of larger-then-life Bollywood style film-making,particularly toward the end,which may be more of a problem of my just not being greatly familiar with rather than any real quality inferiority of the show)that I cannot give better than a decent rating of this film.NOw,that having been said,why I cannot give this movie terrible reviews lie mostly in the fact(hinted in the summary line)that the movie,for all its quirks,inconsistencies and challenges to one's suspension of disbelief,STILL manages to possess human stories and conflicts that really are interesting and compelling. I credit the actors,most notably PAtel,Freida Pinto(as the girl of his dreams,a one-time friend),Saurabh Shukla(As the highly skeptical police Sargent,charged with trying to shake down Jamir when the show gets suspicious and calls the authorities in the middle of taping),Ayush Mohammed Ismail(As young Salim,JAmal's friend),Ayush Mahesh Khedekar(As young Jamir),Rubiana Ali(As a younger LAtika)and Anil Kapoor(as the host of the ""Millionaire""show,a both charismatic and yet potentially shady character)as being the ones who give this show the kind of sympathetic qualities that both salvage it for me and has made it such an emotional fan favorite elsewhere.Director DAnny Boyle,one NOT shy about incorporating dense,jarring,gross and all-around-disturbing images to his movies,does the same here,but is able to temper it with more tender,intimate and humane moments to give it the kind of fanciful,romantic spirit that it so desperately needs to make this film have any chance of walking and talking.While I cannot claim to be a fan of this show,I can appreciate the qualities that it brings. I just cannot say this is the best movie of 2008. Worth a look,however,absolutely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A true Fairy tale,"The riveting start, the charming middle and the fairytale ending really does the trick. You will feel really good leaving the cinema hall.There are not many flaws in this movie. The only major flaw would be character development and the emotional factor in the love scenes. Other than that, nothing. Really, nothing !People are saying that this film shows a very negative side of India. But I say that about 28% of India live in this way and we just ignore it. Only the middle class and the ultra rich enjoy India's development fruits and I think the film shows a few hints of it here and there.The plot is not the usual rags to riches story, but if you are an Indian, you would think I have seen many films like this...but this is not one of ""those"" many films.This a fairy tale movie with a realistic touch to it.

I guess you could call it fairy-tale, because it definitely was not realistic...it didn't even really follow the themes of the movie, that greed and money is not what's important.

A Wonderfully Stylistic Love Story,"Danny Boyle has proved himself again and again as one of the most powerful men behind a camera. If Danny comes in contact with a fantastic script, the end result is nothing less than a masterpiece. Slumdog Millionaire is just that, a beautiful blend of visual style and fantastic story.The story is a wonderful puzzle. We follow the troubled life of protagonist Jamal, who is trying to prove that it was fate that he would do so well on a Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", and not that he cheated.The film is told in a series of flashbacks and stories from Jamal's life. The questions on the game show relate to event that he has experienced, which executes the theme fate that is present throughout. ""It is written"". The events are often very tragic, sometimes comical, but always interesting. There is a great deal of tension in this film that keeps you glued to the screen.Often times, telling a story through flashbacks can be disorienting and even take a viewer out of the action. But with Slumdog Millionaire I found myself in a trance; captivated by the events and life of Jamal. I cannot stress enough how beautifully written the script was.Perhaps the most impressive aspect, however, is the beautiful style executed by Boyle and the camera crew. The cinematographer didn't hold back at all, and some of the shots in the film will take your breath away. Important and impressive compositions were frequent in Slumdog (not unlike a Spike Lee film, or something shot by Gregg Toland of Citizen Kane) and really marvelously mixed the modern edgy look with classic camera work.I give this film an 8.5 out of 10. I want to give it a 10, but that might because I'm still sort of 'high' from just recently experiencing it.Go see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An original but far from perfect movie.,"Really, I am an enormous Danny Boyle fan but his most acclaimed movie, which is this one, is one I consider to be one of his weakest and is only one that still works out because of its originally.Danny Boyle is one of the most versatile directors out there. He can do a movie in basically every genre and turn it into something totally unique. This movie however doesn't really fit into one genre. Is it a drama? Is it a crime movie? Is it a romance? It was a bit of all really, which in my opinion was a bit too much for the movie to handle.The idea of the movie itself is good but the approach and execution of it was often slightly lacking. I just didn't always bought into its concept and the movie always gave me a feeling it could had done so much more with its with its main concept, also to make the movie a bit more credible and interesting at times.The movie was trying to do too much different stuff in my opinion. The storytelling techniques and the story lines themselves let this 2 hour long movie feel like a 3 hour long one.And I just don't understand some things about this movie. Why India? Why this main character? And why oh why would a TV program ever literally torture a contestant, just because he happens to know the right answers and why don't they want him to win? As this movie shows, they got more viewers than ever before when he was on and there are over 1.5 billion people living in India, so surely it must had earned them a lot of money and given them a lot of free press.But clearly, this is not a bad movie. I still liked it more than I didn't, which was mostly due to it that this is simply one original and simply a truly one of a kind movie. You can't really compare this movie to anything else, since it's simply at all times doing its own thing, with its visual style and storytelling.I believe that it's actually foremost its visual style that still makes this a truly good watch. It's a fast going movie, which in my opinion goes a bit at the expense of the drama and character developments at times but it does add to the movie its overall style. It strengthens its visual style and lets its dynamic camera-work, work out even better.I also really liked Dev Patel as the main lead. Perhaps he is the most underrated thing about this movie, since I feel he didn't got enough recognition for it at the time.So it's definitely a good and also original watch but still far from a great movie in my book.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Deserving of not a Million but Billion applauses!,"There are movies and there are movies. Some entertain while some are cinematically brilliant but lack mass appeal. And then there are some like 'Slumdog Millionaire' that transcend all barriers and manage to do both.At its very core 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a magnificent love story, which seems like a fairytale, yet it is so damn realistic and believable. We have all dreamt of the perfect romance, the kind which blossoms and gets better over time like wine. Slumdog Millionaire is living that dream on celluloid for two hours. It's about the perseverance of the protagonist, a Mumbai slum kid named Jamal portrayed brilliantly by the two child actors and Dev Patel, to unite with the love of his life  Latika, whom he met, fell in love and was separated from in the direst of circumstances.Filmed entirely in India, it captures the life, the spirit, the greatness and the follies of the nation and its people in a way, which perhaps no other foreign film has been able to. In fact the excellent production values achieved by this US-UK and Indian joint venture is something that will put many popular Indian film-makers to shame. Of course, it goes without saying that this venture would not shine without the A Grade effort of the Indian crew right from the assistant director to the lower level technicians. The soundtrack composed by A.R. Rehman is a major highlight of the movie. His brilliance in this foreign venture stands out proving that Indian artists can match the best of the best in the business. Each of Rahman's composition has the effect of cocaine injected into your blood stream.The British director, Danny Boyle is clearly the captain of the ship. Slumdog has some clear and refined shades of his other highly acclaimed movie  Trainspotting. But here Boyle outdoes that effort by perfectly understanding the essence of this Indian story, bringing out its soul, thereby brilliantly executing it. In fact, Indian film maker Madhur Bhandarkar would do well to learn a lesson or two on how not to stereo-type and play the same record again and again.Coming back to the film, the game show, 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire' hosted by Anil Kapoor is the pivot around which the story revolves. Jamal, a chaiwala in a call center is on the verge of winning the grand prize in this popular show. But how could a chaiwala, a slum boy possibly do that? His euphoria is short lived as he is arrested on suspicion of cheating and interrogated by the police inspector played by Irrfan Khan. The story goes back and forth, with Jamaal revealing his adventurous journey with his elder brother Salim and Latika, the love of his life. The riveting tale starts from the slums of Mumbai. With a glib charm it gives us an engrossing depiction of their turbulent lives which take unanticipated turns time and again. It is commendable how brilliantly plots like the massacre of Muslims and the organized child- begging business are woven into the story. As is often the case to gain audience's sympathy for the characters, the film-makers do not resort to any emotional manipulation even in the most intense scenes. Instead, they establish a strong and resilient central character of Jamal backed up by equally powerful characters of Salim and Latika. Whenever they are in a spot of bother the viewer is rooting for them with all his heart just like in a football match when one supports a minnow against the league champion.Slumdog millionaire will uplift you to a feel good pedestal where you are less cynical and in a more positive life state. That there is a thing called DESTINY will force even the cynic to think about once he watches this. Of course, destiny always doesn't have to be as over the top as shown in Slumdog but it does exist in everybody's life and that the elements of the universe conspire for you to achieve your's.Maybe in that envelope for the 2009 Oscars there is a card where it is written : BEST MOTION PICTURE  Slumdog Millionaire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Slumdog Millionaire takes you through a myriad of emotions. I went from happy, to sad, to angry, and over those again throughout the film. All the actors in the film were brilliant, but in particular Dev Patel and Freida Pinto stole it for me. I found their chemistry very believable and moving. At the very end of the film, several people in the showing i was at cheered.The only slight problem i had with it was what happened when the credits rolled. Had they left the story the way it was, i would have left with a happy smile on my face.

I felt for the main characters right from the beginning. The universality of this movie is perhaps what will make it popular all over the world. I could imagine similar situations back home in Africa, or even here in China.The director was incredible, the music on point, the lighting, and all the visuals were just perfect. It was a delight for the eyes, ears and emotions, I recommend it for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
great movie from Danny Boyle,"This comment may contain spoilers i love this movie. very original and romantic. The way its told very good. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite director. The movie describe India very well. The road, the culture, the people, the way of life. All are very natural. Slum in India is not quite different in the other Asian country. And what makes this movie best. The color the setting the cinematography and the honesty of the main character, Jamal Malik. Why would Jamal Malik so desperately joins this show, called ""want to be a millionaire"" the answer is about to find at the end of the movie. The music is very good too. AR Rahman did the great job on this movie. I hope this movie will win the best picture at the academy award this year",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Kinda not a big deal,"This movie was all right, it wasn't bad but it also wasn't spectacular. I really think that the movie industry needed that one special film to push for awards season and Slumdog was a safe bet. The film wasn't nearly as gritty and dramatic as City of God (and I was told that it would be) and all in all, I expected a little bit more out of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Shallow Grave). There were more than a few plot holes that I guess every movie critic that saw the film decided to ignore (like how the heck does he actually get onto the show?). Also, Sri Lankan rapper M.I.A.'s music is terrible for the film and sounds kind of corny when played in context with some of the scenes. I mean, let's face it: ""Paper Planes"" was old the minute the first screening of the Pineapple Express trailer was finished; and Slumdog Millionaire plays this particular song like three different times in the film. Also, the dance sequence at the end of the film is just plain dumb (I'm guessing its paying tribute to Bollywood films or something); it really takes away from the dramatic punch and tone that the film had been trying to establish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A masterpiece that will keep you glued to your seat!,"To me, this movie out rules any movie I have seen in recent times, like Frost Nixon or Benjamin Button, and I'll tell you why. Boyle created a movie that is a real life situation and blended it flawlessly with the popular game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He made us look at the dangers and the extreme poverty of India, and the poor conditions these people live in. Aside from that, It also shows the hate against the Muslims and the oppression against them for worshiping Allah, in relation to that, the poor infrastructure of India and its currupt officials who let the offenders burn and kill the Muslims alive. What is most genius but sad at the same time is how he actually managed to get the answers on the show, how the host knew on the 10,000,000 question he was going to choose the other given answer than the one he gave him by cheating, that scene was a nail biter! Overall, this movie is about two brothers who fight for their life every day in India and go from place to place, wandering everywhere. Jamal found love and as they grew, a man picked them up and worked as beggars on the streets. They escaped and eventually landed on the Taj Mahal, they settled there for some time, and grew a small fortune. They got kicked out, and then Jamal worked for the millionaire show, he got on it, and was falsely accused of cheating by the host. He won the fortune and found his girlfriend. The end. the people who didn't like this movie are those who didn't get the message and probably don't know a good movie, but this movie will endure generation after generation. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"If there are no schools, where do kids learn?","In obedience to some feeling - a subjective one - I want to embrace Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" because in a medium of much darkness, here is film that sparkles like a halo in the night sky, with images so visible, and so visibly distinct, they replay in your mind long after the screening. Within a few days of seeing most movies I forget most of the individual shots in predilection of the most fruitful, whatever they should be in regards to visuals or sound properties. I saw this movie a week ago, and can recall virtually every scene, but deeper than that, the number of moments within a scene are unforgettable. Yes, if you are familiar with Boyle's filmography you will not think this notion even mildly curious. He is a very good filmmaker, and a show-off. Could he make a straight-in-front-of-you drama like ""The Godfather"" if he was asked? Could he let the actors pull more of the dramatic crux from their talent?If ""Slumdog Millionaire"" were a novel I would describe it as an aureate piece of fiction. The movie, by chance, was actually based on a book and, sinceI have read the work, I am pre-empting myself by saying it does not fall into the same category of this movie. Q and A, by novelist Vikas Swarup, is a great read, and if you love the movie I suggest you take the time to investigate the source material. Unlike the book, which relied heavily on the main character's sorrow at being refused his deserved winnings, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" rallies to a higher level of narrative complexity, aiming most prominently for a tagged-on love interest. Romance in a fairytale is fair game, but not so much when the actual actors are sidelined by the filmmaker. There are hundreds of brilliant shots throughout, more than most cinematic experts will have experienced all year. The harsh reality is that the style weighs outthe substance, especially if you are an Aristotelian disciple. The screenplay exhibits a discomposure that leaves an inertia on the experience, however magical it may have appeared.The best way to understand a person is to tell stories about them. The best way to tell stories is to jump from one tale to another with no method to the process. In ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the stories we learn about the young man at the heart of the picture, Jemal (Dave Patel), are told in the actual sequence of order he lived through them. Every scene of his past is grooved into specific episodes that are related to the series of questions he is asked on the Indian version of a popular television quiz show. The movie ponders Jemal's status as a contestant; a successful contestant no less. Time and time again Jemal comes up the correct answer. How is he doing it all - even when he admits to not knowing an answer for sure, his instinct comes up trumps? Lady-luck is on his side if we accept his word as honesty personified. Maybe he is regurgitating information linked to him through some intricately sophisticated crowd partnership? Is he simply fortunate, or a genius posing as a slumdog? Not every man can be great, but greatness in men can appear from anywhere, including the poverty-stricken slums of Mumbai.Read the full review at my personal website: --http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Over the top, unrealistic and unneeded","I think this movies is doing well just because of the shock value; the revelation of violence/poverty in India to the western world. Now, i would have overlooked this fact(in fact i did, for movies such as city of joy) if the plot of the movie hadn't been so unrealistic and bland.Seeing this movie reminded me of another movie The Color Purple. There is lot of talk in the forum about the movie portraying all African American men as sexists, abusive and mean(not surprisingly most of it comes form African Americans). SM portrays a similar picture of India only way worse. Now, I like hardcore realism as much as anyone and an not denying these things happening in India.The plot of the movie is universal and could have worked in any country or culture. Imagine this movie is directed by a french or Canadian guy and is set in America and the protagonist is an African American woman. Her parents get killed in a race riot in Alabama. She hitches a ride and ends up in the streets of new york where she works as a hooker being beat up by pimps and cops( And all this has to be shown repeatedly in the most gory fashion) She then goes on to the TV show to find her long lost boyfriend. This may very well have worked but It wont be as exotic or have won as many Oscar nominations as seeing it happen to an Indian, Chineese or Thai.Like i said earlier i would have overlooked the Gross ""exploitation of poverty"" if it scored well on other aspect. Now, the plot is very interesting and i was really looking forward to seeing it. But the scenes and the stories behind each of the answers(which should have been the charm of the movie) are exceedingly unrealistic. I cant suspend disbelief and imagine that a blind beggar child in Bombay would know Benjamin Franklin is on a $100 bill, or Salim would know that he was holding a colt revolver, or Jamal would be able to pick up good enough English to pass as a tour guide.Overall i found this movie to be a disappointment except for the music.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Slumdog Millionaire"" Review: A Captivating Tale of Fate and Resilience","Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" released in 2008, is a compelling narrative that intertwines the harsh realities of life in the slums of Mumbai with the hopeful dreams of its protagonist, Jamal Malik. The film follows Jamal, played by Dev Patel, as he navigates the challenges of poverty, love, and destiny while participating in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""Set against the vibrant backdrop of Mumbai's bustling streets and impoverished neighborhoods, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" offers a poignant exploration of resilience and the pursuit of dreams against all odds. The narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks, revealing how Jamal's life experiences-from his tumultuous childhood to his enduring love for Latika (played by Freida Pinto)-have prepared him for each question on the game show.Dev Patel delivers a standout performance as Jamal, capturing the character's determination and vulnerability with sincerity. His portrayal is complemented by the younger actors who depict Jamal's journey through childhood adversity, highlighting the stark contrast between his humble beginnings and his eventual quest for success.The film's direction by Danny Boyle is marked by its kinetic energy and dynamic visual style, which immerses viewers in the vibrant tapestry of Mumbai's streets and slums. Boyle's use of handheld cameras and rapid editing techniques creates a sense of immediacy and urgency, reflecting Jamal's relentless pursuit of answers and his journey towards self-discovery.""Slumdog Millionaire"" also features a richly textured screenplay by Simon Beaufoy, adapted from Vikas Swarup's novel ""Q & A."" The narrative structure seamlessly weaves together Jamal's personal history with the high-stakes drama of the game show, culminating in a climactic finale that is both emotionally resonant and thematically satisfying.The film's soundtrack, composed by A. R. Rahman, adds another layer of depth to the storytelling with its blend of traditional Indian music and contemporary sounds. Rahman's evocative score enhances the emotional impact of key moments, underscoring the film's themes of love, fate, and resilience.""Slumdog Millionaire"" received widespread acclaim upon its release, winning eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Danny Boyle. Its success can be attributed to its powerful storytelling, compelling performances, and vivid portrayal of Mumbai's contrasting landscapes.In conclusion, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a cinematic masterpiece that resonates with audiences on both an emotional and thematic level. Through Jamal Malik's journey from rags to potential riches, the film explores universal themes of hope, destiny, and the enduring power of love amidst adversity. Danny Boyle's direction, Dev Patel's compelling performance, and the film's vibrant depiction of Mumbai combine to create an unforgettable cinematic experience that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"I normally don't watch drama/romance films, but this one was a surprise","""Slumdog Millionaire"" presents a unique story with moments of tension, cleverly weaving Jamal's past with his present. The premise of meaningful attachments to his answers is creative and engaging, showcasing well-crafted character arcs. The storytelling, revisiting Jamal's past after each question, adds depth and reveals how his past shapes his journey on the show. Additionally, the depiction of India offers a powerful backdrop portraying the challenges Jamal faces in his life. However, the somewhat predictable ending (in addition to drama/romances not being my favorite type of movies) contributed to a lack of emotional impact and felt underwhelming. While the cast delivers solid performances, there are no standout portrayals. The over-dramatic editing and artistic style may be a matter of personal preference, but it didn't connect with me. Overall, a distinguishable story that builds up but ultimately fails to have a ""worthy"" conclusion for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Really?,"This movie is not THAT good. In the end it just turns out to be as meaningful as a movie like ""The Notebook"". It tries to reach deep but then retreats to make sure audiences leave with a fuzzy feeling.Why do I choose ""The Notebook"" as a comparison? It is because ""Slumdog"" is simplistic. It doesn't take long to figure out the characters. It makes complicated emotions and lives too simplistic.When I left the movie theater I didn't think ""Man, life is hard for some people in India."" I left thinking, ""OMG! I am so super excited that love conquered"" Well, I guess I didn't think exactly that, but to me this movie did not reach its potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A very clever idea, constructed into a very interesting film.","Slumdog Millionaire was so much better than I expected, after reading mixed reviews in general. The very talented director Danny Boyle directs with a very sharp focus, that made the film as clever and engaging as it was. The film also allows an insight into the fully fleshed-out characters, that we do empathise with, and has very relevant themes presented throughout. The story for the film was a fantastic and very original one, and was beautifully constructed. The script was well crafted, and the excellent performances from all involved brought it across fine. Though I must say, the real star is the city of Mumbai itself, captured perfectly on cameras, thanks to the superb cinematography. My only minor criticism was that I wasn't sure what the dance at the end was all about;apart from that the acting, direction and scripting were all top notch, and made it the wonderful film that it actually is. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
one of Danny Boyle's best!,"When film can uplift someone emotionally by having two characters who should be together, (mostly) want to be together, and who are as the cliché goes ""made"" for each other, and it's done without false sentimentality (different from sentiment, which Slumdog has in spades), it can be one of the best things in movies. Danny Boyle's film is one of those and, like another masterful take on romance from this year (WALL-E), it utilizes cinematic style, urgent and sometimes feverish and joyfully passionate turns with the camera and editing, to take us to incredible heights.In fact, this is very much a Capra-esqe picture, but in a manner that doesn't insult today's intelligence or betray any of the characters' genuine emotional components. Boyle plunges us into the story of Jamal (Dev Patel, as older Jamal, in an outstanding breakthrough performance), who lives a young life in the slums of Mumbai and Bombay and other places, with only his older, mischievous brother Salim, and a girl named Latika. They're the ""Three Musketeers"" of the story, but they go through a series of circumstances and events that pulls them apart, brings them together, and tears them away once more via gangster connections with Salim and Latika's basic imprisonment under the mob or whoever's control.Like in any strong love story, we got to have someone to root for, and Jamal is one that makes us root for him so much along the way (not least of which when he is in the midst of his nail-biter of a shot on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"") because he is a good person, a genuine one, so much so there may be one or two scenes we might wonder if Latika is ""good enough"" for Jamal's overwhelming desire to be with her, to take her away from all the terrible elements of slum life. But ultimately, they're a as pure souls as are, in their own rotten way, the criminals, and even the (eventually) conflicted brother Salim.A lot happens that I could go on more about in Slumdog Millionaire, but it's moot to try and go into the big plot points or even some of the surprising twists. This is just absolute, crystal-clear terrific storytelling by a director who trusts his actors to find the ripe nuggets of truth with the characters- what makes them basic and honest or dishonest- when faced with the various clichés or conventions or a story like this. And on top of having a great cast, and having such a wonderful and varied taste in music (some Indian, some not), and of a deft attention to the plot as it skips from back and forth from the interrogation of Jamal to childhood and back in little flashes, it's also as dazzlingly filmed and executed via cinematography as anything from Boyle's cannon.He's never one to lack appropriate style or to push the envelope just a little further to make his stories so absorbing (Trainspotting and 28 Days Later come to mind as prime examples), but rarely has one seen so much attention to the raw power of the characters and the actors as in here. Even with Millions, also dealing with mostly child actors, Slumdog Millionaire gives Boyle a showcase for his talents as a provocateur with the camera, as a constant experimenter, while making sure we don't lose sight of those he's got in his sights. It's more than just appropriate to use such force as a filmmaker for such a tender and tragic/hopeful story, it's almost required. Boyle reaches up to that and then some: some of the shots in this movie are hard to lose out of your mind (that sudden vision of the blue Hindu child during the massacre is one, but there are countless others), and I for one can't wait to revisit them again.

"A Magnificent Movie That Tells An Extraordinary Tale Of Survival, Courage, Integrity, Redemption and Above All, Love","From start to end, I was mesmerized by 'Slumdog Millionaire'. I love Danny Boyle as a director. I loved his 'Trainspotting', '28 Days Later' and 'A Life Less Ordinary' which are films I can revisit and easily enjoy. Yet, I got much more from 'Slumdog Millionaire' than I expected. It is completely different from anything Boyle has done.The execution may at times very mildly remind one of 'Trainspotting' but this film is a lot more colourful. It stresses on the exoticness and cultural richness of India. The visuals are spectacular as there is plenty of detail and the shots are authentic. Boyle shows an impressive understanding of both life in the slums and streets and the modern Indian culture. I liked how the slums were filmed in a very genuine style rather than the 'pitiful dump inhabited by miserable savagelike people' as seen on the news channels. Boyle really balances the positive and the dark side. Even though little Jamal and Salim were slum-dwellers, they were shown to live a happy life with their mother. He also effectively portrays the harsh reality of life on the streets. The cinematography is fantastic and the editing is slick, while the film moves at a swift and steady pace maintaining the suspense and keeping the viewer engaged. The writing deserves mention as the characters are very well-etched, the dialogues are solid and the story itself is creative and fascinating.I would never have guessed that A.R. Rahman was responsible for the soundtrack. To me, it is entirely different from anything he's done. It boosts of energy. Think of adrenaline. Or think of oxygen supply to the blood. That's what the soundtrack is to the movie. Hope Rahman gets the long deserved international recognition for it.The acting is sublime. The child actors perform naturally and are outstanding, particularly those who play the youngest versions of Jamal, Salim and Latika. Dev Patel is wooden as the older Jamal.Freida Pinto is competent. It has been more than a decade since I've seen Anil Kapoor do any decent acting in any decent movie. Here, he seems to be back on track and delivers one of his best works (although he looks more like a drifter in a suit rather than a quiz-show host). Saurabh Shukla is getting typecast but he's effective and Irfan Khan shines once again.It's hard to define 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Is it a rags to rich story? Perhaps, but becoming rich was never the protagonist's goal. Is it a story of survival? Yes. A Story of love? Yes, the search of a lost love. A Comedy? Yes. Intense drama? Yes. Thriller? Yes...but forget about finding the answer to such questions because 'Slumdog Millionaire' is much more than one could describe in a paragraph. Watch for yourself and see. Many seem to label it as this year's 'Juno' (though I personally find 'Juno' overrated) and compare it to other great examples of cinema. However, I found it to be very much its own film. I would easily call it one of the best movies of recent times. Hope it gets all the acclaim and recognition it deserves. A must see for everybody.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
More excellent work from Danny Boyle,"I just got back from Slumdog Millionaire and I can't think of many bad things to say about it. It's a beautifully paced narrative with superb acting. He got great work from the kids and the casting of the characters as they age is excellent work, allowing you to become very invested in them. The story was engrossing, the photography was stellar, and the exoticness and energy of India jumps off the screen. Boyle's frenetic camera work and India's frenetic pace are a great match. The Bollywood references are great and the final scene as the credits roll is memorable, leaving you with a good aftertaste. It's all backed up with a great soundtrack. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe, you'll gasp... all that good stuff. I had a couple of issues with the ending but not enough to spoil what was otherwise a hell of a ride.

Perhaps the materials are so familiar to me that I don't find the movie surprising or consider it the best. No doubt, it is a good movie that you should not miss.

THAT was entertainment with the art,"It's been a long time since someone from the movie industry created this kind of movie.

Slumdog millionaire delivers the entertainment that no one had seen for a long time in the mainstream movie industry, the artful entertainment.The critics were right, this film employs the beauty of every possible thing that may be done with a camera. The richness of colors gave the horrible slums of India a life that projects the joy of living for those who live life as simple citizens living below the poverty line. A story that pulls you deeply with every passing moment until the climactic ending where every event, every moment of the extraordinary story, culminates to the ultimate joy and success that the film deserves. The beauty of art merged with a flawless narrative and light-hearted humor creates, at last, a film that deserves more than any award for being a joyful depiction of life and a positive force to its viewers. Quite unlike last year's award sweepers, No Country For Old Men, and There will be Blood, and together with 2006's The Departed that delivered a powerful story and cinematic photography but nonetheless dark and depressing in nature. Slumdog Millionaire is a thrilling and joy- provoking success and a non-cheesy romantic story to boot.Watch and experience the beauty of film-making and story-telling at it's finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The little Indie that could this year at the Oscars,"Boyle is back, and in top form. His trademark shots are all there, his excellent transitions, masterful score, and compelling character's that connect to the very end. I'm a fan of Darjeeling Limited and the India aesthetic in general, but this film is relentless in its depiction of the gritty slums that surround it. The unknown cast only adds to the realism, no parallels can be drawn to previous works.I'm not of a fan of spoiling anything in reviews, it peeves me when more often than not I read a review and nearly most of the film is compressed into three paragraphs. I'm not going to do that. I will say that the film is promising and should court some Oscar buzz this year. However, not in the common ""little Indie that could"" fashion, this film goes beyond that.It has so many things going against it here in the States, the usage of south Asian characters, and... well I'll stop there. If the Academy can look past their ignorance, this coming of age tale will surely captivate, if American's can look past the obvious determinants.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Impressive conjuring tricks from Mr Boyle,"In his most mainstream movie to date, director Danny Boyle successfully transfers Trainspotting's renowned raw realism of economic deprivation to bustling, modern day India. Colourful and ingenious, Slumdog Millionaire adds that pure warmth of the child's smile to the kick of a curry made from a moneylender's intestines, well-laced with raw spirit distilled from fermented slum-dwellers. Rich and poor come together in an orgy of excess, bolstered with a love-song whose words you barely decipher but whose tune stays in your heart. Boyle has been reborn in Mumbai.India is a country of inimitable charm. Yet asked to describe what is good, I am usually stuck for words. It's dirty. Corrupt. Unreliable. Disingenuous. It leeches off you like a starving African stealing food at a Band-Aid concert. Oh, and it stinks. Quite literally.Yet, if you lean your weight against the old buildings near the Taj Mahal, something magical can happen. Somehow it is easy to feel your spirit leave the body. It will flow back through thousands of years of rich and vibrant history. Gandharvas and mythical kings. Back in reality, look up at the monkeys as they scamper across parapets, the sun dazzling you, and Hanuman and Lord Krishna echo from past aeons. Or walk through the mess that is modern Mumbai. Suddenly there's the architectural wonder of the railway station. An incongruently colonial splendour bizarrely appearing in the teeming twenty-first century.Slumdog Millionaire uses the Taj Mahal and Mumbai Station as iconic reference points, rising from the dirt and chaos. Like the boy dressed as Rama, who pops up early in the film. Timeless and almost mythological. But conflict simmers broodingly beneath such visual wonder. Muslim versus Hindu. Strong versus weak. And Slumdog versus Millionaire. Something says the twain ne'er shall meet, so when a kid from the slums succeeds on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, everyone is suspicious.On the other hand, unpredictability is the norm in India. The sense of this is so strong it could almost be described as 'spiritual.' Disconcertingly, it is easy to believe that India is a land where miracles could still occur. Even a child of the slums becoming fabulously rich.The freshness with which Boyle paints the country, the punchy editing and charismatic performances, all conspire against our recognising this is a standard against-all-odds story, a standard rags-to-riches, and a standard do-anything-to-get-the-girl. It is standard pulp. But done so well we barely notice. He has put together a film of surprising maturity, and perhaps his first to win general audiences in a big way. It's a film that uses lessons from Boyle's earlier movies  the gross-out shock value of Trainspotting, the lovable rogues of Shallow Grave, the exoticism of The Beach and the bold visual experimentation of 28 Days Later and Sunshine. It repackages them in feelgood form for all but the most delicate of tastes.True, the sight of a young boy diving through an ocean of sewage (with filmstar photo held aloft) recalls the stronger images from Trainspotting. But here it is done for humour and too brief to be offensive. Everything about the film is refreshingly clever and a delight to watch. If occasionally there are subtitles, they are inventively inserted at interesting places on the screen with their own background colours.The plot starts just before the question that lays the golden egg and cuts engagingly back through the boy's life using flashbacks. Why is he being tortured? How did he get on the show? Why doesn't he care about the money? In the background is his love, Latika, whom he has known since childhood. Both orphaned, she saw him by chance (standing abandoned in the rain) and he lets her share a corrugated iron shelter. It's a touching scene without too much sugar. And chance is the theme of the film. How does a Slumdog like Jemal guess the answers to general knowledge questions that could baffle the educated? That's what everybody wants to know.Few Western directors have managed to embrace India so convincingly. Colours become sanitised, dirt becomes exotic. Boyle leaves us in no doubt as to the degradation, but makes it palatable through daring cinematography. This is no work of realism such as that of Satyajit Ray. Apart from a joyful closing credits scene, neither is it Bollywood. And although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I can't help feeling that some critics have gone overboard in estimating it to be more than the sum of its parts. As if Mamma Mia! could become art-house if it only had had one more ancient artefact. The film has nothing very deep to say. It is entertainment, pure and simple. Boyle's hodgepodge talents have been brought together for once in a recipe that any professional chef should be very proud of. It might even be his best film since Trainspotting, but it is heralds no new frontiers. A rounded display of talent that holds its own against the best in the Hollywood tradition. I would hate to think that the future of British film-making is in India, but I'm pleased Danny Boyle has firmly found his wings again. And I was also very pleased to see one of the stars of the outstanding TV series, Skins, conquer the lead role.Slumdog Millionaire is a bag of very colourful tricks. The end result is great entertainment. It would be more remarkable if, in a later film, we were to see these stirring skills used for real comment on the human condition (for instance) and take us off the popcorn ride. When will the real Danny Boyle stand up? Near the Taj Mahal, I once looked down and saw boys pretending to levitate a corpse. They wanted tourists to throw money down to them (with a cut, no doubt, for the boy beneath the stretcher). It was all good fun. But made me wonder when the real fakir would appear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Yes, this is how India was , this is how India is now & this is the movie you would want to see to get into the flesh of Being an Indian.Slumdog Millionaire is the PERFECT Fusion of Hollywood & Bollywood .I'm hoping for Best Picture, Best Director & Best Original Score at Oscars for this Phenomenon, though it could win others , but I feel it faces a stiff competition in both Best Adapted Screenplay & Best Cinematography with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher also seems to be quite in form , Oscars will be very interesting !",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Slumdog Millionaire is a brilliant., genre jumping revelation","Slumdog Millionaire is a genre jumping revelation that comes across as bizarrely plausible when events that seem impossible are contextualised in flashbacks that illustrate the life of our 18 year-old hero Jamal (Dev Patel), an orphan from the slums of Mumbai. Jamal has entered the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" in an effort to contact his lost love Latika (Freida Pinto). Much is made of Jamal's lowly status as a chai wallah (tea boy) at one of Mumbai's many call centres.This underdog status helps him to win the hearts of the viewing audience but arouses suspicion from the show's host, who pulls strings and has Jamal arrested and savagely interrogated when the show breaks at the end of the day's episode. Slumdog Millionaire jumps back and forward in time illustrating the parts of Jamal's life experience that have taught him the information he needed to correctly answer questions on the show. Much kudos must go to the cast and crew for uniformly excellent performances, filmed in often harsh and immensely difficult circumstances. Resourceful and resilient, once orphaned at a young age in a religious uprising, Jamal and his older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) travel widely in their quest for safety and survival. The boy's hair-raising, and often hilarious, exploits on Indian railways and at the Taj Mahal are played out against marvelous scenery. Slumdog Millionaire successfully combines many genres such as history, 'road' trip, crime, coming of age, romance and quiz. All are deftly handled and interwoven in a total package that is hard to fault. Stay through the closing credits and you even get a Bollywood style dance number! Brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Toronto Film Festival has got another big hit,The Toronto Film Festival every year receives some of the best pictures and Slumdog Millionaire was no exception. Slumdog Millionaire was produced on a $15 million budget which speaks a lot for the quality of the film compared to others with bigger costs. What made this film so good was how the story connected. Every question has something to do with his life and the ending which I won't spoil was just perfect. Some would call this movie a chick flick but regardless of whatever genre you consider this it's easily the best movie from 2008. Quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever and if this movie doesn't win best picture at the Oscars then I have lost all faith and that's coming from a big dark knight fan.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Top Movie of the Year by Andrew Malekoff,"This is the best movie of the year. And, there were a number of movies that I really loved this year. Slumdog was a clear and unambiguous cut above everything else in what I consider to be a good year for movies. How do I determine that it was a good year? I saw more movies that I loved or really liked than in a long time.At first I was put off by the pacing that I thought was a bit slow with the movie shifting from present to past. But patience paid off as I gradually got in sync with the pacing and structure of the film. And, it was a big payoff that provided me with an intimate view of an orphaned child's harrowing journey to meet his destiny. The nine actors that played the three key characters during childhood, preadolescence and young adulthood were excellent and believable. The were perfectly cast and played their parts wonderfully.Interestingly, when I saw the trailer weeks before, I thought that Slumdog was an Indian comedy about a poor kid who wins the game show I Want to Be a Millionaire. I immediately had an association to My Big Fat Greek Wedding. And, although I loved that movie, Slumdog is a sprawling epic compared to the hilarious sit-com-Greek-Wedding. Slumdog is much more than I expected. A young man, played flawlessly by Dev Patel, is trying his hand at the Indian version of the game show I Want to be a Millionaire. His motives are fuzzy at first. He is not a typical contestant. We learn that it was his destiny that brought him to compete.We discover how he came to know the answers to the questions (did he cheat?, is he a genius? or, did fate have a hand in his knowledge?). We learn about how close bonds and loyalty among three childhood friends are stretched to painful extremes over time despite dramatically different means that each must use to adapt to the cruel circumstances that they must overcome to survive. Slumdog is a hopeful movie, that underscores the value of resilience, and highlights the many faces and means of loyalty, against the overwhelming odds of poverty and evil; this movie deserves to be honored for its achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good...Yes. Best Picture...No.,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, but it just seemed to unrealistic for me to get over. It's got a lot going for it: great acting, a pretty interesting story, great direction, cool editing (video and sound), great cinematography, etc. It's an academy pleaser, but it's a shame they failed to notice the glaring unrealism in the premise.I'll keep this short, given that everything aside from this point in the movie was very good. I can't help but notice how coincidental the questions were in the show, and that they just so seemingly coincided with memories he remembers. Some of the things he remembers I can understand, like the God Rama, or whatever it was, question, given that it was the day when his mother died. But does he really remember so far back as to giving a poor kid a 100 dollar bill and then the kid tells him that Ben Franklin is on the bill? I don't know about him, but I probably wouldn't remember something as simple as that. Also, the question about who created the revolver still puzzles me. Just because a Colt .45 is named after Samuel Colt does that really mean that he created the revolver? I mean one of the choices names was ....something...... Revolver. I mean that's not a common last name, but if I were to create something, I'd name it after myself, not out of greed, but just so people can know subconsciously that someone with my name created it. Maybe I would just want to be nice to people on game shows, I don't know. Another main one though is how the final question of the show just so happened to be the question he was asking when he was a young kid, and he never learned the answer to, and how the movie simply avoids telling us the answer to this question. Then when Jamal is on the phone with Latika, he seems so sure that she knows the answer. Why? She never gave any reason to imply that. But then she says, ""I don't know, I've never known the answer."" Jamal was the one who asked it a couple times at the beginning of the movie. But the way she forms her words implies that WE were suppose to believe earlier on that she knew who it was but never said. Are you confused? Yeah me too. This is all nitpicking, but that's what I do best in a movie, and when seemingly impossible odds are met and surpassed in a film, it sets me off. The movie's excuse would probably be something like, ""It is written,"" but that's just an excuse for contradicting writing. Anyway, the last thing that I didn't get was why Salim put all his money in the tub, then proceeded to get in the tub of money to die. What this suppose to symbolize something that I missed. If you know the answer, then good for you, but it never made sense to me.Once again, it's not a bad movie, but I will say it is very overrated and did NOT deserve to win Best Picture or some other of the Oscars it won. Worth one watch. If you're big on movie romances, then maybe a couple watches. This movie is no means a masterpiece though, check out 127 Hours; it's by Danny Boyle as well and is far superior in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Danny Boyle takes on the Indian trinity and delivers the year's best picture.,"Slumdog Millionaire is a cinematic typhoon of chaos, corruption, betrayal, chance, and romance. The foul world depicted in this film rivals the violence, the poverty, and the filth of another impoverished world, that of Fernando Meirelles and his magnum opus, City of God.Danny Boyle takes some great risks by making a movie in Hinglish, sans Hollywood stars, with a story revolving around a television game show of all things. But it works. This modern folktale works exquisitely.The cities of India depicted in Slumdog are Boyles's leading characters. Anthony Dod Mantle captures the light, the color, the dirt, and the energy of these antiheroes with an eye that doesn't flinch.Boyle does wonders with his amateur actors and his actors don't fail him. Dev Patel gives a notable performance as Jamel, who is the Indian trinity of pathos being an orphan, a Chai-wallah, and an untouchable. The Academy needs to take proper notice. Jamel's affection for Latika leads him through his odyssey that will go into the canon of great romance films, (Casablanca; The Princess Bride; The Constant Gardner; and The Fountain), where the hero sacrifices his freedom, his life, his honor, and his dignity for his love.Boyle takes the standard boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy flirts with fate in order to get the girl formula and keeps the formula vivid and vital by amongst all things dowsing his protagonists in dirt, crap, and unbridled class prejudice. He does so not out of some kind of masochistic fervor held against his characters but out of deep respect for these spirited souls who will try and triumph at all cost.A warning must be given to those who are squeamish. Beware of several flinch worthy scenes: torture; violence against children; and one infamous crap scene for which I will not waste your time writing about as you probably already know about it.Best Motion Picture of the Year, (***); Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role: Dev Patel; Achievement in Directing: Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan, (***); Adapted Screenplay, Simon Beaufoy, (***); Achievement in Cinematography: Anthony Dod Mantle, (***); Original Score: A.R.

See this movie ..,"I went to see this movie, tonight, with zero information on it other than Danny Boyle was the director. I am a fan of Trainspotting, and absolutely loved 28 Days Later. What I got here was something nothing like either of these movies, but something else, wholly beautiful.From beginning until the very end, I was enthralled in this film. Everything in this movie has a purpose, whether it be to give the characters their human qualities, or to be used for plot later on. Usually with films like this, I have found, you find somewhat of a filler section (which is why I have never been really a fan of these genres) ... but here, here was something very special.I felt with the main character, through everything in his life, and that everything in the entire film is bringing him to the conclusion of this film. I sat and experienced the things he had gone through, and was genuinely moved as it came to conclusion.Beautifully written, shot and acted, I feel I am compelled to tell people the virtues of this movie. It is a classic love story, told in a wonderful way.I know I will be seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Great to watch, Boyle surprised me.","It is a great love story, usually I steer clear of anything trying to do that. Didn't expect from Danny Boyle, but he does like to surprise.

Must see if you're bored with next superhero franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Sometimes, it just works.","I have been to India three times and from my experience, Mumbai is still the craziest place on Earth. The British understand India more so than any other outsider like me. This work of Danny Boyle just reaffirms that fact.I was manipulated by the reviews to catch a free preview in Buffalo(NY) and I was shocked by the huge crowd that showed up. The movie began with a very powerful note- a torture scene. I could tell people sitting next to me were not so fond of it. Then, the ride began. I saw the India that I was very aware of but never had a chance to see deeply. Danny Boyle is a unique storyteller. You never completely realise what you have signed up for and that's just brilliant. The movie gives you a microscope image of poverty in India, besides the glitz of Bollywood and the power of India's growing economy. It shows you a different world within India. The movie is not really about any of that, interestingly.'Who wants to be a millionaire', a mere metaphor as I have seen it before half way through the movie turned out to be the pillar that kept our fears, expectations, confusion, adrenaline, hate, excitement, senses together until alphabets began to roll. The movie ended and there was an applaud for about a minute. People loved it because it was real. People loved it because they saw something far beyond their expectations of a world they didn't know existed. They participated in the quiz and they were right almost every time. Yes, that's important. This movie will be big. You'll see.My only regret is that I can never watch it again for the first time.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Powerful film,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the best ever. The film follows the life and struggles of two brothers. One of the finest aspects of the film is how Boyle and Co. Found a group of young actors to play the roles of the brothers throughout different segments of their lives. So many times this shows the weaknesses of one group of actors or another, but in Slumdog, they do an equally fine job in each segment. Another unwarranted criticism of Slumdog concerns the plausibility of the film. To say that this could never happen would be like saying that no one ever hits the lottery. Sure, the chips rarely fall into place, but it happens none-the-less. How many times have you watched 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' and just happened to know some of the huge dollar answers because of happenstance? It happens all the time. The smallest and least significant moments of our lives can be the most enlightening. You just never know when some piece of information you thought you'd never use will become useful.Jamal Malik perseveres because he's tough. He's been through so much that he's wiser.... smarter than he appears... an education outside of the realm of education. At one point in the film his rough childhood is the only reason he gets an answer right... It was a lesson about trust that he learned a long, long time ago. It marked one of many great moments in this film.Slumdog entertains from start to finish. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film, but that violence is at the very center of the story. This is definitely not a children's film. The line from 'Shawshank Redemption' comes to mind... ""Andy Dufresne crawled through a mile of the most God awful smell and came out clean on the other side"".... That is Slumdog in a nutshell. I loved this movie. They make movies about poverty, violence against children, and religious upheaval in America and England too. Remember that before you try to tear this apart for casting a dark light on Indian culture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A highly exhilarating and emotionally uplifting story,"Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an enthralling dramatic film with ingenious storytelling methods. Similar to The Life of Pi, another highly acclaimed film set in India which also includes Irffan Khan, we are given a story that chronicles the life journey of a young, orphaned Indian boy, one that does so with such a majestic, albeit harsh, realism which makes it a highly appealing experience for any moviegoer.Everything in this film was great - from the brilliant editing and cinematography to the general drive that is kept running by strong acting performances (many by children) and a fantastic narrative-style comprised of flashbacks into the life of our game show contestant, each of those which are cleverly intertwined into the ostensibly random questions presented on the game show. And that is what made this film, for me, so memorable. All of those small, seemingly trivial, details in scenes had this kind of inherent importance associated with it. The story necessitated that each detail be recalled and, in doing so, ensured that each detail have significance.Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2009 and winning 8 of them (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay), this film was both a commercial and critical success. Slumdog Millionaire presents us with an exhilarating, descriptive story that dissects the origins of our protagonist and his time growing up in the impoverished streets of Mumbai. The energy in this film and realism of the slums is almost akin to that of ""City of God"" and the game show premise ensures a full throttle, electrifying pace. Seamlessly mixing intense drama and uplifting action, Slumdog Millionaire, along with its emotionally- charged momentum, is an absolute treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Where is all the rave coming from?,"I'll give you that the story is good as with the acting. The film's colors are probably one of the best I've seen, in an Indian dominated movie.However, have all the critics gone nuts? If you break it down, this is a very simple 2-3 tiered story involving a boy and his search for his love.The movie has put to frame some of the worst places and conditions on our planet and made it barely tolerable for the eyes to watch. The spoken language is English with very heavy Indian accents at times, but that is comprehensible. It is after all an Indian-centric cast and story.What I do find annoying, and not the fault of this movie, is the fact that everyone now tries so hard to make the Muslim's such victims. I mean we don't have to make them bad, but we certainly do not need to put them on the other end of the spectrum.A few odd-balls do not make the whole population bad or good.Growing up in a multicultural mix in Singapore, I've learn to appreciate each culture's good and quirks. I've also learn that the thing about Indian movies are the dances... it is what's unique about them. However, I don't really see a point for them in this day and age. That said, this movie have left only one dance sequence at the end and it is not obstructive. This is the point where people who cannot tolerate this sequence to leave the theatre. Nice touch for an optional dance.The actors are all pretty believable in their acting. Much to my surprise considering their ages. Seems Bollywood has come of age of late. Even the young ones are getting so good. Of course the veterans are important supporting casts, leading the young actors on the screen whenever they pop up. They are of course more natural at acting.I think this movie is worth the ticket you are paying to watch. However, I cannot understand the hype critics give it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Offensive, Depressing movie","I find the movie extremely offensive and racist. It shows Indian culture as bankrupt and evil. There isn't a single good Indian person in that movie.

I have had people ask me if India is like that? You can see comments in you-tube under India's version of Who wants to a millionaire that says ""what corrupt country gets its own contestant beaten up by police""? Mission Accomplished for the British director and his cronies. Do you guys really believe India is such a morally bankrupt society? Did these guys ever see the Indian version of the show before they made the movie? The host is extremely warm and welcoming (not condescending as portrayed in the movie). And why would any audience laugh at those condescending remarks??? And what is so uplifting about this movie? It is extremely violent and depressing. How come the west likes to see only movies that show abject poverty and misery? This movie is made by a westerner for a western audience so that they can feel good about themselves.

One of the greatest movies I have ever seen,"I watched this movie earlier today and boy did it blow me away. Not even five minutes into the movie and already I was hooked in and it never let me go or manage to lose my interest. From start to interest I was captivated by the story of Jamal, the struggles he endured with his brother while growing up in poverty in India, the kindness and ever compassionate heart Jamal has especially towards the love of his life, Lakita to getting onto India's version of Who Wants To Be A Millionare. Hell Jamal was accused of cheating his way through the questions and was tortured for it until the police finally believed him.The story and relationship between Jamal and Lakita is probably my favorite romance love story that I have seen in any movies Ive watched and Im not too big on the romance side of things. It was beautiful, it was tragic, it was believable, it was gripping. These two went through so much adversity together, split apart twice and still....still they manage to find their way back together. Soulmates, anyone? Hell he didnt go on Who Wants To Be A Millionare to be rich. No. He wanted to go on because he knew somehow, someway Latika would be watchingI dont think there was one bad actor or character in this movie in terms of not acting very well. Every single cast member did a great job telling the story of Jamal, his turbulent relationship with his brother Salim who at times comes across like a very cheeky
prick and an asshole but deep down he always cared about his brother, Lakita and so on.This movie at times can be very violent and brutal but for the nature of the story, it is definitely needed because through all the trials and tribulations Jamal gone through by the end he gets everything he could have possibly wanted, Lakita and a whole lot of money to boot. It turns into a very feel good movieBravo to everyone involved. The story is excellent, the visuals, showcasing India, the soundtrack and cinematography.

Much Ado....,"Much has been made of the rather lukewarm reception here in India to Slumdog Millionaire, America's most favorite tale of hope (after Obama) currently. A large section of the West seems to think that this might be the result of a relatively more upbeat Indian population (given the current financial scenario, upbeat can only be a relative term) that does not want to acknowledge the harsh truths behind its own success story. While this may be true for a section of the Indian Diaspora well and truly disconnected with the reality of life down here, it is certainly very far away from the reason why most Indians (and Mumbaikars in particular) can't seem to understand what the fuss is all about.Well, there's nothing to it really. Very simply, it hasn't touched Indian audiences to that degree because we're quite accustomed to watching 'uplifting' and inarguably illogical tales (a slumboy from Mumbai who speaks in chaste English with a Brit accent?) that Bollywood keeps churning out as it endeavors towards its mindless target of producing 200-300 mindless movies every year. While Slumdog may have enough in it to instill 'hope' in Americans, for a people that has to tackle corruption, abysmal governance, politics of hatred, and unbridled competition with a billion of its own kind on a daily basis - not to mention a terrorist attack thrown into this cesspool every month or so - Slumdog can't make the grade for 'uplifting' entertainment.The West often accuses Indians of ignoring or brushing under the carpet the sordid stories of every large and overstuffed metropolitan city in India, with Mumbai being their favorite bashing ground. Well, they're right  we do ignore, because we don't have the luxury to be tourists in our own country, and earning one's daily bread and butter in such a fiercely competitive arena makes us oblivious to any other living thing that walks the earth, except for our near and dear ones. And can you blame us? Does Joshua Bell performing in a Washington subway ring a bell? It's not so different here, just magnified ten times overOne interesting point to note is that while Slumdog Millionaire has been nominated for as many as 10 Oscars, Taare Zameen Par, a sensitive 'Bollywood' film dealing with a middle-class, dyslexic child's struggle to cope with this competition, and widely toasted as the best mainstream offering from the Hindi film Industry in a long while, didn't even receive a nomination in the Best Foreign Language Film Category at the Academy Awards this year. Is it just me here, or is there a certain prejudice towards only one particular 'reality' of India, and ignorance towards other equally harsh realities, simply because the protagonists in them have a brick and mortar house to live in, instead of a shack?Let me clarify here that while it may seem so, I've nothing against the film  I found it to be entertaining and quite worth the watch. Neither do I have anything against the subject or the depiction of life in Mumbai  in fact, I would have found it more memorable had it given some more screen time to the dark undercurrents of the Mumbai underbelly, which were easily the most believable and fascinating parts of the film, greatly assisted by a rousing score from A. R. Rehman. My only grouse is with the perception that the Indians have some kind of a sinister agenda to not allow this film to succeed, because we don't  as the film highlights rather well at the end of the day, it's just a way of life out here, so why the hype?",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Terrbily over-hyped , here's the reason : Good in parts, pathetic in others -","Saw this movie because 1) I am an Indian 2) The then IMDb ranking was a #42 in the Top 250 films ever ! I was like wow... I should catch this.. only to be utterly disappointed at the end. The reasons are very simple.If you're an international audience, i.e anyone not Indian, you would love this movie for it has so much of India in it , the poverty part of Mumbai/India especially and a novel way of explaining a related story of a TV show (Millionaire) so widely popular in the world.The premise is brimming with potential. A slum kid rises above fate to win Kaun Banega Crorepati (Indian version of Millionaire) -- the sets are ditto, as is the background music for the show -- and the love of his life. He is helped by destiny, as each of the questions on the quiz show is linked to an event in his life. Wow.On the other hand, if you're an Indian, 9 out of 10 chances that you would agree with the following :The execution falls very flat because of two basic flaws: The language barrier, and a wishy washy Bollywood story line. Read on.We flashback to the slum kid as a child diving into potty -- isn't once enough, given that Boyle's gritty and edgy Trainspotting featured such a nauseating scene too? -- to get Amitabh Bachchan's autograph. For all the Amitabh-crazed fans, maybe the mega-star does oblige children caked in excreta; be sure to try it the next time .And then, the kids (who deliver heart-warming performances, faring way better than those who play their adult avatars) and his brother speak in Hindi, and suddenly when they turn adolescent they start talking in flawless English. Huh? Well that's because the film is meant for a world audience, and you can't have an entire film in subtitles, you might say. Fine, but then why do the police officers have to speak 'Indian' English and why does the 'slumdog' have an accent? And no, a semi-literate office help in a call center does not develop an accent.In fact, a lot of the 'how he knows the answers' flashbacks are too contrived. Sample this, Jamal knows Samuel Colt invented the revolver because Salim got a gun -- it is never explained how -- and shot dead the vile man who heads the beggars' racket. In my hometown, the pistol goes by monikers like 'machine' in the netherworld; I doubt the average under-aged Mumbai underworld operative knows a Colt 45, or Samuel Colt. The first gun is usually what is called a 'country' revolver.And then there is the stereotyped, half-baked, black and white characterization, almost bar none. For example, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor ), the KBC host, is the typical villain who taunts the chai-wallah on his show; and the audience joins in with jeering laughter. Agreed, slum children get life's rawest deal, but not on live television. What is the director thinking ? No REALLY ! It is also not explained just why Prem goes after Jamal with such malice, beyond a muttered 'It's my show'.I can go on and on -- like point out that call centers serving customers in Scotland don't keep telephone directories of Indian cities accessible at the click of a button, and that mobile phones are not listed in telephone directories yet (that's how Jamal finds his brother again) -- but the point is that Slumdog Millionaire is miles short of what I had expected it to be.The really key events, the struggles of survival, are glossed over, and instead we get montage (albeit beautiful) shots hurrying towards a climax that leaves you untouched. A R Rahman's music is good, but not the master's best. But then, maybe on second hearing it will grow on you.I have no problems with the 'West' taking up themes of poverty and highlighting the real India. I can completely understand a foreigner being obsessed with the filth and the poverty -- I too was stunned by the plight of the homeless in New York -- of India. I thought Slumdog is brilliantly shot, and I am willing to forgive Ram dressed as a mix between Shiva and Krishna in a foreign film.But I do have a problem with a story that pretends to be real when in reality it is just a mas-ala film -- the kind we churn out by the dozens in Bollywood.Yes, Slumdog Millionaire is just superficial fluff, mainly because of its gaping plot holes. It should have been much better researched, and they really should have stuck to one language.Maybe the makers -- and half the world, apparently -- believe they have married Bollywood escapism with Western sensibilities, but it is not a match made in cinema heaven.

The best movies about a country don't have to be the ones made in that country. It helps, but the only people who would believe it to be a necessity are hardcore jingoistic patriots, a group with which I've had to many negative experiences to care about their opinions.Many of the best movies made about the fifties were not made during the fifties, as people were unwilling to show an objective view of what their lives were like during that decade. Likewise, many of the best movies made about country X or Y were made outside the country, both because foreign filmmakers are more skillful and because other countries can more openly dissect another without worrying about too many layers of politics. Personally, I would love to see a no frills British film about my country. Outsiders do have objectivity on their side.And this is a good portrait on India. It is decidedly not an Indian film, but it has no trouble diving into the issues of religion, poverty, change, and violence which cover the country. Some of my favorite films are the ones which educate without going out of their way to be educational. This movie fits the bill.It is long but it never feels like a drag. It is a sprawling epic that goes across the decades and entire regions of what is one of the most complex countries in the world. It is a visually striking film, one that unblinkingly shows heaps of trash and filth and even kids being intentionally harmed to make them more effective beggars.It never lets itself get too dark because people naturally don't let life get too dark. We are balanced creatures, always wanting to find light in dark and dark in light. There are too many people who live in dark cynicism or forced cheer and don't realize that. This movie doesn't let you forget it.And it is this balance and the feeling of realism that comes from it that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a helping hand from a tight but unrestrained script, of course. When I'm searching through my memory banks, I often come across an image or clip that makes me question where it came from. Often, I realize, ""Oh, yeah, that's from Slumdog Millionaire."" It made a distinct impression on me. The unusual frame work of the gameshow is less a gimmick and more a golden road into a kingdom.The acting is superb. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the lead actor would have become a star if he hadn't ruined his career by starring in the disgusting adaptation of my favorite cartoon. I feel for him.There is no question in my mind that this film deserves the boatload of Oscars it got. If I were to make a list of the five top films of the 2000s in terms of pure greatness, this would likely be on it.There is a scene in the late second act of the film that has stuck with me. Two of the main characters are sitting atop a building in construction, watching their old slums be turned into high rises. It is a complex moment, one that feels completely earned. And it is a moment that encapsulates the experience if watching this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A very good, imaginative film that also depicts India truthfully","This is an imaginative film that uses the much beaten flashback technique in an unusual way -- as part of a TV competition. The direction is first rate and clearly deserves the Oscar that it got. The acting is also very good, the youngest Jamal and Salim emerging as absolute gems. Main actor Dev Patel is excellent if a bit static at times, seeming constantly puzzled by events around him (then again, had I won 20 million rupees I'd probably look puzzled too! And with a beauty like that to share it with...) The photography is of a very high caliber indeed and it helps convey an image of India that reflects its physical beauty but also reveals many of its shortcomings, especially from a human standpoint.The film laudably does not shy away from depicting the ways children are used, including maiming them so they are more valuable as potential beggars. I was not so sure about the brothers symbolizing the division between Muslims and Hindus but all credit to the film for raising it.Slumdog Millionaire boasts some sound action sequences -- the one involving Salim killing Maman is particularly well done if hard to swallow -- and, in contrast, some fine comic relief moments that help make it a riveting flick throughout. I saw some reviews that compared it to ""City of Angels"" - Cidade de Deus -, in some cases calling it a copy of that Brazilian film. In truth, I think the point of contact between the two films is that they happen in the slums of their respective cities, otherwise they differ, principally in terms of character building and narrative technique.Ultimately, I felt I had watched an engrossing and intelligent film that provided an exciting example of globalization and cooperation across cultural boundaries and which might well serve as a blueprint for the future of movie-making.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Unique and beautiful; more dark and gritty than ""feel-good""","Boyle's previous films are all fast-paced and energetic, and Slumdog Millionaire is an incredibly, frantically energetic film. From its opening interrogation scene, the film grabs a hold and never lets go. The exceptionally potent screenplay by Simon Beaufoy creates profuse quantities of tension and excitement, combining three parallel story lines  the interrogation following the game show, all of the events in the protagonist's life leading up to the game show, and the game show itself  and bounding between them frequently, constructing a fragmented chronology that only steps up the tension. Combine that with the natural tension of a trivia game show such as ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"", and we end up with an irresistible brisk, energetic film.Boyle goes all-out with his cinematography; Anthony Dod Mantle combines a wondrous, exciting amalgamation of angles, focal lengths, camera movements (mainly hand-held), wide lenses and lighting set-ups to showcase and emphasize the natural energy and liveliness of the Mumbai slums where the film takes place. In fact, all of the technical elements of the film come together to create an astonishing palette of life and atmosphere, from the naturalistic costume and set design to the delightfully eclectic musical score by A.R. Rahman featuring a modernistic combination of pop songs, electronica and traditional Indian music. Getting all of these elements to come together and complement one another is a difficult enough task; but with the on-location shoot in the slums of Mumbai and other Indian shooting locations, Boyle's task is made even more difficult. It is an incredible directorial feat to undertake, and that's before counting in the local, non-actor, child cast members who deliver their lines in Hindu, when Boyle himself is English and doesn't speak English. The language barrier is broken and Boyle coaxes out of his cast members, both local and internationally known, wonderful and subtle performances that further reinforces his directorial achievement.Many people have been hailing it as ""this year's Little Miss Sunshine and Juno"", the ""little, feel-good indie film that could"", but Slumdog Millionaire reminded me mostly of the 2002 Fernando Meirelles-directed Brazilian film, City of God. Both films are substantially darker and grittier than any American feel-good indie comedic-drama, and both create a gloomy, coarse portrait of the hardships of local life in the slums, City of God portraying the slums of Rio de Janiero, and Slumdog Millionaire focusing on the slums of Mumbai. It's a daily struggle to survive, and people live in the harshest of conditions; but while the exoticness and apparent difficulty of these lifestyles may throw the average viewer off, the incredible thing is that the people who live in these places aren't only used to them, but seem to embrace them and find the good in situations that seem to the average viewer impossible to live in. Going further, both City of God and Slumdog Millionaire feature two characters whose maturity develops in parallel, with one going down the straight path while the other gets desperately involved in a life of crime, the only outlet for many in the slums. In the former film, these are two childhood friends; in the latter, brothers.That said, there is one significant point in which the films differ: While Slumdog Millionaire frames its story and characters with a melodramatic plot of hopelessly epic romantic love that transcends the ages, City of God portrays its characters and story with a far more realistic approach. The love story on display in Slumdog Millionaire is romantic and feel-good, but it lacks that realistic, naturalistic punch that City of God carries with it, and ends up preventing the film from reaching the true greatness of its Brazilian counterpart.Many have been hailing Slumdog Millionaire as the ""feel-good film of the year"". But in fact, it is far from it: While its final message may be heartwarming and uplifting, most of the film shows us a dark, gritty portrayal of people in our modern world living in the most difficult of circumstances. The exotic depiction of the ""real India"" as it is referred to in the film is unique and beautiful; frightening and magical; energetic and lively while at the same time shocking and mesmerizing. Boyle gives this depiction an unprecedentedly skillful portrayal, featuring energetic cinematography and featuring wonderful performances from a very diverse cast, many of whom are local non-actors delivering lines in Hindu. And screenwriter Simon Beaufoy has framed this depiction with a wonderful story of a young slumdog winning the grand prize while playing on the ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" television game show program, his knowledge of the answers to the questions deriving from his various, colourful experiences as a young man growing up in the harshest circumstances Mumbai has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I may be the solitary voice of disapproval.,"The film is a victim of all the hype attached to it. For whatever reason enough people saw something special in it and a ground swell of enthusiasm propelled this film into hysterical popularity. Unfortunately there isn't enough substance to warrant the praise.Gratuitous choppy editing, endless nausea-inducing skewed camera angles (the thing I hated most about the whole mess) and a rather too contrived plot are combined to produce only mildly entertaining results.The performances by the young actors were uniformly stellar and that is where the praise should be directed.Finally, where there's smoke - there's fire. For all Boyle's glib explanations of how well the kids were taken care of and how well paid they were the truth is they received far, far less than they should have based on their contribution. I'm surprised the movie-going public let the filmmakers get away with this.It's great that their education is supposedly assured but considering the extraordinary success of the film and the wealth generated for the fat-cats in Hollywood and London these kids' lives NOW could have and should have been transformed. How on earth could they have been allowed to return to the slums most of them came from?

Three Musketeers from the slums of Mumbai,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, ""the third musketeer"", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material.

A true winner,"After the rather disastrous response to The Beach (which wasn't completely unjustified), genre-hopping director Danny Boyle declared he works best at home, in the UK. How ironic, then, that his best film since Trainspotting - which was released in 1996 - is set in the low-life areas of Mumbai (better known to foreigners as Bombay), India. Then again, Slumdog Millionaire remains an eminently British production since, alongside Boyle, producer Christian Colson (The Descent), writer Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) and star Dev Patel (Skins) were all born and raised in good old England.The director's versatility pushes itself to the limit, considering the story revolves around the famous TV quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the opening title card informs us, a certain Jamal Malik (Patel), is one question short of winning the top prize. How did he do it? The show's sleazy host (Anil Kapoor) is convinced the boy cheated and calls the police, who arrest Jamal as soon as he leaves the studio (the final question will be answered the next day). He is questioned/tortured all night, simply because no one believes an uneducated ""slumdog"" can be that smart or lucky (and let's not forget the host tried to set him up at one point). Jamal chooses to tell his story, revealing that the clues to the answers are all hidden in the key events of his brief, tragic life.At this point, the film follows a flashback-based structure: as every question of the quiz is displayed on the screen, Jamal recalls a specific incident that contributed to his current status. We are thus enabled to see the various tricks he and his older brother Salim used to earn money when they were kids, the religious persecution that led to the death of their mother, the multiple challenges in the form of local criminal gangs and, most of all, his pure, honest love for a girl named Latika (played by Freida Pinto in the present day sections). All these elements are connected. Or, as Jamal says: ""Maybe it is written."".Shot with gritty realism on the real streets of Mumbai, the film reeks of hand-held energy and comes off as Boyle's most dynamic and vital movie in a long time. There's a certain similarity between Jamal getting by on the sidewalks and Mark Renton escaping from the police at the beginning of Trainspotting, and Boyle bravely acknowledges the connection by openly inserting a homage to his cult masterpiece's legendary toilet dive scene (the Slumdog Millionaire version takes the concept quite literally). He never looks away when things get ugly, but fundamentally this remains his most uplifting picture to date, so beautiful and touching it almost feels strange to know he nearly turned down the project, based solely on his lack of enthusiasm - to put it mildly - for the quiz aspect of the premise.The truth is, of course, a whole other thing: the game element is merely a MacGuffin, an abstract factor that serves only one purpose, namely starting the story and thus leaving room for the extraordinary circumstances under which Jamal, Salim, Latika and dozens of other children had to (and still have to) survive. In the end, no one really cares whether Jamal will win the top prize or not (although Boyle deserves credit for making the quiz sequences even more suspenseful than they are in real life); what matters is his story, the human story, the one everyone can relate to on some level.Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who against all odds (given his rather dark back catalogue) delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Calling him a millionaire is a tad inappropriate (the film was made on a shoestring budget), but thanks to this amazing story, Danny Boyle is a real winner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Sir Richard Attenborough, a British man made a good film in 1982","I am writing this comment as a Russian person who regularly travels to India,Eurupe and USA.So I know the tastes of people from all these regions.My vote for this film is a big zero out of ten.The reason why I am giving it a zero is simple.This piece of madness is an attempt to denigrate the dignity of India and Indian people especially slums. Indian people are very tolerant and they are known for their artistic tastes.No one in India protested when Sir Richard Attenborough made a classic film called ""Gandhi"" in 1982.That was a film made by a British film.Many people in the world still admire that film for the vivid and honest description of India.Danny Boyle is also an Englishman and even this film's writer Simon Beaufoy is an English but it is a shame they way they have twisted facts to show India in a very bad light.They have completely mutilated the original material which is present in Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup's book Q and A.Since a score of zero is not available,I am giving it a one our of ten as it is a really awful movie.Let me also state why this film is being liked by people in US,UK and elsewhere.Slumdog has come out at a time when Hollywood has almost run out of ideas and India is a big market for American and British products.So this movie is just a tool for Americans and Britishers to put India in a bad light to impose their ideas on Indian audience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A movie which makes everyone thank God for what they have not gone through,"There are so many comments about the movie so in this review i will not concentrate on the story line. Let's focus about some outcomes of the movie. How would I rate the movie, I will give it a 10 out of 10.For a movie watcher who has not seen how India is, this movie will give a bad impression about Indian living standards. In general, if you are watching a movie you would like something unusual, totally bizarre from day to day life. That's how movies based on Aliens, Wars, Animals of lost age, mutations become popular. May it be Steven Spielberg or Danny Boyle, they know this. Slumdog millionaire shows the worst part of Indian slums. Though this may create a misleading impression about India, One should know that this movie is an extreme scenario .people who have visited India know how full of life India is. India is a melting pot of different cultures and offers rich tradition.Some reviewers have rated the movie down as they think the India portrayal is unjustified. I came across many angry comments from some NRI's in many forums. Some comments also say that India is been viewed as a place where there are just few bunch of call centers and slums. Well if people are so much concerned may be its time they share some profits and try improve things in these slums. Just 5 richest Indian businessmen contribute to a net worth of $200 billion dollar. If some of these Indian businessmen, politicians, Bollywood crew were kind enough things would have been better. Coming to the call centres issue India has many other industries including manufacturing, IT, R&D among others. Having said that I have a concern. In this movie most of the Indian characters are shown as selfish, corrupt and sadistic. Not just that in a scene an American tourist guy say ""this the real America Son"",and hands over a 100$ note, was this needed? I don't think Danny is capable enough to judge a country, the movie is customized for western audience.Frieda Pinto(Latika) and Dev Patel(Jamal) have done well but the credit should go to all child actors who did justice to their roles and captivated the audience. Recently the BAFTA announced best supporting actress for Freida, I am not the one to decide whose the best but those kids deserve more than her(no Crab syndrome here). Thanks to Director Danny Boyle who placed the money to be paid to the 3 lead child actors in a trust that is to be released to them upon their completion of grade school at 16 years of age. The production company has set up for an auto-rickshaw driver to take the kids to school everyday until they are 16 years old. Since this movie is a great success I hope the movie crew will do more for these kids and their slums.Coming to the background score as many have pointed out the movie is outstanding due to its music. AR Rehman as usual has given his best. For those who don't know much about ARR, he is a legend. From past 16 years he has contributed so much to music that he deserves a Academy Honorary Award. Just listen to his scores from Roja,Dil se, Bombay, Lagaan, Yuva ..... the list goes on and on. I hope he gets an Oscar. 16 years ago Rahman got an entry to Tamil/Hindi industry through Roja. His work in Slumdog millionaire will get him more projects and I am sure awards will just flow.Very soon he will top the list of all time best selling music artists.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
No Top 250 material.,"Overly sentimental, anything but credible and ridiculously over-hyped, this petty excuse of a movie managed to reel in a multitude of Oscars. I have to admit I wasn't exactly bored while watching it, but a second viewing just isn't going to happen.The storyline's a wash - to name just one inconsistency, as Salman Rushdie pointed out: from Bombay to the Taj Mahal by jumping a train? Really? -, the actors don't bring anything truly endearing or sympathetic to their characters, and the 'award-winning' music is more often a nuisance than an extra to the whole movie-going experience. Don't get me wrong: I love M.I.A., for instance, but for the biggest part it just didn't work for me.In fact, the only virtues of this film are the often astonishing landscapes, the energetic, yet dynamic camera work and the rhythmic, punctual direction. But you simply cannot make a good movie out of those three elements - except if you wanna go all 'Koyaanisqatsi', which I love. But they didn't.Hence: six out of ten.P.S.: To be completely honest, I would probably rate this a seven, seven and a half tops if it weren't for the suffocating hype surrounding the film, but I feel like bringing the overall score down a notch in my own humble way, because 'Slumdog' simply doesn't deserve such a high rating. I mean: Top 250? No.Let's just wait and see who will remember this film in three to five years' time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Truly this film is world's first globalised masterpiece.,"I really enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with an occasional feel good, happy ending to a movie, especially a movie which is fairly well written n has a good story. Slumdog Millionaire is one of those rare films that comes along every once in a while that is simply breathtaking. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film. But a true feel good in the end. Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Best direction by Danny Boyle. Slumdog Millionaire is much better than City of God. The message of grit and hope the movie carries has resonated with the people world over. It gives them the hope that not all is lost, things will become OK if you hang in there. Luck would favor you if you tread the straight path with perseverance. ""Jamal, son is it you? You have my blessings, go win it all"". That poor lady's wishes n prayers really came true.Professional actors always look like they are acting - its just that we get used to it. The people in this film for the most part are not professional actors, especially the kids, but they acted very well. Truly this film is the ""world's first globalised masterpiece"". One of the reasons why this is a feel-good film for me because one cannot help but along the way, rooting for Jamal to succeed. From every point of view, acting, direction, cinematography, music to any little detail of the film you name it, has been worked on almost to perfection, to create refreshing tale of love, betrayal, crime and Destiny.

It is impressive as this film obtains to captivate, great love that Jamal feels for Latika is impressive and shows in that never we must give up the people who really we like, and above all orders a great message, that the essences of the life is without a doubt the love, the courage and the friendship.

Must Watch...Brilliant Screenplay and Editing...,"Jamal (Dev Patel) is an orphan from the slums of Mumbai. He gets to attend the game show 'who wants to be a millionaire' when he is 18. Surprisingly he starts giving the right answers till he gets into the final round. And all these questions have relevance to certain incidents happened in his life. The game show host and cops suspect that Jamal cheated in the show. The rest of the story is all about how he proves his innocence and wins his lady love that's been playing hide and seek with him since his childhood.The kids who did the roles of Salim, Jamal and Latika are adorable. They are the best in the film than the main leads. Among the notable Indian actors, Saurabh Shukla is the best. Ankur Vikal is excellent. Anil Kapoor is pretty natural as a wicked and biased host of the game show. After some point of time, we start hating him. Dev Patel is adequate. Irfan Khan played similar kind of roles earlier. Hence it is a cake walk for him.When somebody is doing a film on a slum boy, it is bound to show the hard reality in slum areas. That does not mean that India has been projected in the wrong way. When somebody watched 'City of God' which shows the bad side of Brazil country, one expects it to be a poor country with little scope for improvement. But actually Brazil is one of the fastest growing economies in the world along with Russia, India and China (BRIC countries). India is not for the people who judge it by watching fictional movies. Hence, let's not bother about it.Slumdog Millionaire is an Indian film at heart with Indian emotions catering to Indian sensibilities. This film balances arts with commerce. It is also the best example of presenting a story in a realistic way without missing the formula. The best part in this film is the screenplay and most of the credit for this screenplay should go to the Indian writer Vikas Swaroop who wrote 'Q & A' book. Direction of the film is world class and narration balances the sensible humor and subtle tragedy.Background score by AR Rehman is peppy and energetic (especially the beat scored by kids chasing scenes in the initial part of the movie). Cinematography is excellent. Editing is superb with no dull moment. This film shows Mumbai slums in a magnificent way. On a whole Slumdog Millionaire is a must see film and will put India on the world cinema map like Gandhi (1982) film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good movie , but a one time watch","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a romance-drama movie released in 2008. It was directed by Danny Boyle and it starred many actors like Dev Patel, Freida Pinto and Saurabh Shukla , just to name some of them. The movie is set in Mumbai, India in the year 1992.""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the story of 2 orphan brothers and a girl who are all very poor and live on the streets and wherever they can find shelter. As they grow up they get separated and try to find eachother with the only chance being the famous show that everyone watched "" Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". The movie is based on a book from 2005 called ""Q & A"" wrote by Vikas Swarup. The majority of the plot revolves around the love of one of the brothers for the girl.I, myself, liked the movie but not to a certain point where to give it 8 Oscars. The movie is quite good and I especially liked how every main character evolved in their own way. The soundtrack for the movie was OK, but the actors were pretty good. This movie can really show you how the country of India is and how some parts of it look like they are from a completely different country, some parts overpopulated and poor and others extremely rich.I'd say that this is an ideal film for teenagers, the movie plot revolving around love and also having a bit of action included. This movie didn't quite hit the spot for me as I like giving movies a higher rating than others. If you like drama, romance and a bit of action this movie is for you, go give it a shot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Just incredible,"I remember when this movie came out I absolutely loved it. I watched it once in the theater and once at home with my family. 15 years later I just re-watched this and holy cow, it is phenomenal. It's still such an amazing movie. I had some memories of this movie but while watching it I realized that I forgot so much. Having kids now, and watching the awful things that happen to the children in this movie is just heartbreaking at times.The love story is great. I've seen people say that there isn't enough backstory showing their love, but there doesn't have to be. You can feel it based on how he keeps trying to find her and when she sees him she almost gasps. It's incredible. And that final seen at the train station is just so divine...the music, the cinematography, the acting. So moving. This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Despite the extreme suspension of disbelief required, Slumdog Millionaire is an excellent picture of Indian slum life and a fun movie","I'm quite split between a 7 and an 8 - was it a great movie? I don't think I'm quite willing to go that far for this simple rags to riches story. Its merits, excellent and brutal depiction of life in the slums of Mumbai, as well as an optimistic and exciting tone, are undeniable. I love Dev Patel, and his honesty and genuine nature shine through wonderfully here. Despite being told that he won at the very start, I was still on the edge of my seat and nervous for the entire climax. The way Boyle connects each question to the street smarts Jamal needed to survive the cutthroat streets of Mumbai was brilliant, and underscored the immense challenges faced growing up there. Where it falls short is in its overly simplistic plot and the incredible coincidences that were just impossible for me to ignore. Jamal manages to know just the right things and has exceptional luck in repeatedly finding Lakita. The romance plot was the most disappointing part for me, as he basically just had a connection to her from early childhood and remained obsessed with her ever since. I also didn't think the relationship and events relating to Salim, especially later in the movie, were cleanly shown. I love its early slice of life style and the connections between street smarts Jamal needed to survive and the show were truly wonderful, and the third act was still exciting. But when I look back on it and think about my relationship with the characters at the end, I'm left distant from the forced romance and the unbelievable run in the show. But as good movies do, just for a moment there, Boyle has you marveling at the way everything just works.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Fate,"Danny Boyle is a filmmaker who excites me as a filmgoer. He's always got incredible energy to him, but he never loses sight of the humanity and basic narrative building blocks. So, it irks me somewhat that the Academy decided to award him and his film Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for what I consider to be a lower tiered work. I like this film. I enjoy Slumdog Millionaire's energetic run through the strata of Indian society as viewed as a series of flashbacks in between tapings of the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. I just feel like its purported framing of everything ""being written"" is...underwritten.Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) has gotten to the final question on the craze of a game show, and the police have arrested him on suspicion of cheating to get there. How could a slumdog, a tea boy with no formal education, get so far in a quiz show that doctors, lawyers, and professors regularly fail at several steps back, asks the police inspector (Irrfan Khan). Well, it is written. Jamal's life coincidentally lines up with the questions and answers where his journey from orphan with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and the girl they find after the riot that orphaned them, Latika (Freida Pinto) in interesting ways. Like how Jamal knew the biggest Indian movie star of the 70s was Amitabh Bachchan, not just because it's a piece of general knowledge, but because he was obsessed with a boy and had a...colorful experience getting the movie star's autograph that involved him jumping into the hole in an outhouse.The heart of the film is Jamal's two relationships with Salim and Latika, and it's here where I think the film ends up functional rather than really engaging, especially with Latika. The brotherly love between Jamal and Salim is frayed from the beginning (Salim being the reason Jamal was locked in the outhouse to begin with), and the back and forth (Salim does save Jamal from a predatory man who blinds young boys who can sing in order to increase their ability to beg on the streets) between them crescendos over the years, especially around Latika. This half of the relationships is more well-done than with Latika who ends up being little more than a symbol of love rather than a fully fledged character.The problem is that Jamal and Latika don't spend too much time together outside of their childhood. Jamal saved her from the rain, they remained together through getting picked up by the slick Maman (Ankur Vikal), and Salim let Latika fall back into Maman's hands upon their exciting escape. They don't see each other for a few years when Jamal drags Salim back to Mumbai where they look for her, finding her after a surprisingly touching and scarring scene with the young boy who was blinded by Maman, and escape with her, Salim showing his growing manhood and gangsterism by dealing with Maman in, probably, the only way possible. They abscond to an abandoned hotel (with running water? I guess) where they spend about a day before Salim pushes Jamal out because Jamal's innocent love for Latika doesn't match with his desire to have her himself (it would be a rape, but Latika's attitude is more accepting than one might expect).They then don't see each other until a few months before the start of the film's action on the game show. Really, since they were about 6 years old until they are 18, Jamal and Latika have seen each other for a day, and Latika ends up little more than the damsel in distress, having become the mistress to Maman's rival gang leader Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) who is very pretty and insists that Jamal leave her alone to save himself before she shows up at their agreed upon meeting place anyway because love and she gets stolen away by Salim, who works for Javed, leading to the need for Jamal to find her somehow and getting himself on the show.All of this is told through the flashbacks to the police inspector who grows increasingly convinced that the story is real to the point where he lets Jamal go so he can finish his time on the show opposite the host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), who has some thinly sourced reasons why he doesn't want Jamal to be this icon of upward mobility in India because that's his place, or something.So, I'm of two minds of the film. Firstly, I'm entertained throughout. Danny Boyle's camera is active but never confusing. His ability with actors, especially the youngest trio who play the main characters at their youngest, with special emphasis on the language barrier, is rather extraordinary. Performances are very good throughout, though the most praise must fall on Dev Patel who plays Jamal's wide ranging emotions very well. The visual portrait of India is very colorful and seems to bring in as much as they can, from the slums where a riot killed the boys' mother to the high-rises overlooking the slums themselves. Jamal himself is a compelling character, and the idea that he's going to win because the stars aligned so that those specific questions tied so intimately to his life were there is largely well done.However, if the stars aligned for it, why does he have to use lifelines at all (first for the words on the Indian flag, then for a cricket question, then for the third name of the Musketeers)? Now, the third one I get because it brings him and Latika again together in the final moments of the show in a nice way, and it makes the win beside the point. However, the first two are about different things. The first is about showing that he doesn't know everything, even basic stuff five year old children in Indian know. The second is to create this dramatic hump for Jamal to get out of, manifested in the clash with Prem Kumar which doesn't seem to come to much of anything once we're past it. Throw in the fact that Latika is less a character and more of a vision, and I end up with reservations.Those reservations, though, do not outmatch the rest of the entertaining package that is Slumdog Millionaire, though. It's a feel-good film that ends up making the audience feel good. It's just that, after the release of Yesterday, I feel like Boyle has made another film in this vein that's better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Burden of a white man's false vision about India.,"It is rather bizarre that this inane flick is currently at spot 205 in the IMDb top 250 list. It may be because these days it has become a fashion to trash the strong homogeneous cultures of developing economies. This is the reason why so many films are being made which try to belittle booming economies of Brazil, Russia, China and India. Slumdog Millionaire is one such film which is a half baked attempt to mix realism with social message. It fails on both counts. The biggest fault one can find with Danny Boyle's film is that it looks at poverty, poor kids only from an exploitation angle. This is the reason why so many negative scenes about poverty have been put in order to create a sensationalist approach. This can work wonders for those foreigners who have always looked upon India with their myopic eyes full of contempt. One can be sure that things would have been different if a solution angle had been applied to the film's narrative. The vision of Danny Boyle is so conceited that he feels that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is his prerogative to suggest that India is nothing but a land of poor people where snake charmers merely rub shoulders with hungry elephants and crime is the only thing which pays. Slumdog Millionaire is a trashy film which will please only those who choose to ignore the real beauty of India. It is a sad fact that Danny Boyle has been able to fool people in the west. His real test will take place when his film is shown in Indian cinema halls where it would surely be trashed as a stupid white man's discriminatory vision of India's misery. It would meet the same fate as that of Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" when it bombed miserably at Indian box office after being shown for commercial distribution.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

One of the best films of 2008,"Like a cross between 'City of God', 'Quiz Show', and hmm, 'The Usual Suspects', 'Slumdog Millionaire' is Danny Boyle's ('Trainspotting', '28 Days Later') best film to date. Set in the slums of Mumbai, the story traces back through each successive game show question from Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) tragic childhood in abject squalor, through his life as a teenager in the slums with his criminal-minded brother Salim (Madhur Mittal), and Jamal's pursuit of lifelong crush Latika (the incredibly beautiful Freida Pinto).

A sheer delight from beginning to end!,"I just want to say very briefly that Slumdog Millionaire is a very beautiful film, I absolutely loved it. If you have not yet seen this film in the cinema and you are thinking about it then I urge you to stop thinking and go see it! You will not be disappointed. This film has everything - epic romance at its heart, emotion in bucket-loads, action, drama, tension and tragedy. Having been bitterly disappointed by my last two film outings at the cinema..i won't mention their names as they are not worthy of it..i'll just say that one of them was about a guy in a silly bat suit with a silly voice and the other was about a guy who works for the British Secret Service. Both of these films were total rubbish, boring and a total waste of my time and money and sitting through them had dulled my enthusiasm big-time for seeing anything else on the big screen. Seeing Slumdog Millionaire though has totally blown these 'dulled' feeling away and so at last I am back, revelling in the after glow of seeing such a brilliant, beautifully made film. Slumdogs director - Danny Boyle and his team of film makers deserve every award they receive.It was so refreshing to watch a film where it was all up there on the big screen, a film where you absolutely get your money's worth, a film after which when you walk from the theatre you have this wonderful, satisfying feeling flowing through you. All credit to the excellent cast, they are all truly great actors some of which were only as young as seven years old.

I do enjoy the dance at the end, as it finally lets the characters be joyful, something lacking throughout the whole film.The subject is grim, and makes life in India seem terrible for orphaned youth.

Best. Film. of. 2008. Period.,"Without a doubt, no other film of 2008 will be able to title itself as the very best of the calendar year. Certainly, this is a subjective question, but after experiencing this wondrous achievement, I can't imagine anyone picking another film but this as best picture of 2008. British director Danny Boyle perfectly crafted this picture and it is more than just a great story but also a great movie. It is entirely entertaining and will certainly lift your spirits as well. All the actors, whether Dev Patel as Jamal, Freida Pinto as Latika, or any of the rest of the cast, young and old, are perfectly cast and completely bring us into this world of poverty, dirtiness, sadness, and hope.So, I say you must see Slumdog Millionaire before the Oscars are announced. I can say with confidence it will win Best Picture, but you owe it to yourself to experience the expert storytelling, acting, directing, visual style, and music that wraps you up and transports you to a feeling of exhilaration and joy.

Slumdog Millionaire,"Dev Patel is great here as ""Jamal"", a young man from the Mumbai slums who shot to fame by winning the first ever jackpot on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" only to be accused of cheating. It's not an unreasonable allegation - this lad comes from a background that suggests little, if any, education and yet he is answering some tough questions that, theoretically, he should not know the answers too. It's during this (actually quite brutal) interrogation, which is interspersed with flashback and with each round of the television quiz, that we discover a little of the childhood and upbringing of this young man and about how he has amassed the knowledge to, legitimately, get the answers correct. It's a story about humanity and decency, this - and the ensemble cast, especially the street urchins, help to deliver an authentic glimpse at not just the poverty in which they lived, but of their sense of community and loyalty to each other as they grew up together. Now there's no point in pretending that the writing is great - it isn't. It's doesn't really allow for any in-depth character development. Somehow, though, Patel's sheer screen presence and optimism, coupled with the overall style of the film cover up for that more than adequately leaving us with a solidly entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, rags-to-riches story that I suspect many people can readily identify with. It's a bit too long, and maybe the romantic elements could have been ditched, but all told it's still well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The religion problem was not missed either, not even the irresponsible call centers and yes the good America also made an appearance :P.The movie makes a happy ending after all this hustle and bustle.Sadly enough all this is true, but hey people there is much more to the country than what this movie tells you.

A movie about fate and love through a story with a lot of drama,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an Indian-British film, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Simon Beaufoy. The story was setted and recorded in the Juhu slums of Mumbai, India in 2008.This romance-drama movie won 8 Oscars including Best Film and was dubbed into many languages.

Mumbai is so wrongfully portrayed in this fantasized modern-day 'fairy tale'. i do not think Ebert or any other film critic has ever seen a better film which portrays Mumbai truly. and let us be true to ourselves people, Slumdog looks like a less violent, more sentimental 'Cidade De Deus'. kids with guns, a humble n honest protagonist, stark lighting, paced-up editing...Mumbai isn't at all like the city of god! about the music, A.R. Rahman is a genius, nobody can deny that. but this is not his masterpiece. he has given way better music than this; in Roja, Bombay, Rang De Basanti, Dil Se. even if he ends up with an Oscar for this, this soundtrack would still remain among the not-so-good Rahman albums.the film is a real let down at least for all the Indians i know of who have seen. its cheesy, Bollywoodish, immensely predictable and, too too clichéd...clichés which do not work...perhaps for the fantasy-driven, fairy-tale, living-in-a-dream viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""Slumdog"" is visually stunning","Sex. Love. Death. Fame. Violence. ""Slumdog"" tells an epic story of greed, love, and redemption in under two hours. With an impressionistic style and economic storytelling, director Danny Boyle has crafted a thoroughly romantic tale of treachery and longing. It's a Movie filled with larger than life Villains and a from the slums Hero trying to secure the treasure, win the princess, and vanquish the dragon. But it's also merely serviceable. A way to pass the time.While I didn't dislike the film, I think it falls short of the transcendence it wants to achieve. Boyle wants to create an old school love story with over-sized emotions that sweeps you up and leaves you high on its Movie Majesty and celebration of Love. (See also Baz Luhrmann.) Instead, I was left admiring Boyle's editing as the characters are too thin to leave an impression. Also, the motivations of the film's on again off again villain turn on a dime and wholly serve the script rendering him more a device than person. The movie will give you back what you put into it. An impression of transcendence will have to be supplied by the viewer because the filmmaker is too concerned with crafting a whizz bang movie machine.The film's first fifteen minutes or so are its most gripping. Slum dweller Jamal and his friends play cricket on a nearby airfield and are soon chased away angrily by club wielding cops on scooters. The flight of the slumdogs takes them across the roofs of a Mumbai slum while the screaming police pursue. It's a great, alive scene that gives us an immediate sense of place, poverty, and oppression. Jamal will soon meet the Girl who will become his Quest and repeatedly be hindered by his avaricious brother.""Slumdog"" consistently displays a dynamic visual sense, but leaves much to be desired in the storytelling department.

The adult leads were good, but recognition needs to be given to the actors who played the younger versions of the main characters because their performances were absolutely wonderful. Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubina Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar have bright futures.

Magnificent Post-Colonization Urban Representation,"After watching ""Slumdog Millionaire"", we can notice that the movie was first of all a foreign production that illustrates the life of a boy who comes from the slums and became a millionaire after competing in a competition ""who's gonna be a millionaire?"" The movie doesn't only focuses on the life of the boy, but at the same it connects the boy's life evolution to the evolution of the city.""From Bombay to Mumbai"" is a concept that was written in so many articles that focuses on how the city, full of slums and poor people and a big population, became the financial capital of India. The article circles three elements or three architectural concepts that helped the evolution of this city. The first one is the slum itself that projects the daily life of around 1 million population, and how they're adjusting to the life that no can even adapt to nor even can imagine. The second element was the Hiranandani Gardens that presents the switch from the small houses in the slums to the skyscrapers surrounding these slums. And the third element is Victoria terminus train station, that paints the historical background
of the country and it's relation to the British colonization. All these elements, are projected in the movie, not only for the sake of demeaning and distinguishing between the two life styles but also promoting the optimism in the struggle of the poor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Minor Success,"Anyone that can make a movie warrants a pat on the back. Anyone that makes a movie that people want to see deserves great kudos. Once this is done. of course, everyone has a say on the pros and cons, whys and wherefores. Make you wonder why they bother.I've seen a few of Danny Boyle's movies: Shallow Grave, Millions, my favourite Trainspotting and now Slumbog Millionaire. The latter with all it's praise and little gold statuettes is not a vast success. Not for me anywhere. It's a curious hydrid of Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. It has a mix of edgy realism and romantic fantasy and suffers because of it.Perhaps it's me, seeing Danny Boyle's name above the title and creating unreasonable expectations. Boyle is able to make whatever film he likes, and I don't think he'll be fretting over the critical of commercial reaction thus far.Slumbog works best in the first half hour. It's an intriguing story and kicked off with a bang. Children living, playing, stealing and surviving in the slums of Mumbai. For many of us, I'm sure this is quite an eye-opener. All those people!

Good effort to draw story of luck driven Slum-boy,"Slumdog millionaire is a movie, I find over-hyped for everything. Number of movies on the similar line had already hit the floor and not noticed before they perished from memories. The movie is an endeavor to draw the life of a boy, born at Mumbai slum, rolled by his fortune to face all the worst happenings, that can come to a kid's life, controlled by some gangsters, also having a jealous brother, his profound love for a girl, that actually drive the life for boy.Boy Jamaal has portrayed as an extra intelligent human, who learns thing while running, is more knowledgeable than MBA's. The story speeds up in the background of a TV show "" Who wants to be a millionaire"". The way Jamaal's answers being mapped to incidents in his life was sometime indigestible. Pluses are those parts of movie having childhood of kids and story of the 2nd Saleem. Some portions of movie seemed very unpractical. Show host behavior was also unanswered in the movie. Overall this was an good effort to sketch the life of slum guy, driven by his luck and finally landed into the money.

False feel good film with weak premise,"This film was terrible, am a Indian who watched the movie. I find this movie rubbish. It plays into the ""Indian stereotype"" It shows India as a very very poor country, with the only job to riches being as customer service representative to Americans. This movie and nominated the movie for Golden Globe and possibly Oscars? Is there a rule within the Oscars where as no Asian film director is allowed to win an Oscar for a South Asian Movie? Because it seems to me that only White Directors are allowed to win? Bollywood is one of the Biggest Film Industries within the world with fantastic creative film directors who would not even get a look through the door at the Oscars, yet here comes a white film director, who has no Idea about Indian Culture, Indian films and now he and his moron writer are getting credited in making a Bollywood film? It just seems ironic that a foreign film director is getting accolade for a Bollywood film? It seems rather racist to me. What about great film directors like Mani Rattman, Ram Gopal Varma, Satyajit Ray, Raj Kapoor, the list is endless..... They have all made fantastic Movies. Yet never credited? Amir Khans Lagaan, and Devdas? Its not even a matter of the film director being White is just seems fake! Oscar accolade is fake! He should be ashamed of even excepting the award.Selling of world stupid ideas of poverty, that the Western view of any ""third world countries"".Danny Boyle doesn't even do justice to the Bollywod tradition of film making.If this film was made by am South Asian filmmaker, then western media would simply reject it straightaway calling it Bollywood and rubbish. But this is not the case here.Its made by a white filmmaker, and this is why it gets me so angry. Only a few months ago this film was destined to straight to Video but now its getting press for no reason at all! I also know that the Bollywood directors in India are really unhappy crying in their sleep by this director receiving all these international accolades.Non-white film directors cant win Oscars.You cannot ever win an Oscar because you are not a white. As simple as that. Only white directors are allowed to make films in South Asia, Africa etc etc.A nonsense film and it just goes to show how Racist the Oscars really are.Its just sad and i hope the industry starts to realise that there are good film directors in the world that are not white you know. 1-10",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The storyline for this is awesome and very intricate. The circumstances and script is a healthy mix of hilarious, sad and triumphant.

Just look at the similarities: big-time mob bosses, two young boys on the run, a hot chick, and there's a scene when they're smoking hookah! The movie could definitely use Seth Rogen's comic relief.

The most uplifting film of the year.,"This is the story of the journey of a boy becoming a man and what he will do to prove his love to the woman of his dreams. He gets on Who Wants to be a Millionaire, a show that she is fond of, and tries to win the top prize in rupees. His journey is not without a lot of pain and a lot of challenges. This was a surprisingly uplifting and beautiful film, which is a surprise considering how dark and intense it is in the earlier scenes in the film. While the film does have a lot of style in terms of music and color, the camera never stops moving. It is always very shaky and always cutting away. This helps to establish how intense the situations in the film are. The characters are all clearly defined and given a lot of personality and quality. Even the most minor of the characters are given plenty to work with. The film just bursts with life and with beauty and innocence and emotion. There are scenes of incredible clarity and power. This is, by far, Danny Boyle's most ambitious film yet! It's certainly not his best(in my opinion that would by Trainspotting) but it's one of his better films. It's easily the most accessible and the most enjoyable for most audiences. It's probably his most mainstream film. I have a feeling that this film was what he wanted A Life Less Ordinary to be like but at the time didn't have the money or ability to pull it off. Slumdog Millionaire is a success and it is a good movie. There are flaws, don't get me wrong. Some of the music doesn't work, the middle section of the film is surprisingly weak and confusing, there are too many unnecessary chase scenes and fight scenes, one of the characters does some really extreme things that seem out of the ordinary, and the film's editing can be to abrasive at times. Still, this film is fun, it's entertaining, and it's uplifting. This is the ""feel good"" movie of the year. See it, not because you want to but because you deserve to.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Director Danny Boyle never waters down the gruesomeness of his story that, while not necessarily a true one, offers a unique and tough approach to the life of the Indian underworld from a great perspective of an unfairly treated character, using the premise as the storytelling engine, and delivering a great use of narrative flashbacks and current events, this drama might go onto over-the-top corners at times, but it's effectivity relays of the professionalism of Boyle's direction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

India is not Brazil.,"Shocked! This movie has won 4 Golden Globes. It is crowned high up in Top 250(!) What the hell is wrong with everyone?

This film not only lacks the native flavor it also gives way to some unpardonable medley. It just sounds ridiculous when slum people are speaking English(Slangs in Hindi!)- that makes not a single character in this film something that an intellectual may approve.Evenif you look at it as a great piece of story-telling, there are better ones.

Slumdog is wildly overrated,"Slumdog Millionaire presents a refreshingly original concept, but it fails when it plays like a typical action romance. The main problem is that the screenplay follows the same formula that so many other big-budget action romances follow with two major exceptions. One, we have Indian characters, not American (it gives the film a special allure). Secondly, the story is told in non-linear fashion. But the formula is the same.One of the biggest problems in the writing is that everybody except for the two main characters is a villain. Key characters are one-dimensional and that's far too easy to write. For example, everybody with the exception of three key characters are pure evil and even then, one is mostly evil. It's lazy and a way to spoon-feed the audience. It's easier for audiences to identify some one as wholly good and another as wholly evil. Writing complex characters causes more ambiguity and it might make audiences think!Secondly, Slumdog suffers from what I'll call ""Inverse Deus Ex Machina."" Instead of characters always being saved by the bell, these characters are always being harmed by the bell. Just when you think something good will happen, something bad happens to increase drama. This is a problem when it happens at every single opportunity it gets except one.Another problem is a philosophical one. Jamal searches for his true love, a girl that he barely spent any time with making it hard to legitimize this destined love. Now, this can work by giving the main character a reason to love a girl he barely knew. Maybe she reminds him of innocence or maybe she was the only purely good person he ever knew. But the movie does not justify this distant and unknown love, they simply expect us to believe that the overly passionate Jamal would be so unbelievably attached to a stranger and vice versa.Boyle also applies some annoying gimmicks to this film. Almost every other shot is canted dutch (camera tilted at an angle). Critics seem to confuse this as art but it's simply aggravating. The Third Man is the only film that can use canted dutch shots nearly as much as Slumdog did, although it still does it less. Also, every time it happens in 3rd Man, there's an obvious reason for it. Here, there's no reason other than to create never-ending chaos, even during the calm scenes.Also, Boyle doesn't something extremely elementary. He changes the positions and colors of the subtitles, especially throughout the earlier scenes. This is a way of telling the audience, WE KNOW YOUR ATTENTION SPAN IS TOO SHORT TO READ BLACK AND WHITE SUBTITLES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, SO WE'LL APPLY COLORS AND MAKE THEM MORE VISIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE American AUDIENCE WILL WATCH THIS. Man on Fire and El Cantante also did this, I believe for the same reasons, and it's unnecessary. Trust the audience. They're only dumb if you treat them as such. And I won't even get into the end credits. I'll just say this isn't 40 year old virgin, this movie can't pull that off.Also, Boyle has a nasty habit of playing popular, modern songs non-diagetically against scenes that take place well before the song was made. I may be nit-picky here, but this too is unnecessary, sloppy film-making. More importantly, Boyle exhibits a petty reliance on music, making most of the movie feel like a really expensive music video.Slumdog fails to capitalize on the most interesting character in the film. THE SLUMS. There's a brief moment in the film where the camera is sitting on a tri-pod, there isn't any wacky editing, and a serene song plays. We watch Jamal re-enter the slums. Here, the slums are treated with tenderness and a little nostalgia. The film needs more of this.Ultimately, the great reviews stem from the appreciation of an unusual concept made in a fast-paced, City of God-like environment using incredibly epic scenery of Mumbai slums. Unfortunately, the content, editing and cinematography is treated like a Michael Bay film and the theme (and ending) is one to satisfy an audience of teeny-boppers. Slumdog may very well win best picture this year while a simpler, more thought-provoking and more mature film in The Wrestler isn't even nominated for the award.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Film that just WOW's the audience,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers.

Poverty-porn sells good,"Its not surprising to win awards by selling poverty from developing nations, rather it is a cheap trick. This has been done from various others such as Satyajit Roy, Mrinal Sen from India and now Danny from Britain. I am not saying they were/are not good directors, but only when they make films on poverty their piece of art gets an award.An award is much dependent upon the jury members and their background. If the jury members were from developing nations it may not have been even noticed.It is perhaps not incorrect to say that some countries are poor because some others are rich. Giving awards for depicting so called reality would not serve any good to the real cause. It will only make someone richer by selling the poverty of someone else.""The whole build-up of hype around the movie reminds one of the new-found appreciation of Miss World and Miss Universe organisers towards Indian beauty after India's economy was liberalized to allow international cosmetic giants to sell their wares in India,""",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Masterpiece,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008)**** (out of 4)The incredible story of Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who grows up in the slums but gets a chance on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. The only catch is that he isn't doing it for the money and his answers come from his own life experiences while searching for his one true love (Freida Pinto). I really wasn't sure what to expect walking into this film but it grabs you from the very first shot and not once lets go and in the end this turned out to be one of the most impressive films I've seen in many, many years. Perhaps if I thought a tad bit longer a title would come to my mind but as I'm sitting here writing this I really can't think of another film quite like this one. The movie works brilliantly as a love story. It works brilliantly as pure drama. It works brilliantly as a heart-pounding thriller. This film is so many things that it's really incredible that director Danny Boyle was able to handle all of it and deliver one of the most heartbreaking yet rewarding film in many years. The movie is told in an extremely fast paced and it's visually very stunning. The brilliant editing mixed with the cinematography and visionary music score makes for an amazing assault on our senses but it mixes so well with the love story that you can't help but feel everything that the hero is going through. What I loved most is that Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy could have played it safe and delivered a PG-13 love story but instead they wanted to show the viewer what the slums of India are like. We get a couple extremely violent scenes that are rather shocking and we get to see what poverty is like in this country. The way the children are abused might make some think twice when seeing them on the streets over there. The screenplay captures every note correctly in telling this story and Boyle's wonderful direction really brings it home nicely. Patel and Pinto do a masterful job in their performances as does Madhur Mittal who plays Jamal's older brother. The three of them work so incredibly well together that their performances help sell the story. The three of them are played by two sets of younger actors earlier in the film and these kids also deliver very strong performances. What's really amazing is that it seems the filmmaker's goals were met early on in the film yet they just kept climbing and climbing until they've reached something bigger. I'm still early on in my quest to watch the best reviewed movies of 2008 but I will be shocked if I come across a better film than this one.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An Intelligently directed & well scripted movie but portrays India in a bad taste. (Part One),"It's the most appreciated movie in the last few months (2008), winning several awards at various film festivals all over the globe. So I was excited enough to the see it, expecting another movie which will be added in my ""Movies to See Before You Die"" list. No doubt it is one of the best movies of recent times but sadly I didn't find it worth adding my ""Must See Movies"" List and I will surely give you my reasons for that here in the end.Firstly talking about the movie, an interesting observation is that if the viewer is not told about who directed this flick, then, he is bound to take it as a movie made by an Indian or a person with an Indian origin. But surprisingly it is directed by ""Danny Boyle"" of 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later' fame. Though he has done a brilliant job but in my opinion he selected this subject and directed this movie keeping in mind the festival circuit and attention he would get because of the Indian touch and feel of the movie. You might get my point more clearly after watching it and reading my points at the end of this review.The story of this movie is about a young teenage boy winning millions at a TV Show (KBC of Indian Television) and how each question asked by the anchor has a relation to his past life. He knows most of the answers as all the questions have something similar to the circumstances of his real life. So the anchor at one point of time doubts that he may be cheating in the show. In order to investigate his loyalty, he is handed over to the police for one night, but nothing is found against him and he is allowed to play the game, the next final day.Each question put to him in the game show has a sequence attached to it in the screenplay which is well written and enjoyable. The growth of the children from a small age to their teenage youth is well executed. But the thrill which should have been there regarding the game is missing. May be it's because from the title itself you already know that the contestant is going to win. Moreover, the narration of the movie is more towards an artistic offbeat film (like that of ""Salaam Bombay""), which reduces its chances of becoming a big hit in the Indian circuit (But may do well in multiplexes).Performances wise everybody does a fine job especially Dev Patel and all the child artists featuring in the movie. Their expressions and dialogue delivery has been directed perfectly and they never seem to be acting. Anil Kapoor, Irfan Khan, Saurabh Shukla & Mahesh Manjrekar are just fine doing their parts with nothing extra-ordinary to talk about. But they are lucky enough to get this project which has become world famous by now. One thing i couldn't understand was that why Anil Kapoor did not want the slum boy to win in his show and why he tried to give him the wrong answer. Camerwork showing the slums and riots is brilliant. In fact the opening scene is the most well shot sequence with all the kids running followed by the policemen.Musically, there are no full length songs in the movie and the soundtrack alone is more enjoyable separately. The best song is ""Jai Ho"" which was shockingly refused by Subhash Ghai for his movie ""Yuvraaj"". The background music is superb giving an ample support to the direction. A. R. Rahman gives another good score in this International project and has already won praises and awards, making his presence felt in the International Film & Music Circles. We are really proud to have him as a National Treasure.Now coming to the points why this movie could not impress me as expected and why it is not being added to my ""Movies to See Before You Die"" List.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Vastly different place,"It doesn't make sense that someone who succeeds on a game show (the Millionaire show) would succumb to beatings, torture and treatment as though he is a worthless dog due to suspicions of cheating. After all could not this person simply have been lucky in guessing the multiple choice questions correctly. We quickly realize how different things can be in a land different than our own.We do get a sense of the vastness of the country and how different it is than the west. Not only do we get this sense from the shocking way people are treated just from being of a lower class and from scenes of unfathomable squalor, but simply from the questions that are asked on the Millionaire show. When the basic, low value questions will be so obscurely vague to us if we are westerners, but are so rudimentary for Indians, and the hardest most obscure and highest value questions for the Indians are not that difficult for us, we realize the individuality of the country's culture, history and society. When a whole other world of a billion plus people can be obsessed by this person who might win it all, and we would never hear of him, we really feel the largeness of the world and how small we are in comparison.It is fast paced, lots of running and action packed. It seems a bit artificial as cheap thrills and raw entertainment took precedence over realism and a true immersion.The story could have simply been about life on the streets in India and what growing up was like for these ""slum dogs"". The cut to the millionaire aspects seems a bit gimmicky and almost oddly thrown in to make the movie more entertaining.

For one because the first was actually based on a true story and thus also written and filmed believable from the start up to the end and it was a movie depicting things as they really are (albeit maybe a little flashy) and focusing on the life story of one individual in the middle of it all, as opposed to Slumdog, which mainly focuses on the ""Who is Gonna Be A Millionaire""-show (seemingly to be more appealing to the western civilization and TV viewers) all around... No surprise with shows like ""American Idol"" and ""Dancing With the Stars"" leading the ratings in the US and in some cases International TV, while shows with brains get the axe by the minute.If you want to view it as a ""mirror"" into Indian culture etc. I guess it was okay, but again it focused too much on the show and the respective answers. There are movies with a more... subtle approach that I liked more and imo succeeded better in doing that, e.g. Darjeeling Limited for example...Also there were some cringe worthy moments like the flashbacks near the end, how he couldn't answer some of the more simple general questions, but somehow ""circumstances"" allowed him to answer questions in the show, and how winning just by coincidence saves ones entire life and is something to be admired, a few of those ruined it even more for me...An okay movie, but 8 Oscars and so much international acclaim? (While City of God didn't get one) I smell something fishy xD",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Uplifting but Simplistic,"I wanted to see this movie for ages seeing the hype it received in many international film festivals.And I must say, while not being exactly a letdown, it did not seem to quite justify the hype.The film is modern taken on the rags-to-riches story set in Bombay,India.The bad things about the story first: The film is very predictable,you can tell the whole story of the film in approximately 10 mins.All the characters are either black or white,excepting the hero's brother.The climax was a let down,typical of bollywood films(a frantic climax where somehow everything becomes right!).And as an Indian, yes,i did find the part about ""real America"" offensive.Inspite of these faults,the film does strike a chord in one's heart.The cinematography is brilliant,the city of Bombay is presented in a whole new light,one can see beauty amidst squalor.A.R Rahman's music adds to the mood of the film.And finally,the movie is a triumph of human spirit,of fighting against the odds and yet surviving,and for projecting this superbly,this movie is worth a watch.No marks for plausibility though,but as the movie says "" Some things are written,are meant to be"".Go watch it,but put your cynical self to rest.All in all , i felt the movie was good but not worth all the Oscar hype it is getting.There are better movies coming out of bollywood then this movie",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Undeniably a great film,"I remember the hype around 'Slumdog Millionaire' when it first came out. Some people were even hailing it as one of the best movies ever, and it's easy to see why. It is a superbly written and produced film with an uplifting and thoroughly engaging storyline. Dev Patel delivers a near faultless performance as Jamal, though the entire cast are terrific.'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that you hear so many positive things about and are somewhat reluctant to watch in case it lets you down. But unlike a lot of other hyped up movies, this one lives up to expectations. It grabs your attention from the start and keeps you absorbed right until the end. It takes a special kind of movie to successfully achieve that.This is undeniably a great film that deserves the praise it gets. It's not one of my personal favourites but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Loved this film - so uplifting - you can see God in this,"Based on an impoverished citizen from India who went on to be a contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", the whole plot manufactures a very ironic correlation. It appeared as though any question that the ""slumdog"" was compelled to answer on this show, ultimately became a supercilious reflection of some kind of experience in his precarious life. As the plot thickened, so did the depiction relating to the intensity of oppression and emotional disarray that besieged the ""slumdog"" with regards to his whole dubious environment.This American film, which had a lot of Indian actors and actresses, as well as many Indian producers, wound up being one of the best American films ever made in recent history. The cinematography was sensational, the acting was thoroughly believable, and the directing was emphatically first rate! Any film which wins the Academy Award for best picture in the year it is made, will often times make a concerted effort to purport a unique ideological perspective to the movie audience. I thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was the well deserved recipient of the Academy Award for best film in '2008!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Perfect Movie!,"This is one of those perfect movies, you know the ones that you wouldn't change a second, the ones that you put on to have in the background but after 2 minutes you sit there glowed to the screen.
The movie is an fantastic mix of action, adventure, comedy, drama and romance. The story is uniquely told in flashback as Jamal must reveal how he knew the Who wants to be a millionaireshow's answers. For instance, he knew who was on a U.S. hundred-dollar bill from when he was stealing from tourists and posing as a phony tour guide. The story of Jamal, his brother and Latika is so engaging that even the police chief questioning him wants to know what happens next in the story.The acting is awesome, both as Jamal is a young boy, a teenager and as a young man. There is much empathy with him, though especially as a young man his actions speak more than his expressions or words. The directing is terrific, telling the story in a unique way but without drawing attention to itself. The music is fun and lively, and there is the necessary ""Bollywood-style"" dance number over the end credits 😂Director Danny Boyle is also a favourite of mine with ""Trainspotting"" on my all-time 10-top list. Also ""Shallow Grave"" and ""28 Days Later"" are masterpieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"This film's message of hope transcends borders, languages or social positions. And this universal fable is a breath of positive energies in the cinema today","To begin with, the feature film directed by the British Danny Boyle and the Indian Lovellen Tandan from a script that Simon Beaufoy adapted from the novel by Vikas Swarup, is, structurally, a fairy tale. A fairy tale with horrors and violence against children, corruption and extreme poverty, but, even so, a fairy tale, something evidenced exactly by the television game that the young Jamal (Dev Patel in his debut feature) participates in the vain hope and impossible - in the real world - to actually become a millionaire to change your life completely and finally be able to be with Latika (Freida Pinto also in her first feature playing the older version of the character, with Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar in the teenage version and Rubina Ali as a child), the love of his life.The work never hides this, not least because it is important that the spectator has this vision from the beginning, so that it is possible to understand and accept all the narrative conveniences that allow the competitor to answer the questions that are asked. If the film were supposed to be realistic, as many people say it can't be (because it never tried to be), the suspension of disbelief burden would be enormous and unsustainable. As a fairy tale, this burden is light and easy to carry, even though Boyle and Tandam may have stretched the story out more than they should have, forming a narrative stretch halfway through its duration that, however, begins to disappear as the story progresses. That the work is moving towards its climax which, even though it is also lengthened, manages to maintain a good degree of suspense.And that's why even the horrific disgrace that Jamal and those around him experience is brought into focus with a vibrant, full-color photograph by Anthony Dod Mantle (The Last King of Scotland, Antichrist, 127 Hours), something that, of course, also works for emulate the similar footprint that permeates Bollywood films, usually also far from realism, but which are clearly objects of this semi-western homage (since it is an Indian co-production, with Indian co-direction, based on an Indian novel). The music, the colors and the transformation of horrors into threads of hope lead the viewer on a roller coaster of feelings that range from total disgust to effusive joy, which, however, only has the power to shorten Jamal's journey from a very young age. Played first by Ayush Mahesh Khedekar (the incarnation of the happiness of being a child, I would say) and, later, by Tanay Chheda before arriving at Patel, if the viewer doesn't see the tape as a positive version (yes, positive) it gets much tougher and much more terrible reality. Is he an escapist? It sure is, but it's an elegant, very well directed escapism that subverts expectations while making room for some of the deep socioeconomic problems of the country it portrays to be sown in the viewer's mind.One of the great merits of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" it lies in the fact that the audience really believes that the actors who play the ""musketeers"" at their different ages are the same person, maintaining the illusion that we are following those characters in different stages of their lives. The trio of then amateur actors who play Jamal, Latika and Salim, the latter Jamal's older brother who, however, becomes his enemy and who is played first by Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, then Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and, finally, Madhur Mittal , were very well cast, with the directors extracting the best that each of the nine actors has to offer, with little Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, the youngest Jamal, being an impressive standout who would only win competition years later with Sunny Pawar as Saroo (who, older, is lived by the same Patel in Lion - A Journey Home). But the seasoned adult cast leaves nothing to be desired for the young stars, with Anil Kapoor as Prem Kumar, the game's treacherous host and especially the late Irrfan Khan as the nameless, but personality-heavy Police Inspector serving almost as guides to the story. Main narrative line that goes from the present to the past with great fluidity and care thanks to the editing by Chris Dickens (Hot Fuzz, Les Misérables, Rocketman).Who wants to be a millionaire? It couldn't sound more trivial and predictable. It turns out that the plot, a classic Cinderella story, in the hands of Danny Boyle and Oscar-winning screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, is transfigured. It gains a ""modern"" narrative style, electrifying and extremely visual, Westernized. India, a country often distorted by the Western eye, appeared on screens around the world with supposedly realistic colors and full of nuances, despite Boyle's exotic look. It can be seen from the emerging power, a breeding ground for great computing talent, to the misery that leads millions to live on the streets, without access to sewage networks or medicine. But Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? He also takes care of other segments of this society, portraying the (not a few) millionaires of the country, who drive Mercedes Benz and Audis, live in luxurious closed condominiums and send their children to study in Europe (mainly in the United Kingdom) and in the United States. The strong film industry in Mumbai, known internationally as Bollywood, is not left out, which emerges, in great style, in the fantastic closing credits of the film.The merit of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Is to have managed to synthesize, for the West, always thirsty for well-packaged novelties, the complexity of these various Indies through the story of Jamal, an Eastern Oliver Twist (character from the classic story by Charles Dickens) who transits through crime, lives on favors and, because of his intelligence and curiosity, manages to survive poverty and take unexpected flights. And, of course, live a great love. Jamal's life, until he was 20, is told in flashbacks, interspersed with scenes from his participation in ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", in an exquisite editing work, awarded with the Oscar. Gradually, as he progresses, always giving the right answers on the show, he becomes a national hero, living proof that not every fate is sealed in such a stratified society. Images from his past reveal how he learned all that, tell how and why he acquired so much knowledge. It's an irresistible fairy tale made to order for the post-2008 economic crisis world.Contrary to what many might think at first, the tape was not made by Bollywood, the prolific Indian film industry, but an English feature, directed by the excellent British director Danny Boyle. Despite paying homage to Indian cinema on several occasions, the director never adopts the ""Bollywoodian"" shooting style or aesthetics in his film, always investing in external shots, which try to portray the real Bombay (later Mumbai), the place where good part of the story takes place. Boyle gives a strong rhythm to the narrative, starting with a moment of tension - the interrogation interspersed with some images from the program - and then returning to the alternation of scenes, with Jamal being asked by the police chief about how he knew about a certain question, to answer with a fact. Of your life. However, this structure never becomes tiresome precisely because of Boyle's shooting style, which keeps the scenes visually stimulating.One of the sequences that most caught my attention was the religious attack that results in a significant death in the lives of brothers Jamal and Salim. Set in the characters' early childhood, it is a highly emotional scene, and its religious background, portrayed by the girl in costume, gives an even greater impact to the moment, which will change the lives of the ""three musketeers"" forever. It is interesting to note how the uncontrolled mob in this scene comes to resemble the zombies shown by Danny Boyle himself in ""Extermination"", in an interesting parallel. By the way, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" brings together elements from several of the director's own films: the dark aesthetic of ""Trainspotting, the aforementioned sequence that refers to ""28 Days Later"", a cathartic musical number along the lines of that present in ""A Life Less Ordinary""... It's as if Boyle, just like Jamal does on the show, took elements from his professional (and even personal) life and adapted them for his new work.In the end, what matters is that ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" it conquers the viewer thanks to its optimistic message that, even in a world filled with poverty and misery like that of the Indian slums, one can rise and conquer one's destiny, if one is strong enough to run after it and not be overwhelmed by difficulties and sink in a sea of excrement (be it physical or psychological). Moving in the right measure, intelligent and, above all, very well done, it is a feature film that is perhaps not as relevant in a more austere or political concept, with higher meanings and greater aspirations. It's not going to change anyone's life. But it is a well-done, competent and extremely rich entertainment class. In the eyes, in the heart and in the mind. This film's message of hope transcends borders, languages or social positions. And this universal fable is a breath of positive energies in the midst of a true ocean of cynicism in which cinema, not without reason, lives today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Rather dire and very contrived,"In all the various international versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? a few things remain constant. One of those things is that the show is not broadcast live. Except in this movie. That's just the first of many contrivances you have to be willing to accept if you're going to watch Slumdog Millionaire. This movie asks you to believe so many unbelievable things. The fact that the game show upon which the whole plot is centered plays out in a way that is quite frankly impossible is a problem. The game show being broadcast live isn't the only issue. Other key moments of the game within the movie play out in a way which, back in the real world, simply could not and would not happen. So the very heart of the movie brings with it incredible flaws. Some may say let it go, it's just a movie, you're thinking too much. That would probably be easier if the setup of the game show itself was the only major contrivance. It's not. This movie piles contrivance upon contrivance to the point the whole thing strains credulity.The movie tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Mumbai slums who rather unbelievably is on the verge of winning Millionaire's grand prize. The show's host certainly doesn't believe it. He's convinced Jamal is cheating and hands him over to the police who are to beat the truth out of him. Doctors, lawyers, the best and brightest of India's society have gone on the show and been stumped. But Jamal, the simple slumdog, somehow has all the answers. And we, and his interrogators, are about to find out how exactly that came to be. We flashback to Jamal's childhood and then, as we watch him grow into a man, see the incidents in his life which enabled him to know the answers to every question he was asked. It's an interesting story to be sure but so contrived in so many ways. It's just too perfect that every question has a corresponding event in Jamal's life. And the fact that the key incidents in Jamal's life proceed chronologically in the same order in which the corresponding questions are asked on the show? Very convenient that. This whole movie has more than a hint of impossibility to it.So it's contrived but maybe that's OK because Slumdog Millionaire is, as the film's marketing breathlessly tells you, the feel-good film of the decade. Really? This is the most bleak, dire feel-good movie I've ever seen. Jamal has led a life filled with unimaginable hardship. Hardship which is portrayed in unsparing, brutal fashion. People love a rags-to-riches underdog story and that's what we have here. But if the film is destined to be ultimately inspiring, and that's clearly what the filmmakers are going for, it sure is rather depressing along the way. Depressing and all too often not particularly entertaining. The flashback structure comes off as somewhat gimmicky and robs the film of much of its momentum. You're interested in Jamal's story but never completely captivated. There's not enough energy in the movie for it to really grab you. The key romantic storyline falls a little flat as the girl over whom Jamal obsesses is someone who in actuality he hardly knows at all. For most of his life he has had no relationship whatsoever with this girl. That makes it hard to sell this as some kind of great romance. Eventually the flashbacks catch up to Jamal's present-day life which sets up the big conclusion. But by that point the movie has kind of fizzled out. It's already been robbed of any joy that it might have had. Honestly the only time this movie enjoys itself at all is during the closing credits. And by then it's much too late. It's not as much of a feel-good movie as it's purported to be. It's certainly not as entertaining or enjoyable as it could have been. And the story is so contrived. Honestly if you think about it the whole thing doesn't make much sense at all. Somehow despite all of that the movie doesn't fail completely. There's enough good stuff here to make the movie passable but that's about it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A very different coming of age story!,"This is an interesting concept, where a young man's life is being told through questions from the 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' game show.Confused? Quite clever, really: Jamal (Dev Patel) knows the answers to all the questions. Fearing he might be cheating, he is being interrogated by the Police before the final question. As he explains how he knows all the answers, his life is shown through flash backs, relating to each of the questions. (I found the police methods unjust and would have sued them if they treated me in this manner!).The film also illustrates the difficult and sad lives of homeless children, and the greed of people who control them (in this instance). 'Slumdog Millionaire' touches on many different elements. This is a well written story, with excellent cinematography and sound. I also loved the soundtrack. Dev Patel is excellent as Jamal.'Slumdog Millionaire' is an inspirational, feel-good movie with a beautiful ending. Be sure to watch the credits for the musical finale. This is an awesome movie!

The best Bolly Wood film. Not that its worth talking about.,"Case and point. Bolly wood is twenty to thirty years behind Hollywood. It basically copies 80s movies/TV and poor rap/tecno. Quite frankly it sucks.So, SlumDog... Great, or another Bollywood blunder. Well this movie is done well for its back grounds. It seems to mix Forest Gump with a game show. There are small differences, but not much from a far. Except this movie has huge plot holes that everyone seems to forget. Even the professional critics. This movie is a good movie, but not a great one.The movie starts with a young Indian man being accused of cheating on Who wants to be a millionaire. So they go through how he knows the answers. This is not a spoiler, thats the movie. See my disappointment. But I was told the directing was what made it. Hmmmm. I didn't see that. Terantino in Pulp Fiction was what made it. But this is well directed. I don't care what awards it own. Titanic won before, and other big budget movies won that don't deserve a thing. So those who oppose me here, look at this. Each question was asked in chronological order to when he knew the answer. No matter what your interpretation is, thats crap. How, how does that happen? Further more his brother would help him, after all that happens. And the way it happens reminds me of a stupid 70s action movie. Not even fitting with the character. The ending seems like it couldn't happen and is unexplainable. I mean if you won would you be in a train terminal? You can't excuse these problems, and there is more.What left is the struggle of a Slumdog. I think thats why Americans like it. They can't believe that there is a place like that. So thank the directors India for making you look like a third word country who dosn't care for your people. Its ashame, because the film makers don't try to use it for this effect. They obviously wanted a more dramatic appeal. Like Hollywoods Boy N the Hood, or gangster movies. So instead of the problem at hand, the actors, producers, and directors capitalize on the very people they are portraying.This movie seems like a good movie, but when up against debate brittle. But, in reality it should be a ashamed of it self. Oh and like all Bollywood crap this movie features crappy dancing at the end. Why is there dancing in a drama like this? Could you imagine at the end of Shawshank, Freeman and Robins dancing? I think it would lose points. Under first impression you could be thinking this a decent movie, but give a chance and the crappy direction and righting gleams through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The overall Oscar contender for Best Picture of 2008, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is simply brilliant","The Indian police are faced with a quandary: How could a street urchin from the slums of Mumbai accomplish what doctors and college graduates have been unable to do-win the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" This is the mystery at the heart of this feel-good fairy tale from director Danny Boyle,the man who directed such memorable classics as ""Trainspotting"",""A Life Less Ordinary"",""Sunshine""(the Oscar winner of 2006),and was the helm behind the science fiction/horror thriller ""28 Days Later"". ""Slumdog Millionaire"" works on all levels as simply brilliant as a forerunner of the 2008 Oscar race for Best Picture. One question away from winning 20 million rupees,Jamal(Dev Patel)is arrested on the suspicion of cheating. In order how to explain how an uneducated orphan could know the answers to the questions faced on the show,Jamal is forced to recount his life story for his interrogators. He must provide them with explanations for each answer has has correctly given,up to the penultimate question.The real star of the film is the city of Mumbai which is gorgeously brought to life by Boyle's expert work. The overcrowded slums breathe energy into the film's atmosphere as the cameras careen in and out of the narrow streets of Mumbai's shantytowns. The city is characterized by extremes that define and parallel Jamal's life. Although each life-altering experience conveniently provides Jamal with the knowledge he needs later in life,the movie never feels overly contrived. The script weaves an engaging tale of penury,love and friendship. Jamal's life hurtles from extreme poverty to obscene wealth,but he is a character the audience will root for the entire way.The film is intentionally gimmicky. It really casts a life of horror and squalor as an upbeat love story. But because the film never tries to be anything but an entertaining rags-to-riches narrative,it succeeds beautifully in every detail.

Review,"Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British drama film directed by Danny Boyle, written by Simon Beaufoy, and produced by Christian Colson.Set and filmed in India, it is a loose adaptation of the novel Q & A (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup, telling the story of Jamal Malik, age 18, from the Juhu slums of Mumbai. As a contestant on the Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' who is able to answer every stage correctly, as a result he is accused of cheating. Jamal recounts his history, illustrating how he is able to answer each question.I like this film very much, I actually watched it twice.

I liked the music in this film too because in general I like the indian music.I think that people who like true stories should watch it although it's sad.

A mind blowing thriller.,"Thriller, or I would say, a rare instance of permutations and combinations, to the point where everything fits perfect. No doubts it can do wonders, let alone making one slum dweller, millionaire. Though these instances are rare and so are these one night rags to riches people.When KBC was on air in 2000's, I used to think how much money they are splurging with every episode. That was the first TV serial solar raining money on people. Earlier and even today the most I see any TV or radio program giving out to people is a meager movie or a restaurant pass worth a couple of hundred bucks. On the other hand it was giving crores to people per episode. After watching this movie came to realise that winning 1Cr is once in a blue moon scenario not everybody wins 1Cr, most settle for thousands, and what the show runners are making is a fortune because the TRP is so high that they still make much more than what they give.The movie is so beautiful, so full of emotions and so full of the real world and how the not so privileged live. Whenever I went to Taj or any festival or a Show I used to think that what was in front of my eyes was the only thing that was going on but what goes on behind the curtains is an altogether different world, that's totally opposite to what we see and this movie is is a window to that world. It shows you what you are not supposed to, at least as expected by the society.Music is amazing and so are the visuals and the acting by the child stars especially those kids from the slums was terrific, and it was so real that in some scenes they don't seem to be acting, seeming more like the real characters.Dev Patel was great for a debutant and so was Freida Pinto.

Review Slumdog Millionaire,"Slumdog Millionaire is a love and drama film, released in 2008. It is directed by Danny Boyle and it is starred by Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Irrfan Khan and Madhur Mittal. The film is set in India: Mumbai and Dharavi.
The action takes place in India, and is the story of Jamal, a young man from the slums of Mumbai who participates in the contest ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" He goes much further than expected, arousing the suspicions of the presenter and the police. During the film, it shows how Jamal knows the answers to the questions and how he signed up for the show in hopes of finding Latika, his old childhood friend. The film is based on the novel: Q&A by Vikas Swarup.
I love the acting and the story line in this film. My favorite character is Jamal Malik, who impressed me with his past.

a film that will show you another world,"This is a wonderful film that is a thrilling movie experience. The art of film is so fantastic because it combines elements of painting, uses music, is like the theater but beyond it, and has a magical metaphorical level as well. This film is an excellent example of this multi-level art form. The story is a simple one about a lost child. and his fate in the world. Set in the sprawling slums of Bombasy (Mumbai), the plot is based on a Charles Dickens like melodrama. The other part of the story deals with the consequences of the child's early life. The whole story line is driven by an absolute wonderful energy that is really irresistible. I found myself drifting only at the very end when I felt the whole machine had simply run out of time and plausibility. Never the less, this is film is a delight that should not be missed. Luckily I was able to watch it with a friend of Indian heritage, and I think she will be able to answer some of the deeper cultural questions that it poses. What is sure is that few films move across such a rainbow tapestry of cultural, political and artistic canvases with such verve and power. I wish there was something this fun to watch every week.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"I think this movie has been overrated. Maybe it is appealing to the Western audience but for someone who is used to seeing the grandiosity of Indian movies, it is not clear why the movie has got such rave reviews.A.R. Rahman's soundtrack is good, though not clearly his best. I think the lyricist could have done better though (Personally, I think ""Jai Ho"" did not fit well with the song's tune, which I thought was pretty good overall).Anil Kapoor overacts his way to glory, and the movie could have done without him. Amitabh might have been better suited to the role - he was the original KBC host, after all.Having said that, the movie is watchable. But Oscar worthy? Well, I leave that for the committee to decide.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Average enough, but a bit mis-sold as a ""feel good"" film","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSlumdog Millionaire is not a conventional 'rags to riches' film. That is, to say, it's not a rags to riches story told in a conventional way. It doesn't play out like the sort of heart warming family tale that you could sit down and enjoy your Sunday roast with that the genre is famous for following the convention of. Indeed, it feels a tad mis-sold with the front cover loudly proclaiming it 'a feel good film.' Instead, it unflinchingly takes us feet first into the cold and unfeeling world of the poverty and desperation of the slums of India that are as awful as those in, say, Jamaica. It's strange as India does statistically have a stronger economy than the UK, not to mention being much bigger than us, yet it's still known as 'a poor country.' And Indians do have a reputation as quite affable, gentle people. Yet SM shows us some of the more unsavoury ones who are truly rotten eggs. Which brings us onto another downbeat aspect of the film, in the shape of a truly unsettling scene involving a child being blinded so more pity will be taken on him as a beggar. It takes a nasty jolt like this to wake us up to the true human cost going on behind the poorness and despair, and the parasitic exploitation that festers behind it.Indeed, The News of the World ran the story of how the child stars were made to return to their lives of poverty after the film enjoyed Oscar night and how the father of one of them was even driven to sell them so she could have a better life. There is poverty in the UK, but I can't imagine a situation where a child would be sold out of poverty. All in all, the film serves as a depressing eye opener to the unseen world of India and you come away with less of an impression of having seen a 'feel good' film and indeed actually having seen quite a downbeat and disturbing one. That's not to say it doesn't have it's more positive moments or that it's any less involving, just you go in for one thing and come out with something a bit different. And that never works for me. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It is Written,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a terrific story and interesting film to watch! One of my favorite overlooked films of the past five years is ""Millions"", also directed by Danny Boyle (best known for ""Trainspotting""). The screenplay is by Simon Beaufoy (""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"" and ""The Full Monty"") and is based on Vikas Swarup's novel ""Q&A"". Not really sure how to describe this other than a classic love story wrapped in a rags-to-riches story of survival.We get a glimpse of India's underbelly without it being a guilt-ridden social statement. The movie is actually three parts interwoven beautifully. The working class pauper is having a nice run of success on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". Of course his success brings with it the assumption of cheating. As he is being wickedly tortured and questioned by the police, we are provided flashbacks into Jamal's childhood which explain each of the answers he ""miraculously"" knows.The only actor most American audiences will recognize is Irfan Khan as the sadistic police interrogator. Mr. Khan will be remembered as the wise father in ""The Namesake"". Despite that, the acting is superb and we are treated to story lines of our three main characters at three different stages in their life.This is purely expert film-making with a creative and multi-faceted story. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who enjoys interesting entertainment and appreciates Mr. Boyle's expertise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Most of the way an exhilarating, visually blinding rags-to-riches tale!","In contemporary Mumbai, teenage telemarketing company clerk Jamal gets a shot at winning the jackpot on the famous TV quiz show ""Who wants to be a millionaire""... and after suspicions of how a poor, uneducated slumdog like him can get so far, he is arrested, accused of cheating.Oscar-winning, widely praised urban rags-to-riches story gets a tremendous boost from the ingenious, dream-like (yet not too unrealistic) idea of connecting Jamal's ability to know the answers with crucial details of his hard childhood as an orphan, beggar and petty thief. Most of the time an exhilarating movie, filled with both harrowing and joyful scenes of impoverished street children's conditions.Told like a blindingly visual tornado, swirlingly paced, edited and photographed, in the similar style - and in bits, theme - of ""City of God"". It could have used more of that latter film's jagged edge, though, as the overall impact is marred by slightly sugary and conventional finale and the one-dimensionality of surrounding characters: The bad guys are extremely bad, and the role of Latika is unfortunately diminished into a flat love interest without a personality of her own. Still extremely sympathetic and an interesting comparison to ""Salaam Bombay"".7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Bollywood sprinkled Hollywood movie - must watch!,"The making of the film is very Hollywood, but the script is very Bollywood! And I don't mean anything in a sarcastic way - this is truly an amazing collaboration!The Bollywood has been producing dreamy, Utopian, feel-good (or sometimes bad), heart-over-mind, good-over-evil scripts for ages, and it has not only worked for thriving industry, but is slowly expanding way beyond Indian subcontinent. So something that appeals to may be couple of billions of people can't be wrong - can it?On the other hand, Hollywood takes keen interest in realistic, mind-over-heart, fact-over-belief scripts. Nothing wrong with that either.This movie brings the best of both - you cannot afford to miss it. The story will keep you engaged from the word go. Very able acting by the newcomers, Dev Patel (Jamal) as a spl mention.

Deserves all the praise it's receiving!!!,"I was hesitant to watch this movie but I am really glad I did! Being Indian, I have watched several Hindi movies and figured all the praise this movie was receiving was because it was different from any Hollywood movie. I thought the experience would not be as memorable for me and that it would be similar to some Bollywood movie I have watched in the past. I was dead wrong. This movie is in a league of its own... a truth people want to ignore. There are moments you want cry and moments you want to laugh. You really feel for the main protagonist, Jamal. His story is unbelievable.What makes your heart stir is the fact that his story of pain is not so fictional to several in Mumbai. This is not merely a story about Jamal on India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire... it's a story about a child who survived the worst obstacles of poverty.

What's not to like about this enjoyable movie?,"I'm not a fan of TV game shows. So the premise of this movie was not appealing. But the game show is only a backdrop to this movie.

Simply a great film,"Slumdog Millionaire seamlessly combines an expose of the Darwinian struggle for survival among the abandoned poor children of urban India with an underdog's struggle against all odds and a touching romance. It portrays an India that is as attractive and modern as it is archaic and repulsive. Astonishingly it even succeeds in presenting Indian police as both brutal and sympathetic, both the guardians and prisoners of a corrupt society. Finally, it manages to be both angry and yet hopeful and even proud of India, an indictment and a celebration of all that is ugly and beautiful about this newly emerging service superpower. It is great entertainment, great education, great drama and even great comedy. In short, it is simply a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Slumdog Millionaire a Pathway to Oscar ! A clear winner,"Excellent, superb, fantastic is the word that I wanna use for director Danny Boyle.This time he has picked up a completely different subject to portray unlike his previous films. While watching through the entire movie I was amazed how closely this person was able to capture small moments that mesmerizes our minds and stays on for a while. Great job done. Most of us were amazed and asking this question to me whether this movie was actually made by Danny Boyle or by some Indian director. Never ever throughout this movie you'll feel that this movie has been directed by a Hollywood director.The treatment and the feel of the movie was awesome. This one will not knock the doors for Oscar but would rather kick the doors and break it down until its open and I mean it. This is one movie which cannot go unnoticed. In my own words I see many shades of ""Salaam Bombay"" which earned India its 2nd Oscar nomination, but this was better than Salaam Bombay and even not as depressing as Salaam Bombay. It has fantastic and soothing ending unlike Salaam Bombay.Performance wise the heart and soul of the movie has to be the 2 small kids from the where the movie starts off, they were so natural and the best part was that they reminded us the actual 80's & 90's feel yet not depressing and it has its life on it own which is immortal.The movie has already been praised outside India. But I'm highly disappointed by the producers as its not been promoted in India to large extent which it surely deserves. This movie needs a high promotion just like Ghajini as it is the only best movie of 2008 if try to compare it with any movie that has released in 2008 so far.You'll have to watch it to believe.

Best Film of the Year,"When it comes to a film like Slumdog Millionaire, we're not watching for an end result, because we already know how it'll end. It's almost comforting, in a way, knowing the best will become of our characters. The film isn't about waiting for some sappy ending, but about building up and culminating a story to enthrall us till the end. And the journey found here is exhilarating. It tells a story that requires us to become a child once more to relate. We don't just sit back and watch, the tale evokes our own memories of grief, hope, and love in a way of contrast. You undergo a truly personal experience with this movie. None other this year has come close to the stirring magic this incites. It doesn't tell a love story, but rather a story of love, friendship, and destiny, tangled up in a web of poverty, greed, and deception. Simply beautiful, sad, inspirational, and brilliant film.

enjoyable if occasionally outlandish melodrama,"Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century. The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India. Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate. In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.Based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up so much money as a contestant on ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating. With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next it's indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition. Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset. Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters. And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Undoubtedly the best movie of 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is a story of a guy named Jamal Malik who is on a show called ""Who wants to be Millionaire"" hosted by Prem Kumar.

"Stellar, unexpected","This is a stellar movie, but not for the reasons one might expect. The acting is fair, with more seasoned actors Kapoor and Khan stealing the show from the leads. The screenplay sounds stilted at times. The plot is a bit flashy and hard to focus. What makes Slumdog a stellar movie is the portrayal of the Mumbai slums and the tenacity of the human spirit. This movie doesn't treat the slum dwellers as helpless victims--instead, it portrays the people of Juhu as full of energy and life, even as they struggle to survive. This movie also brings to light real-life tragedies such as child prostitution and the maiming of children to increase their value as beggars. Granted, it's unlikely that two children as traumatized as Jamal and Latika would end up looking like supermodels at VT station. Also, the movie took some liberties with the gangster-themed second half of the film, where Jamal's brother has become a powerful figure in the underworld. However, these considerations aside, this movie explodes with life and energy, beautifully portraying the triumph of love and the human spirit over great suffering and great evil.http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Amazing Movie,"Slumdog Millionaire is the story of Jamal Malik, a slum dweller from Mumbai and his travails that culminates in him landing as the winner of 20 million rupees in a game show and eventually joining is true love.As such, the movie is not a masterpiece or a piece of gem that has been conjured out of thin air. It is a Bollywood movie told Hollywood style.What makes 'Slumdog Millionaire' stand apart is that it is not the run of the mill story that we have been used to over the years. Even in projection of the poverty and the way of life in slums, there is a celebration of the manner in which their conditions are portrayed rather than merely making an attempt to provoke and elicit sympathy of the viewers.The big plus of the movie is its style of narration. Its racy, its engaging and it shifts from one frame to another so fast that your emotional curve will also keep hopping very quickly. Before you start to think of crying, you will be laughing, before you soak in the anguish of the pain or suffering of the characters, you will be intensely absorbed in what is about to unfold next.The movie, as it is originally derived from Vikas Swarup's novel, is a kind of page turner. The editing, screenplay has been woven so well to suit the medium of cinema and keep the interest level of the audience very high without letting them droop even for one moment.For all these reasons, Slumdog Millionaire is notable, yet it is these very reasons that don't make it a hardcore attempt at unraveling the layers of life of the Indian poor.And for the argument of those who say it is a commercial potboiler that exploits the story of the slums to make moolah, they cannot be more wrong. Nowhere has there been an attempt made to glorify the life of its characters in a manner such that it would be deemed as exploitative.Rahman's music is different and vibrant, but it is loud and glaring for the most part. Those who have been mesmerized by the dream music of Rahman will certainly feel it is not his best but who cares? Do the best works always fetch you awards? The awards are more of a recognition of Rahman's talent and it is high time the world took notice of the Mozart of Madras .Cinematography is painstakingly beautiful and suits that vacillating pattern in which the story unfolds. There is one factor that has sat pretty well for the movie though no one will ever want to fathom that connection. Mumbai has been in the news after the 26/11 attacks and so a film with Mumbai as its soul is bound to grab everyone's attention and surely it has grabbed the eyeballs of the Oscar jury by its retina can I say? Everybody in the film has done their role neatly but the pick of the lot was the boy who played the youngest of Jamal, the protagonist of the movie. With his natural performance, abundance of energy and mischievous smile, he steals the show.Go watch it, for it is path breaking in the sense that it will tell Bollywood film makers the way to tell enchanting stories minus the usual formula. Leave all your pretensions and see the film with an open mind and you are bound to enjoy it. After all who will not like to see the rise of an underdog?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Absolute Best Film of the Year! The one you can't miss!,"Truthfully, I didn't want to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater on Christmas Day but my sister wanted to see this film.

The casting was perfect with three actors playing the main role of Jamal Malik who goes from the slums of India to possibly becoming the first person to win the grand prize in Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? In the beginning, he is suspected to have been caught cheating and is interrogated for the night quite harshly but it's nothing compared to his life. He works as a gopher for a telemarketing office in Mumbai which is India's Hollywood. There is a reason for everything and the film is well-thought out and executed to perfection. The young actor who plays Jamal is brilliant in the role. Everybody in the film really delivers as well as the thousands of extras. Of course, there are difficult scenes to watch but I won't go there and spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I can see why this film is a front-runner for the Oscars.

"Hip teenage story, morally weak","On the upside, the directing and editing for this movie is quite good, totally deserving of the nominations. The ""hip"" titled camera angle is rather gratuitous, but overall the cinematography is a plus point. The music is interesting, but not outstanding. Now for the downside, this is meant to be an entertaining, feel good movie. Yet it contains one particularly violent scene that can be mood-snuffer. (Those who watched it know which one I'm talking about). None of the ""good"" characters in the movie are morally strong enough to the challenge the violence that they face. (Alert the police or something for Pete's sake!) I can't say more on this point without making this comment a spoiler. On the other hand, the children violence portrayed is worse than child-slavery, and I doubt it can exist in this day and age. Yet the film shows it for the sake of thrilling the audience. In my humble opinion, I highly disapprove of this. All in all, this movie is an achievement in the artistic point of view, but the morally weak story will not make the hype last long enough to be a classic. If Rocky (one of my favorites) gets 8.0 rating, I think number 7 is a generous rating for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An ode to humanity,"Danny Boyle does it again! While being grossly under-appreciated in Hollywood circles, this generation's answer to Frank Capra, Steven Spielberg and Francois Truffault has crafted yet another masterpiece for the Generations X and Y crowd, in the vein of ""Trainspotting"", ""Millions"" and ""28 Days Later"". With visuals reminiscent of ""City of God"", a soundtrack straight out of the hippest clubs of London and a tale which is both evocative of Charles Dickens (in it's depiction of the poor and the slums) and Sinclair Lewis (with his social commentary on ""Progress"" with a capital P), Boyle has finally brought India to mainstream Hollywood and North America. This film will become a historical document as Mumbai itself is the backdrop of the story and we witness the transformation of that city from 3rd world mega-city backwater, to being on the verge of becoming one of this century's financial and cultural hubs, along with Beijing and Dubai. As Asia takes center stage as it shakes off centuries of colonial-imposed self- doubt and lack of confidence, Boyle has masterfully delivered a narrative for the ages on the cost of progress, both morally and historically and on the redemptive power of true love. The cast of largely unknown actors were first-class with an exceptionally talented group of children. It may sound sad at first glance, a story about kids growing up in slums etc. but in actuality this is a film of exuberance, full of life, intensity and joy and to paraphrase Richard Corlis of Time, an ode to humanity.

What ? Best Movie of the Year According to Outsourced Hollywood,"This was a terrible movie. I was really glad when the ending credits started to roll. I felt like I was dumped into India and forced to endure the misery of it. This movie was really disturbing to watch; never want to see children abused and watching their mother being killed. I do not care about any of the characters in this movie. Why was the main character in love with this girl? He fell in love with her when he was 10 and never stopped loving her? The love was so powerful that he was willing to risk his life to get her into his life....very unbelievable and strange. I was not moved in a positive way by this movie. This movie makes me not want to ever visit India, to never embrace its culture, to never want to have anything to do with it. The people of India should be angry about this movie. It paints a very negative image of the country and its people. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences really got it wrong with this one.

Not Worthy of Best Picture,"I won't deny, this was a pretty good movie, but it definitely did not deserve to win Best Picture. It has some good themes on love and struggle through life, but it doesn't really evoke any strong emotions from you.The movie was made well, good editing, some really funny scenes, some very dramatic scenes, but nothing that will leave you completely awestruck. It is original with a pretty good plot line, but not the best. There were other movies that came out in 2008 that deserved that Oscar more than this one. A Best Picture movie is one that you will watch over and over because you were either extremely entertained or deeply moved by it. This movie has both qualities, entertainment and deep thought, but in moderation.

Great movie.,"I think this movie is superb. It totally draw my attention. I watched most of the movies from IMDb top 250 list and this movies totally deserves this ratio. Some are envy and so they say its overrated, but they are wrong. Story is great, interesting from start to finish. Movie is shoot well, biography is well written. Other countries can make great movies.Camera work is great, there are some elements of action and story also portrays difficult life of some young children in India. The biggest factor in my jugment was that movie was constantly draving my interest and attention, what is rare.I give it 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Top ten reasons Slumdog Millionaire is a mediocre movie:,"(With redeeming qualities in cinematography, acting, music and sharp editing.)(And please spare me the hate mail.)10. 20,000,000 rupees is ""only"" about $411,000.9. No toilet paper in the outhouses.8. All the kids are healthy looking with nice teeth.7. Latika experiences no sexual abuse!6. No (gaunt) slum dogs are seen.5. ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" is not a live show in India.4. After step five the contestant does not lose ""everything"" with a wrong answer.3. The questions were in chronological order of his life!2. Police in India TORTURE people if they think they're cheating TV shows?1. Giving a $100 bill to Arvind would be giving it to the hated men who blinded him.Additionally I wonder: Did the copyright owners of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" okay this? I mean, would Regis Philbin or Meredith Vieira try to cheat a contestant? Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India. Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives. And, incidentally, by the way things are going, there is an enormous mountain of poverty to come worldwide, degrading much of humanity.(But, hey, I just got the DVD to be entertained. I don't need to hear about the troubles of the world.)(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Horribly Overrated,"As an Indian this movie is completely insulting.No one in Mumbai is referred to as a 'slumdog'. The movie is wildly inaccurate. From the weak Quiz show questions, to the child who doesn't vomit when drenched in feces, to the depiction of gang life in India. This movie isn't just fiction, it's absurd fantasy.The love story is about as believable as a Saturday morning cartoon.That anyone should walk away from this film believing it's decent film is itself a tragedy.This film is a reflection of Hollwood's white liberal guilt.

What a surprisingly great film,"Danny Boyle, director of Trainspotting, has done it again with a vastly different in content but similar in style film. It's got all of Boyle's edgy editing and use of music, but the content is about how a poor boy from Mumbai goes through several hardships to wind up on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? He appears on the show solely to find the love of his life, Latika, whom he met a very young age, but circumstances and his ambiguous brother, Salim have kept them apart.This film has lots of fun parts, but also lots of tense drama and suspense actually with a brilliant concept of using flashbacks to show their affect on his chances on the TV show.I walked in knowing nothing about this film, but was blown away by the end. My only fault is that the film is a little contrived, but beyond it's one of the best movies you'll see of 2008. I highly recommend you go see it where you can.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""A Bollywood/Hollywood"" Romeo and Juliet","All the buzz here in Los Angeles for Danny Boyle's brilliant SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is absolutely right on the money for this Fox Searchlight film and ""sure-to-be"" Oscar Nom for Best Picture.

It is just so exciting when you find a jewel of a film in SLUMDOG that brings such tremendously interesting characters to the screen.

Great Movie,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of 'Indian Forrest Gump' by loosely basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the 'rags to riches' trope in what is an incredible watch.Incredible to Brilliant Direction, Very Good Acting (Great from Dev Patel, Good from Freida Pinto, Great from Anil Kapoor, Great from Irrfan Khan, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Great from Kids, Good from adults, Decent from teenagers)), Incredible Story (A mix of bollywood with hollywood in a telling of 'Indian' Forrest Gump; also, the narrative and the story points molding together was extremely well done), Great to Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue during the non-romantic parts were incredible while the romantic parts were not as well done; the symbolism of how Jamal was able to use life experiences to be a true rags to riches was incredible), Great Score/Incredible Soundtrack, Great Cinematography, Good Sound, Incredible Editing, Great Production Design (shows the poorer parts of india (rest was also good)), Pacing was good but a bit inconsistent (slow during the childhood, extremely fast during the teenage years, decently fast during the adult years); runtime was a bit long but not terrible (probably could have cut out a few sequences), The build to the climax was incredible with the actual climax being extremely tense and modeling how bollywood climaxes are usually; the resolution was a bit poor in its execution and the movie could have ended with the climax (though the bollywood sequence at the end was a nice touch), The incredible nature of the movie is how the plot points throughout the movie connect at the end and during the competition (even though there aren't any deeper meanings in the movie); it is important to note that many of the elements of the movie is incredibly unlikely to happen (like people from the slums learning fluent English)",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Do I dare dislike the Slumdog? Yes.,"Let's get this straight. I am not here to write an article demeaning the credits of Indian film composer A.R.Rahman and artistic colleagues Resul Pookutty and Gulzar Sahab for winning so many Oscars; lyricist Gulzar being my favourite among them. I simply want to raise a few questions which came to mind during all the hype about much raved about movie Slumdog Millionaire.The hype to me seems rooted in an age old colonial legacy returning, this time in the form of a film.I am not seeking cheap publicity by just being different and running against the tide. And as for the matter of stirring up controversies, though that is a part of my job as a reporter in a democracy, I am ready to face the brickbats.First of all let's get to the point of the identity of the movie. Slumdog is essentially being promoted as a victory for Indian cinema. Get your trousers unfolded folks...it is NOT Indian cinema. The film is a jointly-produced British-American film. Danny Boyle, the director of the movie, said in an interview on Oscar night, that while he is enjoying the the popularity in India, in reality, Slumdog is a completely British film, with all the basic crewmen, concept and funding being British.Hell, right...but probably he also forgot another important thing...Dev Patel, the lead actor and hero of the movie, is a British-born Indian citizen of Britain and in all practical purposes cannot speak his mother tongue properly, let alone Hindi. Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, applauded the movie and its subsequent clean sweep at the prestigious red carpet awards, along with Kate Winslet winning the best actress, as a tremendous victory for the British film industry.Wasn't it expected? Attempts on my part to say anything against Slumdog might be dubbed ""unpatriotic"". But frankly, I don't see any glory and patriotism in celebrating a film, the name of which itself seems derogatory to me and which is almost entirely crewed by foreigners. (No justification for Resul Pookutty for invoking the ""my country, my civilisation"" in his Oscar acceptance speech). Is it a poverty-porn movie? Well maybe not to that extent but, make no mistake, developing world poverty is definitely a sellable commodity on the trendy cultural Western scene.Would the film have been equally popular had it been based on a white slum dweller of Europe or Australia, or a trailer park inhabitant of America? The answer is NO...hard but true. This is no rags to riches story folks, wake up...it only sold because it is based on the Mumbai slums of third world India, the ultimate subject to cash in on.And now we come to the storyline, my favourite part to dissect. A lot of genuine good stories are ignored (comparison of Slumdog with the films Milk, Benjamin Button and The Reader is like comparing a James Hadley Chase book with one by Charles Dickens. To define it in cinematic terminology, Slumdog is an old fashioned, highly clichÃ©d, ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back"" story.What is so great about it then? I am not sure. The acting is amateurish, Frieda Pinto the love interest in the movie is a diva, who acts as a femme fatale in real life too by dumping her long term boyfriend for glamour, post the Slumdog success (but then that is her personal life). Dev Patel is kiddish and Irfan Khan, the only good genuine actor of the lot, is wasted. And yeah, Anil Kapoor who starred in Slumdog, wouldn't have been given a chance had Danny Boyle been an Indian director.I mean please, first Shilpa Shetty and now Anil Kapoor, don't we have any worthy and notable acting talents in India? To me the only stars in the film were the two little kids from Dharavi, who were probably seeing a movie camera for the first time and came through the experience better than the grown ups.The recipe for success, of selling this kind of a fairy tale underdog story, is time tested. I give more credit to the film Elizabeth by Shekhar Kapoor which was shot in England, made its way to the Oscars and was censored in India, with no hype regarding that whatsoever. How ironic it is that similar films are made by Indian film makers, but don't get the needed success at the box office, yet an improbable far- fetched creation from a British brain is acclaimed and worshipped.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A movie bollywood is INCAPABLE of making,"I am disappointed with all the Indian nationalistic thumping that is going on here and rating this movie low.Danny Boyle is an excellent director and he showed his skills and sincerity to the job making this movie.

It's Not Really THAT Good...,"Solid, fun, exuberant, vibrant, and over-rated. Good times, but im conflicted about this. Unique setting for a well worn subject, rags to riches, star crossed lovers, betrayal, destiny, etc. Pop culture inspired, music and TV shows which cross cultural boundaries. Novel narrative structure, and use of flashbacks. Its fun, and not every movie is. It's engrossing and over all enjoyable, it will please most, and I was smiling at the end.Its a good pop corn, movie fun, light, you could pop it in on a bad day, and be whisked off. I don't think its fair to say don't nitpick this cus its nice, it is, but its not perfect, and its being hailed as the best thing since sliced bread. Its a great romantic comedy though, and as an exercises in genre, it works well. The torture sequences really weren't as brutal or prolonged as they were being made out to be(not that any torture would be easy).The signature scene is the boy dipped in s&#t, to get his heroes autographs(its referenced at the end too), sometimes you have to suffer, wade through crap, to get what you really want. But the ""it is written"" ending was a cop out, a pleasant one, but it is what it is. At the end the tea server, is rich and gets a hot girlfriend, bad guys kill each other, just like ""True Romance"". I'ts romantic and boisterous as a Bollywood song, and depending on your mood, just as cheesy or as colorful.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Slumdog Millionaire,"Slumdog Millionaire is based upon the novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup. The film takes place in India and is centered around a young man named Jamal Malik who has just made it onto the Indian version of the popular television game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the show goes along we are told in flashback scenes of Jamal growing up in the slums of India and eventually falling in love with a girl named Latika. Jamal's past experiences whether they were good, or bad, have helped shape his life and provide the answers to many of the questions in the television game show that he is now on. Jamal has had a lot of difficult times in his life, but through personal growth and determination he wants to take the top prize and get in touch with Latika who he has not seen for years. Early last fall I remember reading on several different movie websites that Slumdog was definitely going to be nominated for several Oscars and become a huge crowd pleasing hit. Back at that time I knew very little about the film, but those early predictions were right as the film is now nominated for ten Oscars, has won tons of other awards and is on many critics' top ten lists as one of the best films of last year. I wanted to see the film quite badly, so I repeatedly e-mailed my local theatre to see if they would get the film. They replied back with an article from The New York Times entitled Films Reach Theaters a Drib Here, Drab There by Michael Cieply. The theatre closest to my home did not get Slumdog, but another one not so far away did and that is where I saw it. Overall, I quite liked it. I would not go as far as saying it is one of my favourite films of the year, or the best of the nominated films, but I did like it. The script having been based on a novel is very original and I liked how we saw Jamal grow up in a very harsh and disturbing way, but to grow out of it and become what could be a huge star. The film shows the greed, corruption and danger he has to go through along the way and I found it all quite interesting and it almost played out like a modern day fable with a good lead character, many villains and untrustworthy people along the way as well as a big prize at stake. Not too mention the love story aspect of the script as well. All of this worked for me and did a fairly good job of keeping my interest and involving me with the characters and the story. Visually this film was quite spectacular as well. It had a gritty tone in some scenes and is bright and illuminated in others. The cinematography, visuals and fast paced editing gave the film a certain style and I for one really liked it and found it appropriate to the story and overall movie. A lot of the actors in the film did quite a good job and I think the location shooting in India shooting the scenes showing Jamal's upbringing was quite well done and needs to be acknowledged as well. Sometimes, I felt Slumdog had a little more style than it did an involving story, but there were still times where I was quite fascinated by what was going on in front of me and there was so much to admire here that I found it hard not to give this film a favourable review. While not my favourite film of the year I still found lots to like about Slumdog Millionaire and for the more curious of filmgoers it is definitely worth seeing once, or perhaps twice to truly appreciate it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Will make you 'feel good', but lacking in substance","There are good and bad things about this film. First, the good things. It shows aspects of the reality of slum life in Mumbai that are routinely ignored by 'Bollywood'. In this film, we see the shacks people live in, the way they dry their clothes and how they go to the toilet, and there are allusions to prostitution and to the criminal and communal violence that can be a feature of living in the slums. We also see something of the organised nature of begging and the cruelty of those who control the child beggars. The filming is beautiful, the film is entertaining, and we can all leave on a high and feeling good about how it ends, with its underlying message of the power of love and compassion.However, the key problem with the film is that everything is captured on no more than a superficial level. There are beautiful images in the film of the Dharavi slums and the inhabitants, but they are the kind of images one would expect to see in a guidebook. In other words, these images are taken from the perspective of a tourist, and, like the tourist, the film merely scratches the surface of life in the slum. The superficiality continues in the simplistic nature of the characters and the lack of any real character development. Some of the characters are introduced to simply be one-dimensional 'baddies', such as the gangsters Maman and Javed. The plot itself is contrived, with one question on the game show leading to a 'flashback', another question leading to another 'flashback', and so on. The plot is also implausible in a number of ways. For example, it is never explained how Jamal goes from the slums to a clean-cut looking, English-speaking call centre assistant. Also, the reason for Jamal appearing on the game show is because he apparently wishes to resume contact with Latika, but we are not told how he expects Latika to contact him, given that she is being kept under lock and key by Javed.Despite these shortcomings, there is no doubt that the film manipulates the viewers' emotions in such a way that they 'feel good' after seeing the film, they feel on a high, and they love the film. However, this is a typical feature of many Bollywood films. This is what these films are designed to do. They are there to act like a drug, like alcohol or like sex to give you a kick and to make you feel good. This is not necessarily a good thing because the kick is not going to last. When I walked out of the cinema and into the supermarket, the comedown from the high I felt after seeing this fairytale left me feeling nothing but depression. Watch Slumdog and get your buzz from it, but be ready for the cold turkey as well. Somehow, I think there should be more substance to cinema than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Fantastic Insight,"I absolutely love this film. From the first minutes to the last seconds, it was breathtakingly beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time. Danny Boyle manages to capture the hectic chaos, noise, dirt, colour, vibrancy, dark and light of a Mumbai slum alongside the scenic beauty of modern India. Jamal's story is shadowed by poverty and the grimy underbelly of gangsters and guns from a very early age yet positivity always comes out from the path of unspeakably terrible things and you are left uplifted just as our protagonist is. Throughout his life, his love for Latika, the slum girl we see huddled in a puddle, shivering in a thunderstorm, brings him through whatever happens to him, and drives him to seek her out and draw them back together. The Millionaire premise is what opens and closes the film, like a bookend, the film is open and shut with the same feelings and thoughts. Happiness and love can push you through any despair. In watching this, the day to day despair you feel is infinitely superseded by the misery that Jamal and his companions have to got through, yet it is their youthful outlook to never let anything get them upset, that makes them so amazing and reminds you that as a Western world, we are incredibly self-centred and over-concerned with what is trivial, greedy for more and more when people with nothing have the ability to live each day content with the small things. The young Jamal, Salim and Latika's acting is outstandingly believable and it feels like you are an outside observer dropping in on their lives, rather than viewing a script. I cannot recommend you this film enough. The soundtrack gives me goosebumps and the trailer brings tears to my eyes. If you enjoyed City of God, you will love Slumdog Millionaire. A secret venture into the lives of people that we don't hear about enough, and that are so much more real than any of the other Hollywood blockbusters around. Truly worthy of an Academy Award.

(Most illiterates in most cities(in India) do understand English and do speak English if not perfect)Q)How did the girl learn how to drive with an abusive husband?A)The point is she has to escape, the car was given to her, for her to leave the mobile phone in the car.

One can speak language by getting used to it .. though one cannot writeQ)Since when do people tip with $100 bills, and this AFTER the people themselves have been robbed?A)The kid was winning .. he wanted to snap his host .. for making fun of him that if he has even seen a dollar bill .. again mumbai/delhi in a global village, the dollar is no rarity ..Q)Why did Amitabh Bachan play himself, but Anil Kapoor didn't? Why was the host such an ass to begin with?A)The 'amitabh' at the helicopter is not the actual Amitabh, but his look alike.

Pure Cinema,"Slumdog Millionaire is probably the best movie i have ever watched for 2009. I recommend this movie to all independent filmmakers and students who are planning to shoot their first film. Make this your inspiration as you continue reaching for your dreams.Cinematography is amazing! The angles are well defined as it reveal the highlight of the story, the slum. The cast, Dev Patel, has played a very intelligent role as well as the rest of the cast. The young and middle Jamal, and Saleem, have developed and portrayed a very realistic mood that make the story very significant. The setting, a slum part in Mumbai reflects not only in the country but the whole world. The face of the world, the reality, that 70% of countries around the world have been suffering for a long time. Poverty, prostitution, crime, violence and oppression are common and visible realities that are deliberately ignored over the years.As an aspiring film maker, I truly admire Danny Boyle for bringing this echoes of realities to the world.

Darshan do ghanshyam - India at the centre stage,"This movie is the best film of 2008 and is destined to sweep many awards , deservingly a couple of Oscars as well. It was a true cinematic treat from Danny Boyle (from Trainspotting), who has been able to bring out wide array of human emotions draped in Indian style but with a taste for universal audience.Firstly the script is every bit as interesting as a murder mystery and keeps one on his toes, a true genius from Vikas Swarup (debut novelist from India- novel ""Q&A""). Boyle doesn't go wrong anywhere from start till the end, be it the choice of the cast, the locations, the music (A.R. Rahman). The cast with small kids (espically Shyam) is truly exceptional, and so is the main lead(Dev Patel) and Irfan Khan. The movies reaches to every nook and corner of Dharavi (biggest slum in Mumbai) and tells the story of all the thousands orphans, and the tormenting life they go through.Story of a kid from slum, survives and fights his way to the top with nothing but hope.Being an Indian, i am rather sad to admit that most of it is not far from reality but i do hope that movies such as this one can help bring the wider attention to such problems and help the cause.

Good little movie.,"Slumdog Millionaire - A former street child Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) from Mumbai is arrested and questioned for knowing all of the answers on an Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" He explains, in flashbacks, his past and how he has come to know all the answers to the questions. The film is shot and diced up with three time lines: Jamal's childhood, his experience on the show, and his recounting of both to the police. It's a cool novel way to tell a story that is essentially a love story between Jamal and Latika (Frieda Pinto)The first half of the film is gritty, urban and akin to realism in aesthetics. The rundown lived in qualities of India are rich and very human. I enjoyed them in Salaam Bombay and I liked them here. It's very pleasant to see India's culture unadulterated. India is beautiful and beautifully shot. I expect this film will get many props for Cinematography. The soundtrack is also very good, with many catchy easy-to-groove-to songs. The performances are all top notch. It's a sweet little journey Jamal and his big brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) are on. They commit all sorts of trickery and get into much hi-jinx to survive.It's the main contrivance of the plot (the catch) that is irritating, and leads to the pulpy fluff of the second half. Nearly EVERY question asked on the show pertains to this young man's life in some key way? He didn't study at all? I just have to roll my eyes, and did several times. Many of the questions are also dead easy in addition to corresponding far too easily with Jamal's past. It's less a tale of a poor man making it to fame and riches with his own abilities than being carried there by the movie gods.In the end, we have a rather good movie that should not be held up to the hype surrounding it. This happened for me with Babel a few years ago. It's a shame we have awards and award campaigning to cloud our judgments on films. This will probably be held up as better than it is by people looking for hope in our current depression.

It is Written...(possible spoilers),"Slumdog Millionaire is a film that overwhelms you with its energy, vivacity, joy, hope and love of life. It shows the extremes of Indian society; the poverty of the slums with the exuberant joy of Bollywood films. Yes, there is brutality and violence, but like in real life, the scenes of pain are balanced by the sheer vivaciousness of the story.Danny Boyle shows modern India as a constantly moving and evolving place, and that is reflected in the changing destiny of its main character who will do anything to reach his goal. There's a scene involving a toilet that basically sums up the character of Jamal, that he will literally go through sh*t to get what his heart desires.The performances by the actors are amazing, especially from the child actors, the cinematography is eye-popping, zooming you right into the experience of Mumbai, and the pure strength of the story of a persistent underdog, makes this film without a question the best of the year.

Maybe if he lost the game and still got the girl I would have appreciated it more. I think that there is a reason that this movie was so universally praised; the economic crisis.

The Return Of Danny Boyle,"Danny Boyle has certainly made his share of worthy films since his first offering, 'Shallow Grave',in 1994, to be followed up by 'Trainspotting' the following year. Despite one clinker (28 Days), he has managed to earn my respect as a talented director. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is just another hands down winner for Boyle. The film concerns a homeless ""Chai Wallah"" (tea dispenser)who manages to get himself on India's equivalent to 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'. The film works within the frame work that it's believed that he is cheating, and is carted off to the local police department for a confession (under some brutal torture). Within the use of flashbacks, we find out about just how he got to where he is. The film's cast includes actors known from Bollywood musicals,including some others recruited from their work in Indian television. The romance angle also works,as well. This is a film that manages to evoke a myriad of emotions for the central character. It has a certain Charles Dickens feel to it,as well as a rough & tumble inner city drama (think in terms of 'City Of God'). Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film serves up some brutal violence & rough language,as well as some unpleasant child abuse. Okay for older teens,but you may want to leave the younger children out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Slumdog Millionaire,"Slumdog Millionaire, starring Dev Patel as main character Jamal Malik, is about a poor boy from the slums of India who becomes a contestant on India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Jamal Malik and his brother Salim (Madur Mittal), grow up in India very poor and without parents from a young age. They struggle to survive and stay together throughout their whole lives. When Jamal becomes a contestant on the popular TV show when he was older, no one expected him to do well. After he started answering every question correctly, the producers began to think he might be cheating. He is arrested late one night after shooting by the show's security officers and held captive while being questioned about how he knows all the correct answers. They literally beat the answers out of Jamal, insisting that he is cheating somehow. How could a slum know so much? As Jamal begins to finally explain how he knows the answers, we are shown flashbacks of his young childhood. Each of these flashbacks provides different dramatic, horrific situations from Jamal's past, including being witnesses to their mother's brutal death, and how they are relevant to the questions on the show. We see Jamal and Salim overcome many terrible obstacles at very young ages, barely surviving at some points. They travel through India homeless at most times and earn money with their mischievous ways. A third orphan, Latika, played by Rubina Alina, and then Freida Pinto for the teenage years, joins the brothers and Jamal develops an immediate crush. Throughout the film Jamal and Latika are separated, but Jamal never forgets her. The answer to each question is somehow present in these childhood memories and Jamal remembers them as he is seating in the ""hot seat"", competing for millions of dollars.The film uses great cinematography with flashbacks and the music really helps set the mood for each scene. Jamal becomes the nation's hero and we see them all supporting him. This film grabs the attention of its viewers and holds on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
There just isn't enough to invest in.,"For films such as Slumdog Millionaire, it can oft be hard to distinguish just what the director behind the project was intending to provoke from their audience. On the one hand, Slumdog tells a compelling and mostly interesting rags-to-riches story topped off with a sugar coated ending with extra sprinkles that- while notably hammy- doesn't cross over into absurdity. Yet it also tries to tell another tale alongside it, this time revolving around a romance that never quite takes off in the way that director Danny Boyle wishes it to. Boyle, who up to this point is known for his sensually driven works, surprisingly hasn't touched upon romance at least in the quantity and focus as to which Slumdog Millionaire implies; unfortunately, this lack of experience on his part shows throughout. So although the majority of the feature remains as a somewhat uplifting and compelling drama on base level, a distinct lack of focus in characterisation and chemistry stops the movie from ever going beyond its ostensible ideas and generic façade. In the end I found myself moved more by what Slumdog wanted to say rather than what it did say.Taking place largely in flashback mode, Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Jamal Malik (Dev Patel, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Tanay Chheda), a- well- ""slumdog"". Born in the slums and raised for the most part as an orphan, Jamal is a quiet, well-intentioned boy with a big heart and even bigger eyes for opportunity and beauty. It isn't long before he spots Latika (Freida Pinto, Rubiana Ali, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar) and from here on in it would seem the story writes itself. From here the script moves in and out of telling a mystery thriller seeped in slow paced drama, and diverging upon a romance which feels forced and laboured.A much more compelling element within Slumdog's narrative however lies in the way in which the story is framed within a retelling of the protagonist's chance of lifetime on game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. This otherwise gauche framing device serves as a surprisingly effective way in which to chop up Jamal's childhood and teenage life into its most digestible pieces without seeming too contrived, whilst also paving way for the movie's big finale which makes the most out of the slow building momentum of the first two acts. The result of this clashing between engaging drama and forgettable romance is jarring however; there are times when Slumdog soars and times when it gets downright irksome.One thing that usually remains as something to look forward to within a Danny Boyle feature however lies within its aesthetics. Taking place entirely within the impoverished areas of India, the movie establishes strong images and motifs throughout which in turn further the film's emotional and psychological connections with the viewer. From the patched, duct-taped, second-hand nature of everything, the world of Slumdog Millionaire entices ideas of existentialism not just through its protagonist's story but through the environment in which he exists. This, coupled with a magnificent score and soundtrack which more often than not gives the movie its biggest and most memorable sequences, provide a sensual experience that one now comes to expect when greeted by the name Danny Boyle.I couldn't help but wish that such ideas and care were taken with the remainder of the feature however; especially concerning the romance played out by the lead performers. Boyle, who is inexperienced to some degree in handling such dynamics, doesn't do much to provide any interest in the protagonist's love interest- it's clear that youthful, whimsical love is certainly implied within the constructs of this average romance and yet it is never truly shown. This generic approach to storytelling inevitably hurts Slumdog to the point that many of its sequences which draw heavily upon this much needed chemistry fall on their face. The actors themselves are fine and able- and provide excellent performances in all other respects- but as a pair, there just isn't enough to invest in.This in turn brings me to my final conclusion on what is essentially a mixed bag of engaging drama and tepid fairytale; Slumdog Millionaire is a fine picture- it provides a heart-warming story with all its intentions in the right places, and yet it doesn't ever convince in its ability to connect with the viewer. What results is a lukewarm, temporal pleaser, but certainly not one to be cherished for years to come.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A taste of bollywood...,"The first thing I want to mention is that I'm an Indian, an average Indian moviegoer. I never felt the need to mention this in any of my previous reviews. But, this is very important here as the opinion about the movie seems to change drastically depending on your perspective. I have been reading raving reviews about the movie from all over the world and the movie itself is bagging several acclaimed international awards. But for me, it is a ""typical Bollywood movie"". No doubt it is a good movie, excelling both in the acting and technical departments, but typical bollywood. This is exactly the language used by an average bollywood filmmaker. A boy meets girl, falls in love, gets separated, in between some bad guys, drama added and finally they reunite. This is Slumdog Millionaire. As an Indian, I'm very happy that this movie won so many plaudits. That means people all over the world are understanding the language of bollywood. But at the same time it makes me sad that many Indian movies that are many many notches above slumdog not even got close to the recognition this movie got. May be because the dialog is in English. It was annoying for me to listen Mumbai dwellers talking in English. But I think non-Indian audience will not feel a thing or may even feel more connected to the characters in English, in the same way as me preferring a French or German movie with English dialog than in native language. Or may be because the story was told by a British director. The language is bollywood but the accent British. Whatever may be the reason, slumdog's success is good news to Indian cinema. But, if you keep the Indian aspect aside, as a movie, I don't see slomdog as anything superlative. It is ""a simple love story told in the language of bollywood with English dialog"". Good job by Danny Boyle to cut the crap and retain the essence of bollywood story telling. Music and background score by Rahman is fabulous. Performances by Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, Freida Pinto and the whole cast are well up to the mark. Special mention of childhood Jamal and Salim is necessary as they excel. And cinematography by Dod Mantle captures the essence of Mumbai slums which is the canvas on which the whole movie is painted. But all said and done, the movie dose not have the soul to take it to the next level. It is an average film which is well executed. For showing the world a new language of story telling, Slumdog may be a nomination worthy movie but not win worthy. Again, this is the perspective of an average Indian movie goer who has seen much complex and compelling stories told in the same language. So, for the viewers around the world, enjoy a taste of bollywood but remember we have much more delicious flavors. Indian viewers, have a glimpse of a bollywood film from a foreign director. All in all, Slumdog surely is a worthy watch for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Better than Bejamin Button!,I felt this film very refreshing! A good creative storyline as well as above average acting from faces that where not Hollywood familiar to me! It kept me in from the beginning till the very end! In all i felt this film was not! a typical Hollywood predictable storyline with familiar Hollywood faces. If this film walks away empty handed in the foreign film category at the awards i will not just be surprised! I will be disappointed! In fact if this film was not coming out of the foreign film category i would be picking it over most if not all movies nominated this year! I think that is saying enough considering the amount of great films that will be in the running this year perhaps more than several in the past!,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Did it make me fell good? Yes. Did it make me think? Not really,"As everybody says this is a feel good film. When the film was over I did feel good, although the feel good factor was not as great as in other films I've seen, and I did also find that the film was somewhat predictable. I think a film should first and foremost be entertainment, but when that aim has been achieved, a film should also raise issues and make you think about certain things. Although I found this film to be stylistically well-made, I didn't feel that it raised many issues or made me think once it was over. The few issues it did raise (like ""you don't have to be worthless just because you're poor"") didn't seem particular original. If you're just looking for entertainment, then I think it would be worth seeing this film. If you want more than entertainment, then there are many other films I would rather recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Very disappointing, after all the hype!","Many people are being subconsciously bullied by the media hype to actually like the film, fuelled further by the silly Oscar orgy of ten nominations. Why don't we - Indians- have the guts to speak out about what we actually think or feel about the film, now that the disappointment over the film is growing? It is an absolutely average film. Apart from being obviously shallow, there is nothing of much worth in the film. It needs an idiot to believe that a slum child in Bombay talks with the British body language of Dev Patel. All the actors are so mediocre, I don't even understand what the hype is about the 'great acting'. This must be one of A. R. Rehman's most unimpressive musical scores and it is a sad irony of fate that he would be nominated for the Oscar for this one! By now he should have received 20 of them if this is the benchmark for Oscars! The screenplay is so full of loopholes and the dance at the end of the film is so badly choreographed that it would have been lambasted if it was made by an Indian director. Actually the dance at the end sticks out of the film like a sore thumb. It does not ever grow out of any context. If western audiences can appreciate and actually patronise something so illogical and outrageous, their general contempt for 'Bollywood' cinema now seems a case of moral hypocrisy because the film is made totally in the Bollywood style with every possible form of illogical excess. There is not a second in the film that touches me emotionally or can even be considered as quality cinema. It is indeed a heady mix of the worst variety of third world poverty, an internationally successful TV show, a rags-to-riches story and vintage Indian exotica. Even the geography is all wrong! It is interesting that when the kid falls off the train and the dust settles around him, he finds that he has landed right in front of the Taj Mahal. Any one who has been to the Taj would know that there is no railway line in its vicinity to give that cinematic view of India's most well-know icon seen through a sea of trash. I am not even talking about the display of poverty in the film which is a bit more complicated issue. We know that contention - we must not wash our dirty linen in public - has come from the most conservative quarters in the entire history of cinema, whether it was Italian neorealism or Bunuel's 'Los Olvidados', Ray's 'Pather Panchali' or even the more recent 'Salaam Bombay' and 'City of God'. A filmmaker has every right to explore whatever he wants. The real contentious and political issue is the reception to image-making of realities that are not lived through personal experience. Amitabh Bachchan's response can be perfectly understood in the light of the fact that he has been particularly made into the villain of the film, which was unnecessary in any case. (There is absolutely no ambiguity in the film whether Anil Kapur is playing AB.) So his reactions and critique may have grown out of a personal sense of hurt but then we need to ask ourselves, why do we like 'City of God' so much? Are we getting some perverse joy out of consuming the poverty of the Brazilian favelas or are we just captivated by its palpable characters and plot situations? It needs a depraved mind to even believe that anyone would spend their money to enjoy seeing poverty. So, ultimately the question is whether 'Slumdog Millionaire' qualifies as a film of high quality. I seriously doubt that. At best, it is a well-made Hindi film. What needs to be understood is the myth around it and the mind-boggling hype about hype itself. How did that happen? That would be more revealing about the world around us than the film's laughable claim to authenticity, that too legitimised by gullible Indians themselves.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""Slumdog Millionaire""  is an impressive, visceral piece of film-making that captures the romance of a memorable movie going experience.","What begins as a ferocious, gritty film initiating the likes of a Martin Scorsese crime drama, quickly catapults itself into one of the most endearing films of the year. With the energy of a high octane thriller, to the subtle, tender romance of young love, director Danny Boyle's operatic ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an impressive, visceral piece of film-making that captures the romance of a memorable movie going experience. From the violent opening, to the Bollywood-like dance number at the end, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is without a doubt one the year's best.Using his life's experiences to successfully answer questions on India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,"" Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), is one question away from landing the game's top prize: 20 million rupees. As soon as the show's ticking clock runs out, Jamal is immediately taken into police custody where he is brutally interrogated when he is accused of cheating. Carefully taking the time to explain his situation to a police inspector (played by Irrfan Khan), Jamal reminisces about his nostalgic childhood with his brother Salim, and childhood sweetheart, Lakita, and explains his true intent on why he's on India's highly watched television show: to find his love, Latika, who is a fan of the show.A story of this magnitude could have easily been told within the conventions of a mediocre romantic thriller that reeks anything Hollywood has attempted to produce in the last 10 years. Instead, director Danny Boyle, who gave drug addicts their will in ""Trainspotting"" and zombies their aggressive agility in 28 Days Later, has crafted a film of the highest caliber by injecting it with a heavy doses of heart-pounding excitement. Boyle's camera captures the dilapidated backdrops of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in a new light by showcasing a devastatingly poverty stricken India, which is emotionally heartbreaking yet oddly engaging. Boyle, once again, proves that a film doesn't need expensive visual effects and overpaid movie stars to be a powerfully emotionally enthralling film. Boyle's technique is superb and it's evident in every inch of this film.Set within the beat down slums of India, outside the comforting, pleasing film aesthetics most films opt for, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" creates a visually stimulating environment by igniting every frame with fantasy like elements. Though grim undertones prevail the film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", in the end, leaves one with a euphoric feeling of enlightenment. With the illustrative cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle, Boyle not only captures a striking narrative; but a voyeuristic, genuine way of life that is rarely captured on film. Unlike most films, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" doesn't allow it's audience to remain passive; instead, it's energetic power grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. It's breathtaking.With their first full length under their belt, Dev Patel and Freida Pinto bring soaring vitality to the roles of Jamal and Latika. Because the story is structured as a thriller with tiny hints of a Shakespeare love story, Patel and Pinto add a fiercely energetic boost to the picture through their charm. Established Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor fills the role of the conniving game show host Prem Kumar, who unleashes a threatening bag of tricks toward Jamal.Because ""Slumdog Millionaire"" features pitch perfect direction and noteworthy performances, the film leaves audiences sucker punched by its astonishing amazement. It's a dazzling, pulse pounding film that'll have you cheering with joy. Boyle, throughout the years, has delivered a versatile amount of work; all of which pertains to people that are trying to survive. To date, Danny Boyle has crafted a film of epic proportions, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a masterpiece that is sure to be talked about in years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Wonderful and engaging film about an apparent no-hoper breaking through the breach told amidst a canvas of the funny, touching and of the eerie.","Slumdog Millionaire is a journey; a trip down an individual's memory lane as he recounts the struggles in his life that has, ultimately, given him his opportunity to win big amidst struggles to do with the fact he is suspected of cheating. The film is of the humbling variety, the uplifting and of the downbeat for good measure  chances are you'll laugh; chances are you'll cry and the chances are you'll feel most everything else in-between. English director Danny Boyle has created something that throws just about everything into the mix, but arises as something far, far more than a disposable gimmick. The film's visual approach is one that teeters between the chaotic and the calm, pausing for those tense and dramatic moments of thought and recollection whilst nicely integrating the urgent scenes of chase and memory recollection. The film's pacing and approach is one of a careful nature, one that criss-crosses numerous genres yet remains focused on its study.Boyle identifies the route the film is going to go down in the opening few shots. After an establishment that we are in India, 2006; Boyle presents us with two extremes immediately announcing the overall tone of the film. Jamal Malik (Patel) sits in a chair in an interrogation room and is hit around the face as he is questioned in urgent, close up format. Running parallel with this and in the past tense, he is sitting in another chair  the self-proclaimed 'hotseat' - attempting to win big on India's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' quiz show. Still being grilled and still the central figure of ridicule from the host and the audience, he wades onward.The juxtaposition of being interrogated and electrocuted as a part of that, twinned with the fun; seemingly good natured; rather upbeat and familiar setting of the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' television studio is an instant and sticking one. Boyle manages to get across the range of emotions he'll deliver in the film, often all within a short space of time, as well as establish the manipulation of time that he hopes to accomplish.Needless to say, he achieves it and how. Frequently, there will be passages during which the film will flicker from something quite light hearted to real potential danger and then back again to the television studio as the tension is racked up to do with being the focus of attention. Some incidences include, very early on, when Jamal and some other boys from the slums play cricket on a runway and happily play away despite the immediate danger from landing planes. This activity is then interrupted by hostile guards who pose a new danger but then the kids seem to have fun in escaping.The film is an account, an account of times past by someone who many deem to be in a position they do not feel is possible. The primary theme is underestimation, that a 'slumdog' as Jamal is called, cannot possibly know anything and thus, when he's on the brink of cracking the show's top prize he must've cheated. But the accusers do not know any better. All through Jamal's life, incidences and objects have forced him to pick up on tidbits of trivia that have stuck and on the quiz show, it has aided him in getting as far as he has. The delving into the past as a new question arises consistently offers a refreshing tale within an initially gripping premise. During the film, we learn of his brother and his predicaments as well as the scraps, jobs and potential love interests he finds himself in offering a range: from the humorous, to the touching, to the downright creepy.Jamal sits opposite Prem Kumar (Kapoor), the game's host. They aren't in direct competition despite the banter they share but the study is quite clear and that is to do with what's on the surface and what's below it. Nobody believes a 'slumdog' could get to where they are in the game but through Jamal's accounts, it is possible; whereas Prem comes across as a friendly and upbeat television personality who's game for a laugh although backstage, we see him for what he really is. This is the key distinction between the two and the chief study for these sequences: underestimation and what is on the surface vs. what is below the surface.Although essentially a love story and a film that strongly believes in its themes of fate, the film doesn't concentrate on any particular aspect too much or too little thus creating a mystical aura as all these emotions and events and so forth flash by, dragging you through each of them but always giving you a chance to absorb what's being presented. The liberties to do with the questions being presented to him in the chronological order of his life anyway did not bother me, nor did the fact they paused for a commercial break during a live question. Slumdog Millionaire is effective dramatically and touching at the other times it needs to be; tapping into hope and the errors of people's ways when labelling a certain 'type' of individual. It is certainly worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

There are thousands of Bollywood movies better than this.Then why SM?,"First of all let me say that this movie brought Oscars for three Indians, AR Rahaman, Gulzar and Russel Pukutty.So there was a big reason for the Indian audience to cheer for Danny's team.But frankly speaking, the movie lacks substance as compared to many Hollywood films made in 2008 and also below par than many Bollywood flicks made every year.May be it was with this movie that Western audience got a touch of the flavor of Indian style of film making and Indian way of living.And for this it is a landmark movie in its own right.But then,winning 8 Oscars is a big deal, Isn't it and any Indian would say if that could win 8, what was wrong with the likes of Rang De Basanti,Taare Zameen Par or Lagaan? All of those beautiful movies earned a niche for themselves by their merit, which unfortunately SM could not achieve.I would never say it is a trash but then again its not a gem either. P.S: For those western audiences who think it deserved eight Oscars,I recommend a few Indian movies like the one I already mentioned + Chak De India,Parinda,Satya,Company,Shiva,Parzania,Black Friday,Swades,Ab Tak Chappan.The list will be too long to be accommodated here.So skip SM and go for the ones I recommended.The final thing, thanks to SM and Danny for at least bringing Indian style of film making to the western world, which is a wonderful achievement and deserves loads of accolades.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Even though this movie gives off the feeling of an emotional drama at the beginning, and even at times a legitimate biography, it still is very much one of the most romantic films that a person can witness.It is about a young Indian man, 18 years old, who lost the one and only true love of his life when he was young. This young boy has also lived most of his life as an orphan. He travels around the country of India in search of his one true love, Latika.

"Too much hype, not enough matter.","The only reason I can think of due to which Slumdog Millionaire has won various awards is that the competition is seriously lacking. I enjoyed the movie, but not all of it.I must give full credit to the children who have performed in the movie, they are the ones who deserve a nomination/award. Bombay is shot beautifully, exposing the harsh reality of slum life. It is realistic and gripping. Then the children grow up, this for me was the turning point in the film. Patel, in the lead role was expressionless and irritating. I still cannot understand the Hindi (with subtitles) to English transition in the dialogue, and where for the love of god did the accents come from? (particularly those of Anil Kapoor & Freida Pinto, who hail from the Indian subcontinent).The entire story after the first half was unimpressive. There was no chemistry between the lead characters, probably due to lack of acting experience.I do not understand the ideology of the casting director for casting an NRI as the 'slumdog millionaire'. He does not suit the role at all. Irrfan Khan/Mahesh Manjrekar have not been used well. A R Rahman probably deserves every bit of the acclaim that he is receiving, but this movie is definitely not his best.

Can't Quite Put My Finger On Why It Wasn't Great...,"I just recently finished watching the film sensation of 2008-2009, Slumdog Millionaire, and I wanted to share with you my initial reaction: It was a good film, with a few touching moments, but nothing that will really stick with me long after viewing.I'm not exactly sure why I'm not caught up in the hype surrounding this film (plus its selection for Best Picture at the '09 Academy Awards), but I just don't consider it to be in any way groundbreaking or special. I don't want to steal a thread that has been circulating around the reviews for this product, but it does seem to be a bit contrived in its storytelling method, where a poor contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" wows the entire nation with his knowledge of matters that should be beyond him. Over the course of the movie, though, viewers are shown exactly how he came to know the answers to those questions through a series of flashbacks.The film did a good enough job of building suspense that I could give it four stars over three, but I think its biggest downfall was that the central romance of the film was not a little more fleshed out. The romantic angle is supposed to provide the great drama at the end of the film, but instead (at least to me) it fell a bit flat in the notion that there wasn't enough romantic chemistry built up along the way.Thus, while I loved the ""Millionaire"" segments and the ensuing drama that this film created, I felt that the background stories weren't quite compelling enough to turn this film into a classic. However, it is one of those unique movies that a person must see for themselves to make an accurate judgment on, so I would urge you to check it out. You may not LOVE it, but you will almost certainly LIKE it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
an extremely shoddy movie..,"This movie is extremely shoddy..i have seen better movies with the same slum backdrop which are much more realistic and this one. The sole purpose of this movie was to create a negative image of India and there was nothing else. The story was not believable. It seemed as if the only purpose was to show dirt, grime and human waste and the story was just thrown in. There are many bollywood movie flicks which have the same elements as this movie had, only they are directed much better, with tighter scripting, editing and cinematography. Its a surprise that this movie was even nominated let alone get awards. Incredible. Just wondering if world tastes are coming down or it is something else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"One of the best films of the year, if not the best","On paper, the film sounds like nothing extraordinary. A young man from India gets a chance of a lifetime to go from rags to riches by being a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Throw in another plot strand, that of the same young man trying to reunite with his long lost love, and it sounds like a been there, done that type of story. Yet director Danny Boyle, in what is probably his best film, comes up with ingenious ways to tell this story in what surprisingly turns to be one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. Told with a hyperkinetic pace and punctuated by an outstanding soundtrack (with songs by M.I.A., one of the hottest singers of this generation), this film, detailing the struggles of two brothers growing up, one a street-smart hustler, the other, the hero of the story, more innocent and good-hearted, is never predictable, and is by turns funny, suspenseful, sad and inspiring  sometimes all in the same sequence. Boyle makes a point to show the side of India we hardly see in pictures  instead of a country of glossy palaces that is home to a more than a few billionaires and an industry which exports four-hour long hyperbolic Bollywood melodramas, we see (in superb shots) a struggling, overcrowded India full of hardship and despair, where slums stretch for miles and life is very cheap, if even worth anything at all. But in no way is this a depressing sob story nor is it a predictable fairytale trying to be this year's Oliver Twist; in fact, it's a hugely entertaining film that offers sharp, incisive social commentary on not just the impoverished of India, but of economic hardships and what people do to overcome such adversity no matter where they may be in the world. That is no easy task, and the fact that Boyle accomplishes it so entertainingly well makes it all the more remarkable. It sounds like it shouldn't work, but as one character notes on Jamal's life, it's bizarrely plausible. It's also one of the most audacious, daring and best films of the year. Stay for the end credits.(Side note: This film, in one harrowing sequence, confirmed for me what my good friend from Singapore told me: That you should be very cautious when giving money to beggars, particularly those in Asian countries, as they are more than likely controlled by the mafia. Especially if they are blind or look maimed in some way  the more pathetic they look, the more they are able to elicit sympathy money from unsuspecting tourists.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"More like ""Underdog millionaire""","One word summary: Amazing.With more then one words: first of all; Mr. Boyle, I'm sorry. I didn't get ""Trainspotting"", I taught ""The beach"" proved you're mediocre (as a side note: my parents there then, on a holiday near where it was shot) and I also thought that ""28 days later"" was a lucky shot. ""Slumdog"" proves once and for all I have been misjudging you - you DO have the talent. ""Slumdog"" is one of those rare examples that come by you only now and then in a lifetime. In my life the earliest example of this was ""E.T."" back when I was 6, and the last time was ""Shaolin soccer"" some years back. This year I was already treated with ""Gran Torino"", so I REALLY wasn't expecting anything of this level - and hey, it's only February! As a struggling scriptwriter - sort of myself, this has thought me more than just one lesson. The idea of a poor man's journey through life giving him just the right answers for scoring it big on a TV show is a flash of genius, juggling with traditional issues like ""fate"" and ""destiny"" with those of popular culture. That alone would have secured any British director a sure 6.5 IMDb - point Hugh Grant Box office - hit. And no doubt all but one would have done just that (as would any American director). Now, for some reason, mr. Boyle wanted to put a spin on it (or keep the original premise?), and set it in a foreign culture; India. That's risky. And most who have tried this, have failed... but not in this case.Mr. Boylse handles everything suavely and professionally. He doesn't preach pro or against; instead, he fully accomplishes in taking the best of both worlds as he simply tells the story in another culture.The whole beauty of it, with the whole beauty of it surroundings. In the end, you WILL feel that even if the movie took you in another place to tell the story, that that WAS the place the story was meant to be told in. And that the 2 hours it took to tell it, there wasn't a minute too much.That's rare. And that's a reason to go see this movie.I am truly happy this movie has managed to find an audience, lingering in the top 10 all these weeks (working its way from the bottom up !) and scoring all those 8 Oscars, DESERVINGLY!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Sprawling Humanity,"I am always hesitant to see a movie after hearing all the hype. I was wondering if the Film Academy had just kind of decided to go in a different direction (as they often do). I was greatly moved by this film and the story of the young man who overcomes not just the horrors of his existence but the prejudice drummed up by those who assume he must be too stupid to do well. l was greatly impressed by the squalor and the long shots of the city. This movie shows the slums so well. It reminded me of the Casbah, where one lives in a maze and can find his way around in it when being chased. These kids are products of their culture and know no other way. There are so many scenes that are so impressive. The boy who drops into the excrement of the outhouse so he can get an autograph of his favorite actor. The horrors of the Fagin character who exploits children, makes them a band of beggars. There is, mostly, however, the story of the central figure who is complex and worldly and suspicious and brave beyond his own years. The other mass character is the Indian people who begin to follow the boy's successes on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionairre."" I will never forget the portrayal of the city and the filth and the spirit that runs through here. This is masterful storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It has a few sluggish spots, but the children who play the lead character, Jamal, are all so good that they help immensely and the last half hour is very entertaining. While well performed, the Bollywood dance number at the end lost me as it has not one thing to do with the movie, but that's the way they do it in India.

An Indian fairytale,"Danny Boyle's successful film 'Slumgod Millionaire' is a vibrant tale of life at the sharp end of modern India; but it's also essentially a fairytale, with a happy ending and details that don't quite ring true. Most notably, it's based around the quiz show, 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?', but it makes the assumption that the programme's makers don't actually want anyone to win, whereas I suspect that in reality, the occasional big winner is exactly what generates most publicity and subsequently revenue for the show. And while I am certain the life of a ""slumdog"" is not in any senses easy, the truth is that millions of Indians live, sadly in poverty, but without constant threat from people trying to kill them. Indeed, to me this felt like an outsider's view of India, and perhaps the films popularity stems from the fact that a global audience can share Boyle's perspective; the novel 'White Tiger' tackled similar themes (and in a similar semi-comic fashion) with more authenticity. Indeed, the dramatic tension of Boyle's film comes more from the quiz show embedded within it than from the thin surrounding plot. It's vivid and entertaining for sure; but aside from 'Trainspotting', I've never been wholly convinced by those who think Boyle a genius; and I wasn't convinced here either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great except perhaps for certain viewers,"Appearing on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, 18 year old Jamal is one step away from winning the grand prize of 20 million Rupees. Millionaire-style, a question is posed: How did he do it? A) He's lucky, B) He's a genius, C) He cheated, D) It is writtenIt quickly becomes clear that the host of the show and the local constabulary believe the answer is C. Jamal is a slumdog, perhaps a step or two above the Untouchables, but certainly not much more than that. How could such a cipher be the very first contestant in the history of the show to reach the final question? Impossible without illegal means, or is it? The movie then reverts largely to flashbacks of Jamal's life and his experiences with his brother Salim and soon their female compatriot Latika. We are introduced to Jamal and Salim as young boys, while Mumbai was still Bombay, and the review of the past continues to a time within months of Jamal's appearance on the show. Turns out, why he is on the show is about as important as how he has done so wellSlumdog Millionaire falls almost exactly in between Hollywood and Bollywood sensibilities. The run time of two hours is a bit long for Hollywood standards but short for Bollywood. While there are no true musical numbers (with the minor exception of the closing credits), the soundtrack is heavily featured (and was quite loud in the Arclight theatre where I saw it). The Bollywood chapter-like structure is in evidence but the pacing is far more Hollywood action/adventure. It is quite the unique creature and that, in itself, makes for interesting viewing.As to where the movie succeeds and falters, it is more of the former than the latter. Danny Boyle most definitely deserves consideration for Best Director this year. He sometimes dances close to the edge of music video cliché but manages to avoid triteness based upon the images and set pieces he selects. His rapid cut modes create exhilaration rather than confusion even when subtitles are required (during the scenes with the youngsters  apparently their English just wasn't sufficient). The acting, overall, is more than adequate, though in this regard, the movie might be benefiting from our lack of experience with Indian emotional expression and body language such that we have more difficulty judging realism; the few American/English tourist characters in the movie come off flat and lame, most likely purposefully but certainly not realistically. As with potentially the acting, the writing clearly does come off better in translation to a foreign tongue. With expectations dampened and exotica abounding, simplistic scenes absorb dramatic weight and play heftier than they would in the middling Hollywood fare they would normally inhabit. On the positive side, the script does manage the majority flashback structure well and rarely creates doubt as to where the story is at a given moment. The greatest weakness is the highly elementary fable plot but worse movies than this one have been forgiven for such things.When the movie was over, I thought it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, however, I am not sure this reaction should be taken for granted. My wife was, in fact, quite upset at the movie. The main thrust of her critique is valid, I believe, namely the movie does trade upon some pretty horrific events, many of which happen to children, in service of generating positive feelings in the audience. Obviously not the first movie to ever do this but, if one is sensitive to such things, this movie may not be ""entertainment."" Perhaps disturbingly, critics may be inured to such thinking and the average American film-goer may very well be less responsive to the suffering of alien others hence the almost universally positive reviews. Thus a caveat: if you are particularly sensitive to bad things happening to children or extreme poverty in general and you easily empathize across cultural lines, you may wish to think twice before committing to this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Excellent movie. Worth a watch.,"Saw this movie a few days ago. Luckily it was good enough to still be fresh in my mind. Actually, the only thing that annoyed me about this movie were the askew camera angles at certain points. They were mainly used during the action sequence at the beginning. I think the quick cuts and music would've built enough tension without the aide of the odd angles, but who knows. The directing was still fantastic. Even more impressive was the music. Most impressive however was the acting. Dev Patel was remarkable. His acting was, well, Oscar worthy. Even the children actors were fantastic. I can't give it a 9 or 10 simply because I didn't feel fully engaged in the the movie until the last 30-40 minutes. Nonetheless, the directing and acting were good enough to captivate me until I got there. Not much more to say about it that hasn't already been said or written. The one thing I'm definitely gonna remember from this movie, Dev Patel. I definitely hope to see more from him in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Danny Boyle uses flashbacks to tell the story of this boy, his memories, life experiences; but does so in a way that just flows and you don't get confused or feel cheated by what's happening, instead you sympathize and want to know more. That's the thing about this film, it's human. No smokes and mirrors here, just pure human emotion and a heart felt story. I think this is a perfect movie, or at least very close to be, it doesn't make the mistakes that many films seem to make these days.

wonderful,"i saw this film before it went into limited release at a special screening with director Danny Boyle. my initial reaction to the film was that it was good, but not that great.then, over the next couple of weeks, the memory of the film stayed with me and it continued to grow on me until i felt strongly compelled to go see it again (something i don't do often). i found myself catching so many beautiful moments the 2nd time around, and was moved to tears in several different scenes.this is a powerful film, and don't let the more fable-like qualities of it distract you from the amazing sounds and visuals. Mr. Boyle describes this as a ""love song for Mumbai,"" and that is exactly what it is: a love song. this film, from Mr. Boyle's delightful direction, the amazing cinematography & editing, the incredible score by R.A.

Slumdog Is A Great Ride,"The year 2008 and the great movies it brought us would not be complete talking about without Slumdog Millionaire. Arguably the best movie of the year and certainly the best indie movie of the year. It's hard to believe but friends are dragging friends to this movie in herds. It is amazing how people are put off and drawn to the movie's content at the same time.The story is about an 18-year-old boy, Jamal (Dev Patel), who works as a tea server, or chai wallah, for a telephone marketing company, has somehow become the last man standing on an Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.Jamal is on his way to the ultimate prize of 20 million rupees. His improbable success captures the imagination of the entire country. The show's producer/host (Anil Kapoor) is convinced that the kid is cheating. On the night before the final question police arrest Jamal, string him up and begin to torture him into telling the truth. They are unable to get the answers they want. The film then moves back and forth from the interrogation room and the TV sound stage in a series of flashbacks where Jamal calmly explains how each incident in his eventful life made him uniquely prepared to answer the questions put to him.The film is very reminiscent of Danny Boye's cult film and high-adrenalin Trainspotting. There are some really great scenes in the slums of Mumbai. The cinematography is unique including slow motion, step motion and wild camera angles. Even with the direction and look of the film the real power of the film is still in the hands of Patel. All of these items lead to a wonderful film ride, and at times it does feel like a ride.

"This decade's ""Rocky""; undeniably appealing and masterfully done.","First off, I want to rant (sorry) - for the year 2008, there were three films I gave a 10/10 rating, this film, ""WALL-E"", and ""The Dark Knight"". The latter was snubbed of its Academy Awards Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all because that the Academy does not deem superhero summer blockbusters as art. I was mad as personally I think TDK is the film of the decade, and had it been nominated for the three, I'd think it win them.Thankfully, this film and WALL-E, two romantic films, do the Oscars justice. WALL-E is a marvel. However, I'd give my hats off to Slumdog for giving me the biggest movie surprise of the year. The movie is energetic, has a kinetic pace, a touching story, and a main character that we all root for. Director Danny Boyle takes a story and crafts it into one of the most startlingly original films of the decade, and it stands tall over most films.We have Jamal, a Mumbai ""slumdog"" who participates in a ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" TV game show in hopes that the love of his life will see him. He apparently knows all the answers to the questions and shows no sign of losing. This prompts investigators to interrogate him, and, clues to how he knows the answers are represented in flashbacks of his life leading him up to where he is.The movie cannot be praised without the fine, innocent and heart-stealing characters that the young actors portray. They embody the innocence, curiosity, and enthusiasm of youth. Without them, the film would be nothing. They can all stand up and take a bow, for their performances mold the film to near-perfection.The film's story, while uplifting and inspiring at times, is gut-wrenching, gritty, powerful, and, filled with realism. How the screenwriter makes the story believable is truly remarkable, as it takes talent and dedication to do it, and it shows on the silver screen. Having the kids speak Hindi for 1/3 of the film adds more realism to the film, as the young starlets are more comfortable speaking in their native tongue, as well as showing real life in the slums the way a Hindi kid would see it. There is not one scene where you do not cheer for the main character, Jamal. And the ending is truly marvelous, an ending that will be remembered for a long time.The direction is superb. Fast paced, giving little time to breathe. Obvious Danny Boyle. But, he livens up the atmosphere of the movie, which is dark and gritty. This is Boyle's best film yet, he is truly a filmmaker for his time, and this film certainly proves it. Hell, even in the poor slums there are moments that we can laugh and reflect at! Now that's something that Boyle can be proud of, making the audience feel and care for the characters, to which he succeeds enormously. There is a scene involving an open toilet and Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, for which I will not tell, that has become one of the most memorable movie scenes for the decade. Academy Award Winner Danny Boyle, you deserve it.Technically speaking, the music by Bollywood regular A. R. Rahman is perfect for the film. It is uplifting, gritty, beautiful, thrilling and atmospheric at the same time. He deserves the Oscar win. The cinematography shows the ugly slums of Mumbai in full glory, capturing the essence of the film while making it beautiful at the same time. The editing is nicely done making it fast paced.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an uplifting, near-flawless masterpiece. It drips with movie magic and reminds us why we fell in love with the movies in the first place. To be honest I wanted ""The Dark Knight"" to win, but since it was not nominated, Slumdog was my clear favorite to win the coveted Best Picture award. And hey, it did! Congrats to everyone on the film. Bravo! And finally, Bollywood has something to be proud of, and Hollywood should partner up with them again sometime soon.Overall rating: 9/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Watch it at least once while you are still alive,"The movie has already earned a lot of praise,recognition and awards till now and hopefully will go a long way into becoming one of the most watched classics like 'GodFather','The Dark Knight',''Pulp Fiction',etc.Being from the city Mumbai around which most of the movie revolves I can relate to the kind of philosophy this movie follows. It has got a lot of dark and ugly moments. But behind or inspite of these horrible aspects of life there are certain light and beautiful elements and characters that when discovered give hope that survival is possible even in the most unreasonable conditions. This is what makes disgusting look surprisingly awesome at times like many of the scenes in this movie.One aspect of this movie is the literal story about a filthy and uneducated ""Chaiwala"" becoming a millionaire having to suffer an ordeal and his gruesome past with the lost love of his life. But there are many other aspects of this movie each telling their own story from the history of one of the toughest cities in the world to the scandals of child abuse and an apathetic system. In the midst of all of this you find the most unlikely thing called romance and its not as typical as your girl meets boy.The director has done a good job at keeping the story as real as possible although it is just a work of fiction. In a sense many of the things in the movie do happen in a non-glamorous way in a normal Mumbaiites life. He has offered a glimpse in the psyche of some of those devastated by the workings of this city. This movie's success belongs to Danny Boyle because of the way each of its crucial scenes have been dramatised.The actors look real too and apart from Anil Kapur and Irfann Khan, everyone is fresh in this movie. Most if not all have done a good job at depicting the directors vision. My only complain is that sometimes they do appear to be more sophisticated than the people whom they act as in the story the main reason being that English is largely used in this movie, understandably so to cater to international audiences.But I want to clarify that people in India do speak English although not the uneducated especially those living a low life. Being an Indian I found it distracting at times that the actors were speaking in English ever so often because we are not used to seeing a character of an Indian policeman or a gangster speaking it let alone being fluent. Also this movie is not about Mumbai or India in general because we have a vast culture and this is just a dark variation of it.Go ahead and watch this movie with or without expectations, you are going to be satisfied enough to watch it again some other time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Well worth it!,"My husband and I went to go see this because it was getting such good reviews. I was kind of iffy about it until it started. The movie was very good. It had action, drama, suspense, comedy, tragedy, and it was a different kind of movie which was refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack, the scenery, and the unique story line. I am wondering why this movie is flying so low on the movie radar. We only had two choices of theaters in our area of a gajillion theaters. It was well worth the drive though because we both enjoyed it. I'm hoping that this will win lots of awards because the movie and those involved with it deserve some significant praise. My husband and I both give it two thumbs up (which is a rarity!). We highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great all around and no contrived pap of a plot line...,"While my wife was pregnant, someone told us not to watch this movie because there was all of this ""child abuse"" going on. Say what? There's no child abuse in this movie. At all. Poor street and slum kids doing what street and slum kids do. It's amazing that Americans' perceive this as abuse. Sorry to shatter your tiny world but the rest of the world lives differently than the US. OK, my rant is over. From what I gather this is based on the book Q&A. Never did read the book but this story plays out great and reminds me a Lot of City of God (which was stellar as well). In a nutshell the movie starts out introducing you to our main hero and his brother who are slum kids that go about grifting for basic survival and kicks. A mysterious and creepy guy named Maman takes in orphans and has sinister intentions. He takes the boys in as well as their new friend Latika but they escape. However, Latika is left behind. Without getting into the plot too much or spoiling the movie, we see our hero and his brother grow older and change all the while we see Jamal hoping to find Latika. Overlaid on this back story we find Jamal in the present and on an episode of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.Danny Boyle directer a winner and all the accolades and awards this movie will get are well deserved. There are great comedy moments, tension, high drama, and action in this movie. The acting is not forced and comes off very natural and the cinematography is five stars. I find it impossible to believe that someone would not like this movie if only out of spite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Fascinating  look at modern India,"Tentatively -- 8 out of 10 stars (I'll have to see it a couple more times to finally decide) This is a movie about life primarily in Mumbai/Bombay, India, as seen through the life, struggles for survival, challenges, and aspirations of 3 street urchins, two brothers (Salim & Jamal), and a girl (Latika) as they grow up from their preteens to their twenties.The 3 are Muslim in a divisive culture -- Hindu & Muslim -- and their parents are murdered, they are orphaned in a fratricidal attack by fundamentalist Hindus on Muslims. The film's narrative shows how they survived from then through early adulthood.I had problems understanding probably 25-33% of the dialog, sometimes because of accents, sometimes for whatever other reasons (my own hearing problems?) -- soundtrack, foreign language, etc.The panoramic views of India's civilization, its mixtures of poverty and wealth, ancient and modern, means of surviving, its varied levels of comfort, are unparalleled. Have you ever called a Customer Hotline and been answered by someone you figured was in India? Then you'll appreciate some scenes.Most critics give this movie a 9/10 or 10/10. I need to see it again to really decide.I can say that the background music was superb, the actors playing the early, middle, and later years of the principal characters, the ""3 musketeers,"" were excellent and Latika -- in her various ages -- became increasingly more beautiful. As a professional family therapist, I found the later divergence between the two brothers to be quite plausible (although not inevitable). Nothing was out of place, out of belief, for this clinical psychologist -- a level reachable by maybe only 30-40% of films.Some people who want a very propelled, tight and structured narrative may not much appreciate this film.But those of us who especially appreciate a film that conveys a very intimate glimpse into other cultures will feel greatly rewarded.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Is that your final answer?,"There's no need to phone a friend, ask the audience, nor choose a fifty-fifty to determine if you should see this film. The answer is obvious: SEE IT NOW. The film follows the story of the life of an impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik, who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire?"", wins, and is then suspected of cheating.Throughout the film, we learn that Jamal is able to answer the questions in the game show correctly because of key points in his life. Not only is this about a game show, it's about Jamal's life story. The film mixes the flashbacks and present flawlessly. Probably telling a life story of someone is not new. Just last December, there was ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" However, the fact that the film mixes Jamal's life story with his ability to answer the questions in the game show is quite clever and ingenious. It adds another fresh twist to what might be another story about someone's life.Even too, the game show plays a crucial element to the plot so the whole puzzle fits together perfectly in the end. It's just another thing that makes this movie so great. Now let's talk about the performances. Wow! Weren't they great? Dev Patel gives us a breakthrough performance. Everyone else, although not as memorable as Patel, gave us their all in here too. The soundtrack is also very good. I loved it.So what makes this movie so great? Just watch it. I really can't spoil it. Maybe I can just say it's about fate and destiny but then you might roll your eyes. It's just a captivating film with fantastic performances from unknown actors and in the end, I'll admit it, I really can't find anything to not like about the film. It's what I call a nearly flawless film. Compared to Danny Boyle's previous disappointing film, ""Sunshine,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is several steps up to the right direction, not to mention one of the best films of this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
In my top 10,"I had no idea what this movie was about when I started watching it; we just rented it because a guy at work said it was really good.Wow! At first I was thinking, ""What in the world is this about?"" when it started out with the whole gameshow thing. About 30minutes into the movie, I was thinking ""Wow, this is REALLY good."" And the more the movie when on, the more I LOVED it.My favorite thing, was the friendship between the two little boys. They stuck together to survive in an unbelievably harsh environment. Had they not had each other, they might not have survived.My second favorite thing, was the love he had for Natika (sp?). It never died... and he never gave up.Parts of this movie were pretty painfult to watch though... every time I watch the guy burning the kid's eyes, I get SOoooo angry... I sure hope stuff like that doesn't actually happen.This has an 8.2/10 on IMDb right now... I'd give it a 10.-Tracy Milburn",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What did everyone saw on this?,"'Slumdog Millionaire' was, without a doubt, the most critically acclaimed movie of 2008. Danny Boyle's picture simply won eight Oscars (including for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay) and nominated to two others. It also won seven BAFTAs (also, including Best Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay) and four Golden Globes, along with tons of other awards, becoming the first movie since Steven Spielberg's 1993 'Schindler's List' to win Best Picture at the Oscars, the BAFTAs and the Golden Globes. The problem is - I'm still trying to figure it out what did all those critics and the audience saw on this movie?'Slumdog Millionaire' tells the story of Jamal Mailk (Dev Patel), a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and is participating on a TV program called ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". In the break of the program, he is accused and arrested of cheating. While he is being interrogated, events from his life are shown, explaining why he knows the answers to all the questions of the program. The Oscar-winning Screenplay is loosely based on a novel by Vikas Swarup and adapted for the big screen by Simon Beaufoy. Through Jamal's story, the movie denounces the hard life in India's slums, showing all the dangers of that little kids suffer when they're alone. But the movie only shows a poor and filthy India, that's why many people are gonna have wrong ideas about the country because of this movie. Even though the story gives the possibility to show a nice adventure, with Jamal, his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and a girl named Latika (Freida Pinto) trying to survive in the slums, it is hardly believable. It's impressing how everything in Jamal's life sort of conspires for him to know the answers, how he remembers his childhood in so many details and how the questions are all related to his life. This bugged me throughout the whole movie, but the final question was the most forced one. I'm not going to spoil it here, but you'll see how nonsense it is. I know the basic plot of the movie is how a kid from the slums can win a TV game-show, but that's where I have the problem with.The acting here is a little under average. All the supporting cast does an average job, with the exception of Anil Kapoor, that was very nice as the game-show host. The three main characters are portrayed at three different ages here. Surprisingly, the best members of the cast were the little kids. Even though most of the cast are newcomers, the kids steal all your attention here. All three of them, portraying Jamal, Salim and Latika, are great, and give strong performances. The not-so-little kids that portrayed the three of them in an early-teen age were fine also. The ones that had more recognition were, of course, the actors portraying them in the late-teen age. They were the ones with more screen-time, but not of them were really good. Madhur Mittal was kinda bad as older Salim, so was Freida Pinto as older Latika. And even the most acclaimed one, Dev Patel, wasn't really good. Even though he got a few nominations for his role in this movie, his performance could've better.Undoubtedly (or at least in my opinion) the strongest point of 'Slumdog Millionaire was the directing. Danny Boyle does an excellent job directing this picture. If it's not his best work thus far, since he was also excellent in both 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later...', it's certainly one of the best. The camera work he uses in the movie is incredible, getting some unbelievable shots. His job in the transition of each scene is also remarkable. Another good thing that I enjoyed on Mr. Boyle's job were the montages, that served to make the movie much less boring. The only thing that I didn't like on his work was the end credits. After all the events depicted in the movie, every actor started dancing on a train station to the sound of A.R. Rahman's original Oscar-winning song 'Jai Ho'. I know it was meant to be a tribute to the Bollywood pictures, but in my opinion it ruined the movie completely. Your good and old black end credits were just fine, thanks.Chris Dickens was another one that really deserved the Oscar award he got. His editing work is as remarkable as Danny Boyle's directing one. If it wasn't for him, the montages and the shot transitions weren't gonna be as good as they are. Anthony Mantle's Oscar-winning job on the cinematography was excellent. The yellow tones in every scene really set the mood for what's to come, and make the movie feels like India. You get some beautiful shots of India's famous locations and landscapes, like the internationally famous Taj Mahal (of course they had to show it). One quite important thing on 'Slumdog Millionaire' is the Soundtrack. A.R. Rahman composed several songs for this movie, and they are all quite good. Aside from the montages, the movie also utilizes those songs in a very, almost surgically put way. The only time that the music didn't serve well was in the end credits.Overral, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is not a bad movie. Is not a bad movie at all. Danny Boyle's directing work was of the his best so far, the editing is great, so is the cinematography and the Soundtrack. But the naive writing, the hardly-believable storyline and the poor acting keeps this movie alway from being a masterpiece. And the dancing at the end credits served to make the movie worse than it is, ruining the movie's mood completely. So, with all this, I'm still trying to understand: What did everyone saw on this? Even though 2008 wasn't exactly the best year for movie-making, with the writer's strike and all, there certainly were better choices for the Oscars, the BAFTAs, or whatever awards you mention, than this picture.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Absolutely Amazing,"This is one of those films that you do not come across very often. It was absolutely amazing. This film is one of the most well written, well directed films I have ever seen. The non-linear narrative was executed perfectly and the plot was astonishing. Every single actor in this film, especially the child actors, played their roles perfectly and the casting was so spot on as it was hard to imagine these characters being anybody else. The character relationship between Jamal and Latika was brilliant and the development of the characters throughout the movie kept you on the edge of the seat wanting to find out what is going to happen to them next etc. The soundtrack (music) in this film was mind blowing, every song selected, every sound effect fitted so perfectly within the film, some moments gave me shivers and goose bumps and the music was so gripping.

What is wrong with the world???,"I've lived in Mumbai, India all my life.Nowhere do they teach Alexander Dumas (Three Musketeers), in fact our education is so bad people don't even have English textbooks.

Dis Movie Iz Da Bomb,"This is the best movie so far that I have seen, or hope to see in my lifetime.This movie reflects truth as it is. For example, it portrays how in a city, as populous as Bombay, the police goes relentlessly after one guy, who they suspect of cheating in a game show. This is very important, because usually one would expect Indian police to be corrupt and extract some money from the kid and not do anything more (Bollywood taught us that), but police going relentlessly after a ""Slumdog"" to investigate the possibility of corruption. Now that is what would one call a News!This movie also portrays India as it is: Filthy, poor, hungry and violent. This is something that seems to be very popular theme among the (majority of) Westerners and it exactly fits into their mental picture of India. For example, Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy was quite popular (and highly regarded) in the West (at least, among the Intelligentsia), while his Charulata, where people wore clean shirt and discussed literature, is not very well known. This movie also touches upon another very important and popular issue of the present-day India, as seen by Western eyes: The indiscriminate and ruthless victimization of the Indian minorities (such as Muslims) in the hand of the majority Hindu (most of whom are fanatics anyway!). This movie also, for the sake of reality, adds a nefarious, vapid and insulting game show host to the plot (it feels good to see the big-mouthing Anil Kapoor, who said that ""stars"" like him could not just accept a supporting role in a Hollywood movie, even if offered, now acting in an insignificant role in a Western/American/""Hollywood"" production. O, how the mighty have fallen!)This movie could, however, have added a few improvements. For example, the game show could have been shown to be held in the West, and the kid being insulted for being non-white. (This would have sold the movie even better in India, going by the Big Boss/Shilpa Shetty affair.) Also, the title of the movie could have been ""Jamal M. In Da House"".If you have not yet got what I am trying to say, this movie is for you. Go watch it today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A film that proves no matter how harsh one's life has been thru those experiences can help one master knowledge and win big in the end!,"Director Danny Boyle's film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" clearly has hit the jackpot with this picture an uplifting tale for anyone that sees it especially those that are poor and unlucky. Because those viewers can relate to the central character of Jamal so well. And Boyle's direction is life and storybook like as his direction of the film tells most of this troubled young man's life as the whole film is told from a flashback point of view. It's just so touching to see how each life experience of Jamal's past relates to his present as it was able to provide him with unlimited knowledge of the world that he gained from life experiences.Set in the slums of Mumbai, India we as viewers see a journey of harsh living that is experienced by one young man named Jamal Malik(Dev Patel)who along with his older brother from a young age have to deal with many problems from losing their mother, and being abandoned during war time. Along the way the streets are a way of life and survival for them as they drift from location to location only Jamal gradually learns the culture of how to break from the thug world. As without much money Jamal had to survive on his wits to make money this knowledge would benefit him greatly later. Aside from a journey of dealing with the harsh world of cynical thugs and learning the streets Jamal is in part involved up in a love story. When meeting the beautiful Latika(Freida Pinto). Her beauty and love provides some escape for Jamal.It is then when upon Jamal working after leaving his brother and the beauty behind decides to go for the gold so to speak. Jamal becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire"" as he feels this is the only way to the path of a good life and a way to escape poverty. Ironically as we see from question to question as the film is done in flashback Jamal reflects on his harsh upbringing and dangerous street days of dealing with thugs as it's many of these experiences that helped him obtain powerful culture knowledge. And oddly enough many of these questions can be answered by his knowledge he picked up from the past.As in life the film proves many simply have a destiny often expected or unexpected as in the end Jamal knows his destiny and the only way that he will establish love with Latika is thru this game show! This may seem like a fairy tale ending to some still it shows destiny is often meant even though it takes many strange paths for some it's those like Jamal that struggle thru a harsh upbringing and that living in slum conditions makes a man stronger especially mentally. And in the end this makes him a master because he's found his destiny.

"Pretty good!  For most people, it'll probably rate a 6 to a 9.","I liked this movie, but I wasn't as overwhelmed with it as others seem be. It's a good story filled with a number of emotional-tugs typical of Indian storytelling. It held my interest through to the end, but I didn't really think about the film afterward.If you're thinking about seeing this movie - you'll be glad to know two things: It's filmed in English (so no subtitles) ... and it's not a drawn-out Bollywood singing/dancing musical. You'll get an interesting story with great acting - and I'm sure you'll rate it no lower than a ""6"".The movie is basically the background story of a poor Indian fellow who ends up as a promising contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"". As he moves from one correct answer to the next, we see flashbacks of the rough-life struggles he had to endure while growing up that led him to the answer.It's a cool way to tell a story. If you don't know what living in poverty is like in India, this'll be a somber and touching eye-opener. While it's well acted and written, it wasn't especially engrossing (to me at least).

Transportation by Film,"The film does transport you to the slums in India, in a very real way. The contrast between the poverty of the slums and the (relative) opulence in which the gangsters live is echoed by the (false) opulence of the game show.The major theme: ""it is written"" echoes the fatalistic Hindu theory of pre-destiny, while at the same time setting up the protagonist as a Christ figure  he's the only character in the film who is pure and good.Well written, well shot, and well cut, the film uses the traditional good-triumphs-over-evil theme as a template to view the religious and class tensions in modern-day India.

Okay,"Typical movie about India that western audiences love so it isn't surprising it has all these great reviews and nominations. AR Rahman's score is good. The acting is decent enough. The whole notion of the actors speaking in English was difficult to get over. Especially when the ""slumdog"" busts out English in an English accent. What was the point of having a mix of Hindi and English dialog? Story is very similar to Hindi movies of the 90s like Parinda, Sadak etc. But of course the whole ""who wants to be a millionaire"" is a unique touch over the typical ""slum"" stories. There is nothing extraordinary about it but there is nothing all too dull about it either. It sits comfortably in the middle.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What film did everyone else see?,"This is the most overrated film of the decade! Worse than that all the Oscars it won, the only one I can understand was best original song. I like Danny Boyle & am sure he has a great career ahead of him. He's already done some really enjoyable films including ""Millions"" which is twice as good as this. I don't know how this won so many awards or what film they saw because this can't be it. It's full of clichés, the story is completely transparent with absolutely no surprises, & the script is middle of the road...at best! It will also help that you really like the show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" because it's a large part of the story. If you don't like I don't, well it's even harder to get in on the story. On a plus note the acting was good especially the male lead Dev Patel & both of the little boys playing the young versions of Salim & Jamal are great. I can't figure out why this is any better than the other films nominated for Oscars, but this did not deserve Best Picture at all. I'm betting in 5-10 years this will be one of those films that people will wonder how this won all these awards. I'll wait for you all to catch up, but in all honesty stop doing/rating what everybody else is doing because it's the ""IN THING"" & ignore the fact it won all the awards it won & rate the film on it's own. No bias no awards just how the film rates as it's own separate entity.

The sociological ramifications of Slumdog Millionaire in the United States,"Slumdog Millionaire, in addition to being one of the most perfect films I have ever seen, has some very real sociological ramifications in the U.S. Ever since 9/11, there has been a feeling of being uncomfortable around those people with brown skin--from the Middle East, from the sub-Continent, indeed even from Latin America. I would say that Slumdog Millionaire is the first major award-winning film introducing to the audiences here in the U.S. a main character who is Muslim. (I'm trying to think of another movie--but I can't--the main character in Lawrence of Arabia was English--although most of the supporting roles were Muslim--but that's as close as it comes.) The audiences here are seeing Dev Patel--and are identifying with him, cheering him on, hoping he ""gets the girl"" (in addition to the money!) He is a person, a human being--and America is embracing his character. I know this seems like a real exaggeration--but I think it is not all that far-fetched-- to say that in the same year that we elect a half-African American president, we will be giving an Oscar to a film that celebrates the joys and life of a brown-skinned character from the sub- continent, and a Muslim at that. I never thought I would ever see either in my lifetime--but in one fell swoop, it has happened within the same year. Wow! There is hope--maybe there is destiny--that decency, human understanding and compassion will prevail--we are taught this by a big-eared president, and a big-eared lead character in a commercial movie!!All the nay sayers about this film should be ignored--completely! It is not ""Poverty Porn"", it is not prejudicial or judgmental with regard to the country of India. It is not a contrived film, who's sole purpose is to provide manipulative entertainment. Yes--it uses an old-- fashioned, rags-to-riches, boy meets girl-boy loses girl-boy gets girl, where there are good guys and bad guys. This is a story with characters as old as the earliest Greek tragedies, and theatrical presentations from around the world and in cultures in every corner of every continent. But what makes this movie stand out is its glorious beauty, it's rich characterizations, it's basic human morality, it's mind-boggling artistry--I've seen the movie now 3 times--and each time I notice new wonderful details in terms of story line, pure film- making, and structure. This is a classic for the ages--that will live on as long as there are films being shown!And above and beyond the film--is that in having the audience celebrating decency and love and hope and belief in all the possibilities of life--they are forging an understanding of a culture and a people who are no different than any other people--and in so doing, it is creating enduring human bonds and enduring human understanding--this is no small achievement!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Such a feel good, awesome movie about reality in India.","I have seen this movie 3 times, and just cannot get enough!!Slumdog Millionaire is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while. I don't watch many Bollywood movies, because I have trouble with the fact that most are copies of American movies which my husband and I mostly watch, and mostly they are very unrealistic.This movie, however, is an honest movie about what the reality is in India. This stuff really happens. People in India are not too thrilled of the portrayal of the reality, because it shows the negative aspects of that Country. However, you cannot go to India, and escape that reality! There is severe poverty everywhere. It just breaks your heart. 1/3 of the world's poor are from India.This movie is just such an awesome story about survival, hope, courage and triumph of the human spirit. It just mesmerizes you from start to finish. Definitely a must see !!!Us Indians are really excited about the Oscar prospects for this movie...Rekha - Fremont, Ca",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"I wouldn't call it a 'feel good movie', but it's definitely great","(Very) Global: Slumdog millionaire is about a boy who grows up in different towns/cities in Inda, as a 'slumdog'. When he loses the love is his life, he's going to enter a television show called 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' (Dutch people might know it as 'Lotto Weekend Miljonairs'), in the hope she'll watch and come and meet him. In the beginning, no one thought the Slumdog would win ANY money, but because of his rich life experience and is horrible way of living, he knows almost every answer by himself. He ends up winning the jackpot; 20.000.000 rps.At first I didn't really know what to think about slumdog millionaire. I thought people only thought it was great BECAUSE it won eight Oscars, and not that it won eight Oscars BECAUSE it was great. But in the beginning of the movie I was immediately intrigued by the life Jamar and his family had to live trough. And I had the idea (especially in the beginning) that Jamar was the ONLY nice person in the whole movie. From is schoolteacher to the police, and from the police to the showhost, everyone treated him like crap. And the amazingly way of acting (extra compliments for the actors who played the little versions of the characters), made it even heavier, intenser, but more exciting and sweat to watch.Trough the whole movie the watcher is smacked in the face by terrible (and sadly realistic) stuff that's happening in the cities of India and it's slums. Corruption here, child prostitution there. But the movie amazingly balanced it all out by putting jokes in it that really made me laugh (and again; the little actors were a big factor in this matter).So my conclusion is; Besides the predictable and lame ending (and that's not even about the typical bollywood dance part), the movie was a great adventure that figuratively grabbed me from my seat and pulled me in to the screen. The acting, the writing and the AMAZINGLY direction gave you mixed feelings, but not at all in a negative way.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
don't bother wasting your time on this movie,"First of all the story wasn't great and frankly just stupid. I saw in the cinema only because it got good reviews but i was let down so much. Danny Boyle is a great director and i respect him but he should not have made this useless movie. First somehow Jamal k. Malik wins the ""who wants to a millionaire"" game show based on past experiences that don't make any sense (if he grew up in the slums how could he be so smart no education). Then after he celebrates by singing and dancing in such a fake accent it is not even funny. Then just randomly run in the streets how weren't they killed there would be cars.Then gets arrested (which would not happen in real life)for cheating and gets interrogated. I think the Oscars are rigged because it was not Oscar worthy in my opinion, because the Oscars it got was only really dumb things like music and cinematography.

"I am an Indian, and this one came as a surprise to me too!","Yes it did! Slumdog Millionaire - a title that made me think about three things - slums, dogs and a millionaire. And this movie related all three of them and made it into a masterpiece. It is not a Godfather, Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction. But it is REAL - as real as it can get. The 'in your face' reality of Indian slums (or any slum for that matter) and its hard to digest.How does it relate the three? - A guy from a slum - with a life comparable to a dog, aspires to become a millionaire, and the story is told artistically, with such perfection, honesty and beauty, that you don't feel like talking, moving etc. while its on the screen.

Perfection for the Profound Soul.,"This film can either be understood and loved, or it can be utterly misunderstood and disliked.I am a person who enjoys all the great works of literature, who thinks deeply over the many joys and sorrows of life, and who sheds tears in almost all situations because, although I am sensible, I am also emotional and find no fault in expressing what I feel. When watching this film, everything depends on how you think of life and what you believe is of greatest value.To explain what I mean, allow me to give you an example: my father is a computer engineer and his reaction to this film was, ""I don't think he would have continued playing the game once he reached 10 million if he wasn't certain of the answer."" To those who value material things more than the love and devotion of one person for another, even if they do not fully realize it or do not wish to admit it to themselves, this kind of a reaction is bound to spring up. However, those who are entirely cognizant, completely aware of the significance of love will reply, ""He did it because he loved her."" And yet, the cynics will not understand.This film is a roller coaster without a single pause. Not one second of it bores you, not one second will you be able to say, ""I know what's gonna happen now."" Certain emotions ascend, only to be overcome by different and even stronger emotions; this cycle goes on from beginning to end and as credits begin rolling, you will either label this film as pessimistic, or as fantastically optimistic.For those with personality traits similar to mine, for those with a mind of feeling and sentiment stronger than anything else, for those who have the ability to search for the meaning of things, no matter how bizarre the exterior, this film will be remembered for a very long time as the most beautifully written, breathtakingly optimistic masterpiece of the past years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Re: Danny Boyle reinvents himself,"Just saw this at Cinema Nova and I was blown away..Love Danny's early work such as Shallow Grave and Trainspotting but wasn't the biggest fan of Sunshine or 28 days Later..This, however, was amazing..So rich in characterization..I'm Indian myself from Mumbai so watching this was nostalgia and also a sense of how much we have it good and we don't even it know it sometimes :-)The early childhood sequences with the two kids were awesome..Funny, poignant and sad..However, as is life in Mumbai, the kids were always smiling and they just get on with life..Because there just isn't any other alternative..All you can do is dream, and for some, their dreams do come true..Well realized movie and the cutting back and forth between the quiz show and the way Jamal knew the answers kept the suspense and the momentum going..The sights and the colors of Mumbai were amazing and the two leads, Dev Patel and Freida Pinto excelled, in particular, Dev Patel, who I thought was an absolute revelationIs this the best movie of the year come Oscar time as a lot of people are claiming it to be?

Its a good movie but not worth winning 8 Oscars,This is a good movie taking an Indian typical story made in western style. Its full blown entertainment no doubt. But I am surprised how the American audience accepted this movie for 8 Oscars. There are tons of similar or better quality movies made in India which dint got any recognition for Oscars. Every year India submits one entry for Oscar but its not considered for award.Its story about two brothers. The story of lover and in a typical mumbai environment.

"Great Movie, but the best of the year? I think not","Let me start by saying that i really enjoyed this movie, I've always been a huge fan of Danny Boyle's work, and he didn't disappoint. Great feel good movie, beautiful visuals and fantastic performances (particularly from the younger actors). Its a definite DVD purchase. However this years best movie wasn't even nominated in the best picture category - the Dark Kight. I've always disliked the Batman movies, I actually hate the character! but this movie was clearly the years best. Look at the reviews across any of the movie databases, how can it be denied a best picture nomination? This years other nominations are heavy on performances & lacking story/direction or just too depressing to to be considered a contender by the Oscars. The Oscars decided the world needed a feel good movie in the face of the global economic problems and this was also a way to give Bollywood a small slice of the recognition its been robbed of for years.Sadly, no other movie stood a chance amidst the hype Hollywood heaped upon this movie, a movie which was supposed to go straight to DVD!!!!

Slumdog - yes indeed!,"So.. this is the great movie I've known about for almost a year. Sure I've heard about all the hype about it. Read the glowing reviews. So what did I do? After watching many bad movies, I saved this one for a time when I really wanted a winner. My trust is my fellow man at calling a good movie good is blown. Since when does a movie that is completely disjointed become Oscar material? My whole enthusiasm was gone when I saw the cops torturing the kid for winning the game show. What? That's right. The whole movie is built around a kid that wins the millions on a foreign version of ""who wants to be a millionaire."" Oh come on. The kid while acting the part is so unbelievable - as he wins more and more money.. shows ZERO emotion - no wonder they think he cheated! But the torturing done it for me. WAY over the top unbelievable. Then we get the most bizarre flash backs I've ever seen to try to ""explain"" why he knew the answers. The movie is a humiliation on the intelligence of mankind.

He isn't on the show for money, he's just there to get back his childhood love, hopin' she's watchin' the show. Cause he don't have any clue how to get her nor he has no idea what kinda questions he'll be asked on the show! Eventually he did answer all the questions with the help of his ""growin' up experiences in the slum"". Pretty neat! The story is written by Vikas Swarup. The book is called ""Q and A"".

Critically acclaimed in India and abroad, this international bestseller has been translated into 36 languages.

review,Danny Boyle returns to fine form in one of the most inspiring films of the year. Fantastic cinematography combined with excellent acting from Dev Patel playing Jamal Malick a young man facing challenges which lead him to one place in the hot seat on ''who wants to be a millionaire' .Supported by an excellent supporting class [ the children playing the younger Jamal are truly exceptional] Slumdog Millionaire is a film which subverts the Hollywood narrative and looks at another side of life which is not seen by many it shows how courage above adversity triumphs and how it is destiny which leads you to a place which will change your life.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Flawed but great in parts,"Well, the critics are getting awfully excited about this film, so I'd like to join the debate with a strong note of caution.This is a pretty good movie but I think the imperfection that lies at its heart is what stops it being a great movie. namely, the acting. Of it's 10 Oscar nominations not a single one is for the performances of its leading players and that is, in my view, totally appropriate.This movie is too much of a pick n mix affair to truly satisfy. The central cinematic device at its core, telling a life story (in three sub-generations; infant, child and teen means that its too stop-start to really fully engage.) What you find is that the two younger sections of the film are both more believable and more engaging than the latter stage which starts to unravel in credibility the more it develops.The performances of the two younger Jamals are light of touch, frequently hilarious - particularly in the movie's highlight where the youngest Jamal exits the latrines in true Trainspotting style - and quite moving. Poor old, rather wooden and not especially engaging, Dev Patel has to deal with a plot that is becoming more ridiculous by the moment as his pursuit of the beautiful Latika verges, at times, on the preposterous. How Salim can continually cross paths with the object of his affection so often in a city with a population twice that of the whole of the UK was beyond me.OK, that's all the bad stuff out of the way, now let's turn to the positives. The cinematography (an Oscar nod for Anthony Dod Mantle) and sound design in this movie combine to stunning effect at times. It's like a Discover documentary at its best and you simply cannot get enough of Mumbai, which is given added oomph by the music of A.R. Rahman who picks up no less than three Oscar nominations. Nice use of MIA's music in places too.It's actually all the technical disciplines that this movie excels in and has been recognised for (sound, sound editing, music, cinematography and editing). so that neatly brings us to its direction.Danny Boyle.What to make of him? Well, a director's job is to realise all aspects of a production from performance to technical. I think the script blew his chances of the former but he has excelled at the latter and to many it is seen as the highlight of his career. I beg to differ. His track record is patchy to say the least. Trainspotting is by far the most overrated film of its generation (not a patch on his brilliant Shallow Grave), The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary are best glossed over. But 28 Days Later is as good a horror movie as has been made since The Shining, and Sunshine is as good as it gets in Sci fi. Both are, in my humble opinion at least, better movies than Slumdog.But you lot don't seem to agree. A quick look at Boyle's IMDb ratings shows that the public consider Slumdog his masterpiece with a rating of 8.7 (astonishingly, that places it 34th in IMDb's all time list). How is this possible in a seemingly foolproof ratings mechanism? Early enthusiasm? Maybe as the ratings mature he will come back to the field. I'd think that will indeed be the case as old moaners like me get our way.Here are all his cinematic releases and how IMDb rate them; and my own views. Please feel free to scoff or agree as you see fit.Slumdog IMDb 8.7 Me 7 Sunshine IMDb 7.3 Me 9 28 Days later IMDb 7.5 Me 9 Shallow Grave IMDb 7.4 Me 9 Trainspotting IMDb 8.2 Me 5 (this is ranked 182 of all time on IMDb - Holy cow!) The Beach IMDb 6.2 Me 5For the record, A life Less ordinary picks up 6.4 and Millions gets a 7.2 on IMDb. I haven't seen either, but the bit of ALLO that I saw looked poor.I like Slumdog a lot I have to say, but its imperfections were too significant to overlook. Much as I hoped it would indeed be the feelgood movie of all time (or whatever the marketing blurb claims) it wasn't, but it was a great visual and aural spectacle that merits a trip to your local cinema. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Perhaps the Most Efficient Movie ever made. Good, seen better.","Jamal(Dev Patel) a boy from slums, by chance, gets selected for Indian version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"", and destiny chooses him to be the next millionaire, one wonders, how is it possible for a boy from slums to answer all questions and become a millionaire, but ""IT IS WRITTEN"". Slumdog Millionaire is a story of a boy, Jamal, who is born in a slum in Mumbai, then is chased away from the slums. He then meets Lathika(childhood love), they get separated. Then Jamal searches for her, and this search leads to a journey which is both dangerous and miraculous, yet is so engrossing that one cannot blink while watching the movie.Made with a small budget of $15 million, and yet possessing some of the most brilliant screenplay, music, cinematography, to make a final product that is a valuable piece of art and yet a very distinct movie. Yes, it is Slumdog Millionaire.These days when big bucks are needed to make a movie having great music, sound, effects, big stars etc. We wonder some times whether money is simply wasted sometimes on a particular scene or movie. Like for example the new ""Superman"", which had the bucks but not the quality. Slumdog is exactly the opposite of Superman, Slumdog has no bucks but all the quality. This movie is an example of how efficiently money can utilized, how well a movie can be made with a small budget.

Slumdog has a similar story to a short film titled Boot Polish made last year,"I went to watch Slumdog Millionaire and it was a very good film. The film is kinda similar to a short film titled Boot Polish made by a new British film director Aneel Ahmad in 2007.Both stories covering the same premise. Kid from poverty and saving a girl at the end with great music and cinematography. The perfect cocktail for a Bollywood MovieBoot Polish has no real dialogue and it was more tailored for the cinema of Satyajit Ray. Visual style rather than storyline which needed to be stronger. But its very Bollywood as well and has a cross over genre feel to it. It's a wonderful start by a novice filmmaker and it is unquestionably a real accomplishment.Slumdog Millionaire as a film was crafted for western audience. It was more of a roller-coaster ride shot at a high speed rate. I think the only thing that let Slumdog down was the English dialogue, it just made it seem unreal.Both films Boot Polish and Slumdog Millionaire are both pioneering cross genre Bollywood films and they are very difficult to create because you are trying to grab two very different audiences.Many Asian film-goers usually feel that British directors tend to be insensitive when shooting abroad, but i feel that Ahmad & Boyle had researched and perhaps adopted the idea of shooting Boot Polish & Slumdog Millionaire in a more Bollywood Style - Hence Romeo & Juliet. So it would appeal to the masses.I highly recommend Boot Polish if anyone can get hold of it! There are some great new film directors emerging within the British scene. So it's exciting times. Ahmad has had great critical success with his shorts by audiences across the world and his films have been endorsed by so many established film directors - Ridley Scott, Quentin Tarantino, Mike Leigh, Alan Parker and Peter Carlton who is an executive at Film 4 (co financed Slumdog Millionaire), the list is endless.Danny Boyle should give Aneel Ahmad some mentoring advice because he is sure to be one of the next best film directors we have in England.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It's a roller coaster ride!  Best film of the year. Watch it now!,"Slumdog Millionaire deftly portrays stark poverty and the stark contrast conspicuous in the Indian society wherein the millionaires live within a stone's throw of a million slum-dwellers. The movie never fails to highlight the spirit of these people who embrace the extremes and are relentlessly desperate in fulfilling their dreams.Those who criticize the film calling it a westerner's portrayal of Indian society had better realize that our own Bollywood directors have still not got off the 'India Shining' bandwagon. Their NRI cinema is far from the bigger reality. Movies are meant to hold a mirror to the society and Slumdog Millionaire does exactly that(of course in a dramatic way). It's realistic, contemporary, lucid and has a deep message.The movie revolves around three characters-Jamal Malik, Salim Malik(Jamal's brother) and Latika(Jamal's love interest) who live in abject poverty in Dharavi(world's largest slum) in Mumbai. Despite his horrific, unimaginable experiences like riots and even a near-mutilation, the protagonist Jamal is essentially scrupulous. He manages to get on the show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati'- India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' only to establish contact with his lady love, an ardent fan of the show, who is a gangster's keep. The host and the entire nation is spellbound as to how a 'chaiwalla', who has no formal education, answers every question thrown at him. But his real motive is not big bucks but love. Herein lies the beauty of the movie which manifests that true love transcends everything else.Danny Boyle takes out the best from his actors(esp. the child actors). Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is breathtaking. Rahman's music elevates the film.At the end of the day, Slumdog Millionaire lives up to the hype surrounding it. It deserves all the accolades its getting worldwide. It certainly is one of the best India-centric movies ever made. Watch it!

silly nationalists,"Its absolutely appalling that being an Indian myself I find that the people who are giving the movie negative ratings here and as well as on most other public forums are Indians.For once, let prejudice and nationalism (not patriotism) take a backseat and let people enjoy the movie for what it is.I always chuckle at my fellowmen cringing over the slums shown in a foreign film as if the directors intention was to portray the whole country as one which is in fact not the case. reflect any negative aspect of the country and we have our nationalists screaming foul and ruining ratings on a forum.Its amusing how at one end they would refuse to acknowledge the slum life as being an integral part of the dynamic country while at the same time would spend money watching pure B grade bollywood flicks running and singing around trees.So Amitabh Bacchan who in India is something like John Travolta + Brad pitt + Leonardo Caprio + Tom cruise put together x 10 blasted the movie for showing the country in a negative light. Mind you, this is the same ageing superstar who when goes to a routine checkup at the hospital, people line up in the thousands to offer their prayers.So I have one question for Sir Amitabh, had his blockbuster movie ""Black"" in which he portrayed a older teacher taking care of a young blind girl who eventually kissed her been made by a western director would he have blasted it for portraying all Indian men as pedophiles as well !?!? Or more recently his other work ""Bhagban"" where kids refuse to take care of their elderly parents portray the plight of an entire nation or a certain few Mr bacchan !? Obviously you can relate to what Im saying that movies are meant to pick on a theme and build around it they cannot cover each and every broad aspect or else you wouldn't have a movie.Or for that matter the hundreds of scores he has done running around trees singing proposing the actress realistic in any sense !? I can assure Sir Bacchan that not more than a 100 out of a population of billion would have echoed that sort of melodrama while finding their lady love.Danny Boyle has done a beautiful job elegantly touching the lives of people in the millions who live below the poverty line and their day to day struggles, something that the bollywood fraternity that is based in Mumbai itself rarely touches.I find it ridiculously hilarious that people would argue about India's growing economy and middle class base etc etc etc to somehow prove to the western audience the country is better than what is portrayed. Guess what ?! the western world doesn't really care a 2 hoots, they just appreciate a good movie.

Simply an inspiring movie,"After watching Bakwaas movies such as Ghajini, Welcome, Sing is King (absolutely Bakwaas), Golmaal Returns and Chandni Chowk To China this is truly an outstanding and inspiring movie to watch. Beautifully directed and well written.To those people who are saying this move does not represent real India I suggest they should visit India and one of those slum areas. This movie portrays real life and not Disneyland, but doses it in way which makes us understand the social divide we have in India. Where minority controls the wealth & power and majority live below poverty line, and let's not forget about child labour.Is this movie depressing? NO. It show's us a part of India which I am certain no body is proud of, and tries to explain it by bringing this controversial issue to public which we all like to ignore/oversee.At list this movie is trying to portray less privileged humans who don't have daddy's express account or mummy's chicken biryani to eat everyday. Name me one good Bollywood movie which tried to bring the class/wealth division to the screen without implanting the concept of Romeo and Juliet.I am sorry to disappoint people but this movie doesn't have random song every five minutes nor does it have sexed up vulgar women's with tits out. What it does have it tells the story of two brothers struggling to survive through any means possible. How society exploits them and in the end what it makes each of them.This movie is essentially about how people try to survive through hardship and struggle and still have hope in the end, and how you should never give up. You will not be disappointed when the movie ends.Regardless of what it portrays I have found this movie to be extremely well made inspiring and one of the best I have seen. It has defiantly moved me and also has inspired me enough to believe in hope again. It is ultimately for us (Indian) to change our country for its betterment. It is easy to criticise something from the warmth of your bedroom, but it is another to actually help someone in need.P.S. And when was the time you actually helped one of those slum kids with descent food or clothes?

A crowd-pleaser for the less discriminating.,"A young man from an Indian slum wins millions from a trivia game show but is tortured and detained by police on suspicion of fraud. In order to prove his innocence, he recounts his life story and how its incidental details informed each correct answer.Director Danny Boyle complements this fresh narrative structure with an effusive energy, creating mystery and exciting melodrama. But as the mystery dissolves with exposition, the structure turns predictable and soon collapses in its redundancy. What remains is a long yarn of melodramatic talessome exciting, some heavy-handed but when tallied up, it's fatiguing. Still, the film manages a sweet, uplifting resolution; it's a crowd-pleaser for the less discriminating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
India wink,"The Best Picture winner of 2008 depicts young Jamal (Dev Patel) from Mumbai's slums winning on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" but getting suspected of cheating. During the interrogation, Jamal tells the police inspector how he learned the answers through his childhood experiences.First of all, this is a fascinating look at the subcontinent. I got a feeling of how it is to come of age in these cramped, gritty ghettos that dot South Asia (although that's probably nothing compared to living the experience). By gritty, I mean squat toilets, raids by Hindu mobs on the Muslims, and forced labor. And in the end, the ghettos get cleared to make way for modern high-rises. But Jamal does whatever he has to in order to pull through, and never abandons his love for Latika (Freida Pinto).""Slumdog Millionaire"" is one impressive scene after another. Whether showing dance sequences, chases, or an entire focus on the Taj Mahal, director Danny Boyle (of ""Trainspotting"" fame) does everything right. I should say that I probably wouldn't have given this movie Best Picture over ""Milk"", but this is still a good one. Given India's rising international clout, I wonder if we'll be seeing more Oscar winners, and hopefully ones that focus on the social status in the world's second most populous country.

Film is good but i felt that the film is overrated,"Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 drama directed by Danny Boyle. The film stars Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Madhur Mittal, Anil Kapoor, late Irrfan Khan, Saurabh Shukla and Mahesh Manjrekar.The film is a is a loose adaptation of the novel Q & A (2005) by Indian author Vikas Swarup and tells about a teenager from the slums of Mumbai becomes a contestant on the show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati?' When interrogated under suspicion of cheating, he revisits his past, revealing how he had all the answers.I have heard lot about the film and was very keen and interested to watch the film after understanding that the film has won 8 Oscars my interest has rises manifold times but despite of the fact that the film is indeed beautiful but in my opinion the film is an overrated film and not the kind of film about the viewers or were going gaga.The plot of the film is good and execution is also decent, the sub plots of the film is basically the strongest point of the film. Acting is great and Dev Patel was superb, Late Irrfan Khan was equally impressive, Freida Pinto was little underused and Anil Kappor was impressive in few of the scenes, support cast of the film is also good.Screenplay of the film is good and cinematography is also good. Music is mesmerizing and AR Rahman won Oscar for his film but in my opinion this is not his best work and if you are willing to listen to his best work then you must hear Roja, Bombay or Dil Se.. Climax of the film is good and gives a decent closure to the film. If you haven't seen the film then the film can be watched once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This is an inspiring film.,"A young man, who grew up in a slum, is on one of those television shows where you answer questions to win a lot of money. After each win he has the option of quitting with what he has one or passing the money up for an opportunity to win more. He is a phenomenal success, although he does not seem to care whether he wins or loses.Through flashbacks the viewer learns about his growing up in a slum and of the suffering and degradation entailed in that. Some really terrible things happen to the characters in this tale.There is a love story. This movie has characters you come to care about. It is not like the soulless, puking garbage Hollywood keeps shoveling at us. It is a work of art. See it if you get the opportunity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Excellent, 28 Dec 2008","As a British born Indian, I wanted to see Boyle take on his version of a bollywood film with a good mix of his direction, all the charm that most of Indian films have. Result, a good directorial effort with an Indian version of City of God; far less brutal and replaces that sardonic hardship from City of God to the hopeful dreams of a young boy from the slums, very much a style common in Indian films today.I've been to India before and seen what this film shows. It doesn't make it less dreary by sugar coating; that's not Boyle's style, he will show what is there and this film depicts India's culture, beauty, depression, poverty, lustre, greed, vengeance, corruption and all the moralities. You might be mistaken into thinking I'm being patriotic but the fact is Boyle has made a very good film, with keeping the actual Indian viewers of this film in mind. He has given it a love story like most Indian films while providing the action and tension that so many Indian-film lovers sitting on corner streets in Mumbai and Delhi will want to see.I've lived in West London all my life and this is as close to showing India any European film has done in the last 20 years, that includes Bend it like Beckham, etc.West-Londoner-born, like myself, Dev Patel made his debut on SKINS, and excellent UK drama series involving the life of College/Sixformer teens. A good choice since learning an language and accent is easier, but also a familiar face to those who watch Skins. The main focus is on him becoming more than he is, a subtle underdog story that doesn't boast of its pious superiority. He just wants to find the girl, Latika, he met when he was a boy, save her from poverty, prostitution and give her a life she deserves. Along with that, Dev's character known as Jamal Malik has a older brother Salim Malik who cares for money and the high-life, anyway he can get it. It's the Romulus and Remus tale with loads of morality. There are 3 actors per character of Jamal, Salim & Latika, each depicting the 3 main characters at different ages who are excellently cast, cute and innocent from the younger ages; to the older actors who play them as time and chance have made them into what they are now, with their knowledge of the world changing their day-to-day perceptions. Dev's character gets the chance to play on ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" in India (Indian Version) with familiar host and legendary Indian actor Anil Kapoor. What could a slum-dog know of the world, more than most. He's graduating from the university of life.Contrasting, political, brutal, and bitter-sweet. 8.5/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Very enjoyable,"Danny Boyle has a bit of a hit and miss record directing films. This is very much Boyle on form.Slumdog follows the fortunes of Jamal who is a slum dweller from Mumbai. At it's heart it's a love story between Jamal and Latika told as we watch Jamal's appearance on ""Who Want's to be a millionaire"". Although it tells the story of a tough world it's a feel good movie that lifts the heart. Boyle obviously referenced some of his old movies and the films toilet scene brings back memories a similar scene from Trainspotting.It seems like this movie is going to pick up a number of awards and you can't really object to this as it's very nicely played and has a good script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It should have a better rating,"This film impressed me. and i guess it will impress more people from now on. I've heard of it an went to see the movie, but first i thought it will be a classic Indian movie, until it started.The film has a great idea, and it really presents a hard way of life, but the movie has only the 42nd place in the rating above.In my my opinion it should be above The Godfather I and II, and also in my opinion this movie it's greater than TDK, although, TDK, deserves it's rank.OK, short story long, you will be amazed by this movie, you will leave the cinema with a great feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,"As someone who has seen Mumbai turn from 'The City of Gold' to 'The City of Muck,' this movie encapsulated the despair and desperation of Dharavi in a manner so gritty it was scary. It cut terrifyingly close to the bone as it took us straight into the innards of this brutal world, where wide-eyed kids lose their innocence (and their eyes) at the hands of ruthless gangsters who mutilate, maim, kidnap and kill at will. And the first thought that came to mind is that it has taken an 'outsider' (Danny Boyle), to go fearlessly into 'No Man's Land' and hold up a mirror to our sordid society  the same one that looks the other way... and flinches when confronted. It also makes one wonder why some of our entirely overrated, desi directors (homegrown products, at that), have failed so spectacularly in spelling out the ugly truth about Mumbai's dark world as transparently and convincingly? Whether or not Boyle's film wins an Oscar or two is immaterial. It should be made compulsory viewing for anybody who wants to understand the shocking, ghastly subtext that deals with the 'other' Mumbai  the one that feeds on abject poverty and paradoxically enough, also on the soaring hope that this same poverty breeds success. But Slumdog... is Boyle's gift to Mumbai. He has unblinkingly shown us the rather hideous face of this devastated metropolis that still remains the magnet for the rest of India, despite its faultlines.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A modern-day fairy tale about love and destiny,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the story of a young man in India. All he cares about in the world is a girl. In an effort to find his lost love, he becomes a contestant on the popular game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"". Hoping the girl is out there watching, the boy aims to go as far as he can on the show. As destiny would have it, the questions he's asked can be answered from his experiences as an orphan on the streets of Mumbai. When the uneducated young man reaches the 20-million-rupee question, he is arrested and interrogated on suspicion of cheating.But the money never mattered to the boy. His only motive is to see the girl again. Orphaned as children, Jamal (the boy), Salim (his older brother), and Latika (the girl) were all each other had. They survived many ordeals, being separated, finding each other, and being separated again. Jamal always cared for Latika and is the only person who treats her well. Jamal never forgets about Latika and never gives up on her.I liked the film, though I've heard many criticisms of it. I see SLUMDOG as a love story. Or as another poster suggested, a fairy tale. I do not think the movie was meant to be taken at face value as an it-could-happen-to-you story of rags to riches luck. The money was never important to Jamal. He'd walk away empty-handed if it meant being with Latika.As for its predictability, I didn't have a problem knowing how the love story would end. I wasn't sure if Jamal would win the jackpot, because I knew that it didn't matter either way to him. It's not difficult to predict the ending, but getting there is half the fun.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE cleaned up at the Oscars. It's a very well-crafted film (in terms of cinematography, direction, etc.) and viewers tend to get swept up in the romantic story. Not everybody loved it. (It's not exactly a thriller, it's not action-packed or cerebral, it's not a musical, and, yes, there are factual errors regarding ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"".) But it's a good little love story, if that's what you're looking for. I liked the final 45 minutes the best.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Well made but didn't enjoyed even 15 minutes...do you know why?,"because first of all it is all so much unofficially melodramatic that nothing interests me...added to shockingly abusive language made me disgust for it. When you use f* word in Goodfellas, it is justified but when.....Mr. Trainspotting maker used it to make his movie look realistic, I was sure its going to be one more typo from him. What interests the viewer is Mr. The Beach maker used or adapted a story which is feel good kind...so you can all enjoy your fantasies of getting success at the end, and nothing bad in that, at least it entertains.Then why did it got 'di Oscar'. the plain reason that the amazing movie 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' was not well connected with its end....according to the movie geeks. Rest other movies were pure Hollywood style porn and disgust which can't get Oscar what so ever. And i wonder where was 'The Dark Knight' in best pictures?? So, as Mr. buttons is out of the race, slumdog wins it. No doubt it is a nice enjoyable movie but only for western or westernized minds. The problem that i found with it was Mr. Danny Boyle tried to make it for world wide audience by mixing Hollywood style to bollywood, which unfortunately is not possible because of a huge cultural difference, lack of maturity in new ones, too filmy brains on one side and general requirements.The songs were good, new to the academy and audience, so i can't say it was any bad. In all this was a nicely directed, poorly adapted and dumbly acted, too average movie. One time watch at most.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good but doesn't deserve the Oscar,"I'm not sure how Oscars awarded to the movies. Now i have a deep doubt with the system itself.I had always looked up to the Oscars as a body providing good justice to great movies - Is that not why they are there where they are now??? I'm still looking for some deep answers about this movie winning so many Oscars...OK. I would not say the movie is bad. the movie is good but not great by any stretch of imagination. How can anyone compare this movie with the likes of Gandhi, Amadeus, My fair lady which too has won 8 Oscars each... I have seen better movies than this that were not even nominated for the Oscars...I don't know what is wrong with the system? Anyway that's about my grief...As far as the movie is concerned it is a very nicely scripted movie with decent acting and good music. Again, the music doesn't deserve an Oscar. AR Rahman does deserve an Oscar for whatever he had done earlier but for THIS????? NO WAY!!!! IT is not even close to anything worth mentioning as far as i'm concerned...If at all you wanna watch this movie, i'd strongly recommend it but just be open enough to realize the facts...",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Emotional Connectivity Blends with Visual Panache in Boyle's Hindi Fanciful Tale of Destiny,"It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's (""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"") emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickensian quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular ""Millionaire"" host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair's ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Vanity Fair"", and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable, ""Millions"", there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shocker ""Sunshine"", the post-apocalyptic thriller ""28 Days Later"", the drug-infested ""Trainspotting"") that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father in ""The Namesake"") as the determined police inspector. There are times when the film feels overly manipulative, but the buoyant spirit keeps thing afloat just when you feel you've been left on sensory overload.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Decent Though Unremarkable Film Worthy of Recommendation,"After hearing so many positive remarks about how this was one of the best, if not THE best film of the year my curiosity for it raised. Going into the film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I half-heartedly felt that I'd be either horribly disappointed or completely blown away (since I tend to be in the love it/hate it crowd for critically praised films such as this one). After leaving my theater (which was filled with people at least three times my age) I was saying to myself ""eh, it was a good film, but not Oscar-worthy"".While this might sound like I have an overall negative opinion of the film this is far from the case. Slumdog is a perfectly good film that's worth a watch by anyone really interested in seeing it. That said, I can't call it anything more than ""good"" or ""solid"" since it was certainly likable but far from awe-spiring.The story revolves around Jamal Malik who, upon coming one question from winning an Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? is confronted and accused of cheating. Up until the last ten minutes the film is told in flashbacks as Jamal explains how he knew the answers to certain questions, with a considerable chunk revolving around him and his brother Salim and the troubled connection he has with Lakita, a girl they meet as kids early in the film. I liked the approach they went with giving the answers to certain questions a backstory from Jamal; I was actually hoping they did a flashback for each question but given the film's overall approach, it's easily understandable why they didn't go with this approach.One of the film's strengths is that it manages to feel authentic with the story revolving around the characters and the struggles they face. While I will say the dialogue felt rather clunky and slightly ridiculous at times the film manages to feel mostly believable thanks to its mostly down-to-earth approach with Jamal and Salim. As for the acting, everyone did a mostly solid job. Dev Patel manages to create a likable character (despite some on again, off again acting), Madhur Mittal creates a very believable adult Salim though Freida Pinto would have to be my favorite performer in the movie as the adult Lakita; she manages to make a great character who's very easy to like and sympathize with.There are a few strong moments in the film that will catch the audiences' attention (almost all of them unpleasant), most of which occur in the first half of the film. Comedic bits are few and far between, which does work in the film's favor since it maintains a core mood throughout the runtime. All told, it's a well-rounded package, with a sufficient ending that feels like it flows well and naturally as with the rest of the film.But why isn't this film anything truly amazing (for me at least)? Mostly because there really isn't anything in the film that's truly impressive or spectacular save for a few select scenes. The acting as I mentioned is solid though some performances are better than others (particularly with the supporting cast), dialogue is hit-or-miss and the film does drag out a bit leading up to the end. These aren't major issues and don't keep the film from being enjoyable, but as the film stands it only holds up as being a good, mildly entertaining watch (and I use ""entertaining"" lightly here).This is a good, solid film that I would suggest watching if you're curious to see what it's like and know enough about the film going in. That said, I can't say this film is Oscar-worthy in my books and is far from being the best film I've seen this year. You may and possibly will like the film a lot more than me for all I know, which is perfectly fine by me; I'd rather at least half enjoy a film everyone else loves than not like it at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"No Slumming here, pure class....","Danny Boyle has been able to combine effortless style with a heart warming story, he has really stepped up his game with Slumdog. I felt like I was on a journey with Jamal, ultimately I found the film to be an uplifting experience, an inspiration not because of the money or fame it was more in spite of these elements. You don't get many movies that speak to you and I wasn't expecting the world when I saw it but I received so much.The imagery the Director uses to conjure the emotive explanations that form the movie's skeleton are really apt, he manages to tread the fine line between style and substance perfectly. The film easily fits into its 2 hour running time without much fat to speak of. The unknown talent are punching well above their weights and I found all of them to be excellent. The young Jamal and Salim form the backbone of the story with Latika as the love interest, this triangle of hope and determination is what the real story is about. Sacrifice plays a large part too and in these moment we find the real humanness in all three characters. 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' is a large part of the story but you leave the movie feeling that 'Millionaire' could have actually stayed at home in this wonderfully colorful, dynamic and sad portrayal of life in a slum.

How to make THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR: Amelie+City of God+Quiz Show+Bollywood+Danny Boyle= THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR,"Danny Boyle has created a modern day version of what the great old films use to be like, mixed in perfectly with what grounded modern indie cinema is supposed to be today. The film has elements of life determining fate, Crime in poverty stricken streets, heart-pulsing sound, a bone chilling score that should earn A.R. Rahman an Oscar, great soundtrack, performances by unknown actors which adding even more vitality too the film, competition and love between brothers, and a destined romance. what more can you ask of a film today. it is so hard too accomplish something like this today when most of the films that try too this fail, look at Baz Luhrman's ""Australia"". That project failed because it tried too copy the old instead of using the old and too create something more unique. The chase scene through the streets of mumbai when Jamal is a boy running from the cops is just as of an action scene as when Harvey Dent is being transported too the Jail and The Joker is chasing him in the Dark Knight(noticed I said almost). The film is tragic and deals with real issues, but because you are seeing the film through a child's eyes it is not depressing because children never get down for too long. Children and Pre-Teens always find the bright side of a situation, they are really much better at getting by happy then adults. This is a bold film that reached for a lot of different goals and succeeded triumphantly. If the film doesn't win best picture at the Oscars, I will loose all hope in the academy. Look out for a Oscar nominations in editing, sound, screenplay, director, and I wouldn't even be surprised if Dev Patel gets nominated for best supporting actor.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best film of the year and MY FAVORITE FILM OF THE YEAR, because of not being afraid to be about fate and crime and love and death.

A nice fairytale movie.,"I went yesterday to watch this movie. I had read some critics and I decided to give it a try and after 2 hours I left the theatre with a mix of feelings. First of all I have to admit that If the movie had been 100% American. Meaning that actors, and scenes had been shot at any place in Europe or America the movie would have been completely forgettable. Liked or not, and in my point of view (being European) see some Indian stuff everywhere made this movie enjoyable and I'm not going to judge now if it's or not realistic.Saying that I liked the movie. Don't watch it as a masterpiece or under any big spectations cause in that case it will failed. Watch it as a fairytale based in India. With bad guys, good ones, love and almost impossible endings. The movie doesn't pretend to show us India in deep but it gives you brushes of it and that Boyle makes a really good work with the camera.The movie is predictable, indeed it is. That is not realistic, probably it is not. But it touches you. Makes you feel different feelings along the movie.

Oscars at the ready.,"One of the best films of 2008 and should definitely win best picture Oscar as it presses all those buttons that the industry loves. A great concept - that all the questions on 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' have some significance in the life of a Mumbai street urchin. I think this will have added resonance for those who have visited Mumbai and Agra, but even if you've never been to India you will warm to this movie. The acting is excellent, from the children up to the adult protagonists, the story is believable and well paced, and the end credits are very uplifting. The soundtrack is also fantastic. It has the distinct feel of a European Independent film, like Cinema Paradiso, with the whole life story of the leading characters being played out.

Quite unbelievable that this was nominated for anything, let alone receiving the crazy amount of Oscars it received. Some hands must have been greased. The story itself is ludicrous, the message overly simplistic, not to mention patronizing.

Boyle generates feel good motive in stunningly set drama,"Jamal Malik (Patel) is accused of cheating on Who Wants to be a Millionaire with one question left and when questioned by authorities, he recounts his life story.Danny Boyle's 2008 Oscar winner brought many to see the light in the dark dramas of the other Oscar potentials amongst David Fincher's Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon. All strong conceptual dramas and amongst these stood the Englishman's sentimental feel good picture about an apparent cheat on a game show that delighted viewers all over the world.Filmed in Mumbai, Slumdog is a complex rags to riches story that shines with a warm intensity whilst generating a strong drama of life in the slums of India with Boyle once more establishing himself as one of the finest scenery directors to grace our screens.At first the Oscar dominator starts as a slow paced establisher by bringing out the sequence of the present of Dev Patel's Jamal being punished in Prison, through a literally shocking manor. From there he starts explaining his life story and how he came to be on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and how he was doing everything for one person.Danny Boyle certainly handles flashbacks exceptionally well. From Trainspotting to The Beach he swerves the story into a conundrum of possibilities and expectations. As we travel back and forth through events we learn more and more about the accused and Boyle again is establishing the character to fit our viewing requirements. From the desperate surge of rivalry with his brother to the desperation of finding his lost love, Jamal's sentimental plot resounds around the tightly woven Oscar winning script.What is astonishing about this film however is Boyle's direction and never before has an Oscar been more deserved. From the sharp sweeping shots of India to the sophisticated televised moments Boyle's continuity is to be greatly appreciated as the way the story flows in comparison to Boyle's established scenery setting helps generate the importance and hardness of growing up in the slums and being the most popular person in India.Dev Patel's first major role is vastly different from his beautifully lively Anwar in Skins. The sentiment and repressed desire fits exquisitely to the story's emotional core whilst Frieda Pinto gives good balance.There are flaws in this picture. The first part of the film is immensely boring and the pace and energy of the situation takes a while to generate the feeling of proclaimed ""destiny"". Anil Kapoor is exceptionally annoying as the TV presenter whilst the dance sequence at the very end gives of an unforgivable cheesy vibe.But there can be minimal doubt that Slumdog deserves its praise with a sentimental feel good motive and once more Boyle is on top form with stunning scenery direction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Fantastic Movie. About as Good as Hollywood's Ever Offered.,"I loved this movie. It really did capture a life (many lives, in fact). Some parts were touching, others striking in their social commentary. The cinematography was excellent; even with a non-linear plot, our perspective was never lost and the transitions were never jarring.I have to laugh at myself. I never watch TV, and never watch shows like ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,"" but I was on the edge of my seat half the time. I think it's because the characters were so well developed, I cared about the outcomes. And because the characters were so plausible, I felt like the events in the movie weren't just determining the fate of these few people, but were giving a voice to the millions who lead similar lives.I recommend everyone see it. Let yourself relive the process of growing up, when you have to learn some hard realities of life and determine which of your youthful beliefs are worth preserving.(And, just in case that was too touchy feely, let me make it clear: there is something in this movie for everyone. It is entertainment at its finest. Exciting, mesmerizing, and meaningful.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the most inspirational and beautiful stories ever told on film,"First off, you need to believe the hype surrounding this film. Whether it be one of the most gripping and heartwrenching stories ever shown on film, or the wonderful direction of Danny Boyle, everything you've heard about this film is true, as Slumdog Millionaire is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the best I've ever seen.I've never been more sure of a film's greatness this quickly before. Even for my all time favorite films, it took a few viewings to make them my favorite. Not this one. The story behind this incredible journey is inspiring, as are the technical achievements of it. It's a capsule that will transport you into an entirely different culture, and give you an experience that should stick with you for a long time.For those that do not know, the film's plot follows Jamal Malik, who is one question away from winning the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"". However, once he is suspected of cheating, Jamal uses his past as a ""slumdog"" to explain how he knows the answer to every question. What follows is easily the best story of 2008 on film, and it would be a crime to tell you any more.Though Slumdog Millionaire focuses on three characters in particular, it's hard to review all of the actors...Mostly because a grand total of NINE different actors portray each of the characters in total, three each for each time period. However, that doesn't stop Dev Patel from turning in an Oscar worthy performance as the oldest version of Jamal. His performance, as well as those of the other two boys who play Jamal, carve out one of the most likable characters you'll ever find, because of his perseverance, determination, and unwavering kindness. This is more of a case of an actor riding the coattails of such a well written character.Freida Pinto as the oldest version of Latika did a wonderful job in such a pivotal role despite limited screen time. She was a joy to watch, both from a movie goer's standpoint and a male's standpoint, as she's unbelievably gorgeous. There is no weak spot in the cast, right down to all the other actors who play the kids, as well as the adults in the film. It's one of the best ensembles of the year.Though Slumdog Millionaire is an ""inspirational"" movie, it is not without its darker themes, as it deals with deception, betrayal, and the brutality of living in the life that Jamal must lead. It's even more amazing how kind and caring Jamal is despite the environment the film takes place in.The awesome genre director Danny Boyle may already have his masterpiece with this film, and I really think he hasn't even hit his peak yet, as this would be tough to top. It takes a lot of ability to bring such a fine script to the screen without messing it up, but Boyle does a beautiful job with his vivid sets, as well as camera work that reminds me of his excellent film, ""28 Days Later"". Though this film is vastly different, they share the similar theme of survival, something that is a recurring theme in all of Boyle's films. He was already one of my favorite directors, but now he may be getting close to David Fincher for the top spot.As I've already said, the sets, camera work, and editing are all flawless, but I think it's the film's score that really sets the tone, as it flows so well with the setting, characters, and the story itself. This was part of the reason I was in tears at the end, which really doesn't happen to me all that often. Every aspect of the film is at such a high level that it all blends together perfectly to craft what may be the best movie of 2008.Slumdog Millionaire, in short, is a film that cannot be missed by anyone. It's an inspiring and beautiful story that will move anyone. I know it's already one of my favorites, and it may end up staying there for a very, very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Thanks for All the Fuss,"Slumdog Millionaire, for all the great cinematography, does not really capture the essence of Mumbai. Plenty of Indian movies capture the true stigma of poverty, or the true horror of the underworld, far better. Let us for a moment give Danny Boyle the artistic license, and run through the vignettes here. The depiction of poverty is a sham. The rioting is unconvincing. The beggary racket is trite and equally unconvincing. The fact that each answer coincidentially relates to each (painful) vignette in the life of the protagonist is a cruel joke? Is this even a movie worth making a fuss about? There is great cinematography, but in the end I feel sorry for the legions of Indian directors, unwept unhonoured and unsung, whose far better portrayals of Mumbai go unnoticed simply because they lack the ""brand"" of a Danny Boyle. If this movie is worth four Golden Globes, some of India's movies of 2008 are worth at least as many Oscars",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
As if we required more proof that the Oscars are nothing to go by when trying to find out about quality,"It's not a coincidence that I didn't watch this when it was playing in theaters. Honestly, the notion never even crossed my mind. I found myself wondering why people whose opinion I respect were going to see it. Since then, I saw the high rating, and recently, someone that I know to have impeccable taste in movies(with the odd exception) suggested it and lent it to me. I haven't read the book, but I understand it's quite different from this. Part of what sold me on this was also Danny Boyle, as I've loved everything else I've seen by him. He brings his stunning visuals, impeccable energy as well as his ability to deliver gripping cinema, with very different plots. Wait... there's... something's missing. And I think I know what it is; the psychological/disturbing approach(let's face it, The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine are thrillers to which the two aforementioned adjectives apply perfectly, and whilst it is a drama, the same can be said of Trainspotting). This is the most sentimental flick I've experienced that I would, with a straight face, call intense, brutal and unsettling. I wonder if that sounds as jarring as it is. Another big issue is that no one, least of all the leads, has *any* charisma(with that said, the acting tends to be great). Who are we supposed to care about? I suppose the Jamal dude, by default, on account of everyone else mistreating him(for crying out loud, 8 Mile wasn't *this* excessive in that regard). That's meant to awaken our sympathy for him, I would wager. I can't claim that it did for me. After two hours of film, covering rather a lot of his young life, I couldn't tell you any personal traits about him. ""He was poor, he fell for a girl and stuck with that(no matter what), and he got a chance to get out of the poverty."" Do me a favor. Copy and paste the sentence in quotes to an empty document, share it with a friend of yours, and ask if that seems familiar(not revealing that it's about this picture). If they say no, ask them how they've managed to not catch a single one of those stories before. No, it doesn't need to be original; you have to draw inspiration from somewhere. Just do... well, anything with it. All this does is put it to excellent-looking images, not bothering to give us a reason to care. Yes, it's ""grand""; so? It's fiction. Nothing's stopping it. Many characters are one-note. I read that they made the subtitles exciting, though that evidently isn't true of the version released here in Denmark. The DVD comes with a music video, and the documentary Slumdog Dreams, that I will review on its own page here on the site. I recommend this to fans of schlock or features that have an incredible appearance. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the year's best!! Danny Boyle delivers another masterpiece of film,"Slumdog Millionaire is a true cinematic achievement; a fast-paced, exhilarating and gritty drama with an amazing cast and interesting story. I will not be surprised if this is rewarded at all the upcoming award ceremonies. Danny Boyle has taken what is a seemingly basic story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching Dickensian picture. It is a journey through the slums of India, and what a journey it is, at times funny, at times incredibly sad and disturbing, but always captivating from start to finish. This is another masterpiece in the vein of Trainspotting - a stunningly original piece of film-making.This is one of those independent films that grabs audiences by surprise. This is not the summer blockbuster, this is more like Little Miss Sunshine, a piece of art that will not be seen by everyone, but will be treasured by those who see it. It is interesting to note that not all of the film is in English, but some Hindi, and the subtitles are placed rather uniquely, but suit the eccentric tone of the film. Do not let this prevent you from seeing it, in fact, it should encourage people to see it, as this should be viewed by everyone (especially younger audiences who take what they have for granted). Funnily enough Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi is the right. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depict the realism of the children's situation very well.Boyle and Beaufoy (bravely) do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks to Boyle's true ingenuity, he creates many humorous moments in the slums. Slumdog Millionaire is a dramatic comedy at heart; a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It will make you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's talent as a director. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's so much kinetic energy in this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is one of the ten best films of the decade.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Well, what a movie this is!","Well, what a movie this is! I have been a regular visitor to the IMDb site and especially to the comments section. It never occurred to me till now, that i might want to post my views here. But this movie has made me do it.Each and every aspect of this movie has fascinated me. Be it the direction, music, screenplay or the casting. No wonder why this movie has already grabbed four of the prestigious Golden Globe award. And i feel its gonna be a sure shot winner in the Oscars too.My first appreciations to the Indian Novelist, Vikas Swaroop and to his debut novel ""Q and A"" on which this movie is based. Though i haven't yet read the book, i am sure it would be as good as the movie. I will be looking forward for his works in future too.Danny Boyle (Director) and Loveleen Tandan (Co-Director) together with Simon Beaufoy (Screenplay) have beautifully brought this novel alive. The way the uncertainties in the lifestyle of a pure Mumbaikar is portrayed, is fantastic. The whole movie is a mixture of bits from past and present and i couldn't stop noticing the way the two time-frames blend together.The music by the Indian legend AR Rahman is quite lively and melodious. I especially liked the score when the protagonist (Jamaal) waits for his lover (Latika) in the VT railway station and to the point when his brother (Salim) kidnaps her outside the station. It is a lively mixture of Indian music with the western.The cast have to be appreciated too. All the actors, actresses who played the lead characters Jamaal, Latika and Salim did a great job. Anil Kapoor (Host of the show) and Irfan Khan (Inspector) though they were in mediocre roles, did quite well keeping up to their usual standards.Last but not the least, thanks a lot to the producers who pinned their efforts in bringing this novel to the silver screen, when most of the Indian production houses had backed away.I rate this movie 9/10 without any second thoughts.

A fairytale story you will never forget.,"'Slumdog Millionaire' is something of a miracle. In an industry where heartbreak and tragedy often rule out, here is a movie you can genuinely root for. One that hits all the right notes. Whatever you may take away from Danny Boyle's aesthetic journey through India, it will almost certainly leave you with a smile and sense of wonderment.Oddly enough, there isn't anything particularly groundbreaking about 'Slumdog Millionaire'. It is in many ways a traditional rags to riches story, but told with such freshness and endearment that everything you see on-screen is exciting and unpredictable. A bizarre story, told through the eyes of a young man competing on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. One question away from the million dollar question, our main character Jamal is arrested and accused of cheating. He has, as time will soon show, become a national hero. Because Jamal does not come from a privileged background. He is, in fact, an orphan who has not had a proper education since he was a young boy. But there is an amazing story intertwined, and it's as dazzling as it is unforgettable.To prove his honesty, Jamal traces his steps back to the very beginning. He tells the story of his life, weaving in every question asked on the show and applying it to a life lived without any shortcuts. From innocence to maturity, and a never ending search for one girl's affection. We're given access to a side of India rarely seen by outsiders, as beautiful as it is impoverished. There is such passion behind Boyle's direction, an English filmmaker who has given us a very diverse collection of films throughout the years, and he presents us with a picture that desperately seeks for truth and greatness. A vision that affirms life around every corner even when encountering the lowest of lows.'Slumdog Millionaire' is the right film at the right time. It's an underdog story we can all cheer for, and one that has the awesome potential to move an entire audience. The film's cast, many characters are played by multiple actors as the years pass, all come together to form something very special. Dev Patel in particular, who plays our present day Jamal, is a great young talent who delivers a fine performance. And from its dizzying but fantastic editing to breathtaking cinematography, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is everything you could ask for in a film and then some. Nothing I say could possibly give a film like this justice, you simply have to experience it for yourself and witness the power. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is about as good as they come. A fairytale story you will never forget.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Everyone involved in this production should be very proud...,"I just watched this yesterday with a friend and we were both baffled with just how amazing it was. This is one of those rare movies that inspires you. It follows the life of Jamal, his brother Salim and Jamal's true love Latika. All of these characters have suffered in their childhood and the movie shows how their troubles extend into their adult lives. It is a movie about survival, of love, of family and of fate. I thought the setting in India was very appropriate and moving- a lot of these issues are reality for many people- and I applaud Danny Boyle for bringing light to them. Slumdog Millionaire shows us how goodness can triumph and, at the expense of sounding clichéd, gives hope.

It was fantastically directed and remarkably  acted.,"The wonderful movie Slumdog Millionaire (2008) by Danny Boyle narrates a story of a 18 year old Indian boy, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) from the slums of Mumbai who is about to win the biggest price of a television show. The story begins after Jamal being able to answer most of all the questions even though he is being an uneducated street kid. The police arrest him under the suspicion of cheating. When the policeman questioned him how he knew the answers, without having no other option Jamal unveiled the story of his life in the slum and explained how each incident of his life had the answers embedded. The main theme of the movie is about a young boy who is very simple and honest, believe in all the good things but unfortunately the world does not provide a good place for him. Despite the fact how bad the world treats him, the young fellow; Jamal did not lose his faith in his hope and what he wants. He does not care about anything other than his love. Even he went to the show only because he knew that she watch the show, in that way he can find a way to meet her. This movie was kind of a love story, which can be compared to the movie City of Angels (1998) by Brad Silberling. Jamal was just as the angel who gave up everything and did everything to be with the person he loves as in the movie City of Angle. The director Danny Boyle has used so many effective techniques in order to bring this movie to success. When editing he has used slow-motion frames in an effective way. In the scene where the female lead, Lalitha (Freida Pinto) standing on the platform besides the train, smiling and in the scene where Jamal's mother was killed was strongly highlighted by the slow-motion frames and sound effects used at the moment. It makes the audience feel the corrupted and uncivilized behavior of the surrounding. The director has used flashbacks effectively throughout the whole movie starts from the beginning to the end. In the last scene where Jamal meets Lathika and kisses her scar he has used flashback scenes from revise order which symbolizes kissing away the pain of a life time and undoing all the brutalities happened to her. That last scene created a huge emotional effect on the audience which made it one of the best scenes in the movie. In conclusion, the movie Slumdog Millionaire was one of the best movies in my list. It was fantastically directed and remarkably acted.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Misleading marketing.,"Well, to start with, the English posters saying ""The feel-good movie of the year"" are not at all correct. Driven by them I went to see this movie expecting something like ""Life less ordinary"" set in India, but the only place I remember I laughed was the loo scene and even that was overshadowed almost instantly by the elder brother's behavior.So on my opinion, this movie is nearer to the City of God than to a feel good movie. It's not to much of a comedy, rather a bittersweet coming-of-age tale of an Indian boy (slumdog?).But I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, although for me it wasn't great either; I've found a lot of what I've seen before. (A bit like ""21"", after which I've felt that I've seen this movie before, if even not specifically in a Vegas setup.)

"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (Danny Boyle, 2008) ***","A curious mix of CITY OF GOD (2002) and QUIZ SHOW (1994), this surprising multi-Oscar winner is a good film to be sure but also somewhat overrated (as was director Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING [1996] after all). The editing is deftly intricate (spanning several years, the story continually jumps back and forth in time) and the exotic score certainly effective; however, Boyle's flashy technique rings false within the context of its underprivileged setting! SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have alerted the rest of the world to the dire conditions of life in (the so-called) modern India but, at the same time, it cannot have benefited the country's tourist industry any! The film's trump card is actually the 'impossible romance' at its core: the two young leads are believable and undeniably appealing. The whole ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" angle, then, has a decidedly contrived feel to it: though apparently based on fact, the film was clearly intended as a fable. That said, some of the flashbacks do not really illuminate us as to how the hero knew the respective answer: for instance, does someone need to know who invented the revolver just because he owns one (much less an uneducated person) and would the final all-important question of such a show be one to which the answer could have easily been arrived at by common sense (had it not been a recurring motif)?",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A good movie for our age, but Best Picture?","First off, I'm going to say that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a good film and very Oscar-worthy, but I do not think it deserved the Best Picture slot.

I will tip my hat to the people behind the film for painting a vivid picture of two brothers in the slums of India, though.This film would probably have made a larger impact on me if it hadn't dominated the Oscars this year. ""Milk"" or ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" were more applicable for the big prize, in my opinion.

It was no longer the great and wonderful adventure that we saw in most of the movie. The complex relationship seemed oversimplified and it did the safe thing in the tone approach, but if it had been taken in a completely different direction, it could have become a true classic. However, instead of always peaking or skyrocketing to greatness, it plateaued and didn't deliver as well as I'd hoped, largely due to the failing of the script.The first character of the story conveys a good feeling to the viewer with his oppressed and yet determined face...

However it was not the case with Danny Boyle's brilliantly made film.From the very start to the end, I knew I was witnessing a phenomenon of a movie. Based on an acclaimed novel, this movie engages with the audience and keeps them guessing at every moment. Lively and energetic performances ranging from the much younger actors to Dev Patel and Freida Pinto keep this movie running without dying down.

Streetwise story of love and destiny should appeal to a good deal more than 'City of God' did.,"A very enjoyable film. I saw this last night with my wife and we both enjoyed it. I'd managed to side-step most of the preceding hype for this one and all I was really expecting was a less violent 'City of God'. The idea for the main story being revealed through flashback while the central character is being interrogated is not a new one (The Usual Suspects) but is it done very well here. Dev Patel is somewhat laconic but very good nonetheless, as is the actor portraying his brother. The gameshow host and the main police Detective are also very good characters. The birds-eye-view shots of Mumbai, and the Bombay slums in particular, are really great and some of the editing is very propulsive and helps carry the story along. Great soundtrack, too.

It is beautifully filmed with great energy. I love the little kids. The little kid covered with excrement is hilarious. Their stories are compelling. The one thing I don't like about the movie is actually the game show. It feels very cheesy like that TV game show. It revels in its cheesiness, and that bleeds into the movie. I think it's meant to increase the fun content of the movie and it's a great way to construct the backbone of the movie. For me, the game show and police interrogation are more like speed bumps that break up the more interesting story of the 3 kids. I almost wish to watch the movie without the game show backdrop.

Slumdog Millionaire,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most watched film. The film stars quite a few actors who are not so known, but they became after the filming of this film, such as: Dev Patel ( older Jamal ), Saurabh Shukla ( sergeant Srinivas ), Irrfan Khan (police inspector), Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail ( youngest Salim ), Ayush Mahesh Khedekar ( youngest Jamal ), Freida Pinto ( older Latika ). The directors of the film are Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan. The action takes place in India, where Jamal, a young tramp, participates in the contest ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", which reaches beyond any participant. The competition is held in 2006 in Mumbai. This film is one that combines topics such as: love, drama, competition, crime. This Film is also based on a novel.
This film is about a young man at about 18 years, who participates in a millionaire contest. He manages to answer questions with the help of his childhood. Children in India did not have a very beautiful childhood, they were abused, beaten, even blinded. Young Jamal got rid of these difficulties quite easily, but with the help of what happened around him, he managed to answer the questions to the ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" contest.
The costume of the Indian children looks very similar to the real one, but the clothes of the people from the company where Jamal is a kind of waiter, look very good and are chosen with taste. What I didn't like were the dark frames and dark clothes of the people on the street.

The feel-good movie of the year (even if it is only January),"I live in a part of north-west London with a large Asian population that was home to Dev Patel, who plays the eponymous Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai who demonstrates utterly remarkable knowledge or amazing luck when he appears on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"". So, if the rave reviews, the enthusiastic word of mouth and no less than 10 Academy Award nominations were not enough, the movie was a total sell-out. Nobody was disappointed; on the contrary, everyone left with a smile of their face after viewing this wonderful feel-good movie.Although containing both humour and romance, this is categorically no standard rom-com. It opens with a torture scene and, along the way way, we see slums, poverty, crime and violence - but ultimately this is a tale of redemption and hope. Who would have thought that British director Danny Boyle - who first came to our attention with hard-hitting films like ""Shallow Grave and ""Trainspotting"" - could give us such a tale of India? But, together with cast and crew, he has produced a triumph. Jamal, his brother Salim and fellow orphan Latika are represented at three stages of their young lives by different actors who bring immense charm to the movie and Freida Pinto as the oldest Latika is simply gorgeous. In a succession of convincing performances, Anil Kapoor is especially good as the show's presenter.Of course, colourful, chaotic, charming India itself is a star of the film - notably the vibrancy of Mumbai (the former Bombay) with an appearance by the Taj Mahal in Agra - and, if you've never visited (I have), you'll leave the cinema wanting to do so. The shooting of the film used a prototype digital camera which underlines the kinetic energy of the narrative and puts the viewer right in the action, especially in the crowd and chase sequences. Another key ingredient is the atmospheric music. Finally, don't leave as soon as the end credits start to roll or you'll miss an exuberant dance sequence. In short, this is a movie that has all you could want for an uplifting of the human spirit.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not bad,"Not a bad movie, a bit drawn out but worth watching compared to some of the rubbish that gets released. I thought it could have been a bit more hard hitting in places. I would imagine it was not easy to shoot this movie.It was interesting to see how rude the presenter was and yet it seemed very acceptable to the candidate and audience so now I have a better understanding of Indian humor.I am sure that the police action is normal and yet no one complains.His bruises got fixed pretty quick for part 2 of the showRemind me not to apply play when next in IndiaI wonder how much of the child abuse still goes on",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"It was pretty good, but the critics seemed to overrate it a bit. It just seems that every arty, substantial movie that gets made are sure to win Oscars. The cinematography and direction was great, but the story and characters was mediocre as the character development was ridiculous since the movie doesn't really show why Jamal loved Latika (let's not forget that he saw her only twice since they were kids). This was more of an obsession than real love. The only character that wasn't that two dimensional was Salim. Best directing and cinematography? Maybe, but the fact that the movie won best writing and movie is laughable. Also the little kid actors were awesome and other than that, there were better films released in 08.And are we really supposed to believe that playing for such high stakes on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, they would ask a cricket related question, in India of all places?",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Good but not Great,","This movie was entertaining and told an interesting story but it definitely wasn't worthy of the Acadamey Award for ""Best Picture"". All the performances were good, but it doesn't really come close to being the Best Movie of 2008. The movie is good, but not great. It's because the final third of the movie was another traditional love story. It's definitely worth watching but it isn't my favorite. So don't believe in all the hype but just watch it expecting a good movie and it should be an enjoyable experience. The movie is rated a very low R and it should really be PG-13.

"Good, but not Great as everyone makes it out to be","So did the movie live up to all the Oscar buzz going around? well, in part yes.I gotta say thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film. It was wonderfully shot; I loved the sequence where the slum boys were being chased with A.R. Rehman's fantastic score in the background. Moreover, the acting of the youngest versions of Salim and Jamal were fantastic.However, the second half kinda let me down a bit. I was not impressed with the older versions of the the lead actors, especially Saleem. He was such a good character at the start but his older version was a poor actor and it just turned into a weak role. Also, the ending could've been better thought out I felt. It was too predictable for me.Overall, this still is a really solid movie, and is definitely one of the year's good ones.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It's not supposed to be in his experience,"Slumdog Millionaire which earned 8 Oscars including a Best Picture has some elements of a couple of other films that I liked. It also has no nominations in the acting categories.For the latter I think it's a combined performance. Protagonist Dev Patel whose life we see in flashback gives a performance with two other juvenile actors. It's a combined look at his life so I think no one actor could or should be credited that way. In fact Patel is telling his life in the interrogation room of a police station.Patel is a slum kid referred to as slumdogs by the Indian cops. He's a guest on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and he's one answer away from the all or nothing grand prize jackpot. He's hauled away and interrogated by the Mumbai cops who just don't believe some slum kid from Mumbai could know things like who is on the American hundred dollar bill and who invented the revolver. But it turns out that as they question him and rather brutally at times, he's acquired this trivial pursuit type knowledge through life experience.I was so reminded of Stand And Deliver when the cops haul away Dev Patel because they won't believe some uneducated slumdog kid could know so much. If you remember Edward James Olmos's math class all got retested with strict monitoring to prove they were the real deal.As for the scenes of Indian life and what the ragamuffin kids go through the influence of the Brazilian film Pixote is clearly visible. Occidental director Danny Boyle did a great job of capturing the overpopulation and dire poverty so omnipresent in the world's largest democracy. If population trends keep going India may well pass China as the world's largest country.With a Best Picture Oscar, the Indian cinema has clearly arrived on the American consciousness if nowhere else. Oscars tend to do that with Americans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Best,"""That he should be so abject, base and poor, To choose for wealth and not for perfect love."" Shakespeare's Henry VIIn a time of global fusions, Slumdog Millionaire is a successful blend of thriller and Bollywood hyperbole, a feel-good story of love, fidelity, and brotherhood set in Mumbai's most dangerous and glamorous places. We are alternately thrust into the streets where children are relentlessly exploited and into the sumptuous set of the Indian equivalent of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""Danny Boyle's fabulous story has the Dickensian motif of poverty to riches and the American dream of crossing class lines to triumph with altruism. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) rises from an abysmal childhood running from the worst of adult supervision to become a finalist in a quiz show he hopes his lost friend and love, Latika (Freida Pinto), will be watching, the 20 million rupees prize never his real goal. According to the formula for romantic, uplifting dramas of the poor's struggle for a place in middle class life, no one could mistake what will happen to Jamal on his quest.Indeed, he fulfills Joseph Campbell's monomyth formula, the cyclical pattern for the mythological hero: separation, initiation, return. Although a few attempts at humor seem out of place, Jamal never varies from his serious knightly quest to save the fair maiden.Boyle has wisely and creatively veered from the staid and standard to keep his formula fresh. For instance, he begins in Citizen Kane style at the end, the quiz show, and then ingeniously interweaves questions on the show with how Jamal learned the answers in the course of his life, thereby justifying multiple flashbacks. Also, Boyle, for the few parts of the film that need translation, has placed the subtitles where I have not seen them before, and I appreciate the audience-friendly approach.It is a time for pulling out the genresepic adventure in Australia, scary vampiring in Twilight, and predictable action in Quantum Solace and Transporter 3. Slumdog is by far the best of the re-imaginings.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Fear and Loathing in India,"Fear and Loathing in India.A lot of the medium shots pushing us into Dev Patel's peripheral are strikingly effective due to how he nails the quiet emotion. Once he stops aging, there's no more changes to Jamal's appearance, but through Patel's acting chops on display as early as this stage in his career, through his eyes you understand he's aged a lifetime.Slumdog Millionaire asks a fundamental question every human wishes they knew the answer to. Are you, your soulmate and all their intricate facets, destined to find one another by fate? The jackpot here isn't in the literal prize winnings, but in the characters going through Danny Boyle's stylised hell to dig up an answer to that question. The film would make a good case for predestination or, at the very least, a large dose of luck. Jamal is no stranger to kind fortune, which he refers to as 'destiny'. However, this question becomes very much in doubt because almost all the lucky breaks are simple products of either good or bad luck. The deus ex machina is a plot crutch typically loathed when it becomes noticeably egregious in being used to pull characters out of sticky situations. Here, the story manages to get away with that, partly by almost immediately opening with the confession that this is a story where you know a good chunk of the resolution immediately. It's in giving the context to this ultimate victory you're aware of the whole time that makes Slumdog a unique watch, in equally captivating and irritating spells. I found the train sequence to be a bit over the top in its singularity. No other part of the film is shot or edited as frenetically as that sequence, and maybe this is due to the song being overplayed to my ears, but M. I. A's Paper Planes really feels tacked on. If you know the lyrics and when they play during the film, it really just feels like they stretched to get as many connections together as possible for sake of nifty montage filming, no matter how thin they were. I'm a montage cultist, so I'll never really turn down the notion of a film leaning into its own smile-and-nodding for the audience, but there are little too many moments like this sprinkled into the script that I can't connect properly to the beating heart of this film and its overall point. A story coolly told, but I don't find it a greatly moving treatise on life or how exactly you are supposed to climb up the ladder out of the hole and into the sunshine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"Couple of things.This film perpetuates the western impression of India being a wasteland just filled with vice. Nobody cares that the nation has stepped up its game in so many ways.This movie was the white man's attempt to win an Oscar and that was it. It had no message. A movie like Boyz N The Hood did show a very gritty side of Los Angeles. However John Singleton, who is a native of South Central, wanted to show what he went through when he was a child. His message was clear. This movie is pure fiction. I strongly presume that the director did not grow up in Mumbai's shanty towns.Then comes the story. I heard that Salman Rushdie, a guy who is not welcome in India and who writes stories that make no sense at all, comment that SM's story did not make sense!

A beautiful thought provoking film,"I have to say I was really looking forward to seeing this film. The buzz surrounding it made me curious to see what all the fuss was about and despite it not being my usual type of film (I'm more of a romantic comedy lover myself) I really felt like I took a lot away from it. It's not just a way to pass a couple of hours on a Saturday night, it was an experience you don't get from a lot of films. It wasn't a funny story, far from it, but it was funny in places where you have the young Jamal taking tourists for mugs, and the youngest Jamal covered in other peoples waste. Doesn't sound that funny but it was oddly cute nonetheless.I was engrossed in the story of how Dev Patel's character Jamal, a contestant on India's 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' explains how, after being arrested on suspicion of cheating on the show, he came to know the answers most people wouldn't. With each question comes a torturous memory and how the experiences of his childhood with his brother in the slums of Mumbai leads him to be one question away from the jackpot. While he explains how he came to be able to answer such impossible questions he tells of Latika, the girl he loved and had let go. This is essentially to do with winning love over money and takes you through what people are prepared to do to get these things. The youngest actors in the film are amazing to me and could out act plenty gracing the red carpets of Hollywood these days. There was nothing about this film I didn't like. The sound track, the story, the actors, the setting - all perfect. It wasn't made on a ridiculous budget which kept the story realistic. It was thought provoking while entertaining all the same.

While Salim and Latika were very conflicted about their major decisions a few times, in the end it all wrapped up how it should've been.

One of the happiest films that I have seen!,"I had been somewhat interested in seeing ""Slumdog Millionaire"", but a number of things had prevented me from seeing it until just recently. And I have to say that I'm glad that I finally did. It's certainly now one of my favourite films and – despite its quite dark realistic portrayals of third-world injustice – is one of the happiest, most feel-good films in some time.Having faired exceptionally well on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", the pauper turned phone-operator Jamal is questioned over his lucky streak with the questions posed to him so far. Held by a detective, he recounts the whirlwind story of his life and explains the reasons for his knowledge. The device of the frame narrative works well, allowing intrigue and a brisk pace in a rather episodic piece, yet ultimately providing sufficient character development. As I have mentioned already, the film touches up on the darker aspects of the developing world – child poverty and exploitation, religious and social tension and mafia culture – yet these are not portrayed in a melodramatic way and actually make one question the lack of Western aid in the world's poorer places as opposed to just imploring one to just feel sorry for the characters themselves.Indian culture is portrayed in a kaleidoscope of fancy, yet if there is one problem with the film that I did have, it is that the scenes of the two children travelling to the Taj Mahal, as charming as they may be, do seem like an attempt to showcase as much of India as possible.However, even that doesn't turn ""Slumdog Millionaire"" into a banal travelogue. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the perfect film in that it completely embraces the true philosophy of cinema: to send the viewer to another world, where escapism is realism and realism is escapism, and dreams really can come true. It is pleasing to know that a film that is truly made for film audiences as opposed to arguably just critics (read: the countless political/biopic films that come out in the last two months of the year) can triumph at that once glorious now haughty event known as the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Stefana,"Slumdog millionaireThe film Slumdog Millionaire, appeared in 2008, and from my point of view is a great film, starring: Dev Patel named Jamal Malik in the movie, Freida Pinto (Latika), Irffan Chan (The Police officer), Anil Kapoor (Prem Kumar), and many other actors with wonderful roles.
The film is motivational but also romantic, it is directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan, and the screenplay is written by Simon Beaufoy.
The slumdog millionaire is a film that shows the life of a boy named Jamal. He and his brother Tito lived in India and had a poor financial situation. After their city was attacked, Jamal, his brother and a girl named Latika manage to escape and flee, being found by a man and taken to a children's home. But this home turned out not to be what it seems, because the children were begged and tortured, in order to raise as much money as possible when they are sent to the streets. When it was Jamal's turn to be tormented, Tito manages to save him, but leaves Latika behind, unfortunately when Jamal falls in love with her. After a few years of walking the streets and robbing, Jamal was still thinking about his love and planning to find it. But as bad luck in Easter on this Indian kid, the moment he finds her face, his brother who had become a murderer, threatens him to go away and leave him with latika. He listened and left. But when they grow up, Jamal is hired as a waiter at a telephone office, and in the end he has the opportunity to look for his brother's number and has the Luck to Find him.
When it comes to this film, it seems to me that it is one with a very goood one. I personally liked the story and the message that this film wants to convey. The fact that the boy named Jamal went through so many things and everything he wanted was to find Latika, he shows me that there are people in the world who see true love. Also, the film has some very good actors, such as Dev Patel (Jamal in the movie), he is also playing in my favorite series called Skins, which was very popular and has a rating of 8.4 on imbd. .Another pleasant thing about the film was the music, notiching in the sequence in which the two brothers rode the train, the song Paper planes by mia, a song I used to listen to when I was younger.
My justification that this mobile is a good quality is the fact that it makes sudden moves from the past to the present an d from the present to the past, this managing to keep you captivated in the story . I recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it, like really GO WATCH IT NOW.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Beautiful, gritty, hopeful and exhausting","Visually stunning, moving, gritty, violent and hopeful. Not sure if it was worthy of all the awards it received but a movie I'm very glad I saw. I liked the way Jamal's (Dev Patel) story was told, clever storytelling there, following a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and became a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" He is arrested under suspicion of cheating, and while being interrogated, events from his life history are shown which explain why he knows the answers.If I'm honest I didn't really ""enjoy"" watching this, I found it exhausting even though it's a very good movie. It just gives such an unflinching look at poverty and exploited children that even with the beautiful love story and closing dance sequence I still came away depressed.

Exhilarating!,"Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is at the same time a blur and a rush of color, emotion, and action. It moves so fast that one would think that it would be in danger of getting the audience lost, but no. Boyle may go a little over the top in directorial style, but the audience is with the movie every step of the way.Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is on India's ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Question by question, he gets them all correct and is racking up a huge amount of cash. So much so, that the host (Anil Kapoor) thinks he's cheating. But under interrogation, he reveals how he knows the answers through flashbacks of his life.While the story could (and for the most part, does) succeed on its own, Danny Boyle turns it into a director's show. Mostly, it works. He draws us into the story and keeps things moving. Unfortunately though, sometimes the quick cuts become a bit much, and the frantic pace allows for only limited character development and identification.Fortunately though, his actors are so good that it doesn't matter...almost. The trio of actors that portray Jamal (at various stages in his life) create a protagonist that is impossible not to root for. Likewise, the actors and actresses that play the other two central characters (Latika and Saleem) are very effective as well. The very root of the story is the romance between Jamal and Latika, and the performers deliver (particularly Patel and Frieda Pinto).""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a terrific movie, and though Boyle draws us in and keeps us there, ultimately its the actors who make it special.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Grand Movie with an Unrealistic Story,"Slumdog Millionaire focuses on a slumdog Jamal played by Dev Patel who happens to win the grand prize in the show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. The movie is set in Mumbai and the director seems to have done quite some research which is evident by the final product. It manages to give us a glimpse of the harsh, brutal life that these people have to live.Despite the beautiful cinematography and visionary direction, there are quite a number of points in this movie that are completely unrealistic. First of all, poor people with limited education cannot speak perfect English, in fact, it is highly unlikely for them to even know a few English words. I guess most of the dialogs were in English to make the story accessible to a wider audience.The acting by everyone is quite credible including a number of untrained street kids who were highly believable in their roles.The Academy Award winning score by A.R. Rahman adds another dimension to this film and it manages to complement the tone of the movie perfectly.The movie was made for a global audience and the prime objective was to show the blatant exploitation of poor children by egregious, unconscentious people who force them to beg and do other abhorrent errands. It managed to win the Academy Award for Best Picture but it is unlikely to be loved by Indians due to how they show us in a poor light.All in all, this is a well directed romance that is in some ways like a typical Bollywood masala film. I would give it 7 stars due to my conflicting views on this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
