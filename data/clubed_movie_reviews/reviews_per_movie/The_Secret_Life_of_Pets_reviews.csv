"Don't keep it to yourself - ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is great family fun!","When you see as many movies as I do (and you start writing reviews in your head while you're watching them), certain movies, parts of movies, plot points or characters remind you of other movies. In my reviews, I often note those parallels, using them to comment on the movie I'm reviewing. Sometimes I note similarities between movies to say that the more recent film is unoriginal. Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around. These anthropomorphic possessions relate to each other and form friendships. When a newer version of the original is brought into the group, jealousy emerges and the original tries to get rid of the interloper. This struggle results in both of the rivals being thrust out of the comforts of home into the little-understood big, bad world, a situation which requires their compadres to venture out of their own comfort zones to mount a rescue.That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film ""Toy Story"". (Think, ""Pet Story"", or ""The Secret Life of Toys"".) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of ""Zootopia"". In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as a mash-up of ""Toy Story"" and ""Zootopia"". Nevertheless, this one charts its own unique course and is as entertaining as those other two or the ""Despicable Me"" films, also from Illumination Entertainment.Now that you know what ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is LIKE, here's what it's ABOUT: The movie focuses on a small brown and white terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and his relationship with the other pets in his apartment building. Max lives in a small Manhattan apartment with his owner, a young woman named Katie (Ellie Kemper). When Katie goes to work each day, Max sits at the door wondering where she has gone and waiting for her to come back and play with him. Meanwhile, the pets in the building across the alley and above and below his apartment (and one guniea pig lost in the air ducts) are more active in their daily lives (and more mobile) than is readily apparent. (Thus, the title of the film.) Some of the neighborhood pets include an overweight white cat named Chloe (Lake Bell), a bulldog named Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a dachshund named Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a canary named Sweet Pea (Tara Strong), and Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian who has a secret crush on Max.Except for missing Katie during the day, all is well in Max's little world until one not-so-fine day when Katie brings home another dog she rescued from a shelter. Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is a large, shaggy, dark brown dog who has no problem throwing his weight around to get the best place to sleep, or as much food as he wants, or anything else. Max starts scheming about how to get rid of Duke, but one such attempt while they're in the park with Katie's dog walker back-fires and sets both Max and Duke off on a wild and dangerous journey around the city. When Gidget realizes that Max has disappeared, she enlists their mutual pet friends, plus a caged hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), and a few other neighborhood pets (including the Dana Carvey voiced ""Pops""), to help her find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke have to try escaping from animal control workers, a disfigured alley cat named Ozone (Steve Coogan) and a small, but crazed and bitter bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who was discarded by the magician he worked for and now leads a sewer-dwelling group of radicals called The Flushed Pets, who are bent on wiping out all the humans – and who decide that Max and Duke are also their enemies.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is every bit as entertaining as you'd hope, based on its theatrical trailers, or its movie posters, or just its title. Co-writers Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch exploit many of the well-known quirks of different kinds of pets, but give each character in the film its own personality. Then, once the script clearly establishes who each of these characters are, it gives them plenty to do, but without making the story unnecessarily complicated. Co-directors Chris Renaud (who also voices the aforementioned lost guinea pig) and Yarrow Cheney bring this promising concept and excellent script to realization by keeping the plot moving and not overdoing any of the film's big ideas or overplaying any of the gags. Finally, with the film's impressive voice cast and the filmmakers' ""Despicable"" history, the performances and the visuals are excellent across the board. On the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a ""Grease""-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very silly but enjoyable,Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the most overhated films ever!,"Fun fact: I met the universe of movie critics with The Secret Life of Pets. It was 2018, I was on holidays, my dog was hospitalised (she has been neutered), and I had nothing to do. So, I logged in Netflix, and watched this film. After that, ""coincidentally"", YouTube recommended me a review of this film. The guy was charismatic, and coincidentally, I went to the theatre to watch Aquaman on that same weekend. And obviously, after the session. I went back to that guy's channel (Otávio Ugá, from Super Oito, who's my favourite movie critic until today). After that, I started to follow cinema tirelessly.Okay, this is a movie review, not a life story. And writing this text is something similar with what I did when I wrote my review of Interstellar. No influence of great memories or movie critics. And surprisingly, my opinion here didn't go as down as Nolan's film. I honestly think this movie is still good.Yes, it's a Toy Story ""rip-off""; yes, some of the jokes have aged badly; and yes, the screenplay is generic and lacks polish; but the characters are still charismatic, 70 to 80% of the jokes still work, and the soundtrack is spectacular (Alexandre Desplat, I can't expect less from a two-time Academy Award winner).It's a simplistic argument, I know that, but I can't disagree, and I used it to talk about MicMacs, Jackass, and even Thor: Ragnarok; as The Secret Life of Pets is a comedy, its primary objective is being funny, and WOW, it's hilarious. Jenny Slate is an incredible voice actress, as I said before, I can't imagine another actor but Eric Stonestreet as Duke, Albert Brooks, Dana Carvey, Lake Bell and Hannibal Buress (Chloe and Buddy are fantastic) are also excellent, and I changed my mind about Louis CK. I used to not like his job as Max, as I still prefer the voice from the second film, but he fits the Jack Russell more than I thought (also, I don't see him anymore as a coadjuvant of his own story).And now, an opinion that goes against the majority. All non-Brazilian reviews I've seen have slammed Kevin Hart's job as Snowball, the psycho bunny. To my mind, he's by far the best character. He has the best arc, the script knows exactly how to work with him, Kevin Hart's performance is passionate, and I still think he deserves a solo film.I can't not recommend this movie. It's far from perfect, it's even far from great, but if you don't have anything to do and need a comedy of quality to pass the time, The Secret Life of Pets is a nice afternoon session, and it's another movie that I'm finally in peace with.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much to enjoy here,"Not a great film, but a very enjoyable one.Starting with 'The Secret Life of Pets', while much of the story is charming, beautifully paced without feeling rushed and entertaining, it does run out of steam in the final third where it does drag a bit and feels overstretched.While the lead characters are likable and interesting, there are too many characters, which are not as fleshed out and some of them not in the film enough to make impact, and the film feels over-populated as a result.And while a vast majority of the film is incredibly entertaining, not all the jokes work in the final third, being not as well-timed and being a bit too obvious and childish.However, 'The Secret Life of Pets' is beautifully and vibrantly animated, love the rich colours, meticulously rich backgrounds and the well-modelled character designs. The music score is whimsical and lively.'The Secret Life of Pets' is also very wittily and often hilariously scripted, some of the best lines coming from Snowball, and there are some neat references to 'Grease', 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Some Like it Hot.' As said, much of the story is charming with enough of the entertainment factor.Lastly the voice acting is pretty terrific, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks and Steve Coogan coming off best.Overall, there is much to enjoy in 'The Secret Life of Pets', though it is more a good film than a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Secret World of Pets""-Pure Entertainment with generous dose of love between animals and people.  Great Movie.","You know a movie is good when it's over shortly after it began.Well actually the movie was well over an hour and a half but I was drawn in from beginning to the last second. In fact, even at the last second I did not want the movie to end.It's a simple story. A cute young dog, Max, finds himself stuck with a new housemate, Duke, a big lug of a dog that their owner brings home and expects they will get along.Thus begins the saga to get rid of Duke while helping all the cast-aside pets of the world wreak revenge on the humans who left them.The rest is just cute and includes Snowball the Bunny and lots of animals to include canaries, snakes, lizards and sneaky buzzards. Oh, and a real cute cat that acts.heh, just like a cat.This is a movie for all ages. It's a movie to watch on a rainy day and a movie to watch over and over. The character voices include:Louis C.K. ... Max (voice) Eric Stonestreet ... Duke (voice) Kevin Hart ... Snowball (voice) Jenny Slate ... Gidget (voice) Ellie Kemper ... Katie (voice) Albert Brooks ... Tiberius (voice) Lake Bell ... Chloe (voice) Dana Carvey ... Pops (voice) Hannibal Buress ... Buddy (voice) Bobby Moynihan ... Mel (voice)There is no major moral to the movie except there is a human out there for every pet, there is even a human out there for pets who have lost their owners, which includes Duke.There's action, laughs, shouts, screams and much fun.See this movie, please. See it especially if you have pets.",,Anonymous,Animation
Cute and amusing in parts but ...,"... it's not a classic. Has a nice family feel to it and kids will like it, but unlike some recent animations doesn't have much for adults. The gangsta rabbit is quite funny, and I wish that Claudia the fat cat had more lines as there was scope to develop that character a bit more. The plot is pretty thin but there again you don't really expect a lot more from this type of film. I quite liked it but was also a little disappointed - it was so hyped and unfortunately didn't really live up to it. I could watch Happy Feet and Shrek all day but I wouldn't want to sit through this again. But all in all it is what it is. It's aimed at children and they will enjoy it - my grandchildren aged 7 and 10 certainly did.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flavorless but You Could Do Worse,"I start this review by first acknowledging there's nothing wrong with this film from a family-oriented entertainment point of view. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. As a rudimentary children's film, you certainly can do worse.The problem with The Secret Lives of Pets stems from its complete inability to marry story, character and concept into a discernible package. As it stands, the film is rushed, bulky and is chalked full of nonsensical choices that cripples any verdant ideas that could have been. It's a first draft; not a final product.The story begins with a happy Jack Russell Terrier named Max (C.K.) who lives with his owner Katie (Kemper) in a surprisingly roomy Manhattan apartment. Things change drastically and suddenly with the arrival of Duke (Stonestreet) a large, shaggy Newfoundland whose introduced as a ""new brother"" to Max's chagrin. They, of course don't get along and after a series of confrontations find themselves lost. The first to notice they're missing is a lovestruck Pomeranian named Gidget (Slate) who recruits the rest of Max's friends among others to recover them from the vast streets of New York City.The rest of Max's friends are barely worth mentioning as they're mostly utilized to push the buttons and pull the levers on some uninspired comedic set-pieces. They're not really useful to the plot, nor do they succeed in being the Toy Story (1995)-inspired resilient and diverse gaggle the movie hopes they are. Part of the reason for this is none of the side characters actually solve any problems. They jet here, they jet there but when faced with any obstacles they just seem to rush it. Gone is the creativity of having Mr. Potato Head fashion a new body out of a tortilla; now we have elderly Basset Hound, Pops (Carvey) hobbling through construction sites with stalwart confidence.Frankly focusing on the story's tagged-on villains might have paid more dividends. The broad machinations of Snowball (Hart), a bunny with delusions of grandeur are easily the best part of the film, even if they remain painfully underdeveloped. Additionally his ""Flushed Pets"" group could have complicated Duke's allegiance to his new owner or more easily pegged Max as a fully socialized pet and therefore in need of re-education. Snowball was the best chance the movie had in getting audiences to truly know the characters we're supposed to be rooting for but instead they blew it on prolonged chase sequences and a sausage factory bit that goes absolutely nowhere.And that gets me to the biggest problem I have with this film; the creators' approach to the high concept itself. The film tries to have its cake and eat it to, portraying characters with innately human characteristics but still clinging to the charming pet-like idiosyncrasies we know and love about our furry friends. For example, Gidget recruits the help of Tiberius (Brooks) a hawk who at first tries to eat her. She barely escapes his talons only to trust him once more because that's just what a peppy little dog would do. Max's friends Mel (Moynihan) and Buddy (Buress) don't even notice Max is gone because, being dogs, they're distracted by butterflies and squirrels. They're certainly not a rag-tag group of lovable rogues, they're a confederacy of dunces, successful only because of the ever changing allegiances of the main antagonist. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Snowball at one point joins forces with Max to save Duke in a climactic sequence so blithely unnatural it renders the friends search and rescue completely moot.This film is a rushed, characterless, flavorless kids film that just barely stretches its plot over the skeleton of its story structure. As I said before, if all you're looking for is a bland and forgettable family film, you could do worse. Yet provided it's appealing concept, you'd really think the animation studio that made Despicable Me (2010) could do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pets on the Run, Make for Silly, Family Fun","Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen.The GOOD  Cute/Kid Friendly  Funny  Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored.But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats.And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities.THE BAD  The Story  Lack of Uniqueness  Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale.To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor.The VerdictThe Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can't say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing.My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Secret Life of Pets,"Let's face it, we as pet owners have always wondered what our furry friends are up to when we're not home. It's an idea that has been played around with for years, from Tom and Jerry to Phineas and Ferb. As ideas go, it isn't original, but the possibilities it can bring are endless. When Illumination Entertainment, the French animation studio behind monster hits such as Despicable Me and Minions (the first non-Disney animated film to earn a billion worldwide) launched a teaser trailer documenting the mischief pets get up to, curiosities were peaked. The world cried in unison; what does this animation studio think pets do? We already have pets as spies, pets being obsessive compulsive mouse hunters, and pets finding their way home. There is still so much one can do with this age old trope, if one is clever enough. What we got, is a beautifully animated flick with plenty of humour and good spirits that packs too much into its run time that has good intentions, despite borrowing heavily from a certain 1990s film.The film opens with our protagonist, Max (Louis C.K.), a Jack Russell Terrier living in New York City with his owner, Katie. Max, like any terrier, is full of beans and love for his master; Illumination got the happy go lucky attitude of the Jack Russell down perfectly. They also got the territorial side, for when Katie brings home a Newfoundland mix named Duke (Eric Stonestreet), Max is less than impressed. Not wanting his perfect life torn upside down by the hairy interloper, Max tries his darndest to get rid of him, leading, of course, to the pair getting whisked away by the pound when Duke tries to dispose of Max. Naturally, the pooches must cope with each other and find their way home, but not without obstacles; underneath the belly of NYC is an underground secret society of abandoned and unwanted animals, led by the not so cuddly rabbit, Snowball (Kevin Hart). Due to accidentally offing a valuable member of the society, Snowball and his henchmen swear vengeance on our furry duo. While all this madness is afoot, a Pomeranian named Gidget, who has a major crush on Max, enlists the help of all their animal neighbours to save him.The main issue of the film, and it's a biggie, is that it's Toy Story with pets. There's no sugar coating it. The main species has a social circle that their owners aren't aware of. The main character loves his owner so much, and is insanely jealous when they bring home someone new. When one is trying to get rid of the other, they end up far away from home, and have to find their way back. They even have elements of Toy Story 2 and 3; friends coming together to find the main character, and a seemingly cute antagonist causing chaos. The only real original element is that the animals have their own language; they don't harbour the ability to speak to humans. Despite this, the film isn't a dud. By now, you've already heard from many sources about the parallels with Toy Story, and, if you're open minded, can enjoy the film for what it is; a slapstick comedy with talking animals. It doesn't remove the issue, but it allows one to see the effort the creators put in to the rest of the film.The animation is fantastic; the textures and anatomy of the animals, while stylised, is still very true to what it represents. The look and feel of New York is large in scale and immensely colourful. The characters look like they have weight to them, that despite their cartoony appearance, they could be real animals. The characters are likable and cute, with the actors making them sound like they are animals; in better terms, you believe they are animals, not animals being voiced by humans. I don't know how they managed that, but they did.What little character development is present it given to Max and Duke, with the latter having a genuinely heartbreaking moment which is sadly glanced over, and thrown aside. There is so much life and likability here. The only issue with character, is that there's too many to remember, and not enough time to get to know them. It's a good thing when you want to see more of the characters, but it also gives glaring warning signs: an inevitable sequel. Or perhaps, that may be a good thing. For this film, despite its flaws, seems like it could be the precursor to a creative franchise. There is so much that can be done with these characters, and with this world, that a sequel would be welcomed. The only issue is, would it be milked to the death like the poor Minions?The jokes are mostly funny, with some misses; there is a jab at YouTube cat videos that will forever be relevant, and the metal loving poodle is amazing. The little quirks that the animators and actors gave the animals are fantastic, such as the dogs having short attention spans, and the cat sitting in too small containers. There's a lot for pet owners to relate to, especially in the ending.It may be a mixed bag, but it's a good, likable one. The Secret Life of Pets had potential to be amazing, and still has potential to become a creative, lasting franchise. This beautiful film is plenty of bark, with little bite. If you leave without a smile on your face, then you were clearly neutered.Rating: B2",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best bits are all in the trailer,"The trailer was looking promising. Lots of laughs and clever humour. Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a fizzer. Excessively violent for a children's film, not funny or clever and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means that the audience doesn't particularly care what happens on their quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the row from me was certainly laughing a lot (while I was taking power naps). Not the same caliber as Despicable Me.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The studios best film since Despicable Me,"With the animation genre in such a golden age, more and more studios are starting to drop their name into the mix.The latest one is Illumination Entertainment. After starting really well with Despicable Me, it has seemed to have made OK flicks such as Hop, The Lorax, Despicable Me 2 and Minions.Now we have what many people are hyping as their best feature since Despicable Me, in the form The Secret Life Of Pets. The marketing has been pretty good and trailer suggests a good time at the cinema.For me, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw. The first third of the film was its strongest part. It was introducing the characters well, there were some solid laughs and they were setting up the story nicely. However the longer the film went on, the slightly sillier it was getting. It was starting to lose its feet, and the gags were getting a bit too much. Thankfully, it was not that bad at all on the whole. It was still moving a long nicely, the characters were being solidly developed and the story rounded off pretty well. I think it might have peaked too soon and everything else felt inferior.The voice performances were good. Jenny Slate continues to do well in her voice work and I felt she gave the strongest performance. Kevin Hart played his character really well, and had some nice laughs. Louis C.K. was well cast as the lead and gave us a character you could root for. The rest did their job well. They were not good enough to be memorable, but not bad enough to be negatively criticised.On the technical side, the animation looked really nice and fitted the tone well. The action was entertaining if not a bit over the top at times. The character designs were strong, and I can see them being sold well as merchandise.Overall, some of it felt disappointing. But on the whole I had a fairly good time watching this. It is definitely the studio's best film since Despicable Me. But with so many other animation studios delivering much stronger films at the moment, this could be forgotten sooner than you think. This might not do as well in the box office as originally expected. Especially a new Pixar film on the way.There is also a short before the main film, and it features the studios most famous characters. It was o.k. But nowhere near as strong as Pixar's shorts.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth the wait. And Gidget ROCKS!,"I note, happily, that some of the best character driven films of the past 10 years are animated: ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and especially ""Inside Out"" (the real ""Best Picture"" of 2015) stand tall among a bounty of films where the plot serves the development of the characters and their relationships. Add ""The Secret Life of Pets"" to that list.While not as good as the previously mentioned movies, ""...Pets"" holds its own: It is entertaining, gorgeous to look at and by the film's end developed in me a sincere affection for several of the characters. Especially Gidget, and I'll get to her shortly.Opening with a spectacular animated sequence featuring New York City backed by Taylor Swift's ""Welcome to New York"" (the city might want to consider picking Swift's tribute as its new anthem) the Big Apple has never looked better. A smooth segue leads into an extended sequence which will be familiar and welcomed by anyone who has seen the trailer for the film. This is what we came for. Or at least me. I first saw the trailer a year ago (a preview before ""Minions"") and still fall out every time I see Buddy the Dachshund get massaged. This opening provides a satisfying, hilarious and comprehensive introduction to many of the main characters before the movie slowly starts losing its way.The rest of the film is like many sketch comedy shows: There's a lot of material and it is uneven. There are many good, smart laughs:Snowball the Psychotic Bunny: ""From now on, YOU WORK FOR ME!""Max: ""That could be a fun challenge.""-and:Pops (an aging Basset Hound): ""Maybe you have time, but for me, every breath is a cliff hanger. So I need to take a short cut."" Pops steps off the edge of a building!Chloe (unperturbed): ""Okay, so the short cut was death.""But there are a few scenes, such as a very dark and disturbing interrogation/initiation scene, that miss the mark by a lot.For me, the second and third acts of the movie were made worthwhile by the character of Gidget, an adorable white ball of fluff with a heart of darkness. Again and again Gidget steps up and drops hell on anyone and anything that blocks her path to her UhmEr, Max. (An UhmEr is a person who you really, really like but about whom you are uncertain of the status of your relationship, as in: ""This is Max, he's my Uhmmm...Errr""). Gidget is the focus of one of the best visual sequences in the movie: When the entire Flushed Pets Gang tries to capture Gidget and the rest of her rescue party, Gidget lets loose her inner Rottweiler in a sequence that owes a great deal to Tex Avery and Chuck Jones. Gidget finishes addressing this problem with an attitude of sincere appreciation for the co-operation of by-standers and victims alike that I found winning and upbeat, and almost made me choke with laughter. GIDGET ROCKS!Aside from getting me to smile almost constantly from beginning to end, the greatest accomplishment of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" came near the film's close. No spoiler here, but a plot twist involving a major character reversal nearly undid a suspenseful scene until I flipped my switch from cynical to hopeful. I think kids, especially tween-agers will appreciate this scene because it reflects what many of them (if I remember being a tween-ager with reasonable accuracy) believe about friendship. There is a saying: ""A stranger is a friend I haven't made yet,"" and this key plot development speaks to that profound desire.The above referenced event also sets up one of the most satisfying moments in the movie's epilogue. Any ""Tiny Toons Adventures"" fans out there? If so, you'll probably recognize the homage to Elmyra, the over-enthusiastic pet lover of Tiny Toons fame. Here, Elmyra finally gets the pet that is perfect for her, and for we of the audience, it is a happy moment.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is not a great movie: I rate it 7 Stars. But it is a fun film with lots to laugh at, so much visual detail that multiple viewings on BluRay are definitely in order, and enough heart to make me glad I'm not too jaded to enjoy it.OH! And like ""Minions"" last summer, my viewing of ""...Pets"" was preceded by a trailer for Illumination Films next big release, this winter's ""Sing."" I think ""Best Animated Feature"" could be in Illumination's future.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lady and the Tramp for Urban Millenials,"This fun if formulaic romp through the daily lives of Manhattan apartment dogs and their associates broadens the scope of its 1950s inspiration: it's not just dogs in a house this time, we're looking at a melting pot of different species from the same apartment building (including a hawk on the roof!) who get along reasonably well, at least on the surface; and instead of a puppy looking for attention after a baby joins the family, this movie features a struggle between two grown dogs for the favor of their single, 20-something female owner. The plot is very predictable, but there were a couple of weird things that stood out to me. First, the animation for ""New York"" is mostly fantasy: it looks New York-ish, but a lot of buildings don't actually exist. I guess that's easy to do in Manhattan, just add a random skyscraper; Soul felt more authentically Brooklyn. Second, some of the pets are attempting a ""revolution"" against their owners, but, despite that, there is no serious engagement with animal rights. Third, what is up with the prey animals being psychotic and mean spirited?!? My kiddos and I really disliked ""Snowball,"" probably the worst portrayal of a rabbit we've seen yet! Otherwise, they enjoyed the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never pets were so funny and addictive,"Hallelujah! It took so many time to see a movie that take my illusion in animated comedies back. Funny,fresh and sassy. Though I'm not a fan of comediesA topic so easy to make a movie, but that never was made. And that's exactly what makes this movie so amazing. The simpleness that with hilarious touches that you don's see coming. The variety of animals and situations that puts them in topics and scenes easy to success is one of the best points of this movie.One of the best comedies of the year for just been just like it is and don't create atypical situation that animated movies got us used to.And once again show us that less is more and maybe not perfect but high enough to have an amazing time.This movie makes something that almost no one does, make me laugh almost the whole movie",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick,"Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012 adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them, Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across, to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a little more emotional depth and better character development. I know there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great for kids!,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" was indeed 'pawesome', although very over-hyped. That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
the secret life of pets,I went to see this with my sister and my cousins and we enjoyed it.

Pet Lover's Delight,"It's a ""Despicable Me"" reunion (don't let that turn you away), as director Chris Renaud, writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, along with director Yarrow Cheney (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 2018) gather to get inside the hearts and minds of our little furry/scaly/feathered friends. With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell - the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature) will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious ""pet jokes/mannerisms"" and current society references aren't forced on the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure, about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor quickly returns for a rewarding finish. FYI: Don't let the less than funny ""DM"" Short that pre-empetes the film cloud your judgment. While Children (and there are plenty in attendance) really enjoy all things ""DM,"" there were few adults enjoying that experience. Illumination Entertainment is pre- viewing ""Sing,"" due out in 2016, which also looks promising. Ruff, Ruff!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable, if not original or balanced","The Secret Life of Pets is an enjoyable tale with an interesting premise and whilst it doesn't perhaps fulfil everything one would hope for, it sets Illumination Entertainment on the right track. It is a concept with a infinite line of inspiration and directions to go, should this it become the breakout smash I suspect it will. It has a lot to learn but that should come with the studio's progression and will to try new things and stand out from the animated crowd. It's certainly not ground-breaking or original in any way, but it may lead to the next big animation house breaking through.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/Y0cNfa",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not much here,"Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a ""me too"" money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was ""yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it"". The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel.Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing).",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just back from seeing this movie. Actually it was good,"The Secret Life Of Pets stars Louis C.K,Eric Stonestreet and Jennie Slater and tells the tale of a dog called Max who lives in NYC with his owner Katie. But when Katie gets a new dog called Duke,Max gets jealous of Duke and tries to get rid of him causing the pair to get lost in New York City. So they team up with a wise-cracking bunny voiced by Kevin Hart and his crew and the two dogs try to find their way back home in time before Katie comes back. SO will Max and Duke find their way back.Parts of this film reminded me of Garfield meets Bolt with a hint of Toy Story involved as the whole premise is what do your pets do at home while the owner goes out of their homes.It was overall a very funny tale and myself and my family all loved it today as we seen in in 3D. Kevin Hart was funny as the bunny rabbit and Jennie Slater(who was the voice of the sheep in Zootopia)was funny as Max's love interest.If you are a dog or cat lover and you love animated films. Then check it out.7.5/10B+Verdict: Not original but it was a solid film nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pelts, no secret life","I saw this together with the latest from Pixar. Both are animated, feature talking animals making crazy getaways and trying to retrieve loved ones, so you might think they're going to be somewhat in the same ballpark. How significantly lesser can one be? Let's see.Pixar begin with small, memorable pockets of world that they expand, pulling back to reveal larger vistas. The effort is to have the narrative expansion in as much visually flowing ways. There is thoughtful engineering to this flowing; sequences have been choreographed and given room to unfold. There is an element of discovery. Characters retain a certain human gravity in their wants.These guys just plop us here and there. The place is an unimaginative New York, simply digitized, poorly discovered. The unveiling of the larger world leaves us with an animal mob in the sewers plotting revenge. Sequences, ostensibly the very same chase scenes, are choppy and without any flow. We just bump on a bunch of things on our way out. Characters are sketchy, one is a wimp, the other is a bully, then we change them around to be caring. The hawk as villainous predator then our hero's girlfriend tells him they could be friends, so as of right now he wants to help.We're talking levels of difference between Singin' in the Rain and an SNL skit that features song and dance.And do you ever get the impression some movies simply have lame personality? I find this usually in how characters are presented, in the change of heart they have, in how they pursue what is deemed important. Oddly I never seem to notice the opposite in movies that engage me. Even when I disagree with what I'm being presented with by Noe or Trier but I'm being engaged by a view of the world, not a personality. It seems a certain kind of bad movie reduces the exchange to how things rub me, not having been conceived to do anything else. Well, this is one.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The secret is out, and it's a fun imaginative story for everyone, not just the kids.","But that's the way these movies are going these days, the Secret Life of Pets is design to get everyone to buy a ticket (especially those who own pets), but I do feel this movie is more catered to get adults in those seats. Of course you can bring your children, cause nothing in the movie is not for children, but the clean jokes are mostly focus to an older crowd (or a crowd of pet owners)I'm hoping no child out there knows who Luis CK is, other than his own children. I think this is the first time the kids will hear the voice of Luis CK. The opening monologue was very similar to something that Luis CK would talk about in his comedy routine (Just less grim and raunchy). As the character of Max, a small terrier, he tells us what it's like to be a pet, and from his perceptive it's more like being roommates with your best friend, but in reality he's more like a child who when the parents go away, he and the other children cause mischief when they are all unsupervised. Max's life gets turned upside down when his owner brings home yet another dog named Duke (awesome name for a dog by the way). I understand how Max feels. I'm sure it does happen with dog lovers, but me personally, I've never known a person who already owned a dog in New York City to go out and get another dog three times the size of the tiny dog you have for your above average sized New York Apartment (that she gets to live in alone cause whenever she leaves to the place Max does not know and does not understand why she leaves, she must be making a lot of money from it (She does have a T-shirt from a college I could not read, but it must have been a good one). Two cats, Yes, but two dogs!?Anyway, in both Max and Duke's attempts to get rid of one another they end up getting captured by animal control and escape with the help of a psychopath bunny name Snowball who leads a rebellion of animals that were ""flushed"" away by their owners (Apart of the crew is two Crocodile who live in the sewer confirming the urban legend). This is where the adventure begins as Max and Duke go on adventure from Central Park to Brooklyn and back again in an attempt to find home and their friends from the apartment complex lead by Gidget, who has a huge crush on Max (but Max barely knows she's alive) plan a rescue attempt when they find him missing.The animation is just OK, nothing mind blowing about the character designs, but the back ground layouts were actually pretty cool to look at. The animation is used more so as a tool for what is an excellent story of adventure and odd friendships.The pets where as unique in personality as any resident filled Manhattan apartment complex.Louis CK was almost out shined by Kevin Hart as a tiny bunny called Snowball, a psychotic animal who was abandoned by his owner to become leader of a rebellion for abandon pets. Hart was at his funniest in this movie, Just so on point. Kevin Hart also had a starring role in the movie Central Intelligence this summer, and he was nowhere near as funny in that one as he was in this. If you are a fan of Hart's, you better off watching him play a voice in this movie.Another character I really liked (other than that poodle whose a huge fan of System of a Down) was Tiberius, a hawk trying to hold back his predator urge in order to help his new (and only) friend, Gidget find Max. It was kinda odd hearing Albert Brooks voice come out of the character. Not odd like his role in Drive, but odd in the fact that I just saw (herd) him in as Marlin in Finding Dory that came out a few weeks before.The Secret Life of Pets has a lot of cool charters I should mention, but that's a long list. However, I got to give a shout out to Chloe. If you are a cat lover ( I am) than you are going to love her, she is the absolute best.The 3D was worth it. Items came popping out but not for no reason like most 3D movies. Basically, it feels like they planed the 3D from day one rather than adding it on afterwards to try to milk extra dollars out of us. Once again pointing out a great story happening in the movie, that does not need 3D as a gimmick for you to go out and see it.Plus, like most animated blockbusters, you get a short at the beginning before the feature. This short stars the Minions in a funny tale of the crew trying to raise money to buy something needlessly sold to them on TV.So, Yeah, if you have kids take them, If you don't, It's still a worth wild movie to checkout, but I think you'll have to leave your pets at home (although after seeing this movie you might not want to)http://cinemagardens.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Enjoyment,"As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for this film, I knew that I would see it. I didn't care whether it would be good or not I was determined to see it and I can happily say the film delivered exactly what it promises.Illumination Entertainment who were responsible for Despicable Me have again created a very entertaining piece of animation that will be tickling you through out the hour and half duration. Now you may think that this is basically Toy Story with pets, and you would be right it is, but the film is still new and exciting in its own way.The Secret Life Of Pets follows the lives of various household pets from dogs to rabbits to birds to crocodiles when their owners are not home. We focus particularly on Max a Jack Russell Terrier who becomes ambushed by a new dog Duke who is to be his brother, but when the two don't get along to start, they will get lost in their home city, (which is meant to be NY) and work together to get home. Also pursuing them is their close friends and a maniac rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart.To get straight to the point, the film is very enjoyable and entertaining and funny to be enjoyed by children and older audiences as well. The film is not a masterpiece like Inside Out or The LEGO Movie and doesn't have as much depth as Zootropolis, but it is a fun time at the cinema.It starts of with a very nice establishing tracking shot of the animated city which is very pleasant to look at, and does frequently provide admirable views through out of the landscape. There is also sweetness to it in the relationships between the pets and their owners shown in two montages. All the voice actors also do a splendid job in their role and provide the perfect voices for their characters. With the jokes, there are proper funny jokes and not just plain slapstick, but their is a lot of that. I will say there were moments where the faces of the different characters just brought a smile to my face.However there are still some flaws. There are too many characters that try all to have their moments, and after a while we kind of forget about them and they are just there. There are smaller stories going on in the film which don't quite meet the climax they are built up to be. Finally, the film does have potential in particular moments to give the film the emotion and depth needed but it doesn't quite flow that way.I will say I probably would have enjoyed the film even more, but I surrounded by the most annoying people ever in a cinema. So to sum up it s very entertaining and funny, a good time at the cinema, but not a masterpiece in animated family films. 7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining and amusing,"26 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - The Secret Life of Pets. Max is the spoiled only dog belonging to Katie. His whole world revolves round her and when she brings Duke home from the pound, Max is more than a little miffed. Duke and Max fall out but are forced to help each other when they get lost and into many scrapes during the course of their day. This film, although not side splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals in this film. I think we secretly all hope our pets have fun lives when we leave them home alone, and this film very cleverly moulds each pet to its owner and each house to fit it's pet. Applause must be given to the animators, the details which have been created in the cityscape is incredible, take time to look behind the animals for the skylines, the water, ever the sewers have so much crammed in to them I think you would need to see the film several time to take it all in, it's a long way from ink and paint!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Steaming Pile,"This movie seemed like it was written by a team of writers under the conditions that 1) they include no funny jokes; 2)put as many clichés as possible about pets, and 3) write it in less than 24 hours. It was AWFUL. Nothing made sense, none of the characters are likable, and the antagonist's plot line is DARK (at one point they ask about the details of how the main characters killed their human masters and the villain seems to take pleasure that they killed them with a blender). There's also some weirdly racist line from Kevin Hart about a raccoon lying about being the President. I've seen a lot of animated movies that are great for kids but adults can also enjoy.

A perfect movie for pet owners,"I think this one of Illumination's best movies that they've done, probably one of in the top 5 best movies from the company and I think people are just saying it's bad because they don't like Illumation.Not just that, but also saying that the movie is a rip off of Toy Story. The only similarity I could find if that when the humans are gone, the pets do their thing without them around, which is like when humans are gone the toys do their thing without them around. But that's it. Everything else in the movie does it's own thing.The animation is pretty good, the characters are very likable and I can laugh pretty hard at them, and the writing is really good as well. The humor works brilliantly on the animals, it works great and fits them perfectly.As a dog person my whole life, I can easily understand what their feeling and their personalities. Max looks just like my old Jack Russell who passed away almost two years ago, he reminds me a lot of him and what it was like when he was alive. By the way, what type of dog is Duke supposed to be? My guess is that he's a mix of a chocolate lab and a shaggy dog.Snowball is the most random thing in the entire movie, and Kevin Hart was the perfect choice to voice him. He just says some of the funny stuff in the movie, and sure is out of control. Sure, his plan is to destroy the human race and take over the world is pretty cliche, but this one is a pass for me.So, if your a dog or cat owner/person like I am (for dogs at least) and not a hater on Illumination, than this is perfect movie for you and your family to have fun watching and get laughs at.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
that is just terribly bad,"I think I have never wrote any review before after I watched a bad movie, but this one managed to lower the bar to a level where I simply cannot hold it back.I was very much looking forward to this animation movie as the trailer was great and very promising (5 stars for the marketing people, they sold it).I don't even know where to start. It is not funny at all. It is so not funny that they had to repeat the only reasonable joke we saw in the trailer 3(!) times (the headbanging poodle).People did not laugh at all, not even the children! The conversations are horribly written, felt like they pulled out lines from the same kind of movies made in the last 20 years. Matter of fact the jokes that are also badly build up are also the same boring jokes that we saw before.The characters are weak, the motivations are simply stupid and the series of events is just a big idiotic cliché.I don't know what is the big hype around Kevin Hart lately, but he is bad as an actor and he proved himself to be bad as voice actor. Many times I did not understand what he screams, because all he does in every movie is shout in that very high pitch tone. You know what, I dare to say his character is based upon some racist stereotype cliché too, as no surprises he is the black gangsta type of character (at least act like one even though his character intended to be some sort of underground revolutionary leader, yet all they managed to come up with is a bad ""I am small and cool and crazy kind of gangsta).There are completely unnecessary scenes, just to squeeze out some sort of emotion from the audience and they sweat so they put some also cliché music behind it. Everything is so predictable and cheap in the plot and with the characters that is just amazing.There is one beautiful thing in the whole movie and it is the look of the water, matter of fact it is pretty, but what for? It is the same old Hollywood mistake repeated again, beautiful visuals and awful content.Would it be a disaster for once to spend more money and time on the plot and the character development and not just on the jaw dropping CGI.We all get used to off the good cgi. We know what is possible.Sometimes I have the feeling it is nothing else just some arty farty cgi show off with people who cannot grasp the possibilities of their own work.Do not waste 90 minutes from your life with this rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious with acerbic Despicable-Me touches.,"""All of us have suffered at the hand of humans. They say they loves us, then they throw us out."" Snowball (Kevin Hart voice)Snowball has a jaundiced view of the world, being a cute white rabbit without a home, a street urchin in a most enjoyable animation, The Secret Life of Pets. That he's out to get humans is a given, but his new friends, Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) and big mongrel Duke (Eric Stonestreet), come from a more privileged environment but are unleashed to the world when their human leaves for work.The frequently hilarious and bizarre world of home and homeless pets and the tough animals they conflict and consort with is, of course, a figurative way of looking at how we humans treat those different from us (dogs, cats, for example). Add the dynamic of how we treat our pets, and this romp becomes Animal Farm and Toy Story, with enough slapstick to keep it light but also a happy minimum of preaching the importance of charity and friendship.Max and Duke duke it out until they find they actually work as a team quite well, an ongoing lesson to see the strengths in others rather than their faults. Even the meanest street animal, living in the sewer, has enough wit and love to earn our respect regardless of how unrefined they are.When Snowball, as tough and lovable as a rabbit can be, turns on its verbal street machine gun, step aside because he's funny in ways that cross the social divide. Add to these delights a white Pomeranian who watches soaps and a sausage dog rubbing his back with a blender and you can see why I chuckled through most of the animation.Secret Life is also about the difference between the haves and have not's with plenty of good will to equalize that difference. But most of all, from the Despicable Me and Minions team, Illumination Entertainment, enough cynical observations to fill a Don-Rickles joke book and just enough heart to appeal to optimists. As sea monkeys say, ""It's not our fault if we don't look like the ads."" Yes, you've seen toys in Toy Story on their own when humans are absent, and in a sense this is the same story, including buddies who help each other out (remember Woody and Buzz).The difference in Secret Life is the witty, sometimes sardonic dialogue: for example, remarks that everyone is moving to Brooklyn, Snowball quips, ""I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends."" The other difference is that so much is going on here the emotional rewards of Toy Story are not as prevalent.But, hey, it's summer and this is one enjoyable animation.",,Anonymous,Animation

I think the narrative dealt with the amount of characters well, however, opportunities to explore characters in more detail were missed.

A great animated film for all pet lovers,"I got curious about this movie after seeing the trailers. Then my mom and I saw it in the theatre; I thought it is another great animated movie of the year. Also Max & Gidget are my favorite characters.The story is about Max living a good life in his New York apartment with his beloved owner Katie. That is until Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray name Duke, who Max thought is trying to muscle in on his happy home. One day during a walk with the dog-walker, the resentive Duke tricks Max into travelling far into the city, and they are attacked by a feral cat gang in an alley. The cats remove Max and Duke's collars and the dogs are caught by the city's Animal Control. Fortunately the two dogs were saved by a rogue band called ""The Flushed Pets"". That is all I could tell you folks.I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end. I also love the movie's humor and great animation.

Incredibly uneven,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty lame....and unappealing...especially when they talk about murdering people. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires and is not really appropriate for young kids. This will sound weird, but the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot. That's one of the reasons I loved ""Minions""-- because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun and silliness. Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while. It starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth to watch,"I was waiting for this movie since first trailer was launched. And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, reminds me Garfield and his new ""friend"" dog. Many characters such as lazy cat and hamster who can't find his way home made movie incredible funny. I love Kevin Hart voice and his expressions being that little, loud and angry bunny makes it more interesting. The writing was excellent, made my mom, youngest sister, and myself constantly laugh. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. I hope that there will be a second part of this life of pets.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, Lighthearted, and Appropriate for All Ages!","I'm surprised this film got such a low overall score by users. I thought is was a blast. I am not an animated movie fan in the least. I normally like dark movies, dramas, sci-fi, and horror. This was the first animated film I have seen since Avatar, (which isn't the same type of animation really,) but when I watched the trailer last year, I thought it would probably be good. And it was.The movie delivered exactly what it promised: laughs. It's not earth shattering, mind blowing, and it doesn't explain the meaning of life in 90 minutes. But it's not that type of movie. It's a summer escape film, one that is a little different from the 1000th superhero movie or Sequel #10 of The Current Film of Mediocrity, and one that you can bring your children to without worrying about covering their eyes and ears every scene. There are a couple of scenes of mild violence or almost violence, but they aren't any worse than Bugs Bunny and his adventures with the Roadrunner (I suppose that reference dates me lol).What I liked the best about the movie is the way it demonstrates the thoughts and behaviors of the pets to the viewer. As a Great Dane owner, I often wonder what my dogs are thinking/doing, especially when I'm at work, and my ideas are similar to the writers. Their thoughts and conversations were the funniest parts of the film, and the scenes and soundtrack combined with the dialogue to form a lighthearted, enjoyable story.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The secret life of pets,This a good movie it's not just a rip off of toy story it's actually a good film. If you watch it and love pets you will probably have a great time with this movie. It's a movie that looks great and is really good and it's main story is great and it's cute and cool to see pets talking together doing things that are maybe that is not a thing they would do but it is really cool. Honestly I did not have much expectations coming in to this film expecting an average cute movie but it's better than that. I overall had a fun time with this film. This was a cool movie with characters that are cool two see and I see myself seeing and buying it on Blue ray because it's a good film to see I think. I think I would love to call this a class. One day even though it's just an good and a bit great it's not a masterpiece but it's a good movie that I enjoyed a lot.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Subpar and boring,"Movie has plenty of plot holes, unfunny jokes, generic and confusing characters who flip flop traits constantly, and boring visuals. Another movie by Illumination that's as disastrous as Minions. It just feels like a cash grab with all the animal films being released (though that may just be me and I'm an idiot and it's always been like this). Can't wait for Sing which looks even worse trying to sell tickets with pop songs years old. I know many people will give Kids films a pass because they are kids films such as this one but that's quite silly, we'd be letting them create generic content and make cash off it because it's targeted towards a demographic who would enjoy most if not any movie with talking cats and dogs. At least they tried.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
funny,"The movie gives us a chance to get close to pets, so that pets can sell their cuteness on the screen unscrupulously, and audiences familiar with pets can treat all kinds of pets, especially dogs, as treasures.

Entertaining but hardly ground-breaking.,"Watched The Secret Life of Pets last night. A story you could write on a postage stamp but with some genuine laugh out loud moments and some good voice characterisations. It didn't have any of the mawkish sentimentality that some cartoons manage to devolve into and the action barely let up throughout. Not one I'd want to keep (although there's a lot of background stuff going on that might warrant a second or third viewing) but certainly good for a rental. The animation, as you would expect, was superb with the city backgrounds looking stunning and the characters having great expression and movement. One thing does niggle at me though. It was obvious that the screenplay was thrown together using the ""draw elements from the hat"" method and, while they certainly lead to a few laughs, there were a few points that didn't quite gel with the internal logic of the film. I know it's just a cartoon but still, these things jar and it smacks of lazy writing. What these cartoons do really well, though, is slapstick and there's some great moments of that in this. To sum up: Great for the kids and with a few nice touches for adults to enjoy but not a great deal of substance.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Guaranteed to make pet owners smile,"'The Secret Life of Pets' is a thoroughly entertaining animated feature packed full of action, adventure and family humour.

Same Old Stuff!,"Most movies these days are OK. Animation has become the vehicle of this moment. There was a time when we would be stunned by the incredible use of the animators craft. But once computers and their technicians go into the act and there was so much to watch, we needed something to stand out. While this is a movie about rivalries and being happy with what we have, there is no sparkle to it. There is just a lot of intense action and no reality to peak of. Yes, I did say reality. The anthropomorphic figures here need to be stunning. We've seen the chases and the splats and the tiresome human traits that have been done so often.

Wholesome fun for the entire family...,"Well, there could be little doubt about that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" was going to be a hit, and it turned out to be a very enjoyable movie for both kids and adults alike.The story is about what goes on in the lives of pets once their owners go out the front door and leave the pets home alone. Max, a small well-groomed terrier, gets stuck with Duke, a massive shaggy dog, and have to go out on his life adventure as a mad rabbit named Snowball and his army of discarded pets are about to make life miserable for people, as part of their revenge on their former owners.It is a combination of many things that add up to make ""The Secret Life of Pets"" a good movie.First of all, the animation, which was really great. The characters and environments were all so dynamic and fantastic to look at; with lots of detail and personal touches to them.Secondly, the storyline which was a compelling one that appealed to both children and grown-ups alike. There are many good aspects to the storyline portrayed in ""The Secret Life of Pets"", so there is something for everyone here.And also the characters, whom were all very lovable in their own way, and each character was a distinct and individual character, which also added depth to the movie.The voice acting, which is a crucial factor for an animated movie, was great. And they had some good talents to fill the various roles in this animated movie.I was more than genuinely entertained and surprised with how good and enjoyable that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" turned out to be. And if you enjoy animated movies then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""The Secret Life of Pets"" if you get the chance.

The Toy Story of animals,"The Secret Life of Pets is about pets and their world. Just like in Toy Story, the animals can speak and have a life of their own when the humans aren't looking or are away at work. The dog Max is living a quiet life with his owner Katie. One day she gets a bigger dog called Duke and immediately they start to fight to win her love. After having argued and fought out on a walk, Max and Duke gets lost in the underworld and meets other animals that don't live a fancy pet life like they do.The Secret life of Pets is a film like many other animal films and yet it succeeds in entertaining in a charming way by taking us on an adventure where we get to see life from their side. Films like Oliver & Company, Babe and Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, comes to mind. Animal films are far from new and often contain a worn out story but despite this The Secret Life of Pets really delivers. I think one of the films central elements is the balance in the humor. There is clarity in the dialogue that is easy for children to understand, but there is also another dimension clearly meant for adults. This is often the thing that family films are having difficulties with, to be appealing for both children and adults. The latest Ice Age film that I reviewed here did not succeed in this. The other thing that I really think is the key to the success of this film is the tempo. With its one hour and 27 minutes, the film is not really that long but the time is well disposed and few scenes contains unnecessary things. It also makes us the audience wanting to see more of these animals when the film is over. I am not so sure that we would want that, had the film been 20 minutes longer and slower.The characters in the film is well thought out and shaped to fit this kind of road movie where someone travels forward. They usually include some sort of leader, someone who is a little stupid, someone who is a bit dangerous and also someone who is cocky and perhaps too brave. The Secret Life of Pets has all of these characters and also a villain, a white bunny. Perhaps a hint to Monty Python's evil bunny in the The Holy Grail and also ironic because a bunny is usually seen as cute and harmless. Quite fun, much due to Kevin Hart's great voice acting. The film summarizes itself well towards the end with several morale plot parts. Don't judge people (in this case animals) based on their appearance, comradeship, the ability to share and also that certain things that you want are often found right in front of you if you just look close enough. Definitely good messages for a family film, very often already told, but if delivered properly and in a new way like here in The Secret Life of Pets, they are worth telling several times over again.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!,"Animation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.Kind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.I was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.From the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A Cheerful, Harmless & Family-Friendly Distraction","From the creators of Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets is another barely serviceable feature film to come out from Illumination Studios' canon following their billion dollar-grossing & insufferably pathetic Minions and although it caters well to the needs of its target audience, it remains a highly generic & downright mediocre adventure comedy.Taking place in a Manhattan apartment building, the story of The Secret Life of Pets follows a terrier whose perfect life is uprooted when his owner brings another dog into the house. Although unable to get along at first, the two are compelled to put their differences aside after discovering a sinister plot put together by a horde of lost or abandoned pets.Directed by Chris Renaud & Yarrow Cheney, the movie opens with a brief segment that showcases what pets do once their owners have left for work and it is genuinely funny. The animation is rich & colourful, characters are brilliantly designed & rendered, and it offers a heathy dose of amusement with its fluffy humour but the laughs are usually present in moments that are trivial to its plot.There are moments that are hilarious as hell while it is barely moving on other occasions. Plenty of characters occupy the screen over the course of its runtime but not a single one of them exhibit an interesting enough arc. The voice actors do well with what they're given, pacing is never an issue, camera-work is finely carried out and it is nicely supported by Alexandre Desplat's gleeful score.On an overall scale, The Secret Life of Pets offers a passable family-friendly entertainment and at times exhibits clever use of wit but there is absolutely nothing about it that makes it stand out from the crowd. A slight improvement over Illuminated Entertainment's billion dollar-grossing, headache inducing Minions, it offers a cheerful, harmless & amusing distraction that's meant to be forgotten the moment it ends.",,Anonymous,Animation
If you think this is for all ages you are ignorant,You're absolutely mindless if you think this movie is for young children. I can see maybe nine and older watching this movie. I definitely recommend watching this before you let your children watch it. Just to make sure if they're mature enough to handle this movie. It is extremely violent and potty humor. It's absolutely dark and twisted. These writers must be on drugs when they write the stories. No wonder children are more violent and disturb these days. If this is the crap we push down there throats as good children movies. Please stop making this garbage for our children. If this was just for adults I would say it was an alright movie. It has like three funny parts. I am definitely not a fan.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth a watch especially if you have / had pets,"When growing up as a kid, there's almost a 100% guarantee that at some point a parent will here their child ask for a pet. Whether it's a gold fish, cat, dog, ferret, frog, rabbit, snail or whatever, humans have been domesticating animals for quite some time. There's just something about our pets that we enjoy. The fact that they share and display similar emotions to that of us is so heart warming. They all might express them in different ways but most owners know or understand what their fuzzy friends are feeling. However this is the only thing we comprehend about them on a personal level. They can't speak to us in our native tongue or vise versa and we have no clue what they do behind our backs or how they feel in the moment. When left up to the minds behind Despicable Me (2010) though, viewers will get a completely different perception. Will it make us think differently in what our pets do behind our backs to this extreme - no. But will it let us come up with crazy ideas as to what could happen - of course.This spin off series that runs parallel to the Despicable Me (2010) universe was directed by Yarrow Cheney (his theatrical debut) and Chris Renaud (Despicable Me (2010)). Three writers also collaborated on the script, that being Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch (Hop (2011)). The story follows Max (Louis C.K.), a puppy with a good life. His owner took him who found him when he was a baby and gave him everything to his hearts content. Things were great. Then unbeknownst to Max, his owner comes home with another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Feeling a bit slighted, Max and Duke end up learning that you have to give in order to get. Within that conflict the two end up crossing paths with Snowball (Kevin Hart), an eccentric bunny rabbit whose main goal in life is to overthrow the human race for his fellow abandoned pets. All the while, Max's secret love interest Gidget (Jenny Slate) hopes to gain his affection at some point in time but she's not sure how. Nevertheless she's very determined to make it happen.The development among characters is proportional to the significance each role has. Through several experiences both Duke and Max learn a lot about themselves. Backstories are given for each, which is why their development works. What's even more effective is how many viewers can relate because of comparable life experiences. Gidget as a love interest isn't written so cliché either. The idea itself is rather turned on its head and that's not seen very frequently. As for Snowball, he doesn't have incredibly deep development but his background is made apparent. For the rest of the supporting characters, there aren't too many complaints to have. The only character that doesn't really have a clear motivation is Tiberius (Albert Brooks) the hawk. According to Tiberius, he's sad to have no friends because his owner locks him away in a cage at the top of an apartment. Yet later on, audiences will see Tiberius being petted by his owner and they seem to be enjoying each other's company,...so why is he upset again?The other blatant problem in the story's writing is Max's owner and every other pet's owner for that matter. Apparently this whole movie plays out within a day's time. Throughout the running time, Max and company go through a lot of locations in the city. Some not as clean as others. Yet somehow nobody smells his or her pet has been anywhere but home. Surely somebody's pet would be coming off foul somewhere. What are the odds that they remained clean the whole time? That's about as preposterous as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) where her white dress did not get one smudge. Also the title is a bit misleading. The adventure the main leads go on is nothing that secret. There a few secret like activities that take place throughout the film, but much of it is so out in the open. Aside from this though the comedy and actor chemistry all blend well together. Both Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet practically sound like brothers and Kevin Hart makes Snowball likable and hilarious all at once.The other supporting character that has a number of great lines and best fits her role is Lake Bell as Chloe the cat. So much of her responses and sarcasm are exactly how many cat owners would expect their cat to react to certain situations. The animation is also enjoyable feature. Heading the animation is Salem Arfaoui as senior animator. Arfaoui has been a senior animator going all the way back with 9 (2009) while also participating in Despicable Me (2010), The Lorax (2012) and Despicable Me 2 (2013). The musical score on the other hand was okay but nothing outstanding. Composed by Alexandre Desplat, the music is appropriate to the surroundings with real orchestral instruments but there's no reoccurring theme for the audience to remember. Especially if this is being planned as another franchise, there should be a main theme too. This is what really helps solidify the characters and story. Desplat was also the composer to Unbroken (2014), Godzilla (2014) and The Imitation Game (2014). Especially for such big films, one would expect something.Definitely an entertaining family movie for all ages. It's strongest point is that it can relate to almost any viewer because of how frequently we as a human race go through pets in our lives. The writing is mostly well balanced with a few questionable tidbits. The music isn't truly memorable but the actors and animation are fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lazy and Uninspired,"One doesn't fully appreciate a really good animated film until one sees a mediocre one.It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that animated films don't need to be kept to the same standard as movies for adults, because kids will be happy with so much less. But compare ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" a serviceable but lackluster film, to something from Pixar, say, or the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series, and one is less inclined to forgive the creators of ""Pets"" for being so lazy.The idea of the social life that pets carry on with each other while their owners are away is a good one and could provide plenty of material for a wonderful film, but this movie instead goes for the hard sell approach and creates an overly-complicated plot mostly lacking in wit, giving us too many characters doing too many things, none of which we care much about. The voice work is adequate and uninspired, like the rest of the film, and it's a real liability that the voices of the two main characters (Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet) who start off as rivals and end up as pals, sound too much alike.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming but Lack of Originality,"Part I: Film The latest presentation from Illumination brings audiences a whole new bunch of adorable animals mimicking Pixar's Toy Story but in an overly familiar blended Zootopia/ Finding Dory story line. While lacks of originality and inspiring emotional engagement, it is still a simple, straight forward story lifted by its fast pacing adventure, bloated with ridiculous fantasy and constant charms that are whole-heartedly fun for animal lovers. Characters development is slightly thin due to variety of pets introduced but the film works well in its smaller moments by capturing the sweet companionship bonding between the pets and their owner as well as how do pets behave behind the doors. Music choice and scores by Alexandre Desplats are decent but comparing with Disney; the bright, colorful, state-to-the-art visual effects especially the city skyline is stunningly impressive. This new attempt after the craze on minions continues the mindless entertainment in a repetitive predictability but its flurry fun is overall enjoyable, ends touchingly and definitely amuse the young audiences.--------------------------------Part II: Short Film Mower minions, being short but rebound from empty silliness of the spin off movie last year, offering laughs and at the same time delivering the importance of bringing and sharing happiness with the old folks.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Loved it! Completely funny and silly,"I could not wait to see The Secret Life of Pets and I was not disappointed! I LOVED it! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated comedy that is both funny and sincere. It is about a dog named Max (Louis C.K.), his new brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and their friends. Max doesn't like Duke so he does things that he hopes will get him kicked out of the family home. One day Max comes up with an idea that he hopes will get Duke taken away. His idea backfires and causes Max and Duke to get caught and almost sent to the pound. Will Max and Duke get home? Will their friends find them and help them get home?My favorite character is Gidget (Jenny Slate) who is a white little dog who likes Max. She is very sweet and kind, but when it comes to helping her friends, she will fight anyone. This is a funny trait of Gidget's because she is a super sweet dog but she will fight to protect her loved ones.My favorite scene is when Duke and Max are in a wiener factory and there is a little song where the hot dogs come to life. Little kids might not like this scene because the singing hot dogs get eaten by Duke and Max and they eat the hot dog's heads off.Though there are many morals to this movie, the most important is ""Do not judge someone before you get to know them."" Max doesn't like Duke when he first comes, but later on he learns to appreciate him.The Secret Life of Pets is a funny cartoon about cute animals, but it may not appeal to younger audiences. There are some scenes that might be too scary for little kids. Also, Max and Duke say this to save their lives but, be forewarned they do say ""put their owner in the blender.""I recommend The Secret Life of Pets for kids ages 5 to 15 due to the scary scenes. Older audiences may like this movie if they love animals and fun cartoons.

Not my dogs,"I was looking forward to the release of this movie -previews for such a long time. So waited to go till grandkids were available. and it is not as good as other animated movies released this summer. I did like Max and Buddy - Buddy because I have a dachshund. One of the best things in life is to see a creature that wants to see you so badly when you get home. Back to the movie - the home scenes were fun. The underground bad dogs - not so The references to the crime like people - so over done and how appropriate for young children - that is very debatable. I realize that many children would not understand it and it is the emphasis on the wrongness of bullying - not appropriate. They may not understand it now, but it is in their minds. So some fun things but on an adult level no so good. The animation was OK but being up against the BFG - no contest as to which is better - the BFG.

Lovely insight in their secrets :),"Much of this film was as I expected it, basically the story is a very basic one, everything is good, the days go by as they use too, but hen trouble occurs and it turns the story around, but you have to see that for yourself :)It has some great characters, mostly cute and cuddly, but also a few bad ones, they could be even more evil for my sake, but they are very kids friendly kind of villainous.It is fun and games all the way, the entire family really liked it and we had a very good time in the movies with this one. The Danish voices are really good, but I will be looking forward to seeing it in English when it comes out on DVD/Streaming.Location, seating & time: Atlas, Rødovre, Denmark - Bio 2, row 6 seat 1, 2, 4 & 6 - 14.08.2016 at 13.20",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very human viewpoint - told through the story of lost pets.,"What happens to the pets of New York City when their owners leave their houses for the day? For most, their loyal companions engage in all manner of rambunctious misbehavior and boisterous antics, but for Katie's (Ellie Kemper) terrier Max (Louis C.K.), each day is met with patient waiting for his beloved owner's return. One fateful evening, Katie brings home a new dog, Duke (Eric Stonestreet), which turns Max's world upside down. The large, shaggy brown newcomer quickly butts heads with Max, forcing the smaller pooch to devise a way to remain the alpha. His plan backfires after a disastrous trip to the park, in which Max and Duke firstly find themselves accosted by a band of mangy alley cats, secondly nabbed by animal control, and finally forced into joining an underground brotherhood of abandoned pets - led by maniacal cottontail Snowball (Kevin Hart). As their situation grows grimmer, Max's friend Gidget (Jenny Slate) gathers together a motley gang of animals - including dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress), pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan), tabby cat Chloe (Lake Bell), and red-tailed hawk Tiberius (Albert Brooks) - to mount a daring rescue.Like ""101 Dalmatians,"" ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is told from the perspective of anthropomorphized animals as they embark on an incredible journey. Oddly, though, the film doesn't play by its own rules when it comes to how these creatures perceive humankind. At the start, the main gimmick is that the pets all manage to misbehave or rebel while their masters are away, yet Max is oblivious as to anything going on in his owner's life - such as the unexplainable, unfathomable reason why she would leave every day during most of the daylight hours. Later, he states: ""I don't know any numbers,"" when asked on which floor his apartment is situated. But that doesn't stop nearly all of the other four-legged peers from fully comprehending the English language, reading signs or recognizing city borders, operating vehicles (including taxis and buses), and carving a key out of a carrot.To counter this very human viewpoint - told through the story of lost pets - are a number of spot-on jokes about dog behaviors. With sequences demonstrating infatuations with balls, being motivated by food, chasing a laser toy, craving attention, and discovering easy distractions, all of the animals adopt classic, recognizable traits. Several laughs are even derived from anxiety urination, sniffing, scooting, territorial habits, and performing tricks. But, of course, the creatures are also fully aware of their own identities and egos, with an understanding for other species, cat vs. dog turf wars, soap opera themes, self control when it comes to carnivorism, mastery of the martial arts, and even romance. This leads to a rather sophisticated, highly unusual, tightlipped, underground assemblage of anti-human, anti-pet-status revolutionaries, like some sort of organized guerrilla warrior society that plans complex schemes for prison breaks and recruitment.And, though that faction is governed by an unlikely yet shockingly villainous rabbit (one of the few characters modeled after a stuffed toy rather than a real animal, and one of the few roles whose cuddly design can't overcome the conspicuous voicing, here by Kevin Hart), there's still plenty of humor to combat the severity of a toothy viper; a traumatized, tattooed test-pig; an injuriously lonely bird of prey; or hushed reminiscences of past owners who may or may not care that their pet has disappeared. The film is rated PG for rude humor, but there's also something notably dour about the cast of abused sewer-dwellers and their thirst for vengeance. A sausage-heaven daydream, uncanny dexterity, and creative maneuvering through the city are highlights, presented with a level of hilarity that hopes to match the attention to action sequences (and exceptional fur/texturing effects). Though it ought to be primarily a comedy, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is certainly more thrillingly adventurous than laugh-out-loud funny.The Massie Twins",,Anonymous,Animation
The secret life of pets,"Whenever I got invited on a date to go watch this movie, I was kind of skeptical at first because it was a cartoon film and I haven't even watched the trailer. But whatever, free movie and yummy popcorn right?To say the least, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie. Even though it was a kids movie, it had clues here and there about things adults would do and even say. Which made it even funnier! I couldn't give a bad review on this because I genuinely had a great time watching it. I definitely recommend it to anyone, including kids and adults as well Even if it's a cartoon film, it's definitely the kind to wait and hope for a second version.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Entertaining Family Flick,"The Secret Life Of Pets is an amusing and entertaining look behind the curtains and closed doors at what exactly goes on when people leave the house and their pets behind.The plot is defined in a timely fashion, new characters are introduced that add to the experience rather than hijack it, and the pace of the story development is good. At no time was I yearning for a resolution or to ""get on with this"".I can think of only one or perhaps two scenes that had been spoiled by trailers, another positive aspect of the movie. The Secret Life Of Pets kept some secrets of its own rather than spilling the beans during teasers and trailers.CGI at times seems cheap, most clearly in scenes involving close-ups of the characters anthropomorphized faces. This is sadly becoming the norm as movie companies outsource their CGI.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family animation with a traditional feel,"The Secret Life of Pets is a very family friendly, warm and fun movie. It has less of the tiresome pop-culture gags in it than some other animated releases, keeping the humour within more traditional themes as say an older Disney movie might do which renders it very suitable for anyone of any age.The story follows a group of downtown New York city pets, two of whom run into some trouble during their routine ""walkies"". There's not much more to it than this, aside from the micro plots in each quick-fire set piece and the introduction of (perhaps a few too many) other animals but it is for kids and it does well to keep their attention for the ninety-odd minutes.It features great vocal performances and nice (if unadventurous) animation. You won't see anything groundbreaking in this movie and it is unlikely to be one that's talked about much as time goes on, as it is weaker than the likes of How to Train Your Dragon or The Incredibles but if you're looking for a child friendly trip to the movies, this is arguably a good choice.I'm not a huge animation fan (if you take a look at my other reviews) but I did not feel hard done by after seeing this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Deceptive Advertising, Not the ""Kid"" Movie it Appears to Be","Not commenting on artistic merits, purely on content/target advertising. Commercials are happy/fluffy/funny.... this is in no way representative of this movie as a whole, and could/should be considered deceptive at best, if not literally false advertising. My child has watched commercials depicting happy-go-lucky, anthropomorphic pets hanging out and happily partying with their pet friends of all persuasions while their owners were away. So naturally she loved.... the first 15 minutes of this movie. In short time, anything most rational people would consider appropriate for a child gave way to frightening, gangland-style violence, including discussing the ""glory"" associated with ""pets"" murdering their owners and an attempted ""initiation"" involving an over-sized viper, and an overall tone that is simply disturbing. The greatest disappointment for the moviegoer isn't even in the questionable content of the film itself, but in the fact that it can only be reasonably assumed that the commercials were deliberately misrepresentative of the film as a whole because someone realized that if rational parents were given an accurate depiction, the box office take would have been very disappointing to the company.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
wacky action animation for kids,"Max is a terrier happily living in a Manhattan apartment with his owner Katie. His world is turned upside down when Katie bring home a shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to be the alpha and Duke pulls him out of the dog park. The duo is cornered by alley cats, captured by dog catchers, and released by a gang of ""Flushed Pets"" from the sewers led by a people-hating rabbit named Snowball. Gidget is a dog who likes Max. She recruits another group to look for the missing dogs. Max and Duke escape from Snowball who vows to hunt them down.This is a wacky chaotic stew of loud animated animals. It is unrelenting in its fun-obsessed story. The voice work is good comedy. There are probably too many characters. It's not that much of a secret life when the pets are driving a bus causing traffic chaos. This is geared more towards the younger kids. The non-stop brightly-colored action-powered movie will keep them from getting too bored if it doesn't exhaust them.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not enough poodle death metal for me,"I watched this animation movie just because I saw the trailer and there was a poodle that likes death metal music. Since I have also a poodle and that I like death metal as well I thought it would be funny to watch. Unfortunately there are only two scenes with that poodle and death metal. So for me it was disappointing because animation movies are just not really my thing. I'm too old for that. I read on here that it's not really suitable for kids and I wonder why people would think that. I thought it was perfect for kids. Unless you think kids nowadays are still little pussies like you were at their age then I get your point. But seriously there are way harder things on the internet or on the news that kids have free access to every day. The movie itself is what it is, and that is that it's for kids. It's all well done but boring for an adult.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Toy Story for Pets,"A Toy Story for pets. There, I've gotten it out of the way – the classic Disney film that every critic will mention in reviewing Yarrow Cheney's and Chris Renaud's The Secret Life of Pets. Perhaps cracking early the plot resemblance spoiled my high hopes for this film. We have two rival dogs vying for pet owner Katie's attention, a Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) and a huge shaggy mongrel Duke (Eric Stonestreet) – the Andy, Woody and Buzz Lightyear in this version. The clash of these two mismatched dogs leads them at the mercy of 'The Flushed Pets', a gang of sewer-dwelling, human-hating animals led by a fluffy sociopath bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) – yet again similar to Toy Story 3's group of road-abandoned toys led by Lotso bear. Max's disappearance sets his cutesy neighbor toys, I mean, pets to go for an adventure all over New York City in the hopes of finding him. The Secret Life of Pets just aims to be a fun, harmless, kiddie movie and it easily achieves that goal. Standing next to Toy Story, however, this appears to be the less remarkable model.The first trailer of this film went viral before and it promised something different: the simple proclivities in the life of domesticated animals – an obese tabby cat raids the remaining contents of a fridge, a dachshund uses an electric mixer to give himself a back massage, a seemingly innocent poodle head-bangs to System of a Down, and so on. These scenes may be smaller in scope but it generates more excitement. To my surprise, the teaser trailer is actually what transpires in the first ten minutes. When the film starts to send the pets to the metropolis, only to follow a highly- derivative story- line, I would rather have them stay inside the house and continue their silly lifestyles.Sure enough, the plot rip-off from multiple films (aside from Toy Story, I also got vibes of Stuart Little 2, Babe: Pig in the City and even Fight Club at some point) results to a disjointed film. The friendship between Max and Duke is hastily built around a dream sequence of dancing wieners or what could have been an unintended and subtle promotion to the upcoming Sausage Party. The half-heart attempt for Duke's character development goes nowhere in favor of a crazy car chase. (I'm getting tired of animals knowing how to drive cars at their first try. It only works in the Looney Tunes universe.)The Secret Life of Pets remains to have a high-appeal for children and avid pet-lovers, but it's lacking the big underlying social allegory that only adults can get. The viewing experience is tantamount to watching cat videos – it's a healthy dose of distraction but it also leaves no recollection of substantive material. Sadly, this is not the secret life that I was expecting of.Full review: http://goo.gl/lEPZmN",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Worse movie,Not a children's movie at all. My husband and I walked out after the first 30 minutes of the movie. And we weren't the only people who walked out! A little boy left distraught from what he heard and saw on the movie screen. We were disturbed at how incredibly dark the content was for being a children's movie. From what we saw there was not much humor and violence reigned. The movie took a strange turn when a big stray dog interrupted the life of the main dog & the two encountered an animal gang. The gang had a rite of passage and wanted to share gruesome details on killing humans. This movie was over the top in violent thinking especially for a kids movie. It also appeared to have a political agenda behind it. I am thankful we didn't bring our son to the movie. We would NEVER bring our children to watch this movie! I wouldn't recommend this for any family.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well written, enjoyable movie","I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The writing was excellent, made my wife, youngest son, and myself constantly laugh, which isn't always easy for all 3 of us, simultaneously. The character development for these characters was interesting, as we were shown many facets of their psyche, which made it even more entertaining. I was waiting for the spot in the movie that would make me roll my eyes, as I find in most animated movies I have previously viewed, but it never happened. The adding of the little Minions vignette was hilarious to me, but not my family, which is fine, especially since I haven't seen either one of the Despicable movies, nor the Minion movie. A great family movie, 10 out of a 10 for me was a must...!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Toy Story With Pets,"""The Secret Life Of Pets"" does not obtain the reflective level of films from Pixar or Dreamworks, nevertheless , it can entertain at least most of the movie. The analogies with the ""Toy Story"" franchise are relevant, this causes the originality is reduced to a couple of jokes and an incredible animated landscapes, detailed with realistic, brilliant and vivid colors. Pets' Story' pretends to be a recycled version of the animation classic, same narrative theme, same characters, same relationships, worse results. Story is a sophistry - but, we knew its plot - however, the film benefits of the vastness of oral and visual jokes, the connection between the protagonists, its screenplay and its professional cast of voices to entertain children and amuse to adults.Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud conceive an urban environment as compelling as soul of the pets, but the charm is inversely proportional until to fall in state of trance, in generic state, a linear state. It is a child product, but we cannot underestimate children, they need beneficial films and last production of Illumination does not offer it. Taking advantage of recurrent formulas and few surprises, the characters give life to the project, not with the same satisfaction of toys, nevertheless, they make sacrifices to achieve it.Max (Louis CK) modestly lives with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in a homey apartment in the center of Manhattan. What does Max do when Katie is not at home? Every morning, the adorable canine waits anxious and impatiently at the arrival of his owner, but he enjoys hour by hour with his friends of the building, other pets that do the same like Max; a self-centered and gluttonous cat called Chloe (Lake Bell), a distracted and grouch pug called Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a film bird and even a relaxed and unworried dachshund (Hannibal Burress). Ideal life for a domestic animal, unlimited food, friendly friends, a comfortable bed, a perfect owner, but what would happen if they aren't two plates of food, three plates of food at home?Max has the drama of a only child, after Katie decided to adopt to Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a huge dog coffee; from there, the similarities with the film's toys are visible, two different beings who must join forces later a dispute between the two animals - I am amazed, it is the same premise -, they are defenseless in the real world, outside. Their enemies are a weak point which is added to the weaknesses of the film. The contrast of a cute white bunny (Snowball, Kevin Hart) with a wicked and vengeful rabbit is somewhat curious and very fruitful for the development, nevertheless, its ending is vain and unfinished, it did reduce consistency and weight to the story line.Delicate it is observe that the prominence of the support characters was bigger than the main characters, as in the case of Gidget (Jenny Slate), madly in love for Max. She seeing that her platonic love does not return of the walk with his dog walker, she is alert and leaves to see her side most aggressive in order to rescue him, for this, she assembles one special squad and they take the path, an acceptable adventure. A girl in search of her lost brave prince, this plot works better than the 'copy and paste' from the main.Illumination compensates for the lack of narrative originality with accustomed visual aspects of its movies, a sausage factory full of colors and charm curvatures, an alleyway with clothes hanging out on a rope and even sewers inhabited by stray animals are representations of the potential behind the minds of the company. Despite its visual magnetism and its auditory knowledge, it falls severely on the monotonous twists and predictable moments.""The Secret Life Of Pets"" wasted millions of opportunities, starting with a good story to tell; With what we saw, we wish that the life of our pets were a secret. Continuous laughs and sparkling graphics do not cover to the slow-paced of the film, nor vanish a history already narrated. It accomplishes the unique and poor function of a summer movie, entertain, nevertheless, we would have wished a product more beneficial. Pets had not to leave of their houses and their movie neither, one funny mistake but disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Entertaining Enough for Kids, But Adults May Be Left Wanting","The Secret Life of Pets should come under the banner of 'a good concept yet not fully developed'.There's no doubt it certainly recycles the old story arcs of the Toy Story films, firstly the premise of what pets do when you're not there (so it just replaces toys for animals) additionally it features a main character taken aback by a new arrival, the main character then tries to get rid of said new arrival & then they both get stranded & have to find their way back home...sound familiar? Additionally there is a moment in the storyline where a character recalls his relationship with a former owner akin to what Jessie does in Toy Story 2 therefore the similarities continue in pushing those buttons, now the problem of doing this of course is that you are setting yourself an impossible task to match up to & when they clearly didn't have the same quality of care involved in it in my opinion it isn't going to win over an adult audience who has seen it done so much better, but then again does it have to? The Secret Life of Pets is certainly very passable as a purely kids film and there is enough frantic animation, cute characters and humor kids of a certain age will no doubt connect with.Now in terms of the voice talent involved Louis C.K plays our main lead animal Max & although he does a capable job he certainly gets overshadowed by a couple of support performances, namely Jenny Slate who plays Gidget & for me was very entertaining and without doubt the standout character on show, Albert Brooks who plays Tiberius a pet hawk also does some good work & Kevin Hart gets a showcase opportunity as the rather psychotic rabbit Snowball, beyond those performances though I felt the voice-work was a much of a muchness.As I've said some of the storytelling is recycled, but also some of it is clearly chaotic in terms of that the film seems to be briefly focused one minute and then gets distracted with some other antics the next, now that can be fine as long as those antics are entertainingly worthy of diverting from the original storyline but it treads a very fine line in doing this.The animation itself is vibrantly colorful and engaging to look at, but then again these days with a decent budget (as this film does have to the tune of $75million) that is not too difficult to achieve.There are some nice comic observations on our relationships with our pets and I certainly laughed numerous times throughout but more in the vain of smirks and sniggers rather than belly laughs.I do think that there was a lot of potential with this premise of a film and certainly feel that it has been a opportunity missed to be a truly great animated film, but as I've said previously it is certainly not a a bad film and it is extremely passable as an entertaining kids film but I do struggle to make a convincing case beyond that general consensus.On a side note I really didn't need that unfunny Minions short film prior to the main feature, it utterly reeks of pure commercialism & audience grabbing bait on Illuminations part in order to garner more of an audience for the main film.Now I've not done this for a while sooooo.....Hello to Jason Isaacs.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A shockingly violent and negative film for children,"This animation tells the story of a domesticated dog, who finds himself having to share his home with a big dog. They have to learn to get along, when they are captured by animal control team, and subsequently find themselves in a gang of animals who are sworn to be enemies of humans.I'm truly surprised by how dark and scary ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is. It features scary animals eating each other, cute dogs having to step over the bones of other animals, and treacherous animals attacking each other ruthlessly. I can't see how this can be entertaining for children, or adults for that matter. It's a shockingly violent film with lots of negative messages. It's truly not for children.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The story's thin, but the cast is pretty great","""What do our pets do when the humans are at work all day?"" That's a really good hook - something you'd expect from PIXAR, at that - and it has wide-reaching appeal. That there are gags centered on animals other than just cats and dogs means that a lot of this is accessible to just about everyone. And when ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is about that premise, it's gold. There's a wealth of stand-up talent in the cast, and the animators find plenty of behavioral humor to mine in the pets (cats, especially). But then the main characters are taken out of their home and onto an epic adventure - and this is where the movie goes straight into ""Flushed Away"" area. I was much more interested in the goings-on in the apartments than I was in the sewer.But, aside from that narrative indulgence and some ill-advised song choices (there are much better odes to the Big Apple than ""Welcome to New York""), this is a decent children's movie. It's not as tight as the Despicable Me movies, or even ""Minions"", but of all the movies you can be dragged to by a kid (""Smurfs"" anyone?), it's a harmless Summer diversion.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Cute Kids Film With an Over Abundance of Characters,"The Secret Life of Pets is directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud and stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The story follows Max, a dog who loves his owner, Katie. They both get along very well, and live in a small apartment in New York City. However, Katie goes away every day (most likely to work), and Max has no idea where she goes. During this time of day, Max and all of his animal friends get together and have parties, or just have casual conversations. When Katie returns home with another dog named Duke, Max gets jealous, and his envy sends both him and Duke on a journey that gets them lost in the big city that they live in.I wasn't too excited for this movie. The trailers looked decent, yes, but Illumination's last movie was Minions (2015), and we all know how great that was. Most of the voice actors working in this film are pretty good, so that was enough to drag me to the theater. I walked away just slightly surprised. The film doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it wasn't horrendous. I enjoyed some aspects of it, and didn't find myself wanting to leave the theater.First and foremost; this movie directly, step by step, rips of the 1995 Pixar film, Toy Story. Nearly everything that happens in this movie happened in Toy Story, and even some elements of Toy Story 2, the 1999 sequel. At first I didn't really notice it, but once time went on, I started to realize it more and more. Each and every scene borrows something from Toy Story, and it really becomes noticeable after quite a while.The best thing I can say about The Secret Life of Pets is the main characters. Despite there being way too many characters in the movie, the ones that were the most important were good. I liked Max and Duke, and their characters arcs throughout the film. I started out liking Snowball, the bunny voiced by Kevin Hart, however, as time went on, the character just started to get annoying. My favorite character was Gidget, the small white dog voiced by Jenny Slate. Her personality was very likable, and she was a very compelling character. Her friendship with Max, and her desire to rescue him really pushed the story along, and I enjoyed her character very much.On the topic of characters, there was way too many. Max and Duke are the characters that the film really centered around, but the amount of supporting characters was just ridiculous. There were a few characters that were given more attention, like Gidget, and Snowball, but Tiberius, Chloe, Pops, Buddy, Mel, Tattoo, and Viper weren't, and that's just a short list compared to to rest of the characters. Many different characters could've been cut out of the film, and that probably would've improved it.Most of the unnecessary characters are thrown in for attempts at slapstick comedy, and it doesn't always work. After awhile, the slapstick starts to get a bit annoying, and the movie really should just focus a bit more on the story. The attempts at humor throughout start to give the film a Tom and Jerry feel, as if you're just there to see small animals beat each other up with miscellaneous items or methods. The slapstick starts to get old pretty fast, and drags the film down by a lot actually.Overall, kids will like The Secret Life of Pets, and adults will think it's a cute kids movie. I wouldn't pay much to see it ever again, if I ever did. It's a step by step rip off of Toy Story, except with animals, and I wouldn't pay more than matinée price if I were to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cute and entertaining characters in a too familiar story.,"Yeah, I'm not going to lie to you. I didn't expect a lot from this movie, but I had a good time watching cute talking animals doing mischievous antics.Not that it was terrible, because the voice work was energetic and delivered some funny jokes and the animation was nice to look at. The story, however, was pretty standard. A dog loves his owner, the owner gets another dog whom he instantly dislikes and tries to get rid of and they end up getting lost together and learn to appreciate each other.But even though some side characters steal the show, the film makers went way overboard with the quantity of characters. A lot of them sadly didn't make much of an impact on the movie other than following the leaders or being one-off jokes themselves.I wonder why a sequel is hitting theaters later in 2019, but what the hell, I guess TSLOP made enough money in theaters to green-light it.TSLOP is fine as a time-waster, but nothing that special.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Family film,"Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, lots of laughs and surprises. My 3 year old (also named Chloe) actually behaved throughout the whole movie, of which she was also holding on to her stuffed Chloe Doll that she picked up earlier that afternoon. After the movie she commented that their were two Chloe's now. For a movie that didn't have a lot of media attention I am glad I took the family to see it and it was money well spent, fun for the whole family. My favorite part would have to be the one that they show in the trailers, such as when the poodle switches the music from classical to heavy metal.

Some have criticized the manic pace, but I didn't find it particularly ""manic"" - animated movies have to be in constant motion to keep attention.

"There is an important message in there, that kind of gets lost.","'THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' movie; about a spoiled terrier, that has to deal with another dog his owner suddenly brings home. The two canines go on an adventure together, in Brooklyn. The film was directed by Chris Renaud (who also co-directed 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), and it was co-directed by Yarrow Cheney (who served as a production designer on 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2). It was written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (the two also co-wrote 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), as well as Brian Lynch (who also wrote 'MINIONS'). The movie stars the voice talents of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Lake Bell, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress and Albert Brooks. It's received decent reviews from critics, and it's also been a blockbuster at the Box Office (making over $100 million, domestically, in it's first weekend). I thought it was OK.The movie tells the story of a very happy terrier, named Max (C.K.). Max lives very contently, with his owner Katie (Kemper), in a Manhattan apartment building. He loves his pampered life, with Katie, and while she's gone (his least favorite time of the day) he hangs out with other pets from the building. Then Katie brings home a very large (and messy) dog, named Duke (Stonestreet); that she rescued from the pound. Max is very unhappy, at Duke's sudden presence in his home, and the two don't get along. When Duke tricks Max, into running into the city with him, the two must team together (and work out their differences) to find their way back home.The animation is decent, and it's a mildly funny movie. I definitely didn't find it to be too boring, or overly stupid, but there is an important message in there (about not abandoning animals) that kind of gets lost. It's like the filmmakers wanted to make a more insightful (and educational) movie, about taking good care of your pets, but then they decided to desert the idea; for cheap laughs and cheesy drama, instead. Still, it's not a bad film, it just could have been a lot better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Terrible movie, nothing like the trailers","One of the worse movies I have seen. It was nothing like the trailers suggested. Only the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes were represented in the trailers. The rest of the movie was trash. Lots of trash talking from unnecessary characters, depiction of gangs etc was completely unwarranted.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining and Beautiful, but Mediocre and Self-Serving","Secret Life of Pets follows, as you can probably guess, the secret life pets have when their owners aren't around. Max is a terrier who's enjoyed all the love and affection he gets from his owner, but everyday when she goes to work, he's left alone, waiting for her return. His fellow pet friends, whose owners have also left for work all come and hang out, including Chloe the cat, Mel the pug, Sweet Pea the budgie, and Gidget the Pomeranian; who lives in the building next door so can only watch from afar. One day Max's owner comes home with a new pet; Duke the Newfoundland, who poses a difficulty to Max's comfort and way of life. What ensues is Max and Duke getting lost in New York City after constantly trying to get rid of each other, and Gidget and the rest of the gang trying to track them down. Along the way they meet Snowball and his sewer-dwelling gang of anti-owners, and Tiberius the predatory eagle, and Pop the disabled basset hound.Being a family movie, the story of Secret Life of Pets is unsurprisingly formulaic and predictable. Max and Duke constantly try to one-up each other, get lost and into trouble, but learn valuable lessons along the way, accept each other, and are found and return home safe and sound. There's no subtext, there's no twist, there's no complexity. It's a linear story with no surprises and not too much originality. But it's a family movie, they're not exactly known for their top-notch storytelling (not even Disney/Pixar are capable of breaking this).Secret Life of Pets isn't even particularly new in it's humour. The opening montage that introduces us to all the main characters is probably the movie's high point. Unfortunately this montage was pretty much the whole trailer, so watching the actual movie doesn't improve on that. We see Chloe gorging her face on food, Mel barking at squirrels outside his window, Sweet Pea pretending to fly through canyons on the TV, Buddy scratching himself with a mixer, and of course the poodle that changes the music to System of a Down. The humour from this point on is a little lacking. It's mostly slapstick to appeal to younger minds, and I'm sure it's successful in that regard, but I doubt anyone older than the age of ten will find the image of an aggressive gang leader rabbit pooping himself randomly hilarious.On the note of Snowball and his gang, I have read some controversy on message boards about how violent this film is, and I can't say I overly disagree. Snowball's gang are quite violent and provide the most threat to Max and his crew, but they're also overtly shown as the antagonists. In my opinion, kids could do with a little more darkness in their movies, so this was welcome, but it still wasn't exactly as scary or dark as movies were when I was younger.It's a breathtakingly beautiful movie. Between this and Minions, Illumination have demonstrated that they are second to none in creating breathtakingly detailed and photo-realistic vistas. Secret Life of Pets is bursting with vibrant colour and detail in every scene, from gorgeous cityscapes and autumnal colours, to textures of stone, brick and wood that are treated with excruciating detail. I can't state enough how incredibly impressed I was with the imagery in Secret Life of Pets. An opening scene of Max and his owner going for a walk in the park with vibrant autumnal leaves everywhere, and a towering, imposing city full of lights and colours behind was so crisp and clear.While Secret Life of Pets is absolutely aimed at those with younger minds, the movie is rife with references to other properties that only more experienced viewers will discover. I often found it was a little too heavy-handed in it's references, and maybe a little too self-serving. For instance, the amount of references to Minions and Despicable Me were uncountable. Minions made appearances in almost every scene, Gru can be seen in the background, as well as the unicorn, and the gnome from the Minions short. The love of Universal properties is also rife, including The Tonight Show, and Universal and Illumination's upcoming Sing. But there's others that are a little more thoughtful and subtle, like the sliding turtle taking out enemies in a reference to Super Mario, or a lizard bursting out from a disguise mirroring the chest- burster from Alien, Snowball's revolution against humanity as a homage to Animal Farm, a poster from Hitchcock's The Birds, and an emotional reference to ""Ricky"" a la Boyz N The Hood.I know my review of Secret Life of Pets seems awfully scathing, but I did enjoy it in a lowest common denominator way. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's sometimes quite funny, and it's absolutely a visual feast for the eyes. I didn't feel I wasted an hour and a half of my life once the credits rolled, but it is an unremarkable movie. It doesn't try anything new or fresh, it makes no effort to seek longevity or classic status. It's a fleeting time that is mediocre and largely forgettable, made for the sole entertainment of children and nothing else. On that note, I can't call it a failure. But it's not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either, not by any means, but I don't feel not seeing it would result in missing out. I give Secret Life of Pets and enjoyably fleeting experience worthy of a 6/10. I'm sure my four-year old will love it though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty looking film but not the best story,"My daughter was looking forward to PETS as she just go herself a new rescue dog. I thought it might be fun too; it was a little. The animation was great as usual. You really got the sense that these were real live creatures. The initial storyline was a little slow to get started and when it did I thought I was watching a remake of Toy Story 2. A lot was borrowed from other things; so much for originality. The voices were okay for the characters I especially enjoyed Khloe the cat. What I really didn't care for was the villain of the film. There was some development of his character but he was just a loud talking, annoying character. Of course the human were all but window dressing and that's too bad, a little more human interaction might have helped this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
the shortcomings are obvious,"The overall effect is good, but the shortcomings are obvious. There are not many 3D shots and the effect is not strong; the plot is scattered, each bridge section passes by with too many branches and leaves; the story is always young and not coherent enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An improvement over Minions, but absolutely not perfect.","This film is from illumination entertainment, which recently created the first non Disney animated film to crack 1 Billion worldwide, Minions. For my thoughts on the studio, Despicable me 1, and 2 were great, Hop was OK, but forgettable, but The Lorax and especially Minions were bad. Then this film came along.Easily the weakest part is the writing. It rips off Toy Story using the same concept except with pets, which makes this movie very predictable, often in the first hour. It however, becomes a lot less predictable in the 3rd act, which gives it some suspense. This is also a problem with Independence day resurgence, but unlike that movie, the concept is well executed, which makes this movie entertaining. I had a good time watching it because of that. But overall, this writing is mediocre.The characters in this movie are one of my favorite parts. Max is, however the weaker one who is like Woody from Toy Story, who is a jerk to his companion at first, but then grows to be friends with him. The rest of the characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch, suck as Duke, Gidget, Chloe, and more. But my favorite one is the bunny Snowball, who is the funniest, with Kevin Hart making a good performance as the bunny that looks cute but has a violent personality, making him the villain.New York City is one of my favorite cities in the world, and New York looks like nothing I've ever seen before. It perfectly shows all the attractions such as the One World Trade Center, Times square, Central Park, and Brooklin in way I've never seen in animation. Also, the design of the pets are accurate as they are both cute and well designed. The only part I don't like about the animation is the human design, which is always rather weak in Illumination movies. Along with this high quality animation, the humor hits a lot, with very smart gags, and not the very unfunny slapstick in Minions and it also takes a break from DreamWorks like Crass humor. There is an animated short that plays before this called ""Mower Minions"", which is OK and cute, its just that the humor isn't funny, just like the Minions film.The writing may be weak, but the film is enjoyable with memorable characters, and smart and funny gags. The animation is also breathtaking as heck. I recommend to kids and adults. It may not be as smart as Zootopia, or as unforgettable as Finding Dory, but it is a good addition to the summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An average animation,"In a fantastic world where pets can talk to each other, a small dog by the name of Max is forced to face a harsh fact. His owner brings him a new roommate with whom he must share everything. Unfortunately, their relationship seems doomed from the beginning due to differences in character and also in size, but this is about to change when they must work together to return home after the city pound catches them without collars.It is a funny animation which tells the story of two very different dogs who struggle to tolerate each other and as you would expect, they're forced to put their differences aside in order to survive and get home to their owner. It seems funny at the beginning and it manages to make you laugh from time to time, but far from the expectations I had, while the plot is simplistic, very predictable and very common. As you can tell from its rating, it's an average movie which doesn't stand out from the crowd with anything, thus making it only a good watch, bound to be forgotten very soon, although it had potential through its imagined world.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not what I expected,"Not at all what I was expecting, I took my grandson, and luckily he was a little bit older, 13 years old. This movie is not for younger audiences.

I thought we would see the dogs and cats tearing up the house, eating food, partying, and having just a real good time. A lot of things were very disturbing, don't want to spoil it for anyone but the traffic scenes were very disturbing for me and I know they would be disturbing for younger children.

Uncomplicated kiddie fun.,"Touted as Toy Story with animals, the latest family-friendly adventure from Illumination Studios (Despicable Me, Minions) takes a light-hearted peek behind the door at the lives of pets residing in a Manhattan apartment block. All is well for these domesticated creatures until Max (Louis C.K.), a spoilt Terrier who loves his comfy existence, doesn't return from a visit to the dog park, sparking a perilous journey throughout the Big Apple led by the indefatigable Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate). The first half hour is full of laughs as we meet our eclectic group of pet protagonists, but once the trek through the streets commences the jokes dry up at an alarming rate, largely because it fails to add anything to the lost-in-the-big-scary-world formula. The characters are a mixed bag too, a few memorable ones carrying the bland other ones. The quiet ball of fury Gidget, the nonchalantly self-centred cat Chloe (Lake Bell) and the hyper-energetic bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) leave the biggest impression. But it ticks all the right boxes to ensure kids will love it: bright and bubbly animation, a bopping soundtrack, non-stop visual gags, quotable dialogue, very few quiet moments and, in Snowball and Gidget, two pets who would be a hoot to own. Considering the potentially hilarious concept and the great opening act The Secret Life of Pets squanders it's opportunity to land in the higher echelon of animated flicks, nevertheless it's an easy, breezy 87 minutes of uncomplicated kiddie fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely funny throughout! 7/10,"Review: It's not very often that these animation creators get the mixture of adult and children's humour right, which is why I really enjoyed this movie. The various characters were well put together and the plot had more than enough twists, to make it interesting throughout. The Bunny, voiced by Kevin Hart, cracked me up, and I was quite impressed with the attention to detail. The story is based on a little Jack Russell named Max, who is loved by his owner, Katie but when she brings home a mongrel called Duke, Max feels that he is invading his space. After Duke tries to become friends with Max, he decides to use a fearful approach so he isn't taken back to the pound. Duke then tries to abandon Max in an alley but they are both attacked by some vicious alley cats, who steal there collars and leave them to be caught by pest control. On the way to the pound, a little bunny, Snowball, breaks his friend free from the van, and he frees Duke & Max and takes them to his secret hideout. They soon realise that Snowball is the leader of a gang, called the Flushed Pets, and after proving that they are worthy to join the gang, they have to go through a initiation, by getting bitten by a viper. As Max & Duke are not willing to get bitten, they flee the secret hideout, mistakenly killing the viper, so Snowball vows to kill them, with the help of the Flushed Pets. Meanwhile, Gidget, a dog who lives in the same apartment block as Max and has a crush on him, becomes aware that Max is missing, so she gathers the other animals in the block, to try and find Max. Whilst on the run, Max & Duke try to find Dukes owner, but Duke is captured by the pest control again, along with some of Snowballs crew, so they join forces to rescue them. Its quite a crazy story, which does go from one instinct to another but it's an joyful ride, which has an emotional ending. It does take some time to get going, but once Duke and Snowball come on the scene, it really is non-stop to the end. I'm looking forward to the sequel, which is due out in 2018. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Coming from the stable who brought you the Minions and Despicable Me, I'm not surprised that this movie nearly made a Billion dollars at the box office, and the mini movies on the disk were also a joy to watch. The movie was directed by Chris Renaud, who brought you No Times For Nuts in 2006, the great Despicable Me in 2010, The Lorax in 2012 and Despicable Me 2 in 2013. I'm surprised he didn't direct the Minions movie, which went to Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin but it was still a good film without the creator of the franchise. The plot in this movie, is pretty complex compared to a lot of other straight forward animated movies, and the vibrant colours and various animals, really made me appreciate the amount of work that went into this project. I just hope the sequel lives up to my expectations!Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $875.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey and Steve Coogan. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enjoyable but forgettable,"The Secret Life of Pets is truly an enjoyable animation film that mixes those elements that work in any animated film to make it family friendly: good visuals, nice main characters, cuteness, adventure, clean humour, no hot topics, and overall fun. Besides, as this is not a movie about anthropomorphic animals, but about real pets and street animals, so it has the added flare of reproducing the behavior that some animals show in real life with humans, something that will delight pet owners.The voicing of the characters is perhaps the thing that I enjoyed the most, really great in all cases, Kevin Hart (Snowball) being my favorite character and voice in the film.The film doesn't have any hidden message, any moral teaching, or anything that will make it unforgettable regarding the visuals, the story, the idea behind the film, or the visual narrative.

"Illumination Steals, And Scores!","The Secret Life of Pets easily overtakes Despicable Me as the most entertaining film produced by Illumination Entertainment. It is however, difficult to shake off that its success, is rooted from its outright rip off of Toy Story's storyline & messages, but with fluffy animals, & forgettable sentimentality. Nevertheless, its appeal to animal lovers is undeniable, as it playfully paints an outrageous picture of what our furry friends are up to behind the scenes. It then comes with lovable characters that takes on unhinged goofball adventures, with serious comedic punch. It is as well one of the best voice acted, animated film out there, with the likes Louis CK, Kevin Hart & Jenny Slate voicing its characters.Overall, while The Secret Life of Pets probably doesn't warrant a second viewing, it does enough to make its 87-minute runtime, hassle free.

Pet Tricks,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Too many chase scenes detour a good movie down the wrong path.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Pets' private moments (without their owner) get more complicated for two dogs lost in the real world.The unconditional love and endearing behavior of a pet infuses me with a giddy sense of outright joy. As a life-time pet owner and an avid dog lover, I realize the importance of a four- legged friend in one's life. A pet will bring out your inner child and my latest member to the family, Zoey, is happiness personified.￼In the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, animals are personified as well, taking on human traits, especially when their master is away. That is the on-going premise of this film and since I may be a tad biased, as my interest in this film was as comparable as my dog's overwrought joy in getting a new stuffed toy, I have decided to let my intelligent and sensitive pooch handle the reviewing. So....￼ZOEY'S REVIEW: Hello, dear moviegoers. It's me, Zoey! For those who may not know me, I am a miniature wirehair dachshund with a high I.Q. and I love food, people, playing with toys, and watching cars and movies, in that order. I was asked by my owner, whom I call Daddy Jim, to review a new movie called The Secret Life of Pets, a film that does a disservice to animals in general for spilling the beans about our private moments when you are not around. First off, don't believe it. We are trustworthy creatures who avoid any possible danger. Remember this is not a documentary. It's fiction! That said, I can honestly say that the film was funny and had some nice characters that I enjoyed, especially, the two alpha dogs, Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet).￼The story goes like this: One day Max's owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), brings home a new pet, Duke. Neither are overjoyed with the prospect of sharing their time or attention with their human friend. (I wouldn't either, so already I relate to this situation.) So both go about sabotaging each others' place in the house which leads to problems later.￼Now some of the shenanigans become too far fetched...did you say fetch?... especially as they are chased by a dog catcher...I know, a cliché....and meet up with a gang of strays led by an angry rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who dislike the tamed set...hmm, now that was an interesting development. While I was constantly amused by the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely animation, the screenplay lacked depth and plot development. NO, I wasn't expected Shakespeare, although Hamlet is one of my favorite reads, but I did want something more than one chase after another...and, mind you, I do love to chase rabbits in my yard. (I also did not need a jarring dream sequence that takes place at a meat factory that just doesn't work. Its inclusion gives the film far more filler than any hot dog should endure.)￼Still The Secret Life of Pets has many humorous moments and captures the movements and nature of animals very well. It also establishes some strong characters with the other critters in the neighborhood, such as Gidget (Jenny Slate), who loves Max so dearly, Chloe, a cat who loves no one but herself (like most cats I know), Tiberius (Albert Brooks), a hawk who continually fights his true hunting instincts, and Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a smooth dachshund to whom I particularly related. as I enjoy his noble breed so much.￼Now I know animals cannot speak human, even though I am very verbal...just ask my daddy. So I was very surprised to hear the animals converse in English...that is, until I saw the end credits and understood. So, there is good voice-over work by most actors in these roles, particularly Mr. C. K., Mr. Stonestreet, that veteran of voice-overs, Mr. Brooks, and Ms. Bell, although Mr. Hart and Ms. Slate's vocal demands are overdone and too intense for my liking.￼While the animals in The Secret Life of Pets are not as smart of as sweet as me, they certainly will win you over. The film is fine family entertainment and filled with charm and...oops, gotta go...dinnertime!Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Twizard Rating: 89,"I'm not one to really gawk at the vocal cast of an animated film, but Illumination Entertainment (of Despicable Me fame) sure knows how to pick them.In their sixth motion picture, the studio gives us a peek at what our pets do when we're not home. It begins with Max (Louis C.K.), a small dog who loves his owner more than life itself. He stands in front of the door all day just waiting for her to come home. Then one day, she does, but brings in with her a very large dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet).You may only get the jokes and the high-flying emotions if you have pets of your own. Luckily, most of America does in one way or another. Anyone who does knows how unbelievably ridiculous they can be sometimes. And this movie goes the route of exploiting that a bit, without actually trying to make sense of it--because, what fun would that be? Some may be bothered by the fact that it borrows from the premise of Toy Story--and a couple other Pixar gems. I'm not one of those. It's a smart move. And besides, there's much more to the story than just a simple two-misunderstood-individuals-journeying-home-together angle. There are multiple plots working at once.We don't just see Max and Duke trying to find their way back, but also a gang of Max's friends setting out to find him--led by a paralyzed blind dog and a spoiled rich dog who longs to profess her love for Max.There are some moments where it becomes very dark, but the issues come with how it handles those dark moments. It has a couple of chances--both of which it fails miserably.The energy never lets up, and that plays as more of a good thing than bad in The Secret Life of Pets. Your kids will love it and the laughter is pretty consistent from start to finish. It may not have the same emotional punch of Despicable Me, but it knows how to make us laugh, thoroughly showcasing the world that it wants us to see.Twizard Rating: 89",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Secret Life of Pets,"6/10 - funny and entertaining, but not what I was led to expect from the trailers",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meh-ow,"The Secret Life of Pets is a modern kid's film. That means it will be super energetic, desperately cute, and often funny. That also means, unless it's preempted by a bouncing desk lamp, it will most likely be nothing more than white noise to pass the time in an air conditioned building full of screaming children and sleepless parents. Illumination Studios (creators of the god-awful Minions) may be the main culprit of this type of derivative drivel, and based on the presentation of their products through cultural ubiquity and Pixar-like universe meta-referencing, they are undeservedly proud of what they've done. Their latest, Pets follows NYC house-pet Max (voiced very well by Louis CK) who, joined by a mismatched group of animals, goes on a series of misadventures to try and make it back to his owner. In many senses, it's better than what Illumination has done so far. Pets' observational humor uses the reality of pet / human behavior to really nice effect. Unfortunately, a large part of the story is spent on less down-to-earth story arcs in order to fill a half-wit plot, bogging down in ill-timed sentimentality, frustratingly blatant 3D and formulaic morals. That mechanical storytelling manipulation is its most glaring problem. Otherwise, there is some really great stuff here. The montages in the individual pet's homes are irrepressibly smile-inducing, the score is a bouncy jazz-based good-time, and there's a hot dog segment set to a Grease song that I totally loved. However, if you've seen Zootopia, Toy Story, Bolt, Up, Finding Nemo or even Dory, then there is nothing new here for you but a Disney-Pixar-knockoff without the sophistication.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everyone has a secret,I find it would be a good idea to watch as many films from Illumination as possible as they don't just do the Despicable Me franchise and they are one of those computer animation studios. I find it's good to see how computer animation has evolved and franchises are good ways. The Secret Life of Pets is one of them. There's a number 2 and I saw there is a third in development. It seems like Toy Story as both are about stuff going on adventures without the owners knowing. A big difference is that the Secret Life of Pets is about something that's already conscious and could move by themselves in real life: animals. That is what it has in common with Illumination's other franchise Sing. Both franchises are about animals with the main differences being that Sing has the animals being humanoid and there being no human characters and it's a musical like the title implies. I find Illumination's films are alright but nothing phenomenal like most of Pixar or some of DreamWorks. Illumination is good for children and DreamWorks and Pixar are more for all audiences.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The Movie is OK, but no Oscar Contender","Overall Grade: CThe Secret Life of pets definitely has some funny and entertaining moments. Some of the characters are quite funny. I especially enjoyed Kevin Hart's and Jenny Slate's characters and their respective performance. However, considering the other cast, I was expecting this movie to be much funnier. It had a few chuckles, but that was it. The animation is of decent quality, though not at Disney/Pixar levels. However, the biggest failings comes from the plot. It borrows so many plot points to the point of the movie feeling like a blatant ripoff without adding any of its own, so the movie as a whole was relatively boring and predictable. It is definitely an improvement over Minions, but nowhere near as good as Despicable Me 1 and 2. Considering the amazing animated movies that have come out so far this year (Zootopia and Finding Dory), and the animated movies that look amazing and are being released soon (Kubo and the Two Strings and Moana); you probably won't be finding this on any of the Oscar shortlists.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Horrible stuff for kids,"Started watching this with my kids based on trailer. I actually very rarely do this, but research the movie well before pressing play. Based on trailer I figured this is a harmless cute pet movie. It isn't. I don't know what sick twisted mind thinks this is good family entertainment.Starts off amusing, nice animation, cute characters, it's basically what the trailer showed us. I started grinning already when the two main characters didn't get along, but when they get out of the house, the things get really twisted. They loose their id tags and run into dogcatcher and a ""lost pets gang"" and go down to sewers.There's a lot of detailed talk about pets killing their human owners, with a blender, the discussion comes up twice and is really long. The lead characters are made to act ""tough"" and they make up horrible stories the ""gang leader"" disturbingly enjoys. Then there is a scene where a pet literally beats out answers from another. A lot of scary action, cute bunny turning scary hostile etc etc.I don't know who this film is for really. Kids don't need to see and think of this stuff as entertainment. Kids don't need to think about murders. They don't and I'm pretty sure the whole idea went over their head, because it's not how kids think - thank god. But why feed them this hostile crap?What eventually made us stop watching was the snake in the sewers. My 7 yo said he doesn't want to watch anymore and I agreed.I'm sure the ending is all nice and friendly (atleast I hope so), but I really really despise the idea that you can do what ever to create dramatic structure in the movie, just to sort of make up for it in the end with a ""good message"" (I don't know if there is one tho). At that point the film makers have already served the ideas to kids so you can't take them away anymore.You can do a proper - dramatic, even scary - kids movie without the themes served in this movie. Look at Totoro and other Ghibli movies. You don't need baddies, violence and murder.Come on film makers, you can do better.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than I thought it would be,"Cute, funny, and not always predictable. I went to see this movie thinking it would just be funny. I expected it to be pointless, but the plot was pretty complex. The previews don't show you what it's really about. The story stayed exciting for the whole hour and a half. The characters were adorable and entertaining. The animation was pretty good, too. There are actually some scenes that make you feel like you're flying or falling even in 2-D. I wouldn't say this was *as good* as a Pixar movie, but it will definitely be on the list of nominees for best animated picture. I will add a warning: Do not bring children under the age of 5 unless they're pretty mature for their age and won't freak out. This is not mindless entertainment. There are crocodiles, monstrous snakes, and scary-looking killer cats, and there are scenes where it seems like a couple of the characters are going to die. A kid who looked to be about 2 screamed and cried at the more tense moments. This movie isn't graphic, but it will scare babies and very young kids. It's PG and not just G for a reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Its fine, but not fantastic","I think this is a common theme for Illumination these days, but the Secret Life of Pets delivers an experience that I can only describe as ""Yeah, it was. . . decent."" Its cute, well-animated, nicely voice acted, and delivers a decent experience of fun gags here and there, but its probably boring for anyone over the age of maybe 10.That's not to say that you'll HATE it if you're any older, but believe me, there's a dozen better kids movies out there that parents and adults would love more than this one. Its. . . eh? It's just one of those painfully average ""eh"" movies, a boring plot and boring characters for the most part, but entertaining enough to make it feel somewhat worth the trip. I really like the scenes in the sewers with the viper, and I loved the bunny villain as well. He had a spunky personality that I could appreciate. But other than that, definitely not Illumination's best or worst, just dead center as a ""sure, alright"" sort of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Secret Life of Pets - A Fun and Energetic Adventure for Animal Lovers,"The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a lively animated film that explores what our pets do when we're not home. With a charming concept, vibrant animation, and a cast of lovable characters, the movie delivers a fun and entertaining ride, especially for younger audiences and pet lovers.Positives✔ Great Concept: The idea of pets having secret adventures while their owners are away is both hilarious and relatable, making for a creative and engaging premise.✔ Vibrant Animation: The film brings New York City to life with colorful, detailed animation, capturing the charm of the bustling streets and cozy apartments.✔ Lovable Characters: From the loyal Max to the rebellious Duke and the hilariously unhinged Snowball (voiced by Kevin Hart), the movie is packed with memorable personalities that keep the story engaging.✔ Fast-Paced and Funny: The humor is lighthearted and well-paced, filled with physical comedy and witty one-liners that make it enjoyable for kids and even adults.✔ Emotional Moments: While mostly a comedy, the film has touching scenes about friendship, loyalty, and finding family in unexpected places.NegativesPredictable Plot: The storyline follows a familiar formula of rival characters learning to work together, making it somewhat predictable, especially for older viewers.Missed Potential in the Premise: While the idea of pets having secret lives is fun, much of the film focuses on a traditional adventure rather than fully exploring the everyday mischief pets might get into.Some Jokes Geared Only Toward Kids: While there are moments that adults can enjoy, the humor is largely aimed at a younger audience, which might make it less engaging for older viewers.ConclusionThe Secret Life of Pets is a fun, fast-paced animated film that delivers plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments.

"Sometimes cute, sometimes disturbing and creepy","It had it's moments of cuteness, but the creepy, nasty animals that live in a sewer that hate with cringe-worthy depiction, out to get owners, is over the top. And the most violent animal, the leader, they chose a black person to portray as the the violent gangster role!) (Seriously!) Very racist. I also hated the over-sized sloppy dog who was very unlikeable. The other dogs were cute. The little bird was adorable but hardly got any screen time. The visuals of the NYC background were absolutely awesome. The storyline is sometimes redundant, making it boring. Despite this, I'm still glad I went. Very different from the trailer, where they don't show the dark side. Not for children! This could have been so much better!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Secret Lives of Pets was quite a funny computer-animated feature film,"In this Illumination (the makers of the Despicable Me series) computer-animated feature film, we see the animals talking after their owners leave for the day (just like the toys in the Toy Story series) and doing their own thing. The main character is a dog named Max who suddenly is being paired with a much bigger dog and he doesn't like it. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a funny and partly touching take on the ""animals on the loose in the city"" premise with many fine support from many of the other animals involved including a rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. By the way, I was wonderfully surprised that among the other celebrities doing voices was one Albert Brooks who I previously also just heard reprising his Marlin fish character in Finding Dory. So on that note, I recommend The secret Lives of Pets.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very disappointing,"What a disappointing movie! Here I'm thinking we're going to see a movie about the 'secret' life of pets and their relationship with their owners, but instead we get some goofy, uninteresting story line about pets that have lost their way. Maybe I'm spoiled by Pixar movies like Nemo that have characters and dialog that appeal to both children and adults? This is definitely a kids movie.Case in point; three quarters of the way through my daughter says 'this movie is not what I expected. Can we leave now?'We left the theatre at that point, and did not even discuss the movie on the way home, which is unusual for us.The trailers for this movie are very misleading. In fact they are the only interesting aspect and they all occur in the first 15 minutes. The movie would have been much better if they had stuck with the 'secret life' theme.It's not a bad movie; just disappointing. Kids 5 and younger will love it. Anyone else......not so much.If you do see it, I would not spend extra to see it in 3D.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable movie to all audience,"The Secret Life of Pets surprises you very satisfyingly at the very start. Movies visuality is enormous and the silhouette of New York is stunning. I have visited in New York few times and I instantly start to the Big Apple. Animal characters are very clever and well fulfill. Script is quite straightforward and used many times, but the visuality of the movie forgives a lot. 3D is beautifully used and you can wait some roller coaster ride between skyscrapers. Many characters, especially dog characters feels familiar, especially if you have ever owned a dog. Nostalgic music makes you feel familiar and patch up some flaws at script. Movie is so full of particulars that you certainly can enjoy this many time. If there is something to accuse, the script is quite simple and used many times and you could get much more out of the communication between animal characters and humans. More laugh out of that. After all The Secret Life of Pets is quit enjoyable despite some lack to all audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"When the human's away, the pets will play","You may have heard this with cats and mice instead of humans and pets. But the allegory is what this movie is about. Actually if you saw the trailer you know the overall premise even without reading anything more about it. If you ever had a pet you probably were wondering if there is more to their life and what they were doing while you didn't look. This movie wants to show you what you were missing.Well obviously this isn't real and I'm not only talking about the fact it is animated. It also tries to give us more than just the on punchline and all the jokes we've already seen in the trailer. Which is nice, but overall you can say this is a very uneven affair. Still it strong enough to keep kids entertained and adults should have their fair share of fun too. Never mind the convoluted story and any other mess you'll most likely see - just enjoy the hyper active bunny and the rest of the crew.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uninspired Illumination animation,"Surely a case of concept first/plot comes later, The Secret Life of Pets is the latest feature from Illumination, the animation studio responsible for (to blame for?) everything Minions-related. Though there are references, Pets wisely doesn't try to replicate the little yellow army. But while the new movie does its own thing, I'm not sure it will have the simple, resilient appeal of the Despicable series.Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C. K.) lives in a Manhattan apartment block, populated by all kinds of apparently perfect pets who lead rebellious shadow lives while their owners are away. Max adores his master. So when she brings home a stray dog, Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a fierce rivalry begins.One day they are out for a walk when Duke decides to get Max into trouble by dragging him off the beaten track. Duke and Max come up against a gang of cats, led by the vicious Ozone (Steve Coogan). After being captured by Animal Control, the dogs are inadvertently rescued by a rabbit called Snowball (Kevin Hart), who introduces them to The Flushed Pets, a society of forgotten animals who live in the sewer. The encounter triggers a series of farcical events against the backdrop of Max's and Duke's journey home – and of course their burgeoning friendship.My synopsis doesn't scratch the surface of what is a weirdly complicated storyline. I've named but a fraction of the enormous cast. The film suffers from a damaging overabundance of characters resulting in a ridiculously busy plot. Combined with its vehement slapstick focus and almost complete lack of pathos, it's a dizzying ADHD experience which is aimed at the very young and the very excitable.Beyond the titular premise there is little invention or originality. Lovely animation infuses the animals with personality. But they aren't helped by a rote script which puts a frankly boring, not-particularly-odd couple front and centre while sidelining the potentially interesting creatures (Albert Brooks' pathologically predatory hawk is briefly hilarious).Some jokes strike, even if the pacing makes them fleeting. My personal favourite moment was in the sewers and a visual reference to Super Mario Bros' dashing green Koopa shells. But too many big punchlines land softly, spread across too many plot threads. If it feels like we're watching a series of vignettes then that's surely telling us that this is a short film stretched to scattering point.Perhaps it's because it comes so soon after another anthropomorphised animal animation, Zootropolis, with its vibrancy and its depth, that Pets comes across as so visually dull and narratively rudimentary. In a post-Pixar world, ""just a kids' film"" doesn't cut it. A mediocre film is a mediocre film, even one with moments of individual brilliance – all of which, I can report, can be seen in the trailers.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Let down,"I'm going to be honest, (not that I would be anything other than honest), the trailer is the best thing about this film. It shows all the best scenes, which depicts and deceives a different story. I would have definitely liked it more if the film was just about pets at home, rather than making it into an adventure.The pets, for the most part, have fun characters. Max and Gidget, are for sure my favorite two. Max is the ever loyal human's best friend, and Gidget has the most character out of all. Her persistence is admirable, and Slate does a great job with dialogue. On the other hand, the other group of pets - led by Snowball, was a bad choice for the film. When Snowball is introduced, it just brought the film down so much in my standards. I have nothing against Hart (he is a rather funny guy), but his voice and the character did not fit at all into the overall tone of the film. He is just so much more vulgar than a kids show should be, and his character was so obnoxious and loud, it made me cringe.The animation itself is vibrant and colorful, which fit well with the characters. The scene settings had great detail, and the characters' movements were smoothly done. Filmmakers definitely did their research (in which they may have just observed their pets), and it was great to see the little things that dogs and cats usually do. The way Max's ears droop is so cute, and how Chloe plays with the toys around her reminds me of my cat. It was also fun how they contrasted the attitudes between cats and dogs.As I said, the main issue I have with this film is the character of Snowball, and how typical the plot is. Everything else was enjoyable and cute to watch. It was just a disappointment to watch a film that promised to show what pets do at home when they're alone, but didn't deliver. Would have liked to see more of that, and more of the owners too.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty to Snowball, The two dogs escape the sewers. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.A white dog who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing, and recruits red-tailed hawk, Gidget (the white dog) and Tiberius (the hawk) then enlist Mel (The fat dog), Buddy(a sarcastic dachshund dog), Chloe(a gray cat), guinea pig Norman(a guinea pig), Sweetpea(a small birb), and a paralyzed old base hound named Pops to begin searching Max. The group encounters Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman (a guinea pig) is captured as the rest of Gidget(the white dog )'s team flees.In Brooklyn, Max and Duke begin to get along with each other. Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man, live with him with happy life. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was picked up by Animal Control. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident that Fred will still love him. When they arrive, though, they learn from a resident cat named Reginald that Fred has died. Resentful and angry, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who call Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes for him to escape and ends up being captured instead.While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball and his comrades. However, Snowball's gang are captured by animal control, and Snowball decides to help Max rescue them. They drive by a city bus and crash into the van of animal control on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The animal control van falls into the East River with Max and Duke inside. Max is unable to get the keys to Duke's cage, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve them, allowing Max and Duke to escape the sinking van.The entire group return to the apartment by taxi. Max expresses his appreciation toward Gidget. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but Snowball is then adopted by a little girl named Molly. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in to her sweetness and lets himself be adopted by her. Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you are even thinking of going with kids under the age of seven, I'd seriously rethink it.

It looks all cute and fun, but within the first ten minutes of the movie I thought I'd have to leave when the pets that are in the sewer talk about killing all owners. This keeps coming up throughout the movie as well. There is a fair bit of violence in the movie as well as the sewer pets try to get the main characters at any cost.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Darker than expected, not for small children","The preview gives the impression this is a light comedy. Some parts are cute and sweet, while others are very dark and just plain cruel. Some animals have very nefarious plans.At the screening I attended, when those evil plans were revealed, about 15 people walked out of the theater (about 6 or 7 families with children under 8). There's a character that gets off on violence and violent stories.That being said, it's not a horrible film. It definitely has its moments, but the pacing is just odd. It can't make up its mind. Characters change alliances randomly. One minute it's funny, the next it's very disturbing.There's even a psychedelic, drug-like sequence all of a sudden which just seems out of place and is just weird. I couldn't wait till it was over.The film was obviously made by and for dog lovers, not cat lovers too.I left the theater feeling empty at the end.If you're looking for a solid family film, Finding Dory is a better choice and movie overall.

So much fun,"I heard good things about this movie, but then I read some of the IMDb reviews and got worried that this would be too much of a kiddy movie. But nope, this is absolutely great.It's made by the same people who did the terrific Despicable Me films, and like those, it's very funny and pumps out one gag after another in quick succession. The movie manages to both catch real qualities of animals, like cats that will bite then lick you, and goofy nonsensical things like an angry bunny leading a stray revolution.The cast is excellent, particularly Kevin Hart as the aforementioned bunny and Ellie Kemper and Lake Bell as two of the protagonists' friends.The story is little more than an excuse for a lot of gags, but it works.Some people are complaining this movie is too violent for kids. When I was a kid, Bugs Bunny would hand Daffy Duck a bomb that caused his bill to come off, so I have trouble taking the violence complaint seriously. It's got some action-movie fisticuffs and a bit of suspense, but I see nothing wrong with that. It's fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good.,"I was attracted to this film for a simple reason: my girlfriend is very fond of animated films. From the same creators of ""Despicable Me"", its quite interesting and begins with a good premise: what do our pets do when we leave home every day...The whole story revolves around Max and Duke, two dogs who end up lost in New York. While the remaining animals in the building join forces to find them, led by a cute little dog, Gidget, they end up in trouble when they find - and irritate - the mob led by Snowball, a lovely white rabbit who has a deep hatred for humans. This film was made for younger audiences but not entirely for children, I believe, so I think that children over seven or eight years old will understand the film very well, which is not exactly shocking.One of the most interesting things here is the long list of adorable and cute characters. The dogs (Max, Duke, Gidget, Pops, Buddy and Mel) are noteworthy but are closely followed by the rabbit, Snowball, which was so successful and became so popular that it was one of the movie's merchandising hits. The obese cat Chloe, the guinea-pig Reginald, the budgerigar Sweet Pea and the hawk Tiberius also deserve a special look. The dialogues and jokes were well done and there are subtle nods here and there to another studio works (particularly the ""Despicable Me"" franchise) as well as other popular films and series like ""Saturday Night Fever"". However, jokes and humor are not to laugh out loud and sometimes barely works. The film has excellent voice actors, most of them with some other voice works in their pocket. Among them, I highlight the performance of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Steve Coogan and Kevin Hart.Technically, it was difficult to demand better. It has one of the best opening sequences I've seen in animated films, with the animals taking care of their owners' houses as soon as they walk out the front door. CGI and the quality of the animations are impeccable, with the animals drawn in their details, magnificent colors and light, movement and action at the right times and inexhaustible doses of cuteness. I read some comments on the Internet in which some people said they had experienced difficulties with the pace, with the second part proving to be more tiring and dragging. Personally, I didn't feel that much, I think it developed well and the final part was really fun. Perhaps yes, one or another scene takes longer than necessary, perhaps a more skillful editing effort has been lacking, but that seem to me a minor problem. Finally, I still have to leave a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, with some jazz tones that are simply pleasant... and pertinent! After all, it's New York!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm gonna do the same thing, except I'm gonna call them ""critic sandwich"".The graphics in this movie were absolutely beautiful and radiant. There were some unexpected scenes, and some language that shouldn't be heard by children.

"It was fantastic and does contain cheesy humor, but it made my day.","This movie does make you feel connected to the characters and feel in love with them. The variety of different animals each have a very distinctive trait and personality that makes us want to keep watching. The basic plot of the story is that two dogs go missing and Gidget (another dog) encourages her friends to find the two dogs. On their adventure, they encounter strange and bizarre things.

There is some moral message about friendship, trust and love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful moments.If you do eventually decide to watch the movie, make sure to bring your whole family and enjoy it.

Who let the dogs out?,"This amalgam of 'Toy Story (1995)' and 'Toy Story 2 (2000)' but with pets instead of toys is exactly what you'd expect it to be: totally inoffensive yet utterly unremarkable. 'The Secret Life Of Pets (2016)' is perhaps the definition of fine, which is exactly why it's ever so slightly below average overall. It has a handful of enjoyable moments and the animation is lively, but the picture just washes over you. It's kind of difficult to focus on, in a way.

Good fun,"The Secret Life of Pets is an animated adventure comedy movie directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney. It stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Steve Coogan, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The movie follows Max, a dog who lives as a pet with his owner and enjoys everyday with her. That is until the owner brings in another pet named Duke who Max has some problems with. I very much liked this film, it is a fun colorful animated flick with a very talented voice cast and some very good laughs along the way. It is interesting and has a very good concept, despite it being similar to Toy Story. But it totally works in favor of the film as it does hold our interest until the end with likable, yet underdeveloped, characters that any pet owner will fall in love with. It is not perfect however as it has many apparent flaws, as I already mentioned it is very similar to Toy Story and it borrows a lot from it. The side characters are just there really, they don't do much and we get to know very little about them throughout the entirety of the film. But all in all, this is a hit for Illumination who surely know how to make those numbers at the box office huge every single time. Imagine this movie even surpassed Inside Out at the domestic gross and it holds the highest opening record for an original movie ever, again surpassing a much better film - Inside Out, which is insane to think about.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The two go out one of those days when the owner is out and a spiral of events lands them in the midst of a notorious ""sewer"" gang of rodents, alligators, cats, a pig, viper and an alpha bunny.

Yes, there is a plot but it's such an unoriginal one it feels like a hundred movies we saw before.

A Talented Voice Cast Wasted by a Lazy Script With Little to No Laughs,"The Secret Life of Pets lacks the gut busting laughs of Illumination's other features and unfortunately adds nothing new to the animation genre. Without any real heart or memorable characters, even for pet lovers, it will likely end up being disappointing and forgettable.Centering a Toy Story style plot around a group of pets in New York City sounded intriguing, and the trailers even hooked me in a bit. Sadly, the trailers already featured most of the film's funny surprises. People with pets, and particularly dog lovers, will get a kick out of some of the various gags throughout, but there's no substance here at all. It's quite simply a Toy Story rip off with pets that doesn't even really try to be anything else.With that said, the voice talent is impressive here. It follows the similar pattern of animated films getting Hollywood stars to sell the movie rather than getting true voice talent. But at least most of the cast is made up of actors with stand-up background. Jenny Slate, Louis C.K., Steve Coogan, and Kevin Hart are just a few of the voices who lend their comedic talent to the picture. Hart and Slate have quite a few humorous moments, but I can't say I really cared about the story they were in. Unfortunately, that's all film ends up being, a bunch of mini gags with pets without a story to grab onto.I was also hoping the film would take advantage of its wonderful New York setting a little more. Having Taylor Swift's 'Welcome to New York' play as the camera pans around the gorgeously animated NYC parks and landmarks was a great way to open the film, but that was about as good as the film got.It's difficult to truly care about what's happening when there's nothing more to the characters than dull rip-offs of Disney creations. It's not just that the characters of Max and Duke are undoubtedly rip-offs of Woody and Buzz. But you can pretty much go through the entire character list and point to who they are in Toy Story, not to mention just how closely the story follows events of Toy Story 1 and 2. Sure, you get a few chuckles here and there with talented voices leading the way, but the story is derivative and the direction is weak. Which basically just accounts to one uninspired film.+Voice talent+Gorgeous animation of NYC-Uninspired story/Toy Story rip-off-No heart or substance-Utterly predictable4.9/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Warm fuzzies abound, and not just in the physical sense. Beyond the sight gags and puns, both calling cards of Illumination Entertainment (the studio behind Despicable Me), it offers a big heart and a fresh spin on a rather familiar saga. Like an urban, modern, madcap Incredible Journey from several perspectives, it's a winding road with many unexpected bumps. It's also well-stocked with voice talent - Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks, Hannibal Buress - and does a fine job of letting the bigger personalities do their thing, taking over a scene when they need to.

Additionally, it is very, very crude. It is absolutely not something that I would want my children to see and I myself did not find it enjoyable, partially because it was not particularly funny, well-made, or endearing, and partially because I was concerned about all of the kids in the theater seeing and hearing what I was; I'm sure some of it went over their heads, but certainly not all of it.

"Predictable, badly written, uninspired","Even the voice acting was lazy, Kevin Hart was great but most of the other actors clearly didn't put much effort into this. But the writers put even less.The art style is terrible, every human and animal looks awful. Clearly someone talented did it, who could've done better but I suppose someone gave them sketches of those terrible designs to model and animate and they had to. Just skinny-limbed, big-headed freaky freaks.Again though, the writing is the worst. Everything is predictable, every character changes personality instantly when convenient, which is the main reason why no one cares about such characters or cheap movies like that.""Hey, we need a movie idea!""""Pets that can talk. There's only 999999 movies like this by now. So it's very original.""""Cool, now we need them to face a challenge.""""Well, its dogs, so... dog catchers?""""Cool, we need the obligatory sad scene now.""""Okay, someone we barely showed and no one cares about died with no details and backstory.""""Awesome, now we need the obligatory main-characters-have-a-fight-near-the-end scene.""""We got this.""""Sweet, now it's time to wrap up the movie and make everything work.""""No problem, we'll just drastically change all the characters' personalities to suddenly be friends and/or find each other.

Should never get rating U,"This is absolutely terrible animation for children. Don't show it to children under 10 years old. This should never get rating U. There are words as ""idiot"", ""sucker"" and an idea of pets killing their owners so they can be free. I had to turn it off after 15 minutes of showing it to my 4 and 6 years olds. It is shameful that the studio approved such a plot and wording in a animation that is targeted at such a young audience.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
The secret Life of pets,"Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen.The GOOD Cute/Kid Friendly Funny Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored.But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats.And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities.THE BAD The Story Lack of Uniqueness Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale.To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is de",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
For kids only,"Illumination Entertainment started well with DESPICABLE ME and going downhill from there. They keep shoving their Minions to everything - there's a 5 min short Minions movie before the ""feature movie"". Then, their movies always try to be ""super cute"", there's something annoying about their latest movies.Previously it was DreamWorks that used to release movies with the same subject as Pixar. Now it's Illumination, coming up with a movie about animals life at the same time ZOOTOPIA comes out.This movie starts well, but quickly changes direction and goes all over the place. I completely lost interest after less than 20 min and didn't even want to keep watching it.ZOOTOPIA is, without doubt, a much better movie.Albert Brooks, who had a lead voice role in FINDING DORY this year, also has a voice role here.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Delightful and Heartwarming Animated Adventure,"""The Secret Life of Pets,"" directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, is an animated film that provides a whimsical and heartwarming peek into the lives of our beloved pets when we're not around. This movie is a delightful journey filled with humor, adventure, and a touch of heart, making it a standout in the animated genre.The voice cast is phenomenal, bringing each character to life with charm and personality. Louis C. K. voices Max, a terrier with a comfortable life that gets turned upside down, delivering a performance that's both funny and endearing. The real scene-stealer, however, is Kevin Hart as Snowball, the fluffy yet fierce bunny. Hart's energy and comedic timing are perfect for this role, making Snowball an unforgettable character.The animation is vibrant and detailed, showcasing a colorful and lively New York City from the perspective of pets. The attention to detail in the animation brings a sense of realism to the whimsical world, from the textures of the animals' fur to the bustling city streets. It's visually stunning and a real treat for the eyes.What sets ""The Secret Life of Pets"" apart is its ability to capture the quirky and amusing behaviors of pets that pet owners will immediately recognize and love. The film is filled with humorous moments that are both clever and relatable, making it enjoyable for both kids and adults. The story, while simple, is engaging and paced well, with enough twists and turns to keep the audience entertained.The film also touches on themes of friendship, loyalty, and finding one's place in the world. It's heartwarming to see how the diverse group of pets, each with their own quirks and backgrounds, come together and form an unlikely but strong bond. This underlying message adds depth to the movie and makes it more than just a comedy.The soundtrack and score complement the film beautifully, enhancing both its playful and emotional moments. Each scene is elevated by the music, which adds to the overall charm of the movie.In conclusion, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a delightful animated film that offers plenty of laughs, heart, and visual splendor. It's a film that pet lovers will particularly adore, but its universal appeal makes it a joy for all audiences. With its engaging story, lovable characters, and stunning animation, this film easily earns a 9 out of 10 rating. It's a feel-good movie that reminds us of the joy and laughter our furry friends bring into our lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uses violence to create the story line,"Here is the deal, I want you to understand that this is rated by my enjoyment of this film, which was less than I enjoyed the preview... by far. I brought my just-turned three year old daughter to see this film and wish I had been able to make a more educated decision. Throughout much of the movie the pets call each other names that my daughter has not heard used yet and talk constantly about killing someone just because they are different. I would not be as bothered if I had expected this and the film had not glossed these themes over with cute animals. These are lessons I want to teach my daughter, but not with cartoon animals that remind me of the three stooges. I would have walked out if I had not also been at the movie with family members that wanted to stay. This is the first movie my daughter has said she did not like because she was scared and she has enjoyed movies with much more logical adult themes (like the Secret of Kells where ((spoiler)) a village is pillaged by vikings). I am the type of parent that does not want my daughter watching Alvin and the Chipmunks or Power Rangers yet. I feel this movie was a mix of those two ideals, physical and annoying comedy used to catch you off guard and laugh as well as themes of violence as the only form of suspense. I would give it a 1, but I still enjoyed the exact scenes from the preview.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun and entertaining feelgood-movie,"As a huge doglover myself, I was excited to finally see this movie - especially because of all the hype, trailers and teasers that had surrounded it!The movie starts of great - dispensing loads of hilarious comedy that is sure to give some chuckles at least to those who own dogs. The characters are charming, cute, and true to the breeds of the characters. The plot was pretty straightforward and basic, somewhat relatable to lets say Toy Story; a bunch of characters set off to save their friend, they hit some roadblocks, and all is well in the end.As many other reviewers have commented, the movie is indeed a bit overhyped - I did expect a bit more, but nonetheless I am not disappointed, as the movie didn't fail to entertain and I found the characters to be awesome and hilarious.The Secret Life of Pets is probably a 10/10 for children, as nothing tragic or supersad happens - it's really an all-around feelgood movie with cute and loveable characters!8/10 - looking forward to the sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The secret life of pets,"The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Behavior patterns, movement dynamics, reactions between their interactions, make this film truly for every viewer.The photography and direction decisions are also applauded, for an animated film.

An Enjoyable Film With An Even Better Sequel,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The storyline was alright for a first instalment. There was some room for improvement. The cast selection for this film was alright. The storyline that this film reveals does not teach viewers much. There are some things that the film reveals that viewers can use in life. The connection between the cast members and their respective characters kept the film strong. It did not appear that the crew made the full effort when creating this film. This film could have been created better. This is still an alright and enjoyable film that viewers can watch but the sequel is better.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation

All you can do is keep checking your watch hoping that it will end any minute. Most certainly not worth the $50 it took for our family to go see it. If you are expecting something with strong characters like those from Zootopia, then you will be strongly disappointed as this was painful to sit through. I thought for sure I would love this movie.

Hilarity for the whole family.,"I have to admit that when I first watched this I wasn't impressed. A cute ""tiny dog"", gets a new roommate, and the two dogs hate each other so much that their walker loses them at the dog park and they have to find their way home, learning how to work together and running into a colorful cast of characters along the way. It is cute enough that I gave it another try, and am I ever glad that I did. From the psychotic sewer bunny voiced by Kevin Hart to the crazy old bloodhound voiced by Dana Carvey, the casting is spot on and every scene and line is sheer genius. From sibling rivalry to flushed pets and even metal head rocking poodles, this movie is a delight from start to finish. The kids won't get the ""adult"" jokes, mainly because there aren't many, and you will be laughing right along with them. I've actually seen this movie at least 10 times now, and I plan on watching it often. Two big thumbs up from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great premise but...,"...instead of making the most of that with original and clever ideas the movie falls into the old and tired trap with constant violent chase scenes.

Disappointing.,"I was going in with high hopes and expectations when I saw the trailers for this movie and I thought it looked pretty funny and I think Kevin Hart is hilarious in movies like Ride Along. And I heard people say that Louis CK is pretty funny and was influenced by the late great George Carlin. So I was thinking to myself ""This should be good."" So then I went with a group to see Secret Life of Pets. The film had a lot of hype and was highly anticipated, but however it didn't exactly live up to the hype. I mean, yeah there were some funny scenes in the movie, what the problem was they were already spoiled in the trailer. Now I don't mind repetition put the elements in this movie we have seen before in previous animated movies like Toy Story, one of my all time favorites since I was a child. For instance a dog being jealous of another dog taking over the household and the new dog missing his former owner. The part with the animals talking about killing their owners was inappropriate for a children's movie, especially for one like this. This movie is no way a bad film by any means but compared to other options out there like Zootopia, this movie does not offer a lot to recommend unfortunately. This became an easily forgettable film I didn't remember after a few weeks or even days. If you're an adult looking for a quality animated films give this one a skip. It's probably for the best.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The storyline was creative and exciting, and when the end of the film came, I was sad that it was all over.

"Watchable, perhaps enjoyable but certainly a mess","I watched this a while ago in cinema and it was a severe disappointment. Now, I did watch Inside Out and Zoomania earlier, so I was probably pretty spoiled and expecting another awesome animated movie but what the film delivered was really poor in my opinion.I like the idea, a movie about pets and what they do in secret when their owners are not home. What I wanted were beautiful scenes and those I did not get sadly. Illumination Entertainment tries to be funny throughout the entire film, but fails in doing so: I could hear maybe two chuckles during the entire movie, so it was not only my lack of sense of humor or a bad day, the movie is genuinely not funny. There are a lot of ""jokes"" that get repeated too many times, each time still not making anyone move a muscle in their face. Some scenes are unnecessary and make me feel like the plot (which is loose, not smooth and confusing/made no sense to me) was not enough - not like the movie is a long one anyway - and they had to fill in some random scenes. You won't feel a lot of suspense or see many memorable scenes. I kind of like how the characters develop, of course the main development being between Max and Duke, however the characters are still flat. The climax was a big letdown.You can still watch, enjoy and like this movie with your family I guess, especially if you have pets that will watch it with you :) or if you simply like the animals, but don't expect a great movie. It is a mess for me. This is of course my opinion (I like Despicable Me + 2 a lot!), but I think the ratings do go hand in hand with this feedback.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perfectly safe family fun,"One critic's review I read said ""It's a beat-for-beat ""Toy Story"""". I don't know what movie that critic watched, because I didn't think that at all. It has some similarities in the beginning, but by the 45-minute mark it becomes different enough, and it was clever. There was one scene in a sausage factory that I found particularly hilarious. The film does a great job of capturing the funny, quirky things our pets do. I laugged several times at the hijinks the animals got into, because I've had some of those expereinces myself with my pets. The villain,voiced by Kevin Hart, was one of the best parts. His craziness and over-the-top voice acting made him one of my favorite characters. The animals' love and devotion for their owners was adorable. Overall, I'd say this has been a great year for animation. I rank this up there with ""Kubo"" and ""Zootopia."" Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Probably not, but that doesn't mean it's not good. This is definetely worth checking out. My only complaint: It felt too short. I wanted more.

Pet Owners will definitely relate,"Not a Great Classic by any stretch, but SECRET LIFE OF PETS is still a pretty awesome achievement, both from a story, design, and animation point of view. There are moments in the film when you wonder how the animators pulled off scenes of such dazzling complexity, such as the one on the Brooklyn Bridge towards the end - and speaking as a 3D artist, watching the hair dynamics pf the various characters was. at times, truly jaw dropping.But the most fascinating aspect of this was how the film moves from how we see our pets to hoe they see the world. The writing is especially clever during these moments.All in all, a film I will probably watch again, simply because so much happens that you cant take it all in in one viewing.

The Secret Life of Pets Leaves Much to Be Desired,"The 2016 animated comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is directed by Chris Renaud along with Yarrow Cheney and is made by Illumination entertainment (makers of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise). The film takes place in a fictional world where animals can talk (think ""Toy Story"" but with animals) and their owners are none the wiser. Even though the films premise is extremely promising, it fails to deliver much more than adorable animals and jokes that wouldn't make a twelve-year-old laugh.Without giving away any spoilers I will say that this movie doesn't exactly head in the direction showed in the trailers. Instead it takes the much easier route of being a clichéd and mundane tale centered around these characters finding their way back home. Soon after these characters start their adventure, the plot splits into two parts. There is the story of the main protagonist and the story of his love interest. The side plot involving his love interest was absolutely horrible. This side plot takes up a good chunk of the movie, yet never once did it fail to bore. This is the biggest crime that this film commits as there was an extreme amount of potential here for a creative story. Instead what we're left with is a boring shell of what we were originally showed.Animation is definitely a strong aspect of this film. The movie is packed with vibrant and bright colors that match the goodwill tone of the film. Every character design fits that particular characters' personality. The characters are all particularly adorable, especially the bunny rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Along with Kevin Hart, the film is host to an incredible cast including Dana Carvey, Louis C.K., Ellie Kemper, and many others. These voice actors do a great job of portraying their respective characters and really bringing them to life. This is especially pertinent because of the horribly simple characters within the film. That's right, unfortunately most of these characters are one dimensional and lack any sort of character development. There is the large bumbling dog, the eccentric rabbit, the mischievous hawk, and even a fat cat. These characters never reach their full potential and are otherwise useless. Never once during the film did I resonate with a single character. In fact, even the main character comes off as unlikeable throughout the film. Thankfully however, the great voice acting in the film did help to keep me engaged in the story. Otherwise however, these characters exist only to further the plot and sell toys.Technically speaking, the direction and writing here get the job done and not much more. Many running jokes become tired after a few times on screen and most jokes not meant for seven-year old's simply fall flat. Actually most of the dialogue here only exists to further the movie and it becomes blatantly obvious after the first fifteen minutes that this is a movie geared towards children. Granted there were some genuinely sincere moments scattered throughout the film that really did connect. Unfortunately, those moments were too few and far between to make much of a difference. Surprisingly however, the soundtrack in this movie is excellent. There are several tracks from artists such as Pharrell Williams, Queen, Bill Williams and even the Beastie Boys. These tracks worked wonders for this film as the soundtrack is extremely engaging and is sure to get stuck in your head after just a few songs. Almost every time the music got turned up, the film became much more interesting.While ""The Secret Life of Pets"" was not out to break any new ground in the animation department, it still should have been a fun movie the whole family could enjoy. Instead what we're left with is an unenjoyable film that caters specifically to young children. Though the animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and character designs are great, they are not enough to save this movie from the bargain bin at your local department store. Score: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's No Minions,"I have been in two minds about whether or not to see this film. Part of me thought that this company, Illumination Entertainment, had set themselves a very high bar with any future release that they do due to the success of Despicable Me series and not forgetting everyone's favourites, The Minions. The other half was worried that maybe the best bits of the film had already been seen in the trailers. However, my Better Half really wanted to see the film. So we went.The film is set around some pets that all live in a tower block in New York City. One of the Pets, Max, has an owner who adores him and MAx is very happy with their life. Then Max's owner brings home another dog. Max isn't too chuffed about this and sets about trying to get rid of the new dog, Duke.A lot is made of this at the start of the film but to be honest this is over as soon as it is started. The main plot line evolves around them trying to find their way back home once they have been caught by the animal welfare team.So what did I think? Well...Its OK. There is some comedic moments that are fleeting and only really make you chuckle. I guess this is more for the kids and more for those that are pet owners. Personally I am not a huge fan of pets and so I don't think this film is really for me. I do think that the best bits of the comedy had already been shown in the trailers.The underground scene of the animals that had been released by their owners was an interesting twist, if not very random, I mean who has a crocodile or an aligator as a pet? It is far-fetched it is tongue in cheek, but lets be real its not meant to be realistic.Will I buy this on when released on Bluray? No I won't. Its not a film that I would watch again. Is there going to be sequels probably and hopefully, like Finding Dory, it will be better than the original.The Average Joe Film Review Blog: http://tajfr.blogspot.co.uk/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Need to keep a close eye on my dogs now,"Illumination has done it again, bringing yet another fantastic and enjoyable movie. Secret Life Of Pets is funny, cute, and adventurous, enjoyable to kids and adults alike. The film tells of a dog who loves his owner, but she gets busy in life and doesn't have much time to spend with Max (that's the dog) so Max's owner gets a new dog, Duke. Max doesn't like the dog that much, but they go on an adventure, will they ever get along and become friends? And that's all I'm gonna tell cause after all this will be a spoiler free review. So that's all I can say about this film its cute, comedy, and adventure so enjoy and God bless.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent but not great,Secret life of Pets remains a children's animation comedy. The trailers looked promising and the film was somewhat as expected. Some light bits of humor and a story with likable characters (pets) to root for. Though the story isn't that interesting and is of course predictable. Nothing too memorable in the end. A decent film for pet owners and the entire family.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie for the all family,"Im 28 and I enjoyed it a lot. Fun simple story and pretty funny movie.Pretty universal of age. Kids would enjoy and wouldn't notice some lack of the internal logic and adults would get some interruptions that kids to young to understand. Which make the target audience pretty wide, good thing in my opinion in those kind of movies.What I liked a lot in this movie is the way they portrayed the animals which was very accurate to real life, and the small silly actings of the animals. For example: dogs that doing something and then squirrel or butterfly coming around and they just forget anything else and running after them. Or the cat that you pet, then it bite you out of reflex but then lick you or getting close to you like they getting what they did was wrong because they like you but they couldn't control it.Great movie, I liked it a lot. 9/10 for me. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

whats not to love...Dogs in a cartoon doing crazy stuff. Gidget. God any man.. i mean dog would die for a girl like her.. Before I forget. Love the scene where Max runs into Katie's bathroom and switches to barking. Clever. Ok. I'm easily pleased. But let's talk about Pop's Place.. The antics of the 'PETS"" made me laugh out loud.Dogs going around in a circle smelling each other ****. Whats not to like. I loved this movie
Headbanging Poodle. Who knew.New technology has advanced the art of animation, given creaters ways to entertain that is extraordinary.But let's talk about the STAR... Yes.. You Kevin Hart.. what you did with Snowball will be remembered and loved by kid's big and small forever. Hart makes an insignificant little bunny rabbit a huge LOUD leader of the gang. And what a gang. Ricky. Come back.. I am someone who never tires of watching cartoon's. I love that the story, the characters, world can all go places that would be unbelievable in other films.

Surprisingly good,"I don't like Illumination Studios works. It is not like they are horrible I just find those things that are the focal point of those movies a miss for me. I like Gru, but I don't like minions. Sing was OK mostly for the songs. I don't remember anything about it. So I haven't watch a lot of works because I see the studio as a producer of dumb cash grabbers.And that's why I haven't watch any part of Secret Life of Pets. Though I definitely should have.I enjoyed that movie a lot. It is interesting and funny. Some animation ideas were great. I would always fell for Rabbit Villain since Hoodwinked! Not only that, all of the characters are amazing. And the story actually had a heart and moral.While watching I gradually rate it from 6 to 7 to 8 out of 10.

"Toy Story...i mean ""Pet Story""?","Let's put aside the fact that this is actually a remake of Toy Story with bits of Toy Story 2. Unlike those, this movie is extremely boring and uninteresting. The first 3 minutes are fun, and that's it.
The animation is ok, but the character models are some of the worst I have seen in an animated movie. They're gross looking. I mean, they gave them b**th0les, for god's saked.
The characters don't have any motivation, they just do things because...I guess they have to. The ""ex-pets"" stuff in the sewer is so bad. Kevin Hart as this evil bunny comes irritating, he just screams non-sense the whole time.

Disappointing,"I went to see this movie in theaters after seeing all the hype about it and it started out great but I was disappointed as the movie went on. Firstly, the story line wasn't really anything that hadn't been done before so you won't be seeing anything new. Since I'm not one who watches animated films very often (in fact this was the first I'd seen in years) I was expecting something a little different.Furthermore I found that for an animated kids movie it was quite harsh. Sure, there are plenty of others and cartoon violence isn't anything new, but I was somewhat shocked at the amount of threats the rabbit made against humans and other pets and the whole underground street gang thing surprised me for this kind of movie. I found it to be rather excessive for the message behind this movie. It would've been much better if they had just toned it down a little bit.If you're looking for a movie to watch with your kids, you can skip this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A 90 minute chase sequence bereft of originality and charm,"The Secret Life of Pets, the latest cutesy, family-friendly slice of talking-animal animation from Illumination Entertainment, feels like it was written as a result of a producer stumbling upon the 'ninja cat' video from YouTube. The trailers promised a fresh spin on the usual cartoon animal antics, with the action focusing on what our mischievous but lovable pets got up to when we leave for work every morning, whether it be inviting their neighbourhood friends round for a party, raiding our fridges for chicken and cake, or using the whisk as a vibrating scratching post. It felt like we were going to get Toy Story with cats and dogs, but what we get is a 90 minute chase sequence bereft of originality and charm.If you're not familiar with the company Illumination Entertainment, they're the ones infesting what feels like every advert, bill-board and internet video with their Minion characters, those yellow, bespectacled creatures from Despicable Me (2010) who inexplicably inspire laughter from many by simply making a noise, and inspiring children everywhere to demand their parents cough up money on merchandise. Life of Pets is so devoid of ideas that it would be more appropriate to label it an extended advertisement for a new toy range. The latest must-have toy is Max (voiced with an Average Joe twang by Louis C.K.), a Jack Russell terrier who loves his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper), but pines for her every day as she leaves him to sulk in the apartment they share.Despite spending most of his day feeling lonely, Max is perfectly happy lapping up all the attention whenever she is home, and hooking up with his friends - fat cat Chloe (Lake Bell), pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan), dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress) and budgie Sweetpea - when she isn't. However, Max's idyllic lifestyle is thrown into disarray when Katie brings home a huge, shaggy rescued stray named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). A series of events unleash Max and Duke onto the busy streets of New York, where they must dodge vicious alley cats and the always- lurking pound in a bid to get home, but instead find themselves in a kind of terrorist cell for disgruntled former pets led by the maniacal rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart). Max's disappearance alerts the smitten Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate) from across the street, who rounds up the gang for a rescue mission.If you've seen the trailers then you've already seen the best parts of the movie, for when the attention remains on the domestic quirks of the many animals on show, there are laughs and fun to be had. By taking the action outside of the home for the majority of the running time, directors Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud lose the hook, and events quickly devolve into almost every other audience- friendly animation not made by Pixar or Disney you've recently seen. Worse still, is that the many set-pieces aren't funny, with too much reliance on prat- falls and Kevin Hart's high-pitched squealing to generate any laughs. It's all just noise and colour and no heart, with only Slate's husky- voiced spunkiness and Albert Brooks' slightly unsettling eagle Tiberius managing to inject any life into their characters. It does little but reinforce just how good Disney's Zootopia was, and remind us how Illumination's priorities lie with how much cash is lining its pocket.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very well done, but not for me","Pet movies are cute, and so is this. This has many funny moments of what pets might do or think when humans are away, but that's it. The idea is original and I waited more, but it is far from classics like Oliver and company or Aristocats or other animated animal movies. Kind of fell flat after the mid-point and I soon lost interest, but did watch it till the end.

"Though it's visual gags and side characters are good, it's main characters and Toy Story-plot make The Secret Life of Pets a bad dog","I was having dinner with my parents the other night where a plate of hamburgers suddenly disappeared. Seven beef patties vanished as we were getting other side dishes ready to go. What makes it harder to grasp is that it was in the middle of a round table, so we first tied to see where they went. Once our large Rottweiler Zoey came into the living room, we noticed that standing on her hind legs, she could have been tall enough to reach the burgers. While I have no video evidence and no one saw her, we all suspected she must have gotten to the table when we kept our eyes away while she had herself a feat.There's a funny dynamic on how much people will associate animals with thoughts that are just as human as their owners. I'd be lying if I said that I never had my dog with me if I was watching a comedy, hoping that my animal could understand the jokes I was laughing at. With today's movie, voices are given to common pets, even though we've seen plenty of talking animal movies before. The Secret Life of Pets explores the thoughts of our pets and what they do when were away.In the heart of New York in a high rise lives a young woman named Kate who cares plenty for her Jack Russell terrier, Max (played by Louis C.K.). He spends a lot of his time simply waiting for his owner to come home, but does communicate with other pets including a fat cat Chloe, a pug Mel, and a dachshund Buddy. When Katie returns, she also brings in a large Newfoundland that's named Duke (played by Eric Stonestreet). Though they are told to be brothers, Max immediately takes charge as the alpha dog to show whose boss.The next day, Both Man and Duke get separated from their building's dog walker and start wandering the streets. Not only do they loose their collars to a deranged Sphinx cat Ozone (played by Steve Coogan), but they end up being taken by dog catchers. Before the truck can get to the pound, Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit Snowball (played by Kevin Hart). Their taken underground where Snowball reveals his team of other abandoned animals who are hoping to take revenge against humans. Meanwhile, a Pomeranian dog Gidget (played by Jenny Slate) is organizing a search team to find Max and Duke before their owners get home.As a pet owner myself, I thought that this would be very good. Illumination Animation (The Lorax, Despicable Me, Minions) has a talent of imposing classic slapstick into their stories. There were plenty of moments that I laughed when I was reminded of stunt that seemed like something out of a Looney Tunes short. The visual gags were one thing, but Illumination is not that skilled at writing. The big problem is that The Secret Life of Pets feels like a beat-for-beat dog version of Toy Story. You can identify the same structure of the buddy story of the two that don't like each other, but are working to get home; It's Toy Story.How are the characters? What's odd was that while I got into the side stories of Gidget and Snowball, it's actually the main characters that really bland and uninteresting. I cannot remember a single line from a shockingly stale Louis C.K. whose working with a script that gives him little to do except make dog jokes. Truth to be told, the biggest character is the animation, which looks nice and gives a fantasy-like of New York City while making it feel big.I'll give this five Maxs out of five. The Secret Life of Pets is a movie that was made for kids (I'd say eleven and under). I didn't laugh much, but my full theater had kids and families that seemed happy. While it wouldn't be my first choice to show children, this will probably seem fine if you just want something for them to watch for an hour and a half. Pet people just might want to take their leashes and frisbees somewhere else.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Toy Story, but with Pets and not Good","The Secret Life of Pets is the latest Illumination Entertainment film to release and tells the story of Max, a seemingly ordinary dog, who is forced to deal with the a new addition to his family. The film features to the likeness of Louie C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart and many others. The marketing to this film was excellent and featured a well put together trailer montage of different pets doing things while their owners are gone, the trailer was sweet and funny and though it didn't hint too much at what the story may be it kept be interested and excited for the release of the film. Sadly the final product is not as good as the marketing was, the best and funniest parts in this movie were the scenes already shown in that initial trailer. The beginning of the film starts off very strong, but as it continues rolling along it loses steam and delves into a story that is too big and too complex for its own good, featuring the underbelly of New York and its gang of abandoned pets, that just felt stupid and out of place. My reaction to this may be due to my expectations that film would remain in the real world, by having these pets get into everyday problematic situations but it goes for an approach that I didn't necessarily dig and honestly kind of lost me. I do appreciate what the writers were going for as on paper the story itself is pretty good but it just didn't translate well to film and at the end of the day just came off as a Toy Story rip off. This still isn't the worst animated film in the world, as it did have jokes sprinkled throughout that made me laugh, it just had so much potential that it sadly never lived up to. Also the animation itself felt lazy and the voice acting not extravagant considering the amount of talent this movie featured. In the end, this is just an okay animation that'll entertain young kids, I can't really hate on it too much considering how great the opening 15-20 minutes are, it's just a shame the rest of the movie maintained that greatness, The Secret Life of Pets gets a 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Technically complete but lacking in genuine humour,"The interviews that come with the DVD are telling in the creators talk about working through a 'idea' about what pets might do when the owners go out for the day. It's a interesting idea perhaps but not really enough to carry a feature length movie. Maybe they all act like humans? It's not exactly spell-binding. OK its fun and in YouTube sized morsels it plays very well and should be a hit for younger kids. Quality animations should be good enough to carry grown-ups. Good animated films in my book all have a hook or two that ground the story in real i.e. human world reality, society or psychology and play on that - for instance the fun & intelligent Inside Out, or deliver charisma & charm like the character Rango. Zootropolis has a few great characters. The narrative in Secret Lives of Pets is lame and inconsequential, and the seminal 'idea' lost the intrigue for me early on. This is well-rendered and colorful, credit to the production craft team, but also sadly carried a major deficit in humour and empathy. Best left on repeat in a nursery room.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

What Utter Dross!,"Pros:
1. The end montage, which shows how much pets mean to humans and the joy and companionship they provide, is suitably heart-warming for anybody that owns a pet.2. Kevin Hart (Snowball) delivers a typical Kevin Hart performance, but at least he brings some life to a somewhat dull movie.Cons:
1. Hannibal Buress (Buddy) and Bobby Moynihan (Mel) give really weak and stale voice acting performances.2. The soundtrack is utterly boring and lifeless.3. Somehow the pets know how to use appliances that would require more brainpower than they possess, or appliances that they shouldn't be physically able to use.4. There are far too many characters introduced. Most of them are given barely anything, or nothing at all, to do.5. The comedy is unbelievably stale as it mostly relies on Kevin Hart shouting things at the top of his voice.6. The film title, in addition to the beginning of the movie, promises to look into what pets might get into whilst their owners are away. However, it quickly devolves into a recycled plot of animals getting lost in a foreign place, and them setting out on a journey to get back home. It's essentially a domesticated rendition of Finding Nemo (2003), Madagascar (2005), The Wild (2006), and Bolt (2008).7. There's a somewhat strange sub-plot of discarded pets forming a rebellion against humans that doesn't actually go anywhere. They should have spent more time on the discarded pets storyline.8. Max (Louis C. K.) is thoroughly unlikeable even though he's the protagonist.

"Goofy with fun characters, but a stale story","Animated films changed forever when Pixar's ""Toy Story"" showed us what are toys are up to when we're not around. More than 20 years later, that tradition of storytelling continues in Illumination Entertainment's ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" which applies the same concept to house pets (and who doesn't love talking animals). This ""unseen world,"" however, has half the wit and imagination.Animation storytellers have done an incredible job building intricate worlds in the same way sci-fi geniuses do, and the potential is certainly there for ""Secret Life of Pets."" This has yet to be Illumination's calling card, however. The ""Despicable Me"" films succeeded on clever slapstick and delightful characters. ""Pets"" has plenty of that to offer, but it runs out of steam after a point.""Pets"" follows Manhattan pup Max (Louis C.K.) whose life with owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) is turned upside-down when Katie brings home a big, clumsy rescue dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The resentful Max tries to get Duke in trouble, and their cruel back-and-forth schemes result in both getting lost in the concrete jungle and in danger from a group of stray, abandoned animals.Other than pointing out the similarities to the Woody-Buzz conflict in ""Toy Story,"" I won't make any more comparisons, but the point is that the originality is sorely lacking. Some jokes contrasting real- life animal behaviors to personified animal behaviors stand out, like Chloe the lazy cat (Lake Bell) going ballistic when she sees a laser pointer – being wielded by fellow animals. Then there are the dogs in the park who make fun of an owner using a fetching stick. Writers Cinco Paul and Ken Dario of the ""Despicable Me"" films, and Brian Lynch, play with that range of humor really well, but aren't able to channel that creative energy into the plot.The Max-Duke saga has a forgone conclusion from the very start, and the points along the way are not all that surprising aside from an incredibly strange diversion to a sausage factory. ""Pets"" redeems itself with its assortment of characters, some archetypal and some that defy expectation.Jenny Slate's Gidget is one of the bigger hits; she plays a poodle with a crush on Max who rallies the neighborhood pets to find and save him, a subplot that's decidedly more interesting than the danger Max and Duke are in. Her relationship with a hawk voiced by Albert Brooks is refreshingly unusual, and Dana Carvey's Pops is one of few characters that keep us on our toes. Kevin Hart's cute-but- nasty bunny, Snowball, appears to be subversive of typical animated characters, but ultimately ends up being a token character in disguise. All in all, the interest level in ""Pets"" buoys based on which characters are on screen.Illumination has a lot of work to do if it wants to enter the Pixar/Disney/DreamWorks echelon in more than just the box office sense. Its movies are fun and amusing, but everything that happens in ""Pets"" feels familiar and done three times before (like animals driving cars, which we saw not even a month earlier in ""Finding Dory""). I have no issues with their films that knowingly stick to goofiness – nor with the ways this one does; they do it so well. But the premise of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" suggested something grander in style and scope that simply isn't there, and the story ultimately disappoints.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Most modern children's movies do have a few scary scenes with mean characters but are otherwise light and entertaining.

The animation is probably one of the best Illumination efforts in a while, and while the story and characters aren't very memorable, it just struck the right chords to be enjoyable.

Funny Start... but PAINFUL middle and angry bunny damages film overall,"The first 20 minutes where we get to meet the characters (pets) and their families has some excellent writing and funny animal to human relations insights. The characters and story start off great and Louis CK strikes the perfect balance of the main dog voice. However, the film ""jumps the shark"" with the introduction of the absurd set of angry and fake characters with Kevin Hart's Snowball bunny. Snowball is angry, mean, and a total distraction. Terrible writing and direction here. These characters hate humans and have evil and totally unfunny intentions. Without this unwatchable middle section of angry and mean pets, the film has a great vibe and worth a watch. I've seen it about 100 times because our 4-year old loves the beginning and ending.
