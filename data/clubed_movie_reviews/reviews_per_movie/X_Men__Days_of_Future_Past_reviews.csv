X-Men: The BEST ONE,"By brilliantly combining the original cast and our new first class crew, all while telling a classic comic book storyline and giving it JUSTICE. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" gives us everything we love about this franchise and more, with great performances all around and giving us a magnificent hybrid conclusion/beginning that sets the stage for what's yet to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite X-Men!,"I don't want to give much away, but of all of the X-Men ever made, this is one of my favorites!The additional cast was concerning, but overall actually added to this film.Of course the rest of the usual cast were on point as usual, but what made this movie different than the others, was not the battle of good vs evil, but the timeline differences and the new cast's involvement.A great addition to the X-Men franchise, and a 9/10 from me!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is what movies are about.,Days of future Past in my opinion reigns as one of the greatest movies of all time.I said this immediately after seeing the film I say this now years later 8.0 and climbing.This is an epic adventure you will be on the edge of your seat it's storytelling at its best a complete sinematic master piece.Just go see it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The perfect blend between character-driven drama and fun, edge-of-your-seat spectacle!","I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves).What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A stunning achievement – a blockbuster movie packed with at least as much heart as spectacle.,"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
constructed well to connect old cast with the new,"In the future, the world is devastated by constant war. Sentinels are robots created to hunt mutants. Xavier and Magneto team up with a plan to change history. Kitty Pryde sends Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) 50 years into the past to 1973. He has to find Xavier (James McAvoy), free Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and recruit them in a mission to stop the Sentinel program before it starts. They have to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who tries to kill weapons designer Trask (Peter Dinklage).This is a compelling sci-fi thriller achieving one of the most seamless transition from an old cast to the new. The story is terrific. It introduces Quicksilver as a fresh injection of fun. That's probably the only minor complaint. It needs a bit more fun to offset the serious tones. It's not really a complaint. OK! Forget about it. The new cast is set to take off in place of the old.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not only the best of the X-Men films since X2, but manages to be even better","The first X-Men was a good, fun, well-made start to the series, though with a yet-to-find-its-feet feel. That was found with X2, which turned out to be bigger, darker and even better. X-Men The Last Stand I didn't find quite as terrible as its reputed to be but it was very disappointing and a big step-down, it had its moments like the visuals, some good performances and the action but suffered from too much going on, a script that was sorely lacking and too many characters that were largely underdeveloped and out of character. X Men Origins: Wolverine was just as disappointing and with very similar pros and cons to The Last Stand. The Wolverine was a definite improvement but still had a fair share of flaws. And First Class was excellent. I was hugely excited for Days of Future Past because the cast is such a good one and the return of Bryan Singer promised much. And Days of Future Past didn't disappoint at all. It is a visually very stylish film that has an even darker and more audacious feel than the rest of the films in the series, the special effects are of great quality and everything looks very slick. The score is the best since the one for X2 in terms of memorability and how it fits and the script is the sharpest since X2 as well and is probably the best and most well-balanced script of all the X-Men films put together. There's a bit of humour that is subtle and genuinely funny, not feeling overly-broad or overkill, while there are plenty of suspenseful and emotional parts. Bryan Singer makes a triumphant come-back, the action sequences really thrill especially the battle between past and future X-Men to stop annihilation while the drama resonates. Great also was the quietly powerful tete-a-tete between the two Xaviers. There is a fair bit going on and there are a lot of characters, but the solid pacing, chemistry between the characters/actors and how well everything's balanced in the writing makes the story thrilling yet with plenty of space to allow you to feel emotion, and for the amount of characters there are here a vast majority of the characters have real personality and soul(plus they're treated with respect), something which Last Stand and Origins did not do. The cast are spot on, Hugh Jackman is grizzled and charismatic while bringing the subdued quality he brought to The Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence is surprisingly good as Mystique(blue is definitely not the warmest colour with her), the transformation sequences are as eye-popping as they were in X2. James McAvoy gives one of his better performances here and Michael Fassbender is suave and calculating. As the older versions of Professor X and Magneto, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen make a welcome return, Stewart is cool and McKellen is menacing yet with a sympathetic quality, Magneto is much more than a one-dimensional villain(a mistake Last Stand made and that the first two films did not). Evan Peters is excellent too as Quicksilver, like how Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler almost stole the show in X2 Peters' Quicksilver almost did here, a definite scene stealer. Nicholas Hoult is fine as Beast and is very well made-up, but Kelsey Grammar for me was a touch better, and Halle Berry gives her, by far, best performance of the series(the only time she really made an impression as Storm, who's also developed best). My only complaint for Days of Future Past is the cop-out ending(outside of the action), other than that it was a brilliant film that was not only the best X-Men film since the second but a big contender for the best of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men DOFP is the best blockbuster of 2014,"The X-Men franchise has set itself apart, among the gluttonous crop of superhero movies in recent years. After seven films, the characters are very familiar to us, and the latest installment is arguably the best yet, with its predecessor as the only other contender for that title. This is vastly better than the two stand-alone Wolverine films.This movie wastes no time, putting us right in the action from the opening credits. The storyline is complex and frankly doesn't make an enormous amount of sense, but with a modest disbelief suspension makes for an entertaining couple of hours. It's also a decent science-fiction film in its own right.The all-star cast does a satisfactory job. (I'm not really convinced by Jennifer Lawrence, sorry.) It's satisfying to have so many characters, which was a hallmark of the comic book series. We could easily be experiencing this story in the pages of a Marvel mag.The film stumbles a bit when it begins to fall into the blockbuster trap of trying to pack in too many spectacular scenes. On the other hand, the musical score is far less obnoxious than we've been hearing in other recent Hollywood movies.I was surprised to learn this was directed by the same person who helmed ""Superman Returns"". I thought that film was a disaster. So he seems to have evolved in his artistic skill.These new X-Men movies demonstrate how to convincingly make prequels, in contrast to some other blockbuster franchises. One wonders why they gave the coveted Star Wars sequel to JJ Abrams when there are clearly better directors in the business.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best xmen movie ever,"I still remember I had watched enough movies one can watch in 2,3 months and can gets bored from movies but when I watched this movie I didn't feel bored for a minute. It was a great movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Saving The Future,"The timeline of the X-Men movie franchise has been troubling ever since the supposedly conclusion of the series, X-Men: The Last Stand. The studio continues to make more of these by telling each of the mutants' origin stories, but it wasn't quite a success due to leading to a grope of making two awful Wolverine movies and a main prequel that doesn't know where to go afterwards. A solution to fix this is simply time-travel. With all the space time continuum and stuff, it finally has the chance to amend the universe and unhappen the unwanted events of the last movies. In that way, X-Men: Days of Future Past triumphs. The movie itself does need to be a little economical in its exposition, but as a blockbuster it is quite a solid entertainment.The plot isn't actually a big of an adventure as it sounds. This fact may blind the audience by the vast amount of references from the past films, astounding action scenes, and extended character work. Take all of that away, you'll just get a breezy little mission that just walks in to historic periods and places. Not saying this is a bad thing; the action scenes are in fact a huge benefit of providing real momentum, and the pathos of the main characters are also worth exploring. It's a real joy just seeing these mutants get back together again. But the weakness here is it's too drawn to nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, it is fun remembering the best parts of the old X-Men, and as a time travel movie, this is absolutely essential, but only few become helpful to the plot. The rest of them is just a fan service which doesn't always elevate the overall story.Then again, the real pleasures are the basic appeal of the series. Most X-Men movies are usually more focused on Wolverine than anyone else, and this sequel might do the same. Surprisingly, it was able to juxtapose each of the major character's arc. The young Professor X and Mystique remain the most intriguing among, the script doesn't always give enough detail to it, but their actors bring the gravity they deserve. The action, once again, is pretty well done. Besides of the future scenes, it provides more than just explosions. There is a real direction going on to these sequences and the camera perfectly shows its every action which makes it totally entertaining.X-Men: Days of Future Past stands as perfect as a fan service. What exactly matters in this installment is to erase what was messed up by the last few movies by taking the concept of time-travel, butterfly effect, etc. The whole film is still too burdened by the past which sometimes hinders the plot, it would have been a much compelling movie if it goes deeper within its intriguing subtext. In the end, the film still succeeds in their goal, and it is a simple one which comic book fans will definitely appreciate. Therefore congratulations, this sequel just saved this franchise's future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men,"Seamlessly blending old and new elements of the franchise together in one delightful package, X-Men: Days of Future Past combines emotional drama, exhilarating action, and surprising humor to create a wholly satisfying experience that ranks among the finest in the franchise.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not only is it the best X-Men movie, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made....","X-Men: Days Of Future Past' serves as a sequel to both 'X-Men: First Class' (which is excellent) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (which is pretty bad). Now, I used to be a pretty big X-Men fan a few years ago, but after the disappointments of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I kind of just stopped caring about the franchise, even though the subsequent two movies were actually very good (the aforementioned 'X-Men: First Class' and then 'The Wolverine'). That being said, I was still looking forward to 'Days Of Future Past', what with it being the return of the old 'X-Men' crew, and I was also moderately familiar with the 'Days Of Future Past' comic. I was just expecting it to be good though, but it turns out not only is 'Days Of Future Past' the best X-Men movie yet, it's also one of the best comic-book movies ever made.In 'Days Of Future Past', the X-Men of the future are facing extinction due to the sentinels which threaten to wipe them all out. They send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must recruit Professor X, Magneto and Mystique in order to change the course of history so that the X-Men may survive.First things first, this is a time travel movie, and time travel movies normally either go very well or very badly. 'Days Of Future Past' marks an occasion where it goes very well, as the time travel logic in this movie is very well thought out and makes perfect sense, I can't pick any holes in it. This movie even manages to validate 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which is something that I thought could never be done. It even feels weird just saying that, because righting the wrongs that those movies made is a huge, monumental task, yet this movie pulls it off perfectly.For a movie that's crowded with so many characters, it's surprising that all of the characters included feel meaningful and aren't shoehorned in. We have Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, and there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said. He is Wolverine, the role is made for him and he absolutely owns it. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr respectively, their characters have an amazing relationship and the two of them are just phenomenal at pulling it off. We also have the future X-Men cast with the like of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Ellen Page, and while they have a lot less screen time they're still great. I was surprised at how prominent a role Jennifer Lawrence had as Mystique, over the past few months I've had a growing dislike towards Jennifer Lawrence but I can't deny that she is great in this role. Then we have all of the new characters, like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), all of whom are great. But there is one new character who is greater than all, and that character is Quicksilver.Quicksilver in this movie is perfect. In fact, it's worth seeing this movie just for him. He doesn't have a huge amount of screen time and it comes fairly early on in the movie, but he is the best part of this film by far. There is one particular sequence with him in a kitchen, and it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The visuals in the scene are gorgeous, the music is perfect, and it's both hilarious and stunning. The way that Quicksilver's super speed effect has been done is amazing. Some people thought the costume looked goofy, but I think it works perfectly well considering the time period and the personality of the character. I've been a big fan of Evan Peters for a while, and he is great in the role, he is very entertaining and has a great screen presence. I never thought I'd be saying this, but I doubt Marvel will be able to produce a better Quicksilver in 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' than the one that's on display here.But you know what I think all this great quality comes down to? Bryan Singer. I'm pretty sure Bryan Singer is just the perfect X-Men director. Even though up until now I thought 'X-Men: First Class' was the best of the X-Men franchise, it didn't really feel like the X-Men in the way that 'X-Men' and 'X2′ did. 'Days Of Future Past' nails that X-Men dynamic while still being an exceptionally good movie. Part of that X-Men dynamic comes from John Ottman's amazing score, as it's so good to finally hear his X-Men theme again.The action scenes are incredible, especially the opening one which uses some of the new mutant powers phenomenally, especially Blink's. The movie is very well paced, I never grew bored and I didn't want it to end.'Days Of Future Past' also surprisingly has a lot of very funny humour in it, but it's not humour that's just forced in for the sake of it, it all feel natural and within the confines of these characters. This film nails the comic book movie aspect; it has a plot which is clearly very serious yet it is still silly enough to remain a comic book film, unlike movies like 'Man Of Steel' and 'The Dark Knight' which go so dark that they just completely ditch the comic book aspect. There are also a few nice references that fans of the comics will get, which is just a small example of the great fan service this movie does for readers of the 'X-Men' comics.'Days Of Future Past' made me remember why I was such a big X-Men fan. It rekindled my love for the characters and story lines, and like I said above, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"Review By Kamal KQuite possibly the best of the X-Men franchise, both original and prequel reboots. The acting was amazing for a Sci-fi movie. James McAvoy's performance here was really good. The McAvoy/Stewart scene was pretty epic. I wish this was the last of the X-Men movies cause it was such a great bookend...but sadly they made more...crappy ones. Fight scenes were very good. Showcasing different powers were done well. Seeing the old X-men was very nostalgic and seeing their fates at the end was very heartbreaking if you ever watched the previous movies before the prequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Superb, Even for Those of Us Who Are a Little in the Dark","I've seen them all because my son and I like to go to these big movies. Every time one comes out, I've forgotten who's who and what's what. This is of a different generation. What I see here is masterful storytelling, dynamic characters whose purpose isn't just to beat to a pulp or incinerate their opponents, but a culture that has developed around mutations at war with the people for whom they are saviors. Time travel can be quite touchy and this needs to be treated with kid gloves. The story begins in the present where things have gone badly for the recurring characters and their ilk. A race of killer robots has been launched against them and it becomes necessary for them to find a way to mutate time in order to prevent the killing of a man who has used the DNA a of Mystique to create these devils. Wolverine is chosen to go back because he is the one most capable of withstanding the perils of the trip. He must get a group the mutants to act on faith since they have no idea who he is. So much has been written, so what I will say that what follows is an amazing series of scenes filled with tension, humor, and clever intricacies of plot. There is a scene where a football stadium is uprooted and brought down around the White House (Nixon's White House) and used a prison enclosure. I will leave the long dramatic explanations of events to others. I really enjoyed this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb In Every Way!,"Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of most alleged blockbusters.This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any X-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly hit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to behold. The cast-selection is still perfect.Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A new kind of super heroes movies (sorry for English mistakes),"As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true).Anyway, after seeing it, with 2500 X-Men fan in Paris, I was divided. In fact, I expected something else entirely. There is some plot holes, monotonous parts However, after thought a lot about it, I have to say that is a masterpiece in super heroes' movies. Why? Because it is very different from what we see today, we are not waiting for a finale with explosions, characters just keep moving so the finale do not overdo it but is still very impressive visually. Plus, this movie is very human paradoxically: it speaks about usual mutants themes, but the very point of the movie is can we change, whether it be the past or our vision of the present. The intelligence of the movie is not to focus on changing the past but on writing the present.But the most important thing that makes this movie great is that Bryan Singer loves this franchise and more than making a great blockbuster, he wanted to make a great movie relying on the characters. He was convinced of making the best movie ever and even if it is not the case, I felt it, so despite all is defaults, X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST is a great movie, maybe, one of the best super-hero movies ever made.I advise you to stay till the end of the credits, the scene is just awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Days of future past vs what I expected it to be like.,"I expected a lot after reading the reviews and watching the trailers and all but from the minute the movie started I knew that I had been tricked.First of all the beginning of this movie wasn't as great as the beginning of first class. Due to this weak start my expectations for the rest of the movie lowered. A film like this needs a good beginning, which I thought the dark knight movies gave us. Days of future past gives us a very messy start and one might find it hard to concentrate or to watch the beginning because there was too much happening everywhere all together. There's something happening here then something else happens there and then we completely forget what just happened before that.The acting was OK, but the directing was bad. Mostly because it's not possible to see most parts because it's really really dark. I do understand that they've done that on purpose as to show the darkness that there living in but seriously couldn't they make it just a little bit less darker. Also the slow motion, I loved the slow motion in the beginning half of the film. That part was breathtaking and it was one of my favorite parts of the entire movie ( of course I mean the pentagon part). But as you go more and more into the movie you can realize that almost half of the movie is in slow motion, some of it unnecessary.The story was OK. It wasn't thought through well. Firstly it didn't make much sense. The story at the beginning half made it look like the story could have a really good prestige like, shocking ending but ended weirdly and not making sense at all. I have no idea how they are going to make a sequel for this with that ending. If they do make a sequel , I don't think it will have a lot to do with this. Also some parts of the movie were slow making it a bit boring.I really preferred first class in all ways ( this didn't even have any humor at all.) anyways it was watchable but not what you might expect it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men Days of Future Past,"Talk about a rise and fall and rebirth of a franchise. If you're around my age than the big superhero franchises that we soaked in were the Raimi's Spider-Man films, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and of course the X-Men movies. Overall, I can honestly say that I really love this series. Origins: Wolverine, is certainly a low point and while The Last Stand was no where near the awesomeness and greatness that was Bryan Singer's first 2 films, it's still a fairly entertaining action movie. First Class was (before yesterday) my favorite X-Men movie, and even THE Wolverine was an awesome and gritty and much needed different take on an X-Men story. I literally grew up with this movie franchise, so I guess you can say I was extremely hyped when I sat down in the theater for DOFP.You start off with a Terminator like intro, the first 10 minutes of this movie had some of the strongest and haunting scenes I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Humans AND mutants are on a losing side of a tragic war against the genocidal, Sentinels. A group of X-Men, led by Patrick Stewart's, Prof. X and Ian McKellen's, Magneto. They have a last hope idea of sending someone back to the point in time, where these Sentinel's were created. With his ability to heal and agelessness, Wolverine offers his services to travel back to 1972, to try to reunite the torn friendship between young Magneto and Prof. X, and band together to prevent this horrible war from happening.My god, what a rush this movie was. I don't think I had this sense of wonder watching a comic book movie since The Dark Knight Rises premiered. The eerie opening got me by surprise, but it worked. It perfectly showed us the audience, just how serious and catastrophic this battle with The Sentinels is. So from the start I'm hooked, then we get into this crazy plan hatched up that sends Wolverine to the 70's and get a bit more lighter, but then we see James McAvoy in a terrific performance as young and troubled Charles Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence being as hot and more bad ass than ever as Mystique, and of course Michael Fassbender as the multi-layered Magneto. Everyone's performance in this movie was utilized so good. Oscar winner Halle Berry has minimal dialog, but her presence was felt, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, and Evan Peters all aren't front and center a lot, but they give it their all every minute they're on screen, which makes the dramatic tension so powerful especially when you see certain characters die or get injured. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine as usual, but in a different way, as opposed to past films. Here, Wolverine is a much more centered guy, who really wants to help everyone. He even agrees to think happy thoughts to keep his mind from bursting by traveling through space-time.You would think a movie THIS packed with story, characters, and action, that'd the movie would get lost and tumble over it's own weight and I can't tell you happy I am that it doesn't. You're never once lost as to what's going on, what needs to be done, and how everything got to where it is. The story is played out rather well. Each character and actor has the perfect amount of screen time for what it is their character's are needed for. Quicksilver is a perfect example, he stole every scene he was in, and while he's here and gone pretty swiftly, it gives other more important characters their time to shine. You gotta give it up to the writers and the absolutely terrific direction of Mr. Bryan Singer.Just hearing the X-Men theme song playing during the begging made my eyes tear, this movie really brought the X-Men back to greatness. The special effects were spot on, my favorite scene even outshining the big stadium scene was, Quicksilver's kitchen run. The combination of music, humor, effects, and practical effects worked to summer blockbuster perfection. The design on the Sentinel's were OK, I wasn't blown away by them as they reminded me a lot of the giant robot guard from the first Thor movie. The setting of 1970's Washington makes for some pretty nice looking sets and sequences and the future scenes were awesome. The action is filmed so well and the powers of the mutants make the action just the kind of jaw dropping eye candy I've been wanting.This is one of the best movie I've seen all year, it may have even beaten out Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my favorite comic book movie of the year. The action, acting, and story are exceeded my expectations. I really believe the hype and I see why people are rushing back for another viewing, this is a fantastic movie and I give it my highest recommendation. This movie was a Cineadventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As good as it was at the end of X2,"After Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class (2011) injected a bit of life back into the X-Men franchise, any further instalments faced the headache of what to do with a bunch of fantastic actors playing the same characters decades apart. Inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X- Men comic of the same name, Days of Future Past switches between a nightmarish, dystopian future overrun by giant sentinels, and the boogie nights of the 1970's. We get the best of both worlds, and thankfully, in his seventh appearance over the course of 14 years as his most recognisable character, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine inhabits them both.After narrowly escaping a sentinel attack in the near-future, a band of mutants including the returning Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) meet up with Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Magento (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry) et al to hatch a plan before the next inevitable attack. Kitty transfers the mind of Wolverine back to 1973, where a young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is soon to assassinate Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), setting off a chain of events that could result in the apocalypse. The only problem is, the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is depressed and mansion-bound, still struggling to deal with his powers and the loss of the use of his legs. They also need to help of Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who is imprisoned in a plastic cell for allegedly assassinating John F. Kennedy.For all it's time-travelling gobbledegook, Days of Future Past doesn't spend too much time trying to explain the mechanics behind it. Like Rian Johnson's mind-bending Looper (2012), it recognises the folly in attempting to spell it out for you. When you look at it under a microscope, time-travel makes little sense in movies as it is, so it's best to accept what you're seeing and move on. McAvoy's Xavier even dismisses Wolverine's ramblings as 'future-s***e'. This frees up more time in an already packed movie to concentrate on the damaged Xavier, brought to life by another fantastic performance from McAvoy. If First Class was Magneto's origins, this is Professor X's, showing a scared, conflicted and broken man and how he became the father to mutants he is when embodied by Patrick Stewart.Of all the many mutants on show, some are not given as much time as their name would suggest. Storm, Anna Paquin's Rogue, and most notably, Ian McKellen's Magneto are somewhat left out to dry, while Nicholas Hoult's Beast, Kitty Pride, and a first appearance for Evan Peters' Quicksilver, are more prominent, and thrive in their larger roles. Trask, a rather fascinating villain thanks to the performance of Dinklage, is left undeveloped. We glimpse into his mind and ambitions, but there's little clarity given to his motivation. But with a film this packed with characters, it would take four hours or more to explore them all, and some inspired set-pieces pepper the film at the points where you start to think the plot will make your head explode. The (possibly) plot-hole laden climax aside, it seems like the franchise is as good as it was at the end of X2 (2003), seemingly serving to delete all the poor decisions made in returning director Bryan Singer's absence.

A Visually Stunning And Exhilarating Flick,"2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best of all xmen movies,"simply said it was well directed and well acted with good pacing,great cgi effects and epic soundtrack. what more can you expect from a superhero movie? X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except wolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all star movie with a good director (everything not related to professionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least a decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really surpassed my expectation.I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It already had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by professor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I didn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that annoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very well. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes put me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was appropriate and subtle,just what I like.They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie doesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always about fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always about self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great Xmen movie,"The Parisian premiere was yesterday and therefore, I actually did see the movie and let me tell you this: all the waiting and fuss around this movie is well worth it and well deserved. It is a great movie, easily relatable in many ways.I won't say a word about the acting. When you have established actors such as McAvoy — who repeatedly stole the screen with his heart-clenching performance — and Fassbender, along with their older 'counterparts' — McKellen and Stewart — you are in for a treat when it comes to the acting performance itself. No surprise there.This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes — much like Marvel's latest movies — are still very relevant in the world today. You will see that yourself.The movie is action packed. There is no irrelevant scenes — I tend to judge movies by the ratio of irrelevant scenes per minute in it — and there is no break between action scenes and more emotional, storyline scenes. You won't be bored.But along with the action, and the acting, there is also the usual dose of humor found in most Marvel movies, without being out of place and without cutting the pace of the movie in itself. There, Hugh Jackman will provide you with a few laughs, or at least, will bring a smile to your face.The cinematography in itself was excellent. Excellent use of the 3D. Great camera work — at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D.So, why not 10 out of 10 then? Because of the score. If the soundtrack was good, it didn't match what I got used to with the recent Marvel movies. Good score but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe it was because we were all more focused on the fast-paced action scenes and the storyline in itself rather than whatever was playing behind. I might need to go back and watch it again once it's out for general public to really appreciate the little details that I might have missed in a cinema filled with excited fans.But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. A good movie. A great Xmen movie. Full of Easter eggs for more hardcore fans as well. The waiting was worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bryan Singer's magic flourishes on screen..... X men beats everything else!!!!!!,"OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again.Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie. Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole movie.Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits together in a wondrous puzzle.So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form. Even the soundtrack is fitting.Happy watching !!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groovy Sequel,"Groovy sequel to ""X Men: First Class"" set about ten years later in the 1970s. Cue self-reverential period costumes, decor, and references (like lava lamps) that keeps the film cheeky. Some cheek is needed as a break from the mopey characters played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. And fans of Hugh Jackman's butt will be pleased to hear that it makes an appearance in this film, as does his hirsute chest (many times), making up for the fact that Wolverine had only a brief cameo in the first film.""X Men: Days of Future Past"" has probably the best special effects yet in the series, so no wonder it received an Oscar nomination in that category. My favorite set piece was probably the one where the mutant kid who can run really fast freezes time and we see him rearrange an action shot mid-frame so that a bunch of bullets that otherwise would have killed our main characters end up missing their targets.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Fun,"I watched X-Men: Days of Future Past in the cinema in 2D as a conclusion of a 7 day mutant movie marathon. Yes, that's 7 says of watching X-Men movies – one per day. That's quite a tall order for myself seeing as though I was never really into the movies (loved the 90's cartoon though) and I must say I was pretty burnt out by the time the end credits started rolling for The Wolverine. Being dragged along to the film this weekend meant I had to watch/re-watch all the previous installments which I'll admit is not something I had fun doing.The first two films were very important for comic book movies. Along with Spiderman 1 and 2 they paved the way for the current superhero crave. I somewhat enjoyed them on my recap whilst acknowledging that they are children's movies, meaning I had to adjust my mentality whilst watching. The third had potential but was ultimately disappointing due to a number of creative decision. First Class was a much better effort with an exceptional cast – it felt fresh and reignited the franchise.Don't get me started on the Wolverine movies.The first thing you'd notice about Days of Future Past is who's in it. You have the likes of Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, Ellen Page, Patrick Stewart and Shawn Ashmore. Whoa. That's a roster that would make Wes Anderson blush. The film handles its impressive cast pretty well, and most of the actors seemed invested in their characters. There are obviously people who would be disappointed with certain people not getting enough screen- time. I myself was a little upset that Ian McKellen wasn't around for much – though he did get an awesome moment against a bunch of sentinels. A lot of the 'now' actors hog a lot of the screen, like Fassbender and Lawrence, but that's OK since they are pivotal to the story. Wanna see more McKellen, CineRanter? Go and watch X-Men 2.Performances all round are good. Jackman is on fine form once again as Wolverine, and his character opens up a lot more than before once he makes his trip down to the past. The Magnetos and Professor Xs delivered flawlessly again, and there was good supporting work from the likes of Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult. 'Old' Magneto was played with subtle brilliance by McKellen, who gave of an air of compunction and regret, whilst his counter-part was fuelled with anger and drive. However, I could have done without Ellen Page's Japanese porn star-like squealing in the sending-back scene. I wasn't too impressed with Jennifer Lawrence either. Her character, ever since First Class, has been written much more differently from the first X-Men movies. Despite there being a huge gap in time, where a person can obviously change, Mystique is no longer cold andscary? She's far too open in this and a change in voice or something could have helped separate the character from the actress. I even though the makeup was a bit off. Mystic suddenly becomes involved in some kind of love triangle which was not presented previously.As far as the story goeswell, time travel is very hard to get right. Only a few films have done it perfectly, such as 12 Monkeys, and there are undoubtedly going to be 'plot-holes' galore. Days of Future Past leave the idea of fate/destiny open (that is until we see Apocalypse) and other aspects of time travel are just not dealt with which is an ideal way to avoid confusion. If we're going to try and think scientifically about all this then none of the X-Men movies would be with us. The premise is good – The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history (hint hint) and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants (nudge nudge) – and the execution is satisfactory. It clears up some mess from previous instalments pretty well and a lot of continuity errors can be dismissed by the fact that the First Class set of characters and in a different universe to the 'old' X-Men (and it seems the film says a big ""Fuck you!"" to Brett Ratner at times). The movie's two-and-a-bit hours drifts at a consistent pace with the cast of characters moving from set-piece to set-piece in flashy fashion. Humour is blended with action and drama seamlessly (Oh, that groovy 70's tune!) and there are Easter-eggs plentiful to please the hard-core fans. Not to mention some special cameos. One thing I really enjoy in fantasy films is when real life events are incorporated. I'm of course talking about the JFK bullet- bending material which made me chuckle.Unlike a lot of modern action films, you can actually see what is going on in the fight scenes (looking at you Winter Solider). Someone clearly threw the Shaky Cam out of the window, and it's a beautiful thing. The 'future' fight scenes were great eye candy (especially those portals) and the 'past' ones were grounded and consistently spread out. There was no 'epic' end fight scene as I expected after seeing Singer's first two X-Men films which makes it easier for the next movie not to try and one- up it, which is becoming a problem with comic book movie sequels. Also, Marvel fans may have an Avengers-esque déjà vu with the post credit scene teasing a 'big baddie'.Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/movie-review-x- men-days-of-future-past/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Melodramatic superheros and not enough comic book action,"I've waited a long time for this one. X-Men: First Class was truly first class in my opinion, from the perspective of a comic-book-turned-movie. I thought there is no way for Days of Future Past to disappoint me, but sadly, I was wrong.Don't get me wrong or think I am to negative - the movie is visually great (especially the ""villains"") and the actors do their job more than well. The story is also very interesting and gripping. However, when I watch a Marvel movie, I expect action, thrills and adventure. I do like drama - but not here and definitely not that much. A bit of drama would be OK, but the levels of melodrama we get from certain characters (I don't want to spoil anything so I'll skip the name, but you'll know it when you see it) are simply not fitting for this kind of movie.After some great starting sequences, my wife and I started wondering why is the movie losing pace and when will the ""real X-Men movie"" start. We rolled our eyes more than once during some scenes, although we are both huge franchise fans.I give it a six because I like X-Men and it's visually great and the story is okay. But that is as high as it gets for me. Despite that, I would recommend watching it because I see some very good reviews here so I hope not all of you find it as disappointing as I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable and satisfying blockbuster thanks to engaging narrative which is well delivered by all,"I don't remember being overly taken by the previous X-Men film, although I may be wrong because it has mostly slipped from my memory after it took quite some time for me to get around to watching it in the first place. Days of Future Past came out in a busy summer season and it did strike me as just another superhero blockbuster in a very crowded marketplace. Although it of course has much in common with other superhero films, X-Men doesn't directly take them on at their own game and, although it has the odd touch here and there, it deliberately avoids the knockabout comedy that The Avengers film and some of its offshoots has. Instead we get a darker plot that begins in the future where mutants are either enslaved or killed by robots designed specifically for that purpose. The plot device that triggers the time-travel is as easy to accept as anything else in the film, and it is delivered fairly straight which also helps. This gives us a plot where we know the stakes and the film plays it very well to keep things dramatic.Having very recently been disappointed by the superficial thrills of Godzilla, I pleased to find that Days of Future Past was an engaging and satisfying film to watch – although I personally think that its current very high rating on IMDb is partially down to an overreaction to low expectations set by First Class. The plot has some good twists and turns and it connects the future and present well. Special effects are well used throughout, with plenty going on that is visible (I'm looking at you Godzilla) and most importantly, is connected to the plot; so yes the film has spectacle, but it is spectacle that the viewer cares about rather than passively watches.The cast helps give the material some weight and, although some of them have comparatively little to do, they all do well enough with what they are given. Jackman is as good as presence as ever and there is a reason he and this character remain so constant through the series. Fassbender and McAvoy have good material to work with and they engage and convince as to their connection to their future castings of Stewart and McKellen. Lawrence is surprisingly good and although she seems a bit out of place at first, it is her performance that makes her character work. Dinklage is always watchable and he fits in well amongst a cast that includes many famous faces in roles small and big. The balance of all these names and faces is down to how enjoyable the script is, because even though we barely see some people, it makes sense within the context of the story being told, so doesn't feel like they are wasted (although I could have done with a few fewer in the final scenes).Days of Future Past is perhaps not as amazing as the high IMDb rating suggests, but it is an enjoyable and satisfying superhero movie with good edge and seriousness in the plot, which is all played straight aside from a few moments, helping it carry it off and keep the viewer engaged.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A brilliant addition to a very hit or miss franchise. Dare I say better than ""The Avengers""?","I always thought the X-Men were the real deal. When everyone was praising the brilliance of The Avengers I was more preoccupied in the compelling dynamic between the 2 leads, Xavier and Magneto in X-men First Class. Despite loving ""Earths Mightiest Heroes"" the story hasn't got a lot of grit to it and is rather zany. X-Men on the other hand I find to be a lot more compelling especially through it's sub-text of societies prejudice on minorities these are highlighted specifically well in First Class and X2.By taking the principal characters from both these films and bringing them together into a desperate attempt to warn the past of the atrocities of the future in Days of Future Past is a work of genius. Days of Future Past is loaded full of exceptional performances James McAvoy is superb as a young Professor who has lost his way and has withdrawn from offering guidance. Michael Fassbender's performance is magnetic quite literally...but figuratively it is a fascinating portrayal of a man determined to get his way yet still showing respect for his old friend Charles Xavier. This dynamic that has carried on from First Class really fascinates me. Yes the action scenes with the mutant side characters like Blink and Storm are very impressive but the conflicting principals of these 2 characters is the big draw to me.Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian's interpretation of these characters is a much welcome return adding an element of class to the rowdiness of there youthful selves. However I wanted to see more of the desperate survival within the post apocalyptic future. A whole movie could've been done on establishing the bleak future of a world ruled by Sentinels.The big poster characters of these movies Wolverine and Mystique are also great. Wolverine is a bit of a bore in his solo outings. Having him function within a team is infinitely more compelling. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has many poignant scenes with the story hinging on her actions entirely which really raise the stakes.With such an expansive cast all having a chance to shine it is a massive shame that Bryan Singer didn't direct the major let down that was X-Men 3 and Origins. It's nice that the characters act like the events never happened but it's a shame that I can't. As a standalone entry to the series X-Men Days of Future Past has a thoughtful script that doesn't rely on mindless action sequences to keep your attention. Along with it's stellar cast, this is a truly amazing installment to a messy franchise that now has a chance to develop.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men : Days of Future Triomph,"Right now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from the X-Men movie I've just seen:The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle. Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting. Visual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it is unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose, whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's development.All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be disappointed, I can tell : you won't be.But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something you'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of the credits...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bryan Singer does it again!!!,"Ahhh the X-men Franchise.There's the good: X-men, X2 and x-men first class and the bad: X3, god dammit Brett Ratner.But with a familiar face returning to the franchise Its easy to say the franchise is being brought to life and exceeding new levels with Days of future past.So as always I will rank this art film as 1.Acting, 2.Plot, 3.Sfx and 4.Flaws, 5:Direction.1:The acting:The acting was superb.Hugh Jackman is as good as always playing the 6 foot 3 Canadian with anger issues.Micheal Fassbender and especially James McAvoy gave praising performances as the younger counterparts of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.Micheal Fassbender shows how cold and calculating Magneto is making him the bad-ass super villain.James McAvoy gave a shuddering performance as a broken down Charles Xavier who's lost his way.Evan Peters was great as the speedy quicksilver(I doubt avengers 2 quicksilver will beat this one)who stole the show for the part he was given.Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the troubled Mystique.10/10 2.The Plot:In 2023, the mutants face the biggest threat yet:the sentinels, which are mutant killing robots made by Bolivar Trask, 50 years ago.The sentinels are so advanced that they adapt to any mutant power.So what do they have to do to stop the massacre?They have to send the Wolverine back to the past to change the future.Sounds good right?10/10 3.SFX:The GCI was simply stunning.The sentinels (both future and past)looked amazing.The mutant powers were awe strucking(especially quicksilver's superhuman speed).10/10 4.Flaws:Although the X-men franchise is pretty flawed some things were explained.Like how Charles could walk.How Hank Mcoy was still human in X2.But some questions remain unanswered.Like did Logan ever undergo the weapon X procedure?How is professor X still alive?Well we still have X-men:Apocalypse coming up so they might be awnsered.9/10 5.The direction:After 3 blockbuster movies, it really shows how Bryan Singer knows how this team of outcasts functions(Not you, Brett Ratner).He really knows how this team works and there's heart in this film (unlike the Avengers).There's a right amount of action, dialog and emotion to this film.Worth buying.Overall:10/10.This flick is a perfect blend of everything.Even if your-re not a fan of superhero movies this one is still going to surpass your expectations.Its worth it.Cant wait for Apocalypse, Bryan Singer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A whole lot of fun but the finale is overblown,"The X-Men series has been with us now for well over a decade and in that time we have been witness to some truly great examples of the comic book genre (X-Men 2, First Class) and some truly forgettable examples of the genre (X-Men 3, X-Men Origins) and in an instance where things seem to have come full circle with the reappearance of the series original helmer Bryan Singer, this latest X-Men falls somewhere in between the others, despite it being arguably at certain times the most entertaining entry into the series to date.With a convoluted story line that even the slightest thought into will display its many flaws, Days of Future Past for the first 90 or so minutes displays an incredible ability to be fun, frenetic, original and engaging with one of the year's best singular scenes taking place in the Pentagon and a whole lot of creative banter taking place between everyone's favourite mutton chop sporting superhero and the younger more sombre Professor X and his loyal sidekick Beast. Time fly's by as the action takes place in the 70's, full of camcorder action, 70's ditties and enough old school fashion to outrival American Hustle, the jaunt back in time really takes X-Men to places we have not yet been and with a fantastic cast, all feels steadily on song to become the quintessential adventure in the series so far but then low and behold like so many before it, this superhero adventure gets lost in its third act.Days of Future Past seemingly went all out to create a 3rd act not content with one time frame but multiple ones, and it becomes a mess of a million different ideas flying about the screen all at once. There's mutants v humans, sentinels vs mutants (in the future!), President Nixon and Tyrion Lannister verse our hero's and a raft of other subplots and ideas to boot. It's a real shame, but the finale to the film feels like a major step down from what had been building before it and it feels less spectacle and more preaching, which in this genre never seems to completely work. While the ending is a huge anticlimax the acting by the large is fantastic with Fassbender and McAvoy in particular continuing on their fine turns and the direction of Singer is often highly inventive, therefore the film feels frequently fresh.This newest entry into the X-Men cannon has been highly regarded by critics and audiences alike and with a large haul at the Box Office the world over it looks likely that many will be waiting Apocalypse's arrival with baited breathe. There is a lot to like in this journey and there are some inspired ideas that sadly culminate in an unsatisfactory and overblown finale. It's hard to agree with all the praise and love given to this film that in the end is nothing more than an enjoyable romp in the universe that is Marvel, but I guess we should all be thankful, it's like those horrible Wolverine movies never happened.3 and a half floating stadiums out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THE GREATEST X-MEN MOVIE,"This is the greatest X-Men movie in my opinion, without a doubt, the story and the acting are phenomenal, the ending is fantastic, and the effects in this film are amazing. Alongside all of this, the cast is massive and full of great actors, it's sequels may not have been amazing, but this movie paves the way for them nicely",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix + The Terminator + Back To The Future (with Mutants),"I won't disparage anyone for what they find enjoyable. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. That being said, here is mine...The hallmark of an intellectually insulting film is when, early in the movie, each of the main characters stands around in a single room reciting one-liners that give away the entire plot. That happens about five minutes into Days of Future Past and serves as a staggering reminder that this ultimately is a movie for kids.Along the same vein, it would take the film watching experience of a child to not recognize that DOFP is basically an unoriginal mash-up of better films that came before it (the most obvious ripoffs being Back to the Future, Terminator 2, and The Matrix).In fact, DOFP is nothing more than a mutant version of Back to the Future, with fewer memorable lines, mediocre acting (save for the always excellent Michael Fassbender), without the classic soundtrack, and with no real villain.**Spoiler Alert** Plot Synopsis: The Matrix, I mean, DOFP, starts with the all-powerful Sentinels having basically destroyed civilization and terrorizing the mutants who remain in Zion, I mean whatever city they live in. Withing five minutes, we find out that a mutant has the ability to allow others to time travel, but that the farther back in time someone travels, the more difficult it is for Ellen Page to hold it all together. Of course, Wolverine is the only one who is strong enough to make the trip. Why are they time traveling? The Terminator, I mean, Wolverine, has to see to it that Sarah Connor, I mean, Raven/Mystique, doesn't kill The Brother From Another Planet, I mean Joe Morton, I mean the guy who creates Sentinels. What else happens in the movie? Nothing of consequence. A lot of running around, chasing, breaking into stuff, and a melodramatic half love-story involving an apparently alcoholic, depressed, and pathetic Professor X and Mystique.Surely someone out there understands my POV. Again, I respect everyone's opinion, but when I googled DOFP after seeing it and saw a 8.7 rating on IMDb (plus a 91% of RT), my eyes almost fell out of my head.Background/Disclaimer: I did not grow up reading comics. I occasionally watched, and enjoyed, the X-Men cartoon of the '90s. I have seen X-Men (really good), X2 (amazing), The Last Stand (disappointingly awful), and portions of First Class (no opinion).",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just Fantastic,The one truly great X Men movie.Both the old and new franchises executed extremely well. Loved it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but the inconsistencies are too distracting,"My general summary is that this is a 'good' film with lots of action, 'some' great acting and is overall well worth watching.Unfortunately, I can't give this more than a 7 (much as I would like to as I love X-Men) because for me, this was as good/disappointing as the Breaking Bad finale.The good:Obviously the 'real' leads: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Gripping acting from them as per usual. I liked the Sentinels. And Peter Dinklage.That's about it.The bad:I'm not sure there's any point in listing the plot holes and inconsistencies because I'm not very observant so I'm sure people will spot way more than I did and the internet has lots of hilarious pages dedicated to finding the faults. Also, I don't usually care about plot holes but inconsistencies really wind me up because it's so lazy. Decide if you're following the comics or not. If not, make damn sure you follow the events of the previous films. You have to reckon that even if the writers had never heard of X-Men before, 'someone' at some point would have seen the script and gone ""noooo, that can't happen because..."" but no. All the way through this film I was rolling my eyes and groaning and shouting and asking ""HOW??"", ""WHY??"" and the millions of inconsistencies kept taking me out of the film and ruined the experience for me (hence the 7).Jennifer Lawrence. I was never on the bandwagon and I don't hate her either so (that proves?!) this criticism is genuinely an honest opinion: really bad casting. The original Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) moved like a serpent (I mean that in a good way) and had a low sultry voice but Jennifer just looks and sounds like a sulky teenager in most of her scenes. James and Michael are so convincing in part because they nail the accents. Jennifer doesn't even attempt to change her accent or voice. The first time she played Mystique I could overlook it because she was just playing 'the kid version' and wasn't the real Mystique in my eyes but now that she's played her twice, I feel like they want us to think of her as much as being the real Mystique as we do of James and Michael being the real Professor and Eric...but that won't happen until Jennifer drastically improves her acting. She needs to work on her voice and body language.The choreography and costumes: sorry to pick on Jennifer, this is probably wardrobe's fault but maybe the actress requested it? She is blatantly wearing a leotard! Like, 'blatantly'!!! If you're going to play such a proud and distinguished character, you should do it properly and just have the body paint. Isn't she supposed to be naked? i.e. refusing to disguise herself in any way? I've never read the comics but Jennifer's Mystique looks so fake and again, it's distracting. Instead of going for a big name, why not go for an actress who's willing to play the part right?Regarding the choreography throughout the film: There were loads of fight scenes that felt rushed or unfinished or poorly edited...not sure which. Like the sound effects weren't properly added. They weren't always convincing.Why can Kitty Pryde (ridiculous name) send people back in time?? How did the Professor get his body back?? Why is it suddenly acceptable to provide important plot points in DVD commentary? NO, NO, NO! Plot points essential to the development of a story MUST be provided in the film otherwise your film is SH*T!!Tangent: Someone online explained the theory i.e. 'not spoiler' that the Professor got his body back by using the paraplegic's who happened to be his identical twin brother (I don't remember them being identical from the news story in the other film but whatever) and that his twin was in a coma because the Professor's psychic abilities overwhelmed his brother's mind in the womb. Two things wrong with that explanation: 1- The Professor states in this film that he only developed his powers at around 9(ish). A foetus would almost certainly not have reached puberty and would therefore not have been exhibiting any mutant abilities. 2- Even if there was some weird 'developing-foetus glitch' and the Professor did in fact manage to exhibit mutant abilities so powerful it knocked his twin into a coma: 2b- Why has his twin been kept on life support for the last 60 years or so since birth?? 2c- Would that even happen in real life?? 2d- Given that his twin also has to have the exact same abilities otherwise the Professor would now be in a non-mutant body without powers, why would his twin be affected if he has the same genetics and same psychic abilities? I suppose it's possible he just wasn't having a developing-foetus glitch that day like his brother. Unfortunate for him.The point is that if you take over a project and disagree with the death of someone, bring them back in a way that makes sense and also: ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT !!The ending was great on the one hand because of a reason I can't say but disappointing because it reminded me of the happily ever after of Breaking Bad. Also: that's how you could have brought the Professor back. But whatever.If it wasn't for James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, I would have given this a 6.

A Very Satisfying Goodbye To The Original X-Men,"Based on one of (of not) the best X-Men stories form the comics, this film is an absolute delight as an X-Men lover like me. As someone who's favorite movie is Back To The Future and loves timetravel movies, this is basically my dream movie with the perfect cast, story and execution.The combination of the old and new X-Men was just perfect. We finally have a good Friends Of Humanity story in a movie containing Sentinels.They made the right choice to let Logan go back in time though Kitty's powers, instead of Bishop through a timemachine like they did in The Animated Series.This is hands down my favorite X-Men movie, with Logan, X1 and X2 closely behind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a simply gorgeous film,"This is what the comic book film genre was supposed to be. Fast-paced, intense, character-driven - all of that, but with HEART. What a work of art, Marvel. Please don't take us for granted like you did in the early 2000's. Keep it true. Keep it fun. That's all you have to do. And you did it here. THANK YOU. And how can you not love the easter eggs everywhere in these films. Wonderful hat-tips to the comics.But that cast....this series set the bar wonderfully high for subsequent Marvel movies. Michael Fassbender & James McAvoy might be the greatest actors in a Marvel film. Good GOD. Perfect ambassadors for the X-Men series for years to come.And uh......can we see Deadpool done right? :) Beggars & choosers, I know! PEACE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fear not, it's better than X3 and the Wolverine movies.","It's hard to review this movie without spoilers, but here it goes:It's a very ""epic"" X-men movie...probably the most epic yet. For better or worse, there's a lot going on in this movie- future and past time-lines and characters...if I have one complaint, it's that there's so much to the story that some scenes happen too quickly just because they need to.There are also some head-scratching lines of dialogue and plot elements (don't even get me started on how the time-line is supposed to work with the previous movies).But that's all being technical, the movie succeeds where it needs to: the story is interesting, the acting is good, the action is pretty awesome (though we don't get as much as I wanted), and the effects are the best yet.A lot of people are raving about this movie, and I hate to say I don't really know why- it was good, but not great. I wouldn't say it's the best X-men movie, but it's a welcomed addition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Who needs Avengers when you got X-Men?,"Putting aside my being a die-hard Marvel fan and summoning my critical perception to the film, I say this with most sincerity, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film of X-Men franchise yet, and for that matter one of cinematic history's best of the superhero genre, easily lining itself to other superhero films' gems like The Dark Knight and the Avengers. I would like to begin by saying that Bryan Singer is a miracle worker (making the ""impossible"" filmable), making X-Men DOFP one of his finest. Singer carefully crafted every single scene with such awe and sincerity that the word perfection isn't enough to describe it. May it be a series of CGI effects, unique action extravaganzas, and powerful, moving emotional scenes, Singer never failed to blend the elements of a superhero film with human drama. His powerful direction certainly brought the best in each of the cast and unlocked their hidden potentials. For the storyline, I would like to commend the writers for their excellent writing that never failed to amuse and captivate the audience with powerful storytelling while maintaining logic and perceiving bigger messages to society and human faults. (BTW I'm not a huge comic book reader so I don't have any idea what X-Men DOFP would be about) Anyways, the writers did an excellent job in connecting the dots from the past X- Men films (though it's not necessary to watch them all to fully understand the film). Now for the stellar cast: I think the whole cast (both new and recurring) did their best to fully portray the characters they're embodying. First, kudos both to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who both are the embodiment of X-Men themselves; even though their pretty much in the same place the whole film, their performance proved to be timeless without severing emotional vulnerability and the bond of a strong true friendship. Hugh Jackman's performance in the film could be argued as his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. What can we say? He's Hugh Jackman. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's characters have evolved so much from the first film, and the two of them displayed performance that made X-Men DOFP superior to other X-Men films. Their portrayals held such pain and confusion from their damaged relationship that made them human despite their superhuman distinctions. Of course there's the ever-astonishing Jennifer Lawrence whose acting prowess is unmatched. Lawrence's Mystique is one of the best portrayal of a troubled character in a superhero film, exploiting mixed feelings with pure acting that made Mystique and Jennifer Lawrence a very crucial piece to the film's success. And for the newcomer Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, portrayed a villain with no actual superpowers but made the future as it was in the beginning of the film. His role as Bolivar Trask is an interesting character fighting for survival with judgment clouded by society's erroneous perception. The actors in the supporting roles also did very well. Ellen Page got the spotlight she deserved with her vulnerable yet enduring portrayal of Kitty Pride, who's the bread-and-butter character of the film. Shawn Ashmore has grown so much since his first X-Men film, and that maturity is very much shown in his strong portrayal of Iceman. Halle Berry, while she has a much smaller role in the film, steals the spotlight every second she appeared on screen. The appearance of Bill Stryker (Josh Helman) is of course appreciated as it gives us a brief window to Wolverine's character and proves the quantum theory about time which is an important aspect to the storyline. Smaller roles which are included for filling the shoes of other characters showed so much potential that it's too disappointing they didn't got a chance to develop throughout the film: Colossus (who's supposed to be Kitty Pride's couple, though I don't think that's necessary for now), Sunspot, Bishop, Warpath, Blink (instantly my new favorite character) and Havok from the past. By the way, special mention to Evan Peters and his portrayal of Quicksilver for being too awesome. I think it's very obvious that he would appear not only in future X-Men films but also in other Marvel films (such as Avengers 2) because he's such an iconic character. As expected, the cameo appearances by James Marsden and Famke Janssen as Cyclops and Phoenix set us for the next X-Men film, which I think is great. So that's pretty much my though for X-Men: Days of Future Past (not including the visual effects, sound, costume design etc.). This is a must-see film and it is sure to entrance die-hard Marvel fans and non-fan viewers alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An ambitious and appreciated effort!,"To me, this is the comic book property that has the best chance of competing with the Disney/Marvel universe. This movie was much more adult focused and serious than most of the movies coming out of Disney's Marvel machine. I love the Disney movies, but this was almost like a breath of fresh air. It had it's flaws, but they have the source material, the resources, and a very solid cast available to move this franchise in the right direction.The plot of this was apparently taken from a comic book storyline which I have never read. They definitely selected the right material as I thought it was a great and well thought out story. It was also a great way to bring in the original cast. I only wish we could have seen more of them; for various reasons some of them such as Anna Paquin only had very limited screen time which I thought took away from the story a little. Especially because they were such a huge part of the original franchise. It seemed to me that the reason they weren't in the movie much didn't necessarily have anything to do with the story, and more to do with contracts. Even though I know they may not be in the comic much either I have read that at least Rogue should have had a larger part in the movie than she did.That said, the only other gripe I had was the focus on Wolverine. We have stand-alone Wolverine movies available if you love Wolverine, so it would have been nice to center the plot around another character, or characters, this time around. There are plenty to choose from and the first movie did fine without him.These complaints are mostly marginal; and not really a reflection of the movie itself. I loved the storyline and thought they did a truly great job of creating the Sentinels. You actually believe they could pose a major threat to even the most powerful of mutants. The action and effects were top notch and there were some truly great parts such as the Quicksilver sequence that I thought was very well done.The scale of the movie was also fantastic, you truly feel as if you can grasp the power these mutants posses with the ability they have to control their environment; even on a large scale.The biggest strength these movies have to me is the all star cast. With names like McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Hoult, and the fresh face of Even Peters leading this franchise into the future, there is a ton of potential to directly compete with any other comic book movie. Each of these actors is in the prime of their career at this point and they are all being assembled for these movies. They all bring a dramatic depth and believable emotion to their characters on what I believe is a higher level than any of the Avenger cast. As I mentioned earlier, these movies are more dramatic and therefore require more dramatic actors. That being said, this is the perfect cast for a more grown up and serious plot.On a side note, I hear a lot of talk about Scarlet Johansson getting the first female lead super hero movie; but I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a superior actor and Mystique is a much more interesting character and should be given a movie as well. Who wouldn't love to see that? Overall, this was a great film BUT the focus on Wolverine was a bit of a cop out. I also think the ensemble cast was a little too ambitious as it didn't give every major character from both franchises enough screen time. Outside of the that, the plot, acting, and effects were top notch and I can't wait to see the next entry in this fantastic franchise! Rating: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"With such abundance of talents, it's a surprise their powers are not throwing award statues at each other.","An all-star ensemble delivers one of the better and more captivating superhero movie in recent time, despite the use of a rather mystifying time travel plot. They do a remarkable job of keeping the audience invested to the characters, each with brimming personality to ensure there's never a dull moment. Visually, the movie is captivating, its contrast tone bridges the colorful 70s and severely bleak future impeccably. It also appropriately utilizes good humor throughout the seemingly melancholy plot.X-Men: Days of Future Past is an ambitious movie, it brings the newer cast from First Class as well as the older trilogy, plus Hugh Jackman. The time traveling gimmick could be a puzzling one, and in some occasions there are tricky twists that rely on heavy expositions. However, the movie pulls it off quite neatly with balanced pacing. The complexity doesn't divert the focus away from relationship of characters, most of which are always in peril. Many of the cast are capable to lead a movie by their own, but the movie doesn't feel bloated because they are so many involved. Director Bryan Singer cleverly seams the characters' tales together; the present chemistry produces engaging interaction between them.The bulk of the story occurs in 1973, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence take most of the spotlight. They perform admirably, each showcasing emotional baggage and entwined history together. Hugh Jackman fits into the party fairly well, he has been Wolverine for so long, he just naturally meshes together with the younger X-Men. Peter Dinklage provides a unique antagonist. X-Men movies are notoriously filled with military men as villains, it's nice to see someone more dynamic and with less reliance to violence.Effects are done beautifully. The future battles are spectacular, not to mention the choreography gracefully combines the mutants' power into the fray. I personally like the intricacy of Blink's ability which allows her to use multiple portals. Her scenes are few, but very well done. The slow motion effect looks wonderful and melee combat is performed effectively, especially Mystique's acrobatic dances. There's lingering retro ambiance for 70s, a simple touch of familiarity. One minor blemish is the lighting for future setting might be a tad too dark at times to fully appreciate the graphic.The prevalent flaw of time travel gimmick is the impact actions supposedly have on the future, this movie is no exception. There are a few instances where characters act rather brashly just in case it may hopefully change the future, a couple decisions are questionable as well, it's hard to believe experienced mutants with special powers would do impulsive action. It also tries to add prejudice theme, but seeing Jennifer Lawrence, even with blue skin, having self-confident issue is like seeing a supermodel complaining she's fat. All the flaws are just little hindrance, they barely affect the gripping performance of the talents.X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably the best of the franchise, it will entertain viewers with exquisite acting, finely pace story and delightfully likable characters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another over-hyped soulless hero mash up.,"I only just about made it to the end of this film. In some respects I'm glad I waited it out as I always enjoy seeing Magneto rise up and wreak havoc in any format.It was a close run thing however - I came very close to cutting my losses as we all had to endure the tiresome emotional crisis of the young Professor X. This film suffers from the blight of a tedious extended middle section where not an awful lot interesting actually happens - and there are prolonged periods of uninspiring dialogue. I found my mind wandering in the cinema as the director laboriously set up the clunky plot climax. It was all a bit tiresome.One always needs to leave one's brain at the door in this type of film and that's OK, it's what we all expect, but I was expecting this film to outdo the other incarnations of the X-Men given the things I had read, and the glowing recommendations I got from colleagues.Sadly it's all a bit pedestrian, and when you find yourself fidgeting and looking at your watch in the middle of an X-Men film you know that something has gone wrong somewhere. There are excellent performances here and there. Fassbender continues to ooze screen charisma and he captures the ruthless single mindedness of Magneto wonderfully well. Jackman continues to make Wolverine his own, but aside from that there's not really much memorable here.This is the first X-Men I have gone to see in the cinema and I think it will be my last.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Suffering from superior competition, Days of Future Past entertains, but doesn't push franchise forward like X2","X-Men Days of Future Past should go down as the blockbuster film that had arguably the most daunting task you'll see from a Summer flick: successfully combining a rebooted franchise with the franchise it had just replaced. Luckily for all of us there's a good old-fashioned time travel story to connect the two without too many continuity disruptions. Bringing back the man that delivered the best of the X-Men films up to this point, 20th Century Fox went all out to ensure that they can still hang on to the Marvel franchise.Based off of the highly-successful comic book series, Days of Future Past revolves around Wolverine (And not Kitty) heading back to the past to prevent a murder from occurring and creating the fallout that would lead to the dystopian-like present that involves all the mutants hiding for their lives. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the only constant that connects the two series of X-Men films, is the only hope to unite Professor X and Magneto in the 70s to prevent the creation of the ultra-powerful Sentinels. The emotional fallout from the events of First Class is overwhelmingly present so this movie feels a lot like a sequel and less as a mere connecting bridge between the X-Men films. Newcomers to the X-Men brand would probably be lost.The time-traveling quirks and limitations that made Back to the Future a masterpiece are not present here; the focus is entirely on the characters and the task they have at hand. X-Men fans shouldn't be too upset because they get to see a heavy slew of the mutants including Quicksilver, Colossus, Storm, among others. Too bad most of the X-Men are condensed to cameo-like appearances.And yea.....still no Gambit.....Whatever the film lacks in humor and action, it makes up for it with the heavy set of drama, bouts with forgiveness vs. justice, and the genuine care you will have towards our heroes. But like I said, the action is rather lacking and after nearly 15 years of X-Men being on the screen the battling becomes well repetitive. Which is a shame because Bryan Singer can craft good action sequences, especially when Quicksilver was involved. The Quicksilver appearance further proves the dulling of the fighting in X-Men when we see Magneto once again picking up something heavy with his mind and see Wolverine once again slash his way through opponents. After seeing the creative battles occurring on the Disney side, it gets hard to be blown away by anything here.There is plenty of heart and good performances, but you can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed at the X-Men as this is the seventh film featuring at least one of the mutants since 2000. Back then the X-Men was the peak of joyful comic book mayhem as we saw lots of interesting characters work together and showcase their abilities. But after the likes of The Incredibles, The Dark Knight, The Avengers, and even the recent Captain America, the competition has caught up. It is time to expand the scope, and push the franchise farther ahead with more risks, more surprises, and more twists.X-Men Days of Future Past will be sure to delight modern-day X-Men fans while slightly upsetting the hardcore crowd, but it doesn't quite top the quality batch of comic book movies we have seen within the past 5 years. Here's to hoping Apocalypse can shake things up a bit now that the transition between X-Men series is complete.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, though flawed","An entertaining movie, though it got fairly silly and plot-hole- ridden towards the end.Started very well, with a time travel piece that explained some of the past history of the characters. Also had a fair amount of intrigue, especially due to the changing of history angle.The movie managed to maintain focus and keep the plot tight, until about halfway through. Then, slowly but surely, the cracks began to appear. People behave in random ways, things happen that make no sense, and it all seems that these are just plot devices to prolong the movie.The final confrontation makes very little sense at all, and neither do the effects of it.However, great CGI, obviously, and solid performances all round.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Convincing performances, fantastic cinematography in the fifth X-Men installment","In the near future, mutants and ordinary humans alike are under attack and losing the battle. So our heroes from former installments try to prevent this war by sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the past so he can fix the mess a certain blue lady (Jennifer Lawrence) is creating. In the year 1973, Wolverine meets young and depressed Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) again. Will he succeed in uniting the two mutant geniuses and change everything?That said, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a thrilling experience. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is amazing, as are their performances. Again. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as Hank. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, meaning he IS THE Wolverine. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage does a great job as Dr. Trask. And yes, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven. Plus, we see Ellen Page and Omar Sy, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great as ever.I like the performances and the acting in general. There are quite some emotional scenes. Needless to say that James McAvoy pulls them off so well it almost hurts.""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" promises fun as well. Action sequences are spiced with nice effects and flavored with some humor. Evan Peters who plays Quicksilver is amazing in his role and gives you something to watch in amazing 3D.Last but not least, the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, I have seen even better results, but scenes, cuts, and effects fit the movie. 3D looks and feels great.Overall, I rate it as one of the best X-Men movies so far. Although I am aware of some logical gaps (considering the original X-Men movie time line), I accept ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" as a more or less alternate canon time line. By doing so, it is easy to enjoy these two hours full of mutants, their powers, and their fears.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For being not a fan...i was impressed,"First let me elaborate my relationship with the whole xmen franchiseAs a child I loved the cartoons and series, I later liked the first movie a lot , but everything else after that( even the much appreciated first class) for me felt like ' meh' at it best, not bad or something but in a category of movies i would completely have forgotten next week after.Voilà that being said my expectations for this were pretty low. If it would had some decent spectacle it would be already fine for me. But wow this movie truly amazed me in a very very positive way.Story wise, directing, characters, acting,spectacle,music,sound its all form an incredible level, and to me this is hands down the best xmen movie to date i saw!Very well done mr singer,cast and crew perhaps i become after all a fan of xmen movies :)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure fan indulgence with great production values,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly an ambitious project, attempting to stitch together both film franchises, the original X-Men trilogy as well as the 2011 semi-reboot X-Men: First Class. And the way it accomplishes this is certainly both effective and commendable. The story is believable, most of the important loopholes get closed and as a whole it's just a lot of fun.The best thing here are the actors. Pretty much all the actors from both franchises reprise their roles, which is an impressive feat and all around heartwarming. The main show belongs to Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) as well as Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender (Erik Lehnsherr). All five are talented actors in their own right and they absolutely nail these characters and give us some really good character moments. The rest of the cast is equally up to the task and it's great to see so many of them in the same film, seeing that X-Men has always been about a group of people coming together to fight greater evil.But here I have to be honest and admit that I was kind of expecting more from the story. Once again mutants are threatened by evil, bigoted men and it's up the X-Men to stop this threat before the society slides out of balance. We've seen this before, and while the execution here is superb and allows an old story to feel refreshing, it's still an old story. And there were a couple of clear points in the movie, where they could have broken the mold, but instead they went with the expected. Sure it's faithful to the comic books, but these characters are so huge that there would have been room for variance.And that leaves me with a conundrum. I loved the characters, I loved the action scenes, I loved the production values, but I honestly cannot say the same about the story. I didn't dislike it either, but it could have been so much better with so little effort. The film is still worth seeing, easily, but you should be advised that if you're expecting something new story-wise, you're not going to get it. Although the final ending is great in its own indulgent way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily One of the Best X-Men movies,"This X-Men movie puts the action in action packed. It has plenty of good action in it. It does delve into time travel, as what puts the future past in the title. This movie is practically an excuse to get Hugh Jackman to interact quite a bit with the younger X-Men characters (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender) before going to this alternate timeline the next couple X-Men movies will take place in where he may not have a lot of screentime. This movie does bring up the idea of alternate timelines. It's kinda like the MCU right now but not. This movie does allow the older X-Men characters (from the first 3 movies) to appear again. I feel like this helps formulate current day multiverse movies. This may not dive into the multiverse deeply, but it surely does help create it. If you like both the original X-Men trilogy and First Class, you will likely like this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We've seen this all before,"I've never really cared much for X-Men in any format, but I did like 2011's 'First Class'. Unfortunately, despite a few clever bits, I found 'Days of Future past' to be a rather flat re-hash of the tired X-Men formula; Humans are afraid of mutants. Xavier and Magneto argue over how to deal with this. Blah, blah, blah. It's been five movies of this same sort of thing now. It's beyond played out.For the uninitiated this is likely to be a rather confusing slog. There are a lot of characters and story elements here that have little to no set up, and much of it goes back several films. And even for those who have been along for the ride there's not much pay off here. You can see every twist and turn coming from a mile away.'Days of Future Past' is a well made, well acted, but ultimately mediocre film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-cellent,"I want to start off by saying that my brother, Nick predicted this movie after the 2nd X-Men film. He is a true comic book geek and saw this coming. I am sure that he is not the only one. I was more of a bi-polar comic geek. I read Archie and Richie Rich on good days and Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside on bad days. I read super hero comics sporadically. My brother informed me that Quicksilver (Evan Peter) is Magneto's son. I had no clue. Speaking of Quicksilver, he was my favorite character in this film. When assigned a task, I never had a concern that he would not complete it. Apparently he will make another appearance in the next film. Once again I neglected to stay through the credits and missed some important information. Nick informs me that it has something to do with the apocalypse. I really need to start staying through the credits of not only Marvel films, but also DC Comic films. Anyway, I was really glad to see the original X-men join forces with their younger selves. They even found a way to include Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman). I was glad to see Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) as the person with the power to make going back to the past possible, but for some reason I was getting flashbacks to the film Inception. Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) has his mind set on creating Cyborgs that would identify mutants and destroy them and it is the X-Men's goal to travel to the past and to keep the present future from happening. I would be remised if I did not mention Mark Camacho (President Nixon). Not only did he do a great interpretation of the president, but the whole recreation of the 70s was done extremely well. There were glimpses of every X-Men film to date incorporated in this film and the writers did an excellent job tying them all together. This is one of those films that you really do not have to advertise. Most people are so engaged with the X-Men, that it would be almost criminal not to see the franchise through. I thoroughly enjoyed the film because (1) it was not too long and (2) there weren't any dull spots. This is definitely a film worth seeing, especially if you want to be ready for the next one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This film is amazing, the best superhero film ever made!!!","I went with medium expectations, and this film blew me away!!! the action scenes were thrilling and exciting, the spectacle epic and exhilarating and the acting top notch!!! The complex plot of the film worked, because X-Men fans will geek out. This film is an absolute blast, a popcorn blockbuster for the ages. It is explosive, emotional , awesome. Although it can get a little slow at times, and the film isn't as dark as it's said to be. The stakes are very high and the film is quite suspenseful and shocking at times.

Surpassed my expectations,"If you plan on watching a X-Men movie you expect some cool and latest-technology special effects, some great combat scenes in which mutants with crazy powers use whatever ability they're feeling like and of course some cold-blooded drama that sometimes is based on some real issues society faces (more often the movies ask ""How society treats minorities""). X-Men ""Days of Future Past"" has it all .... and so much more! Almost every line spoken is excellent and deeply important and the team of actresses and actors is absolutely stunning. I can't remember the last time I've seen a movie in which every actor/actress does their absolute best to achieve entertainment on such heights. If I'd want to find a fault in this movie it'd just be how the ending is so big of a plot-twist (which can be foreseen right from the start) that it greatly influences every single X-Men movie you have seen so far.

So much wasted potential....,"I had been looking forward to this movie for a long time. The previews made it look so epic and it turned out just so so. I personally think First Class was superior. I know a lot of people are bashing Brian Singer just to bash him but the man ruined Night Crawler and I really don't think he should have been a part of the film and I would have preferred it if they had just pretended like the earlier Xmen films never happened and completely started over. They could've still used Patrick Stewart and the other actors but just abandoned the story lines, which I guess they kind of did.They didn't do a very good job of connecting things. There are far to many inconsistencies to list. I think what aggravates me most is how did they fail to tie in the post credits scene to The Wolverine with it? I can understand having trouble with movies released almost a decade before they knew they would need to tie things together, but not with a movie as recent as Wolverine. They seriously made James Mangold drop Wolverine receiving his mask and gloves so they could include a scene that doesn't even make sense.I wanted to see Wolverine take out one of the Sentinels but they made it impossible.I like Jennifer Lawrence but she shouldn't have been the focus.Magneto gaining complete control of the Sentinels was just stupid. At most the railroad tracks he inserted would have simply given him control of their movement.How is Xmen Apocalypse going to take place in the 1980's if DOFP ended in the future?I better see Rogue fly in the next one. Hopefully with True Blood being done Anna Paquin will get more screen time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Mulligan Ever Made,"Many things occurred in the year 2000 that changed the way we look at the world. Known as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, the beginning of the millennium saw the first year of Vladimir Putin's reign, the tumultuous election of George W. Bush Jr. and an understated blockbuster by the name of X-Men made its debut. Watching it today, the film can be underwhelming, especially in comparison to its above-the-cut sequel, yet it still holds a special place both in my heart and the emergence and popularity of superhero films.Fast-forward to the year 2014 and the X-Men has become an immensely popular film franchise with a spotty history as far as quality. Taken as a whole, the canon set by Director/Producer Bryan Singer and 20th Century Fox is a prime example of what a comic-book expanded universe can be. Still there were problems including the death of not one, not two but three important characters and the incredibly shoddy treatment of a fan favorite from the Marvel Expanded Universe.Is it safe to say that X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is the greatest mulligan ever made? After all, it's a sequel, its part of an extended canon and universe and with its play on time-travel it's also a reboot. It's also marvelous to boot featuring soundly made special effects, seamless period detail (a large swath of the movie takes place in 1973) and a great plot paying proper lip-service to many of the most popular characters from the comic-books. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Professor X (Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy), Magneto (Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammar/Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), all have their moments to shine.Director Bryan Singer and scribes Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman wisely weave a story that is properly weighty with big stakes and big pay-offs all while being a character centered tale. There is a reverence and respect for the characters as well as a respect of an audience that has been burned by the X-Men movies of the last decade. The Avengers (2012) may have mastered the ensemble superhuman savior shtick but The X-Men are now juggling with fire batons (as well as ice batons, telepathic batons etc.). With the power of a salient, timely and timeless message of inclusion and tolerance this new installment may be the new standard in superhero franchise films. It's certainly the blockbuster to beat in 2014.I have always has an affinity for the X-Men films, comic-books, cartoon series and memorabilia. Unlike many things you love starting at the age of ten, the characters have grown and evolved with me while keeping true to a core message that I still believe and probably will never grow out of. We still do not live in a culture of peace, yet through the stories we tell, maybe we can discover a world where special abilities can mirror our presumed faults and turn them into positivesand of course if the stories become bad we can always tinker a bit.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good,"Surprisingly good! If you've seen many of the recent crop of super-hero sci-fi schlock that's been released then you'll understand why this is a surprise.The premise is that Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent the horrible Terminator style future all the mutants are experiencing. There is plenty of eye candy CGI and explosions and all the usual suspects make cameos. In that way it's similar to other offerings but this one, unlike those, has an engaging story. True there is probably nothing earth shatteringly new here but the deft handling keeps it from ever feeling like a paint by numbers tent-pole.Wolverine doesn't do much Wolverine, he's mainly used as a POV character for us to bridge the past and the future. Peter Dinklage plays the gov't villain and while I always love seeing him on screen his character seems underutilized. Hugh Jackman carries the movie in terms of character and acting chops though the cast in general was very well chosen, there are just so many of them we only get a little bit of time with each. Young Xavier and Magneto reprise their roles from the previous movie and Mystique looks better than ever and we actually get a bit of character development from her. Giamatti has a great scene chewing couple scenes that are far too short, I can only hope he and Dinklage will be used more in future movies. It would be awesome to see a spectacle genre movie that also let some of these great actors loose.The world building holds together very well, not as many obvious anachronisms. I didn't feel the effort to hold suspension of disbelief like I have in other recent genre flicks. Special mention for the scenes with Quicksilver showing off his powers, those were particularly effective.If they can keep this quality up for the future offerings then I will be going for sure. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"X-Men's Journey into the Past, is a treat in the Present!","Brian Singer, Director of the first 2 Critical and Fan Praised X-Men Films, return to the Director's chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" brought High Expectations. My Verdict – Singer and Company Delivered!!!The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but quickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" is sent back to 1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot ""Sentinels"" which basically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the present day. The X-Men First Class Cast Members – James McVoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), and Nicholas Hoult (Beast), reprise their roles for the 1973 setting, 11 years after the story of ""First Class"". The acting from the entire cast is pretty much wonderful, including newcomer Evan Peter's Quicksilver, a subject of on-line worry leading up to the film, is great!!! And special mention should also be given to Mark Camacho, who scenes as President Richard Nixon are well done!

The past future of Earthlings,"The ""First Class"" has become an undoubted leap into modernity. The picture showed itself perfectly, demonstrating a fresh look at the trilogy about People from the 2000s. It was interesting to see the continuation of the large-scale comic thriller of 2011, the name of which sounds great ""Days of the past future"". Undoubtedly, I wanted to see the continuation of the history of the formation of Magneto and Professor X, but we must pay tribute to the creators - they competently lured the audience by attracting Hugh Jackman and his Wolverine to the project, as well as the heroes who were once performed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. In addition to them, other familiar characters appeared in the picture.The film undertook to show one of the most interesting stories where the superiority of mutants was nullified when humanity took seriously to deal with people with superpowers. The Guardian robots were incredibly dangerous and practically invincible. The picture already at the very beginning shows how strong and ferocious these machines are. The creatures of human hands, the Guards kill in cold blood any mutant that gets in their way. And these silent killers really terrify, suddenly in the mind of the viewer radically changing the balance of forces in the confrontation. There is only one salvation - a journey into the past, and only Wolverine can make it.The story is rich. It is in no way inferior in scale to the powerful ""First Class"", and in terms of the number of characters and stars on the screen, it undoubtedly surpasses the previous superhero team film. The story is strong, it combines strong drama and a lot of adventures, for which the audience loves this franchise. The director was again Bryan Singer, who gave us the original dilogy of 2000 and 2003. His hand is felt in this project absolutely. The story is large-scale, it is deeply personal and incredibly watchable.The calculation was a win-win. The creators combine two storylines, where both classic characters and actors performing them appear, as well as new performers whom the audience saw in the 2011 film. At the same time, the stories perfectly echo, they allow you not to get confused in what is happening on the screen, and Logan, performed by Hugh Jackman, looks like an excellent kind of glue of this work. The opening of the film was Evan Peters, who gave the world Mercury. This is a charismatic character who, even in the short minutes of his screen time, was able to make the audience fall in love with him, promising an interesting story of this mutant in the future.The film has a deep script. The creators did a great job, turning the plot not just into an attraction with special effects and fierce battles, but creating a truly deep story, where the main place is given to the drama, the inner world of the characters, of which there are quite a lot on the screen. Despite the abundance of characters, the viewer will be quite able to feel the experiences of this or that hero, plunging into their stories.There are really a lot of characters. Many of them are already well known to the audience and will appear on the screen in a limited time frame so that the audience remembers them and rejoices at their appearance. Other protagonists will be revealed more thoroughly. For example, Wolverine has already had so much screen time in past films, both general and his personal, that you seem to know everything about him. However, Jackman presents his Logan in such a multifaceted way that you don't get tired of watching the hero, and his life is still interesting to the viewer. The young versions of the beloved and well-known Charles Xavier and Eric Lansher are also perfectly revealed. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender perfectly play their roles, making the characters even more interesting. Other performers are also good, among whom I would single out Nicholas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, as well as franchise veterans: Halle Berry, Sean Ashmore, Anna Paquin and Elliot Page.The picture is inspiring. Its scale, its drama, its history. ""Days of the Past Future"" is created with respect to all the characters and the history of mutants in general. The film successfully connects the past and the present of history, predicting an interesting continuation of the adventures of mutants.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ensemble super-cast hits the high notes,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The X-Men are possibly the ultimate ensemble cast. The central half-dozen have been joined over the years by well over a hundred named characters, each with their own personalities and powers. All the more surprising then that for X-Men: Days of Future Past, they chose a plot that meant doubling up on several characters, bringing together two whole all-star casts into what amounts to an absolute galaxy of stars.Of course, sacrifices must be made to some degree, so the old cast - Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and so on - take something of a back seat as the new group brought in for X-Men: First Class predominate in the drama. This is fine, because Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are all excellent at their craft, and indeed all the best parts of this film come not from spectacle but sizzling character interactions.My sister pointed out that the role of Mystique (Lawrence) in the plot doesn't quite make sense given the existence of Darwin, a character who got inconveniently killed off in First Class. Being honest though, Jennifer Lawrence can now be relied on to carry the focus of a film in a way Edi Gathegi simply can't. Or at least, not yet. There's a slight problem with Professor X too, as Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's versions of the character - both interesting and engaging in themselves - seem just a little too different to be accounted for by the development and aging of one person.The plot is outright bonkers, which follows a fine tradition of comics madness. In fact, a significant proportion of the plot revolves around characters struggling to convince each other of the truth, against their quite understandable skepticism. They make it work, though, due to returning director Bryan Singer's deft hand with character drama and returning writers Matthew Vaughn (who also directed First Class) and nerd queen Jane Goldman, who bring a real sense of playfulness that pokes gentle, affectionate fun at the plot, characters, setting and everything else that hoves into view.The title is dumb, the end credit scene is far too enigmatic for its own good, and there's no Stan Lee cameo, but these are all insignificant niggles compared to the fun, excitement and character-led drama, remarkably free from the inevitable encumberance of so many characters, so much comics history and so much money.

"Great Movie, but timeline is confusing","I started watching the X-Men movies in chronological order (not by release date) , so at approximately 15 minutes into the movie when Charles tells Wolverine that he doesn't have his powers in 1973, this confuses me. When Charles meets Mystique for the first time in X-Men First Class (which took place in the 60's), they are children, and they both have powers. Charles is clearly quite powerful in X-Men First Class.Other than that, it's a terrific movie. I'm looking forward to watching them all in chronological order:X-Men First Class (2011)

A Super Solid Superhero Film,"X-Men: Days of Future Pasts finds mutants in their greatest plight yet, as in 2023 A. I. robots known as Sentinels are sent to eradicate them. With the help of Kitty Pryde, Wolverine volunteers himself to be sent back in time to 1973 where he must work with a young Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr and Hank McCoy to alter public opinion about mutants thus stopping the creation of the dreaded Sentinels. With Bryan Singer returning to direct, alongside all cast members back to reprise their roles past and present, Days of Future is an ambitious X-Men story to tell but was a hit for both audiences and critics back in 2014.The crux of this tale relies on time travel and while that can be an aspect that is hard to nail given the many story details that are required to be thought about, it's something that can lead to many plot holes and while Days of Future isn't perfect it mostly works. It was fun seeing the present Wolverine interact with the very young Professor X and Magneto, and seeing the return of the First Class cast was great. James and McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are standouts yet again, each delivering equally great performances, McAvoy portrays a very different Charles Xavier than we have ever seen before. He is a cynical man that has lost all hope for a balance between Mutant-Human relations and would rather subdue his powers with an experimental drug than use his brain for good. It was an interesting depiction of the character that led itself to some wonderful story moments. While Erik Lehnsherr's motives sort of remain the same, Michael Fassbender does an excellent job with it, he is both menacing and someone you root for to do the right thing. All the other actors and actresses do a fantastic job as well, no one felt out of place, even with all the returning characters from the previous X-Men trilogy.Another standout of Days of Future Past is the CGI, a lot of the effects are seamless and with a movie so reliant on them, nothing ever felt out of place and it feels like a film that will hold up for years to come. It was also really nice to see Beast done properly again, gone is the computer-generated mouth in place for a more traditional look that uses practical rather special effects and it really pays off. The movie also features a perfect sense of scale, everything feels grand with massive stakes on the line and the story went places, particularly near the end, where I wasn't sure exactly what was going to happen. It was refreshing to watch a superhero film and not be able to predict the whole thing.While there are a lot of positives to X-Men: Days of Future Past I found the runtime to hurt the film at points. I found myself checking the time more often than I should and I wasn't always engaged with what was going on. It was nowhere near as consistently fun or entertaining as X-Men: First Class, perhaps with further rewatches I may feel differently, but where I stand right now, it is certainly a good X-Men movie but not my favourite in the franchise.Nonetheless, Days of Future is an excellent superhero movie that is ambitious in its plot which pays off. It is certainly a film I can recommend however if you're brand new to the series I would suggest catching up on the previous movies just to get a good understanding of all the characters featured here. Even though I may not be head over heels for the film, I certainly respect the craft that went into it and I can say that it is one of the better movies in the hero genre, and with all that being said I am giving X-Men: Days of Future Past a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Near Perfect Film!,"X-Men: Days of Future Past, simply, is not just a good superhero film but a good film.It excels in all areas of its acting, directing, script and effects.Featuring the blend of the two generations of X-Men, DOFP feels like an X-Men movie should. It ditched the overly cheesy story of origins and features more heart than The last Stand. It also vastly improves on the characters first introduced in First Class.The real heart of the movie though is the performances. Hugh Jackman, Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart bring it as always but the real standout of the cast is James McAvoy as a young Charles Xavier. McAvoy really shows us the beaten down and depressed hippie that Xavier has become. His performance is one of the best parts of the film.Although the best part of the film must be twenty minutes half way through the film when the Wolverine and Xabier need help from a young mutant. It adds a nice comedic touch that X-Men movies always have.One of the only problems with the film is the under use of the actors. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen were horribly underused when their presence is always enjoyable.The only other issue is the time travel which is inevitable in any movie with time travel as it never makes any sense. The ending involving time travel feels very cheap and somewhat detracts from the rest of the film.Overall, these issues don't ruin the entire film and it is still a very enjoyable ride that just narrowly beats out X2 as the best X-Men film to date.(Here's hoping Apocalypase doesn't ruin this.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The performances from all actors involved are great but I was particularly impressed with the dynamic between Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and the younger versions of Xavier and Magneto (played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender). This is the most essential X Men film, because it actually makes the wacky X Men movie timeline make sense by changing events in the past, and it is a celebration of the entire franchise up to this point.

Brian Singer tries to undo the X-Men franchise damages,"I remember the time when I was all jacked up when I saw the previews of X-Men. I was blown away when I saw the movie on VHS as well. Such an ensemble cast and Wolverine seemed to pack quite the punch. X2 Xmen United was better than I'd expected and the less said about X- Men The Last Stand, the better. Bryan Singer undoubtedly a skilled director as evident from The Usual Suspects and not to mention handling an ensemble cast like X-Men was no easy feat. But a look back at his recent flicks (Superman Returns, Jack The Giant Slayer), you are bound to set your hopes a bit low for X-Men Days of Future Past. Despite his fairly brilliant initial track record, I myself was skeptic about X-Men Days of Future Past especially when Matthew Vaughn's X-Men First Class had a set a bar at how well made an X-Men could be.Off to a very rocky start, Days of Future Past introduces to a dystopian 2023 run by Sentinels and the few remaining mutants fighting for their lives. I mentioned 'rocky' coz you are thrown into the thick of the action and despite the brilliant sequence, if you are not familiar with the X-Men lore you'd be wondering who these mutants are. You'll feel right at home when Charles Xavier, Eric Lensher Logan and Storm enters the scene. Logan is sent back to 1973 by Kitty Pride to prevent Trask Industries to ever build these Sentinels. Logan meets up with a younger Xavier, Hank, Eric and Raven and sets about to save the world once again. What ensures is a good two plus hours of entertainment.Time Travel is used as a plot device and a lot could go wrong if there ain't much thought put into it. Thanks to Bryan Singer the comic series of the same name, time travel n Days of Future Past works just fine. It fills in most of the conflicts caused in the franchise's timeline but then again by the end of Days Of Future Past, the original X-Men trilogy supposedly never happens (If I am correct). There are some nifty sequences that'll make you go Whoa. The Magneto Prison break sequence in particular, left me in awe, thanks to Quicksilver. This rendition of Quicksilver was so good and leaves me wondering if this version would come on top if it had to go head to head with the upcoming Joss Whedon version from The Avengers Age of Ultron. I guess you cant have too much of a good thing as Quicksilver is sent home just after the said sequence.Unlike the spinoffs the X-Men series had always been about the Mutant-Human war and its the same here. There is a ton of other story arcs that had loads more potential but it sticks to the same formulaic arc. Another qualm were the mere glimpses of mutants like Bishop, Wink, Colossus and even Storm and used as just baits. While the mutants showed off some cool combat, these are pretty relevant characters from the X-Men series and to make them just cannon fodder, not cool! X- Men Days Of Future past delivers but I felt it doesn't have that charm or the heart X-Men First Class had. And if ranked X-Men Days of Future Past might be a notch below X2 X-Men United and First Class. There is a ton of fan service here and it is also advised to watch the past X- Men movies to get the complete gist of Days of Future Past.Bryan Singer once again proves that he's good with an ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Ellen Page all plays noteworthy roles in Days of Future Past. If this isn't star studded, I don't know what is. In almost all the previous X-Men movies Hugh Jackman usually steals the show, and he does most of the heavy lifting here as well but a bit of the limelight is also shared or rather snatched by James McAvoy playing the younger Xavier. McAvoy displays a remarkable performance and brings in layers of emotions to the man in the wheel chair. Michael Fassbender also shines throughout with his cold steel looks and grey shades. Jennifer Lawrence excels in being Mystique as well as sexy and becomes one of the most indispensable characters in the narrative. Boliver Trask wasn't even a dwarf in the original X- Men lore and yet Peter Dinklage nails it, his acting prowess was all that was needed and not his height.The visuals were fairly impressive, but I did notice some itsy bitsy flaws here and there. I loved the way the footages from 1973 had a kind of Eastman color shade to it. The Future Sentinels were impressively rendered and felt daunting indeed. The X-Men theme makes a comeback as well, Thanks to John Ottman. While it wouldn't even come close to Henry Jackman's awe inspiring original score from X-Men First Class, Ottman's score still brought forth a sense of nostalgia.X-Men Days of Future Past is a great comeback for Bryan Singer and some of the faith in him has been restored. It doesn't break any grounds and despite its gaping plot holes and flaws, X-Men Days of Future Past makes for a good entertaining flick. Go watch it!PS: As its tradition, do wait for the credit roll to get over for some awesome Post Credit Sequence paving way to the next in series: X-Men Apocalypse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best,I am going to skip commenting on the movie and just say watch it - if you have not or rewatch to get some more mutant for your money!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You may need an 'X-men refresher' course first,"I've already seen (and even own a few) of the X-men movies (and they various spin-offs/reboots). However, maybe I should have watched a few of them before I sat down to see 'X-men: Days of Future Past.' I will admit to getting a little confused with the plot, but, eventually, I settled into the film.I never could really work out whether the previous film 'First Class' was a reboot, or a prequel. Now I find it was just a prequel, as 'Days of Future Past' now cements the two universes together with that modern lynchpin of science-fiction, time travel.Star Trek got a lot of praise for merging the old and the new cast together (or at least the majority of the fanboys didn't kick off as much as the possible could). So, it seems that every sci-fi franchise feels okay using the 'time travel to create an alternate universe' scenario to gloss over any glitches merging the two films may throw up (Terminator: Genisys, I have my eye on you).We start in the future when giant robots (Sentinels) are mercilessly hunting both mutants and humans alike, cue a trip for our favourite cigar-chomping hero, Wolverine, to take a trip back in time to the seventies in order to make sure this future never sees the light of day. Therefore, the film-makers can crowbar in both the old cast (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and all) with the new lot (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender and so on). And, yes, it works – if you're okay with that sort of 'plot device.' It all feels well at home with the other X-men movies, not to mention distinctly different from Marvel's 'cinematic universe' of Iron Man, the Avengers and co. It's generally darker in tone and more serious, with less one-liners and colourful action. Not that the action isn't colourful (and even spectacular towards the climactic scenes), it just feels pretty computer generated. You get the CGI fiery person, the CGI icy person and the CGI sort of discount T-1000-type person as they battle their way through various CGI robots.But, if you can live with a CGI that probably should be a little better for the budget involved (not to mention (future) Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman's bad haircuts) then you should be able to appreciate this movie. Like I say, I got a little confused by the timelines and what everyone was doing. However, that would probably have been cleared up by watching what came before a little more recently. There's plenty of action, explosions and twists and turns in the plot. Plus – perhaps best of all – is that there's plenty of (fan favourite) Wolverine. Many had criticised his two stand-alone movies, whereas here he seems like the natural star who the film is basically all about. But, it's not just about him – there are plenty of other recognisable faces to entertain – just make sure you know your 'X-men lore' before you spend two hours watching this lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking,"I am going to put this out there and say that the previous X-Men films have missed the mark when it comes to any sort of emotion. What we have been left with is a brutish clash of superpowered beings, loosely held together by Professor X.Days of future past, however, is another league entirely. While it still contains the characteristic marvel glitter and sparkles, the underlying plot and the performances are as moving as they are interesting. The performance from Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy were nothing short of brilliant, two very different interpretations of the same character yet surprisingly believable.Peter Dinklage was a star; his suavity and maleficence was on point, knowing he had the spotlight and using that to the extreme.Another overproduced sci-fi superhero movie? Perhaps. But this time, it had the substance to back it up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Erm, no...","Awful in pretty much every sense.Do not waste your money on this pathetic excuse of an X-men film.The very clever and interesting X-men franchise has now sold out and turned into the mindless summer blockbuster in the Transformers style.Over the top everything, far too much exposition for the retards in the audience, boring story, paper-thin villains, I could go on...I found myself checking my watch a few times during this over-long stinking turd.My partner who is an avid X-men film fan ever since X1, turned to me as we were walking out and said ""well, that was crap""...I had to agree.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I don't know if I just saw the best Superhero movie yet, but I might have.","After seeing this movie I tried to compare it to others I had seen, as I often do. I usually find most of the ones I watch to finish somewhere below the traditional greats: X2, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, Avengers, Superman...until now. I'll have to see it a few more times before the novelty wears off but that may have been the best superhero film I have ever seen. And I stress the word ""film"" because that's the only way I can describe a movie with so many emotional beats, such strong subtext, so many layers, so much complexity and so many gut wrenching moments.From watching Mystique review autopsy files, to painfully watching the X-Men graphically die in a lynch mob of Sentinels can not be describes in comparison to other superhero movies. They felt less like scenes from another cape-inspired summer blockbuster and more like scenes from Schlinder's List.The movie also does an excellent job of being an allegory for racism; the trump card X-Men holds over all other heroes. It means something. Unlike Batman who is a rich playboy, or Iron Man who is a rich playboy or Spider-Man who is a broke supposedly hard luck case who none the less bags tons of pretty ladies, or Cap who is a universally loved war hero, the X-Men are outcasts. As the movie so perfectly depicts, they're lives are not perfect. These characters don't fall into normal caricatures of ""good"" and ""bad"". Everyone is a mix, everyone is broken.There's no pretty girl for them to impress, most of them are not surrounded by wealth and all of them are normal faces who blend into the crowd but are not part of the crowd. The movie makes you feel truly sorry for that.There is no superhero formula in this movie. The good guys don't necessarily ""win"", the bad guys don't even ""lose"". Even with a future averted, the future still is not set. And it leaves you with the feeling that maybe this never ends, and there is more to come. Much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The First Superhero Movie I Liked In a Long Time,"I'm not a fan of superhero comic books, but I'm not against the idea of superhero movies. Its just that few of them escape the clichés of the hundreds of other actions films out there. The Dark Knight was pretty good half a decade ago (tarnished by edgy teenage misanthropes, but that's not TDK's fault), but since then Marvel and DC either didn't interest me or disappointed. I was mildly interested in seeing this due to its high Rotten Tomatoes score, so I chose this for a movie outing with a friend.It was actually a perfectly solid action flick. I wouldn't say it sets a new bar, but it avoided clichés by focusing on character. In fact, action and character development were evenly matched.The conflict between Professor X and Magneto is done surprisingly well. You wouldn't think a superhero movie would do a good job at showing the clashing sides of moderate vs extremist activism, yet both sides are portrayed realistically. Magneto is villainous, of course, but he's not evil for the sake of evil. Professor X believes that humans can be taught to accept Mutants, yet all their crimes make Magneto convinced only one race should reign on Earth. And its not easy to debunk him. Mystique was also well done, not subservient to either side.There was too much gristle in terms of the number of superheros. Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique are the only vital characters to the plot. Wolverine, Beast, and Kitty Pride serve important roles, but don't have a character arc. Perhaps twice as many characters make cameos, but ultimately are forgettable unless you read the comics. The action never wowed me, personally. Some of parts against the Sentinels were cool, but predictable.Regardless, the characters were strong enough to hold the movie for me. A 7/10 may not seem like much, but its above average. I think it deserves its large box office toll, and I'm curious if the sequel can maintain this quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Finally, an X Men Film Done Right","It was immensely satisfying to finally witness an X-Men film that got the fights scenes right. Both scenes that pit the X-Men stand outs against the cartoon-famous Sentinels were highly entertaining, CGI done right. There was a sense of melancholy as well, as we see sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart kick ass in what could be their final reprisal of their iconic roles. Story (and the usual mutant-human melodrama) has its moments. The only downsides in my opinion, JLaw's forgettable acting and James Mcavoy's constant pained expression. Both are rather overplayed and exhausting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good effort, but I expected more from the original comic book movie franchise","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the fifth X-Men film (let's not include the Wolverine movies in this count) and does a good job of linking the original trilogy (2000-2006) to the 2011 prequel, 'X-Men: First Class'. The story starts off in the not-too-distant future (i.e. a decade or so after 'X-Men: The Last Stand'), where the Sentinels have almost hunted mutant-kind - and some of human-kind - to extinction. The plus side of this is that we get to see grown-up Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), Shadow Cat (Page), Storm (Berry), Iceman (Ashmore) & Colossus (Cudmore) - plus new additions Sunspot (Canto), Bishop (Sy), Warpath (Stewart) & Blink (Fan - who? Yeah, even I don't know who Blink is - some sort of weird mix between Nightcrawler & Psylocke) - and how they're living in the Terminator 4-esque future. The solution? Send Wolverine into the past to try to stop the Sentinels from being created. (I'm not sure how Shadow Cat's phasing ability inexplicably lets her transport people to the past...)This is where - in 1973 - we're re-introduced to young Charles (McAvoy) & Eric (Fassbender). There's some good moments as they meet Wolverine for the ""first"" time, including drafting in Quicksilver (Peters). I'm glad they hinted that Magneto is his father, but it's a shame the same actor won't be playing him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. We also meet Dr Trask (Dinklage, solid as ever), the creator of the Sentinel program and find out how Mystique (Lawrence) is out to assassinate him. I'm not sure why the films have so much focus on her, when she's not really that interesting a character in the comics and certainly not as pivotal as the films make her. Beast (Hoult) is good and I'm glad they got one of the original five X-Men in there with Xavier (no sighting of Angel at all!). It all gets slightly confusing, as the ""future"" X-Men fight off Sentinels to stop Wolverine from coming back to the future (had to be said!), while the ""past"" X-Men fight Magneto, Mystique & Sentinels separately!There's some pretty massive set pieces at the end, with all the sets/costumes of the 70s looking great/realistic too (including Nixon!), but it all seemed just a little lacklustre to me. A few things don't quite add up and I had higher expectations from the future battles, as well as from the young Professor X/Magneto dynamic. It felt to me like it was building to something massive and the pay-off wasn't quite there. Sure, it's an enjoyable ending (I'm still looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and does a good enough job of linking the films/characters, but I think Fox bit off more than they could chew. It was a little slow in parts and Wolverine certainly seemed like a passenger with not much to do. There were certainly some fun scenes and some exciting scenes, but not enough to elevate this to 'Avengers' status.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Teirible like my spelling,"They should stop calling these movies X-men. It should just be called Wolverine. I hate what they have done to x-men.

You were robbed of what the X-men really are and that is complex characters with richer struggles and woe.

The Butterfly Effect,"In the future, the mutants and the humans that help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels.

Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel. Will he succeed in stopping Mystique and the Sentinel Program and save the mutants and their human friends from annihilation?The screenplay of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is confused in the beginning of the story but soon there is the explanation of what is happening.

A psychological insight into Superheroes!,"X-men Days of Future Past redefines the genre of smart superhero movie. The movie delves into the psychological depth of the characters that we have admired for decades. It is not just about a war between humans and mutants in this movie. It is more about correcting one's path and believing that by changing your decisions, one can have a better life to live.All the characters face a dilemma of what they must do and what they should do. While Wolverine has a choice whether he should go in past to fix things, young Charles Xavier has a choice to make between pain or power. Mystique faces a choice between exacting revenge on those who hurt or forgive while Magneto faces a choice between following his path or following Charles's wishes.Bolivar Trask clearly thinks of his own dwarfism as a bad form of mutancy and he wishes the world to be rid of the phenomenon. Smart choice to pick Peter Dinkalge for the role who clearly nails it. His own sentinel program is determined by his desire for ""true peace"" but it sounds hollow in the face of the destruction that the sentinel causes 50 years later.This is definitely a smart movie and not just a popcorn flick. Evan Peters is too good as Magneto's illegitimate son Pietro Maximoff. The direction by Bryan Singer is top notch. Clever shifting of scenes in the final segment between past and the future. The momentum and the pace of both the stories is well maintained.I go for a 10 rating for this Marvel venture. Keep it coming.P.S.- Don't miss out on the Post Credit scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvelling in Nostalgia,"""The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods.""That right there was enough to give me a wet dream! Hyped as the X-Men movie that most fans have been waiting for (especially since X2: X-Men United back in 2003 was such a massive leap forward), as a big fan of the original comic series, it lived up to that hype in a BIG way!What so many other super-hero movies fail to do, is to embrace both intimate melodrama and tongue-in-cheekiness to make a spectacular mix of intensity and fun, balanced with just the right amount of interesting characters. Another challenge that this movie masters well, is finding a character that the viewer will cheer for... it most definitely doesn't fall short. (Except for Sentinals. Sentinals are dicks.) Heck, even Tyrion Lannister, and Katniss Everdeen are in this movie! Generally, the faster I finish my popcorn the more exciting the film is, and I did stuff my face very quickly.'Days Of Future Past' also continues the X-Men tradition of being politically and sociologically conscious and relevant, bearing a number of allegorical references that fit squarely with many issues faced in modern society.(Cue philosophical discussions here). The special effects are mighty, the humor is sharp and in abundance and the dialogue is alive & breathing. Even though the film is sometimes erratic, the paradoxes of time-travel are exhilarating and extremely fun to watch, despite the complexities.

"Slightly confusing, still an entertaining watch.","Really had been waiting to watch this installment of the X-Men,one of my favourite series. Needless to say it was far more entertaining than the second Wolverine movie and X Men-3.The story was well written, although would have been better had they explained the time-travel aspect a little more. The story picks up in 2023, when the sentinels have all but eliminated the mutants and the humans who had tried to defend them. The only was is to go back in the past and stop an assassination, that would inturn cause the sentinels to be made.Of the cast, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine marches right from the front. This has been his best portrayal as Wolverine. Jackman's acting is on the rise since Les Miserables and again he was truly impressive. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, were again superb in their respective roles of the younger Professor X and Magneto; especially McAvoy. Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult were also good in their respective roles. However there was not enough screen time for Patrick Stewart(old Professor X), Sir Ian McKellen(old Magneto) and Halle Berry(Storm) to make a mark on the viewers and their performances could be regarded as a guest appearance at the most. Ellen Page, again had hardly any screen time, but did a decent job. The other X Men, sadly to say were wasted. But, this was expected,wasn't it?The major disappointment for me was the lack of a characteristic Marvel soundtrack, that would give a normal guy goosebumps.The energy was totally amiss, because of that. However, like most other Marvel movies there is an end credit scene, which from the looks of it was good and I would like to see the characters shown in that scene, in the next X- Men movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ranks among the best X-Men series,"At first, the idea to unite the old and new face of X-Men team is brilliant but could be risky too. Thankfully Bryan Singer knows what he's doing and seems comfortable with the material it has, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" never get confused or lost with bunch of mutant character and always focus to the main topic. All top form casts are placed where it should be and given almost same portion on each significant character while the plot itself is nicely structured and the future-past time are neatly set. The mixed of action-drama-comedy are put in a right place and never reduce fun factor this movie offers. A hilarious escape scene, thoughtful yet compelling time twisted storyline guided with charismatic performance by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, all ended with stunning action climax, it's a first class entertainment which the fans and non fans of X-men franchise are expecting. Overall ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is an elegant, emotional, entertaining action-packed that is worth to see at any season. And once again Bryan Singer proves himself as an X-Men specialty. He succeeded to bring nostalgia from the original X-Men casts and give more chances for younger member to shine by continuing the respected-solid foundation that Matthew Vaughn had created.

X-Men: Days of Future Past - Aka. The Wolverine 6,"After watching the 6 previous X-men movies, 5 of which where centered around wolverine, I did not have too high expectations for this one. And 10 minutes in when it becomes apparent that this one will also have wolverine as the main character, my eyes rolled back in my head.However, this time they really nailed it. The plot is as tight as you can get with a time traveling plot in an action movie. Yes, the opening is a total ripoff of Terminator 2, yes it's predictable, yes it's too long, yes there are too many characters.However... The pacing is good, the plot is exiting (despite being predictable), the action is really great. The effects are great and not cheap looking. There is plenty of nerdgasem moments and it was great to see the old crew back together.To summarize, it's not Citizen Kane or Donnie Brasco, and to be honest it's probably not even Dark Knight, but I think this is about as good of an X-Men movie as you are going to get.

Raising the bar on sequels,"The sequel/prequel element makes for a complex storyline and there are some 'borrowed' themes from the TERMINATOR and ROBOCOP franchises, but this doesn't interfere with the viewer's enjoyment of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The pace is terrific and the action scenes showcase CGI at its very best. I watched the 2D version, having come to feel that 3D doesn't actually add much to a good movie (or a bad one).Obviously you don't come to a film like this looking for great acting, but all the cast play their roles seriously without any pantomime send- ups. Middle age must be about to catch up with Hugh Jackman, but he's still a hunk. We mostly see the younger versions of Erik and Charles (Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy), but Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen pop up from time to time to add a bit of gravitas. Mark Camacho does a great job of recreating Richard M. Nixon, that most devious of presidents. There's a welcome surprise appearance at the end, and the suggestion that messing with time really does have consequences.DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really raises the bar on sequels and remakes.

The Most Satisfying Mutant Movie So Far,"This film is a hot mess of goings-on that challenge viewers to various degrees for their attention. And in many ways, these efforts are rather successful. Whether you will enjoy this film lies in whether this is an experience you will be all right with. In director Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, we as viewers deal with the presence of two series worth of X-Men casts, a time travel story that forces viewers to juggle a number of plot points in lieu of a more fluid plot, a splattering of subtle references to other elements from the X-Men universe, as well as a mélange of historical and cultural references — some of which exist in a retroactive continuity thanks to the humans with mutant abilities and the effects of their presence in the world.Even though it had been a decade since Bryan Singer directed an X-Men film (2003's X2), he does so here with the confidence and ability a dedicated expert. Singer had a difficult job in reconciling conflicts of story continuity between the first three X-Men films, the Wolverine films, and the series' most recent instalment before this, X-Men: First Class. But Singer manages to bring everything together and adjust the details so that they make sense for the most part.More committed fans of the franchise and the comic books will probably take issue with conflicts that would be more glaring to them, but as a general movie-going experience, the film is far from unpleasant. In fact, it's rather exciting. It's a time-travelling adventure, and as such, it carries with it consequences on a scale much grander than previous films in the franchise. This film creates much grander stokes befitting a world filled with super-human beings. It also jumps ahead in creating what feels like a much more expansive mutant-filled universe that has been around for much longer than we viewers have seen up to this point — especially if we consider the post-credits scene and the deep implications it carries, which viewers familiar with the X-Men comic book universe will instantly understand.The plot of the film itself is adapted from one of the comic book franchises most legendary story arcs. It's a story from 1981 where mutants in the future are hunted to near-extinction. A member of the X- Men travels back in time so they may alter history. The heart of the film is easily the interplay between the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the young Erik Lensherr, or ""Magneto"" (Michael Fassbender), as they struggle in a heart-wrenching back-and-forth over the troubles their friendship faces and their hopes for the future of mutant-kind. Their future counterparts, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, accomplish much to convey the grim and dire situation their young selves fight to erase. There's a tone in this movie unmatched by any of the other occasions where these actors have portrayed these characters on film.Ellen Page, in her role as ""Kitty Pryde,"" is worthy to further recognition as well. Her character, whose ideas and power prove to be a lynchpin to the whole movie's plot, is an intelligent, brave, fearless soldier who proves herself to be just as multidimensional in character as any of the actors and characters that have come before her in this film franchise. Plus, Peter Dinklage, of Game of Thrones fame, makes for a curious villain, as he not only seeks to eliminate mutant-kind but also proves at the same time to be fascinated by them, making him far from the one-dimensional villain many feared he would be. Ultimately, it may be Jennifer Lawrence as the ever-popular character ""Mystique"" who steals the show. She's just as much a lynchpin to this cast as Ellen Page, exercising her well-established acting skills with wildly successful finesse and depth of emotion.The plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past is easily the most satisfying in the franchise's history — and the most fluid. It drops the need to reintroduce old characters, doesn't spend too much time on new characters, and moves immediately towards the plot that carries this film towards its end. This approach reflects self-confidence in the film franchise, as it assumes fans who are familiar with the series are in fact familiar with the series. The franchise is so popular that it doesn't have to spend much time re-introducing characters and recapping previous events in the franchise. Perhaps this is a presumptuous move, but it proves very helpful in terms of efficient plot delivery. It uses the audience's presumed fandom to move faster and go further than it could if it were continually stopping to reintroduce characters and explain the setting — which is good, because this instalment is perhaps the most narrative-driven. The downside to this is approach is that this makes the film less of a movie to new fans and crafts itself more towards as product for returning fans.In the end, the film is definitely worth the price of admission. It makes for an adventurous, fantasy-filled piece of alternative history storytelling and emotionally compelling action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-meh: What's the last thing you remember? The Opening sequence.,"The hype may have left me ultimately underwhelmed. For a film which was chalked full of potential, I can't help but feel it could have been a lot better. No denying it was a good film, on the same level as X2 and First Class give or take half a star. The future scenes were immense, Sentinels were insanely overpowered! Quicksilver's part was as good as it was brief. The best parts of the film were so short that throughout the rest of the film, I longed for more, rather than appreciating the Mystique Show. I felt Wolverine particularly wasn't used properly. The past really missed out on introducing characters to the full story rather than just the 1 in a bit-part role. Overall, a good superhero film, but not the classic I hoped for and in all honesty, expected.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-Men: Days of ""Future Sh!!e""","If I could give this movie (notice I didn't say ""X-Men movie"") zero stars, I would. OK, so here we go...we're enjoying the little reminder of the first two movie intro's (this one's in a similar style. We've had a bit of dramatic action...I don't think it's really a spoiler to now tell you that this is where some ""time travel"" is involved. Aaaand...that's where I shot the director, your honour. How did Singer go from a good film maker, a director of fair detail, to THIS... :o/Specifically, and again, I don't think I'm ""spoiling"" anything here; we here young ""Professor X"" speak a bit. Waitaminute...let me back up a minute or two first, before I get to it...In the future time, where we see Professor X and Wolverine have a conversation about imminent time travel, Patrick Stewart tells Wolverine, ""I was very different back then""......What he neglects to mention is that he has had some sort of lobotomy, or brain surgery...which has resulted in him speaking in a VERY near as damn it, full-on broad COCKNEY ACCENT when ""he"" was younger. When the hell was Xavier EVER been a cockney? As if this weren't enough of a travesty (incidently, I immediately had nightmarish Iron Man 3 flashbacks at this point lol), our younger ""Xavier"" uses the following phrases while talking to Wolverine:""Bloody"" (as in the swear word)...OK, I can let that slide...it'd be easier though, IF he didn't sound like he were talking about jellied eels... - ""P!!! off."" (again, sounding like he might, at any minute, ask you if he can have a CAP of tea). - ""F!!! off!"" (same deal with the accent). - ""Future sh!te."" Hence, my title to this review.The last three phrases are just SO out of character for Charles Xavier it's unreal. Plus, he obviously shouldn't sound anything like a cockney. For the love of all that is holy GIVE THIS FRANCHISE TO A STUDIO WHO CARES ABOUT GETTING IT RIGHT. I'm totally sick of this now... ..Yeah, I know it's a slim chance anybody with the power to change things might see my review, but in case you wondered, *that's* why I put that in capitals.I love the X-Men, but that's not what this is. You're being lied to. A lot was changed for X1 & X2, but I could deal. Every film since then though, has been a smack in the face to the viewing public. Credit to the person who cast Kelsey as beast in X3, though...perfect choice for how BEAST should speak. There are good actors out there, all we need are some decent writers, and directors who care about detail getting the directing gigs again. Patrick Stewart, is pretty much just dialing it in now, in his film performances. As he did in the abomination that was ST Nemesis....If you could buy a Malibu beach house off the back of a terrible movie script though, would you say no to the job? ;oD Not many would. Anyway, I waffle. But seriously ladies and gents. I advise against paying to see this ""movie"" if you care anything for film. Even ""movies"" shouldn't get character details THIS incorrect. And let's bare in mind, this is meant to be kiddie friendly, and the more you feed the wh*remongers a.k.a. the MPAA and the BBFC (who at this point BOTH need to be given their marching orders), the more they'll keep crossing the line, resulting in screwing up society further still. The power to improve the quality of viewing material (or listening material) is in your hands. Use it. And, my advice is see this movie, if you must....BUT...for the love of common sense DON'T PAY anything to see it. It's up to you though...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The best superhero movie yet? I still have a few to catch up on, but this looks like a serious contender.","Having been suitably impressed by the trailers, I really wanted to check this one out on the big screen before it went to DVD, but was slightly concerned by the fact that I had yet to see X-Men: First Class. I needn't have worried: although many of the events in this latest adventure do refer to the previous movie, for the most part I found it fairly easy to fill in the blanks for myself, and am happy to report that I had an absolute blast with what has got to be one of the finest superhero films ever made.An excellent cast, mind-blowing special effects, amazing direction by Bryan Singer, a fun time-twisting plot, Jennifer Lawrence in the buff (well, covered in blue paint and a few scales, but that's good enough for me!), the secret behind the assassination of JFK: X-Men: Days of Future Past is pure entertainment from start to spectacular finish. The 131 minutes just fly by.Although the basic plot mightn't be considered all that fresh—it's the old 'change the past to alter the future' scenario—the whole thing is so beautifully written and skilfully executed that any lack of originality is easily forgiven. The entire cast do an excellent job, with special props going out to Peter Dinklage for his awesome Anchorman style hair-do and 'tache, and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who provides the film with its most enjoyable moment, using his incredible lightning speed to save the other mutants whilst taking down an entire team of armed special agents.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"9,5 (Put to a 9), should be seen by everybody who has liked any of the others, and thank Apocalypse that Bryan Singer is back!","X-Men: Days of Future Past review, from the sound of a nerd. Hello everybody and welcome to Sound of The Nerds' first review, this one is coming from Toby.Visual Presentation: The movie has a ""right"" feel of the 70's era. Using heavily CGI, which looks great, the movie emphasizes large monsters, and beautiful powers. The coloring really shows the difference between a dark desolate future, and the bright and hopeful 70's.""Am I the only one who's dying to see the costumes (-Hank McCoy)? The 70's era has no ""X-Men costumes"" as the X-Men at the time don't exist. Whatsoever, seeing Magneto in something very much resembling his classic was fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence ditched a costume to don a body suit, and looks amazing as mystique. McAvoy looks nothing like the Charles I know, but created a unique twist to him, that adds character. The biggest surprise was Quicksilver, whom in the trailers looked ridicules, but in the actual movie, it was quite good, the costume really added to his character. Beast has become more feral, more alike his true self.In the Future everything looks darker. The old cast hasn't really changed that much, and their costumes remain true to what they have been, but the little things do improve. The biggest difference is Shadowcat moving from a normal teenage mutant in The Last Stand to becoming a war torn soldier in Days. The new guys was visually impressive, especially Blink and Bishop, they very much look like a realistic version of themselves from the comic books. The fighting scenes were very good, especially in the future.The first time, watching cerebro in 3D? For me that was the singular greatest moment in the movie! It was really amazing, and felt like a way of getting closer to understanding Charles.Sound: There isn't much to say about the sound of the movie. The soundtrack was unnoticeable, some will say this is a good attribute to the movie, others will say that it is the exact opposite, I like the fact that it was unnoticeable. Whatsoever, the one part that stuck in my head was Wolverine listening to ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" fitting both the time, and the character from the comics. Other than this, at sometimes I recognized some similarities in the score between Days and previous movies. Story: I will keep this very clear of spoilers, and do note that as a fan this is the most important part of the movie to me. The story really does what Singer wanted to do, and is used very much as an eraser. It tries to maintain true to the story from the comics, using Shadowcat as a means to time travel, as she was the one who traveled back in time in the comics. Whatsoever, this left me with one question, how does ""phasing"" as in moving thru place turn into the power to move others thru time? If it was made clear this was in accordion with Xavier's telepathy (it was telepathy in the books) it would be easier to swallow. Other questions do surface, how is Xavier alive? Why does Magneto have his powers back? Why does Wolverine have adamantium claws again? I can't answer these questions, but I do hope they will be answered in bonus scenes from the DVD.The movie really ties up everything the X-Men is, a constant struggle for survival, and putting your life on risk for those who hate you. The addition of the new characters like Bishop, Blink and Quicksilver was well done; they all got appropriate screen time according to their back story and importance to their story, and most importantly expanding on the entire universe. The main story circles around Wolverine, Magneto and Xavier, with other important parts by Beast and Mystique. Whatsoever I missed Banshee, Emma Frost, Rogue, so I really wanted more of the old cast back, especially in the past, with only four recurring characters.Following the other movies, it feels mostly like a sequel to First Class, for me personally this was a huge setback, I was expecting to see the original cast more than they actually was featured, because of the way the movie has been advertised, I expected more of them, and many explanations that never arrived. Overlooking that, the movie did make the shifts between future and past smooth. The second time I saw it, knowing how little the future was going to be featured, I understood why the shifts were made when they was made.Cast: Having some of the best actors of past and present, it contains some of the best talent. Patrick Stewart is the same Charles we all know, and hearing him was a wonder. Whilst the two Xavier are vastly different, Fassbender is very much only a younger McKellen. And one of the scenes Fassbender has, on-board a plane, he shows so much power, and only in words, portraying the same Magneto I know and love, and proving him to be the strongest surprise. The new additions also did a good job, the most noticeable of them was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. The cast was as wonderful as ever. Seeing McKellen and Stewart again was amazing, although short lived.Overall: A wonderful summer movie,great action adding to a great story This movie finally ties together all the previous movies. The second best X-Men movie ever made, this is a must see, although the others should be seen firstly. Setting up the future of the franchise, this is the movie you must see this summer!+ Fassbender and McAvoy's chemistry + The notes to the comics + Charles high and drunk! - Too little concentration on the future part - Leaves you with more questions, then it answered",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X Men First Class was better...,"All I can say is that I expected more! The hype for this really made me believe that Days of Future Past was going to top the last film: First Class. I found it to be average. How is this listed under IMDb's Top 250. The plot = relatively average. On the bright side the few action scenes( excluding those from the ""future"") were pretty good, but nothing amazing.I really enjoyed X Men: First Class, but this one made me lose faith in Summer Blockbusters again. It's not a bad film at all, the performances were good and the dialogue, not bad, but this movie suffers from being too ordinary and with movies like the Avengers on such an epic scale the Xmen franchise needs to up its game!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie raises the bar for future X-Men movies...,"OK, I have to admit that I am impressed. I am not overly keen on superhero movies, and the previous X-Men movies have been adequate entertainment, sure, but ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" really put all previous X-Men movies to shame.The storyline here is really well thought through and executed equally well. And whereas the previous movies have been entertaining, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" also gives the audience something to think about. This installment to the series is more than just another action movie, it actually challenges the audience.As with the previous movies, the cast is impressive, and people are still doing great jobs with their given roles and characters, and that really shows on the screen. Each character did bring something unique to the story and the movie, of course some more than others, especially those around which the story was centered.I liked the concept idea of having to go back in time to change the future. Granted, there is nothing new in that idea by far, but it was done in a nice way in the movie, and it did start some thoughts. I started to think 'so if they go back in time to change history, what about the events that transpired in all the previous movies?'. But after a bit more thought, then it dawned on me that it was actually genius, because that would mean that the events that happened in the previous movies were all byproducts of the change in history, and what was shown in those movies differed from what actually should have been show. So in that sense, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" does give the audience something to think about.As for the effects, well it was as with all previous X-Men movies, great and up to date. Lots of really great CGI effects and some great display of interesting mutant abilities. And while Blink did have some interesting power, I couldn't help but notice that somewhere along the line someone had played a bit too much ""Portal"".Anyway, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a really entertaining movie and it does justice to all the previous X-Men movies. This particular movie is by far the best in the series so far, and I can highly recommend it, even if you, like me, are not too fond of superheroes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally the X-men film the franchise needed,"The plot is as complicated as the title itself, but it's done so masterfully that there's no scope for complaints.The acting is superb, and the chemistry between the cast members is noteworthy. It grips you instantly from the get-go with an elaborately orchestrated action sequence, and keeps you on the hook till the very end.Even when there's not much going on-screen, the emotional intensity feels very real and palatable.The introduction of Quicksilver couldn't be any better. He steals every scene that he's in, and makes vital contributions whenever he's needed. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine. Only this time he shows his depth of the character in a more vulnerable and experienced way.There is a couple of surprises throughout the film, and the inclusion of humor every now and then- makes the movie worth every penny!The conflict of ideologies between the Professor and Magneto is impartially depicted. And the dark past of a few major characters is carefully handled.Overall, a solid A+. And a must-see film of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Extremely Far-fetched, but Filled With Emotions and Ambitions.","A very different kind of X-Men movie, director Bryan Singer takes a risky script and delivers it, for the most part, with exceptional poise and craft that he has displayed many times before.The character interactions are full of high stakes emotions, and a real sense of desperation, not just to their past but also their future. The film succeeds in crossing over and passing the torch in this unique but not necessary way.However it does take a considerable time for the action to really kick in, and there are times the crazy dialogue gets too close to being on the silly side. It also doesn't go deep enough into why we should care about the future world with the limited and confusing world building and its lack of historic storytelling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BAD Movie. Do Not  Watch Paying Full Price or in 3D !!,"Simple review of a person who went to the comic book stores since the early 90s.Do Not WASTE Your Money On This Especially in 3D !!!!List of Reasons this was barely bearable to watch:Absolutely Bad Action - Moved like a Drama on Late night (waaay too much dialogue) - Action sequences were not worth $15+ admission prices - Absolutely no character build-up; in a marvel universe where character build-up can be used to enhance the movie experience as a whole. - Very weak use of powers. yea magneto and Raven: Yay for the win, not !! - disjointed character action, people doing things based on a compelling comic series, chopped to bit-scenes, lame - the sentinels look like students did the cgi(even ravens cgi was bad) - useless stretched out conversational scenes, WAAAAY TOOOO LONG (found me dosing off into my own mind wondering ""What the hell are they talking about"",get back to the action)Comparatively does not even hold a candle to the Original X-men Prequel. this was stale movie and i'm mad and wanting my money back. the only thing I will take from this is whoa that was worse compared to the trilogy, and the prequel. maybe worst than the wolverine spin offs.Conclusion: the story was all there (as its all in the comic), but the execution, the execution was a total fecal matter. I think the people in the credits probably all signed in to IMDb on multiple accounts and leave reviews, with more compelling literature that the movie script itself.the only thing that actually hit a nerve was the talk between the old and new Charles Xavier, and oddly was very intrigued by the development of Stryker, everything else was very weak, even wolverines cgi arms or make-up couldn't lift this movie. boy this failed to deliver something that could have been amazing, miscasting, odd character emphasis, Fassbinder couldn't save this sinking ship, ice-man still was bad especially in this one, I still cant help but love captain Piccard as Professor X. everything else is beyond dis-heartening and not worth watching. Do not waste your time or money watch it at home or on cheap day !! -",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite X-Men Film,"This is a well told story. The time travel is so complicated, but it is easy to follow. Xavier is truly the focal point. The Wolverine is only there to get a ball rolling and create this change. Erik and Xavier are still having the same argument they are making in every other film and Mystique still doesn't know who to side with. She can't decide what she wants to be. She has to choose her own path. Mystique is brilliantly acted in this film by Jennifer Lawrence. I loved her portrayal in First Class and anyone should be glad about this performance because she turns into Rebecca Romijn. James McAvoy falls away in this role and equally brilliant in his role is Michael Fassbender. Each of these men give the characters a dynamic that is so much better in this film. The weaknesses of some of the first films is the fact that the didn't get a lot of screen time together, but in this film they get to play out their struggles to each other and fight over their beliefs. Mystique is in the middle and she has to fight the both of them. Magneto is the villain of the past in this film and it is so great to see that he still the same Magneto that we love. A man who is hurt from his experiences. Nicholas Hoult is also really cool as Beast and his change is also explained. Hoult is there as a support for Xavier and it takes a talent to be able to handle your own against Hugh Jackman. Hugh Jackman is Huge Jacked Man. He is the most fit person I have ever seen in my life and is brilliant in his role as Wolverine. Hugh takes this to a new level and his also added dimension. Trask is a villain that you get what he is doing and has a clear motivation that I really enjoyed. Peter Dinklage's height is pleasantly absent from the script and is satisfying for this character and actor. You don't like Trask, but you can see where he is coming from. Peter is even one of the best parts of the film. His comedy and action blows you out of the water. The hint at the his relations to Magneto and it isn't very overbearing about it. His action scene is also so good that it is on the level of Nightcrawler's raid on The White House.I also have to give a hand to Bryan Singer. I believe that it is hard to come back to a franchise a couple films removed and he did an excellent job. He was able to go from future to past so seamlessly that it is really cool and the action is so well directed. You also have to give a hand to Simon Kinberg and Mathew Vaughn as well because they also had to write this story that seamlessly goes between times and each time brings its own feeling and that comes from the writing itself. Kinberg does a great job of bringing in the funny comedic moments without it going into silliness. The special effects are really great and are well done. The sentinels in the past looked like a newly made creation with the limitations of the time and the future sentinels are well explained why they look like that and are quite frightening. The time travel is so well done that you give credit to the people behind the camera who have to set it up well.The future in itself is its own film. Each of the introduced mutants don't just seem like characters that need to be there so they can die or CGI tricks. They each get a moment to bring some kind of emotion to the screen. Professor X an Magneto in the future are so well done that they are friends and you get to see them together and you just enjoy yourself by seeing it. The future sentinels, like I said, are scary. They are frightening. When every future scene comes on my heart is pounding because of how well the suspense is built. The history of this film is so interesting that you can see where the future might be going, but you don't know how its going to get there.I am flabbergasted about how well this film balances the time travel aspects and while being a pretty dark film and also balances the comedy as well. The time travel might over complicate the already confusing canon of the X-Men universe, but I only question it because of how good this film does on so many other levels of fixing the canon. Singer returns with a competent direction with the help of Kinberg's well written script. The action and effects is spectacular. Each actor gives a great performance that helps blend the two times together even more fluently. I am fan of superhero films that are simultaneously another genre at the same time. This is a great time travel film and a great superhero film. This is a great film and deserves a 3.75 out 4 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: Days of Future Past is a Fantastic Superhero Movie!,"I couldn't have said it better myself, or anyone else. This X-Men instalment is THE X-Men film that the fans have been anticipating since the beginning. I can even go ahead and say that this is the one that will even convert non-fans into fans, it's that good.Days of Future Past reinvents what the series can do in such a fresh way, without rebooting it completely may I remind you. Most of all it is a time travel film, and there are some issues with the continuity but all can be forgiven after sitting through this film completely. It mends all the mistakes of the past X-Men films (in terms of quality) and feels closer to the comics than the first three movies.I have to admit that I keep comparing too many superhero movies to The Dark Knight in terms of the story and the characterisation, but I only compare Days of Future Past to it in the ""reinventing the franchise"" way and also telling a bigger story that is darker and meaner. It gets so much right: The Sentinels, Wolverine, and the mixing of the all-star cast of X-Men 1-3 (including Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) and even the cast from X-Men: First Class (featuring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender).The story, the direction, the editing, the music and particularly Quicksilver's soon-to-be classic scene, all adds up to one thrilling ride that doesn't deserve to be missed by any X-Men fan out there. I couldn't recommend this movie enough. It's like Avengers but with a whole world of weird and wonderful mutants.A well deserved 9/10 is what this movie gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best comic book movie yet,I was somewhat unsure of what to expect when I went to watch this newest installment of the X-Men franchise. While the X-Men franchise has produced some remarkable films (like the original X-men) many have left me leaving the theater with a rather large dose of disappointment. After researching X-Men: Days of Future Past I couldn't help but feel a certain amount of optimism.This movie absolutely delivered! Right from the very beginning the viewer is launched into a world of dread and hopelessness. All of mutant kind has been driven to the point of extinction. With their options dwindling the X-Men decide to send on of their members to 1973 in order to try and undo the present.Everything in the film is well done. The visuals are fantastic. The graphics are state of the art. The storyline is brilliant. There was never a point during the movie where I felt I knew what was going to happen next. I was very happy to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen reprise their roles as Charles Xavier and Magneto. They have truly brought their characters to life in a very real way.If you are looking for film that has it all then this is a must see. From start to finish you will quite literally be left on the edge of your seat. In my opinion this film sets a very high standard of what a comic book movie should be.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the action-packed X-men I want,"Mostly Cons, hardly Pros.Pros: As everyone is saying, the beginning fight and the Quicksilver gig.Cons:Few action scenes: what you see from all the trailers are just about what you get in the movie. Not much more.Where's the thrill when x-men leveraging their special powers to fight each other?Too many preachy, crappy, unnecessary, repetitve and disrupting dialogs. Design compelling epic action scenes to convey your cause next time, Mr.Singer.Too much focus on Lawrence, Jackman and Fassbinder makes a crappy script -- X-mens should be about all the mutants making the best of their special powers. Depending too much on actor/actress popularity just kills the film.My personal preference order is 1st class=X1>X3>X2 >>>>>>>>Future past>Wolverin Sagas.Future past is this bad, just above Wolvering Sagas.Let's see how many fiascoes in a streak Singers had after X2.2006 Superman Returns. 2008 Valkyrie 2013 Jack the Giant Slayer 2014 Days of future pastMr. Singer, if you're too busy being a producer, let some other talent direct it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Comic enjoyment intertwines with top notch acting and excellent human drama,"In the convoluted time-travelling plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past, Fox molds two X-Men franchises into one, by colliding the future mutants, now living in the post-Sentinel cleansing wastelands of Earth with the past versions of themselves from Nixon-era 1970s. With mutant genocide bringing about the collapse of civilisation, the remnants of the mutants, including core X-Men members: Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Warpath (Booboo Stewart) and the once infamous Magneto (Ian McKellen) attempt one last daring ploy to avert the imminent disaster. This means Wolverine must be sent into the past with the use of Kitty Pryde's powers to stop the murder of Sentinel mastermind Dr Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) by mutant rights activist turned rogue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The future's hope lays in averting the past - thus Wolverine must force the downtrodden and resigned drunkard Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the imprisoned Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) to stop the occurrences of days to come from ever coming into being. Only Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and a fickle youth Quicksilver (Evan Peters) are willing to aide the best at what he does...Amongst the many faucets of success of Bryan Singer in he reclaiming of the franchise, one seems to be strongly undervalued by most viewers. Despite an onslaught of characters the X-Men are rejuvenated thanks to one simple truth: not all character need to be character studies and albeit each of the cast receives their moment in the limelight, the X-Men resonate all so much more strongly that the super-powered mutants need no introduction. To a varying extent introduced in previous episodes of the series, most of the characters function as direct imprints from the comics, cartoon series or previous movies with the entire mythology appropriated to them. They need not be presented, delved in, they just function as part of a well-oiled team of superheroes. Much like in the comics the movie finally understands that focus can only be placed on a select number of characters, the rest operate within action sequences to wow the audience into submission, while the drama evolves around just a few in their midst.Thankfully also focus shifts away from Wolverine, the franchises most important and recognisable character, towards the trio of Professor X, Eric Lensherr and Mystique. Wolverine still features heavily in the plot, but is mostly a backup cast member with limited impact on proceedings, but with charm and character attributes helping to liven up the story throughout. Nonetheless McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence shine with a well-thought out plot centred around the morality of Mystique and the dark path she has chosen to follow. Support cast is unanimously superb within their characters, even if they receive but a few minutes of screen time they each memorably capture their moments: Storm is godlike and enchanting, Colossus is almighty, Blink has a lingering presence, Iceman is all-powerful, while Magneto of the past and future display their otherworldly power. Quicksilver naturally steals the show, but Singer has improved in leaps and bounds in his presentation of fight sequences. Only Bishop cries out for more screen time and focus, which hopefully he will receive come X-Men: Apocalypse.Also thoroughly enjoyed the teamwork, so key to the comic book, that is on show throughout all the future sequences of battles with Sentinels.It says a lot that the two mayor flaws of the movie are its short runtime of 130 minutes (it honestly feels like the movie could easily go on for another 60 or so minutes and never lose traction on the audience) and the fact that we have to wait for the next episode of the series for another 2 years (how I wish this was a mega-budget several episode series...). Minor faults of the feature are some laboured story, which at times struggles to piece together the plot holes of past episodes, and the somewhat funny, but ultimately jarring, jokes centred around Magneto's supposed involvement in the assassination of J.F.Kennedy.By far the best comic-book movie of the year and arguably only inferior to ""The Dark Knight"". The mouthwatering prospect of X-Men: Apocalypse is just too far away to bear...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Way too convoluted and often baffling, but thoroughly entertaining anyway.","People walked out of Days of Future Past with one phrase on their lips; ""definitely the best X- Men movie."" With our market over-saturated with Marvel and there being 6 other X-Men movies in the last 15 years, does that sentence really mean anything? Does that make it something of worthy value to cinema? I just wanted to know if it was good on a scale of all movies. The answer is no, but a mild no, I'm still partial to X-Men 2, but while Days of Future Past was entertaining, it's very flawed. First problem is that it doesn't have a first act, it just dives straight in after a huge cringeworthy exposition dump. It's a totally clunky introduction which followed one of their best action sequences in a long time.It takes a long time to sink back into the narrative after a series of painfully bad dialogue that shows a complete lack of confidence. At times it's just way too convoluted, but that might be just because I haven't watched any X-Men movie since First Class and I'm rusty. There's a lot of chronology where I'm not sure what's changed or fixed or whatever. The problem is that the antagonistic force requires a big suspension of disbelief that I'm not prepared to give. It's a film very derivative of its inspirations and in particular in that regard, The Matrix. But predictability aside, it has some very involving and colourful action scenes that make up for any moments where I'm lost.Mutant fighting is always a joy to watch and Fassbender and McAvoy prove their worth as Magnetic and Professor X. I could take or leave the Quicksilver stuff but I get why he's popular. However, the film does do a great job at raising the stakes with a tiny shot of emotional resonance in its biggest moments and I think that's partly why the film works much better than other blockbusters this year, even if its first act misstep shoots itself in the foot. I guess it depends on the backstory from the other movies but I can't quite figure out at what point it's entering from. Days of Future Past is just real easy to watch with plenty of lights (aka crowded with characters) buzzing at once to keep you occupied for two hours. We know what worse looks like anyway.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superb celebration of the entire X-men franchise!,"One of the most eagerly awaited superhero films of the decade (if not, like, EVER), 'X-men Days of Future Past' certainly hasn't been crushed by the weight of ginormous expectations placed on it - rather, it has far surpassed those expectations to become one of the greatest comic- book films of all time. In my opinion, DOFP may well lay claim to inclusion in an elite club of superhero films that includes The Dark Knight and The Avengers.Indeed, Bryan Singer's task in DOFP was far more ambitious in some ways than Joss Whedon's mission with 'The Avengers'. This time, it wasn't a bunch of superheroes that had to be united on screen, but rather two disparate franchises within the X-men franchise - the world of the original X-men trilogy (with Jackman, Stewart, McKellan et. all), and the 'prequel' world of 'X-men First Class (with Hoult, Fassbender, McAvoy et. all). And he does so masterfully, uniting the two eras of the franchise into one cohesive whole...further developing the younger cast of 'First Class' while also giving a fitting tribute to the ones who started it all.Hugh Jackman of course is the star of the movie, who literally bridges the two casts just as his character Wolverine uses time-travel to bridge the two eras. But the true protagonist of this film is James McAvoys's younger Charles Xavier. In 1973, Charles is a far cry from the wise mentor and leader embodied by Patrick Stewart - he is a tortured soul, a drug-addict who has numbed his mutant powers in order to be able to sleep peacefully, a man who has seemingly lost his purpose. In an interesting inversion of their relationship from the original films, Logan is forced to mentor the young Charles and set him down the path to becoming the legendary Professor X. Michael Fassbender does a great job as the younger, more militant Eric Lensherr/Magneto. And Jennifer Lawrence's Raven/Mystique is of course the lynchpin of the film's time- travel plot. When we last saw her in 'First Class', she was torn between the opposing paths of Charles and Eric. The original trilogy would have us believe she is destined to become Magneto's ally and fellow mutant terrorist...but if this film teaches us anything, its that the 'future is not set'...Despite the focus on the 'First Class' cast (Wolverine notwithstanding), many of the characters from the original cast get their moments to shine in the midst of the final desperate battle with the mutant-killing Sentinels-most notably Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde, Patrick Stewart's older Professor X, and Ian McKellan's Magneto. Also, while the film in many ways functions as a direct sequel to 'First Class', owing partly to the time-travel plot and partly to the return of franchise creator Bryan Singer, this film feels more or less like a spiritual sequel to X2 - from the use of the soundtrack of that movie, to a number of homages and callbacks to that movie.On the whole, DOFP is both an ending and a beginning (a fitting thing for a time travel movie to be!) and leaves you excited for the next installment in this, the longest-running superhero franchise ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice story with superb effects!!!,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is a 2014 superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics.

"Was not sure what to expect, but I ended up enjoying the latest X-men film","I am one of the few people out there that apparently enjoyed X-men: The Last Stand. I thought the film had the best battle scene of the original trilogy as it actually had the first real team battle instead of being Wolverine versus various mutants and people. I had heard that this one was going to wipe away that film, but in reality, this film pretty much wipes all those films away, but does so in a bit more imaginative fashion. Like a reboot, but not in a way. We get the cast of the old films and the ones from First Class in a time travel story that works for the most part.The story has the mutants in a desperate situation as Sentinels have been created to cleanse the Earth of all existing mutants. We witness, right away, the terror they can inflict as they wipe out some of the toughest mutants around with ease. This Sentinels adapt to their targets and are able to inflict great damage. Well after this group of mutants is wiped out, we see them alive and well as one of the mutants, Shadowcat, can now send a person back into their former self and that person then warns of the impending Sentinel attack and they then abandon their hiding spot and find a new location. Professor Xavier and Magneto are now on the same side and Professor X has a plan to send his consciousness back into his former self to the time the Sentinel program took off and stop Mystique from killing a man by the name of Trask as this leads to her capture and her ability to morph leads to the super adaptable Sentinels. Unfortunately, Professor X can not survive the time jump, but Wolverine can. He makes his way into the past and must convince not only Professor Xavier, but also Magneto that they must stop Mystique and thus stop the horrific future.The story was pretty good and I liked that Beast played a huge role in this film. I also enjoyed Quicksilver's time in the movie. Still, the emphasis is on Wolverine, young Professor Xavier and young Magneto. Granted, the best action takes place in the future as the Sentinels once again locate the remaining mutants hiding place. They did a lot of good things here, but I am a bit perplexed as to why they insist on making Mystique such a huge part of these movies. I can understand Wolverine, as he was everybody's favorite and he was in the comics a whole lot, but when I collected comics heavily for three years I literally did not have but maybe two comics with Mystique in it. One a back issue featuring Cable's first appearance and another an annual that had a couple of short stories detailing the downfall of her group Freedom Force. While perplexed, it did provide for an interesting story and so I guess I will roll with it even though I find it highly unfair that the females who saw this got to see Wolverine's bare buttocks while all us guys get is a smurf with all the best parts distorted.In the end, I really enjoyed this X-men film more than I thought I would and I am also very excited about the next film that will finally feature another X-men villain that should have been featured before now considering the amount of X-men movies there are now. The film did have some strange moments and there were some off screen deaths that were a bit puzzling and I did not care for, but overall the film had some nice action and an interesting enough storyline to keep it all together and not seem like a film where they were simply trying to shove every mutant possible into the film just because they could.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horribly overrated extremely flawed film. I don't recommend it.,"In the future Sentinels are hunting and killing mutants, in an attempt to save mutantkind Wolverine is sent back to the past to change the future.Movies that take on time travel take a huge risk, it generally makes for a flawed film. After seeing several good reviews about X-men: Days of Future Past I hoped it would be good. Nope.First off the explanation for time traveling is just a cheap mutant ability to keep fans from questioning it. They also use the same excuse to exclude the butterfly effect from occurring.Secondly the current timeline that is supposed fix all connection problems from the original trilogy to X-men: First Class is so horribly flawed I truly don't understand how fans can stick up for this nonsense.The action scenes were mediocre, nothing amazing. The acting, uninteresting. They have great talent like Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters and make them look like they're B-list forgettable actors. Its really sad.This movie is so horribly overrated by fanboys that it currently resides on the IMDb's top 250 list. Its rated higher then classic films like the original Planet of the Apes and Arsenic and Old Lace.This is dumb filmmaking for audiences who want to watch loads of special effects and lame but good looking actors. Wanna watch a new action film with good characters and emotions? Try Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A film with logic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This deftly scripted and unusually affecting film is truly memorable.,"X-Men: Days Of Future Past marks the end of an era. The cast that people got used to over the last 15 years makes its final appearance. It's a bit sad to see actors like Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) go because they were so charismatic in their roles. In this film too they show their excellent acting abilities. It's actually nice to see familiar faces return. Halle Berry (Storm), Shawn Ashmore (Iceman) and Daniel Cudmore (Colossus) took part in the action, while others returned to nicely conclude everything at the end. Days Of Future Past is a sequel to both The Last Stand (2006) and First Class (2011). The satisfying ending isn't the only thing that director Bryan Singer was thorough with. This sequel has been called the best X-Men film yet by some reviewers. My opinion is that First Class is the best X-Men film so far, but Days Of Future Past is just about as good. But let's not forget about X2 (2003), which is another worthy contender for the best X-Men film. I'm not someone who likes the X-Men films much. I think that none of them have been perfect so far. They all have something that prevents them from being great films or some of the best superhero films. They're first and foremost blockbusters that are meant to entertain. Some scenes in Days Of Future Past can be seen again and again, especially the spectacular opening sequence that introduces a nightmarish new threat. In terms of action Singer is at the top of his game here. The tone is softened after the incredibly grim introduction. Some may think this wise, but once Wolverine is in the past the film loses momentum, introduces characters that aren't very interesting, humor that isn't very funny, action that isn't very exciting, and details that aren't very clever. Some people may think that Magneto's connection to the JFK assassination was clever but, in my opinion, it was handled poorly by Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The film slows down noticeably in the middle. This minor problem is what prevents me from giving Days Of Future Past a very good rating. What happens at the end though is just as interesting and entertaining as what happens at the beginning. The action is terrific and John Ottman's good score is used to great effect. Days Of Future Past is a long film, with 131 minutes of running time. Still, considering its epic time-traveling story and its many characters I can say that Singer and Kinberg succeeded in making the film satisfying. Much of the cast can be applauded for their efforts. Stewart and McKellen, as I mentioned before, are excellent as usual in their roles. Hugh Jackman is as reliable as always as Wolverine. Many people forget that Jackman is a good actor. He proved it in films like The Fountain (2006) and Prisoners (2013) and even in schlock like Kate & Leopold (2001) and Van Helsing (2004). Jennifer Lawrence, playing Mystique, is fine in her role but nothing special in my opinion. When she's covered with blue paint she's not as menacing or as sexy as Rebecca Romijn was in the role. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get to impress only at the end of the film. Before that there's really nothing to write about concerning their acting. They're clearly not as charismatic as they were in First Class. In fact, McAvoy simply annoyed me while he was doing his depressed Charles Xavier bit. His acting, thankfully, improved when Xavier tried to convince Mystique to abandon the course that she was on. The only other thing that I have to add about Days Of Future Past is that it doesn't contain as much establishment propaganda as First Class. In First Class it was just obvious. ""Mutant and proud"" was clearly a metaphor for ""gay and proud."" In case you didn't know, I'll mention that for the Anglo-American establishment pro-gay propaganda is very important. It's one of their tactics to reduce human population on the planet because they think that there's way too many people now. So being fine with homosexuality and not having children is what the ruling class wants for the lower classes. Globalization is another thing that's very important for the establishment. The story takes place in different countries and there's also an international cast involved. In Days Of Future Past, the Russians and the Chinese are mentioned as enemies that are more dangerous than the mutants. This also fits into the establishment line. Russia and China are the main enemies for the ruling class of Britain and the USA. North Korea gets most of the hate these days, but China and especially Russia aren't far behind. Other than what I've mentioned there's really nothing to complain about. The visual effects, especially the Sentinels, are mostly impressive and so are the designs. Days Of Future Past suffers because of the plethora of characters. Not all of the key players are given satisfying story arcs, but I still recommend this epic yet entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best X-Men Film to Date!!!,"So after watching X-Men: Days of Future Past on the night of release, I can honestly say that I have never been so emotional driven and impulsed with excitement since the day Avengers Assemble came to the silver screen. It was a film which took me by surprise (for which I am glad for), simply because of how each of the individual characters played a significant role to the overall plot and ultimately decided the fate of the mutants.Much like how they portrayed it in the classic 1992's X-Men: The Animated Series, for which some of you will recognise some familiar faces in this film (thou shalt not be named) that I jumped out of my seat in excitement like a 13 year old Japanese fan girl.

Days of future past can't pass fast enough!,"X-Men Days of Future Past is yet another failed adaptation of one of the most successful comic book franchises of all time. Those of us who grew up with X-Men have come to love the characters and their back stories. The most beloved mutants, Storm, Kitty Pryde, and Rogue, who have been a constant from the beginning have had much of their character and presence stripped away and replaced with male characters such as Magneto, Beast, and Wolverine who have dominated the big screen script. A lot of focus was placed on Mystique as well. Their sleek comic book costumes have been replaced by black militant riot gear, which looks a lot like Batman's rubber suit. X-Men 1-2 and 3 story lines centered around Wolverine, and the male characters. It appears to me that the writers and the directors are intimidated by strong powerful woman, and I'm left with the impression that they didn't even research the mutants individual back stories. The most disappointing scenes is when Storm, Cyclops, and Gene Gray, where all being tossed around by Toad...really? Based on the comic book character, Storm is a strong willed leader who commands the group and takes down the difficult villains. However, on the big screen she's portrayed as a timid mutant who take orders from Wolverine, and poor Rogue was slowly erased completely. The writers and directors missed a great opportunity to explore the full potential of the most powerful and diverse mutants of the X-Men franchise. I would like to have seen more impending doom with a lot more of power display and fight scenes from Storm, and Rogue, and a lot less of Wolverine saving the day. I do not like any of the existing X-Men movies. My wish is that I live long enough to see X-Men rebooted about 10 years from now with directors and writers who appreciate the original vision of X-Men without dumbing down any of the characters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
(hey) days of an all star cast,"In the trail of ""X-Men: First Class"", this is also a period movie of superheroes taking on their differences with humanity and finding the right path in due process except that this is mashed up with the cliché of science fiction, Time Travel.Logan is sent back in time to change a particular event in history that will forever alter the course of history for worse (I mean big time worse). In order to do that he must confront Professor-X at the worst stage of his life and convince him of the time travel theory and bring the best out of him.The lump some of the story is revealed through the trailers and teasers which makes the story monotonous. So, there are no surprises in that area. The lack of any sort of twist adds woe to the story department. The complexity of weaving the future and past together is managed well by the screenplay team.If First class changed the Cuban Missile crisis history, this movie has altered the JFK assassination and if that surprises you, then wait until Magneto explains the truth behind it.An eerie bit of seriousness prevails throughout the movie. This was a trademark of X-men movies but ""First Stand"" tried to add fun into the potion. It looks like we are back to default. But occasionally we do have a few one-liners but nothing on par with the other Marvel Cinematic Universe.The cast have filled in the suits and done what was asked for. Nothing superlative but nothing worse either. Blink, Quicksilver are valuable additions to the line-up with their powers brilliantly lit up on the screen, thanks to CG team. The prison break sequence is a standout example.A meaty role is bestowed upon Mystique. Whether J-Law's fame added to the character's weight or vice versa is something that only the director can answer. Word on the street was Bryan Singer had long discussions with James Cameron to make the concept of time travel more relatable to the audience. It seems that the discussions have paid off.Magneto's stunt with the submarine and the missiles was what I considered as ultimate. The teasers made me rethink (baseball stadium). But the execution of it could have been more majestic i.e. there is very little frame of the stadium being held on air.Another significant addition to be noted is Peter Dinklage as the mutant-hating scientist. He is good as always with the 70's look adding more gravity to his role.My final word: Entertaining but slightly (very slightly) disappointed. Stay until THE end for a post credit scene.

OK - not too disappointed,"We saw the new Spiderman movie last weekend. It was poorly done. Consequently, we almost gave up on seeing the new X-Men movie. Thank goodness we didn't. This movie was as fast paced & packed with fights, tense situations that you're sitting there every minute hoping Magneto becomes a good guy and that Professor Xavier gets his legs back. The Good Guy vs. Bad Guy was, for once, less predictable than in previous movies. Simply put, we loved it. The only down side is there is so much CG that after a while you're just staring at certain scenes knowing they are green/blue screen and missing what was going on.

Written in the past,"When you go to watch this movie, don't buy popcorn at first. Instead buy it sometime in the future, travel back to that very moment and gift yourself the popcorn. I implemented this strategy and ended up watching the movie on an empty stomach. The point of this exercise? Nothing, just as the senseless time travel shown in the film. This much anticipated installment in an otherwise brilliant series will leave you disappointed. That is, unless you choose not to strain your brain and just accept the events as they are. The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, whom he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine sets out to change the future. In the end, the viewers are left hanging with a dilemma about the fate of the dystopian future world. It seems as if it never existed. However, if it didn't exist, none of the events in the movie would have occurred in the first place. There are plenty of other loopholes and inconsistencies that will constantly bug an observant viewer. The movie also leaves some open questions, which I hope will be resolved in the future. For example, where does a mutant who can walk through walls (Kitty) get the power to transport people back in time? How did Wolverine get his metal claws back in the future, given that he lost them in the fifth installment? How did Xavier survive the violent disintegration previously seen in the series? On the bright side, some well directed action scenes, especially when Quicksilver saves everyone in slow motion, provides the much needed excitement one expects from an X-Men film. Towards the end, all you can hope is for the next installment, X Men: Apocalypse to be much more sensible, thrilling and satisfying than this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't bother if your age > your shoe-size,"Up front, I should say I'm not a fan of the Marvel (etc.) genre. I wanted to see a movie with my daughter (15) and we both thought we could truck with this, having both enjoyed X-Men: First Class.An otherwise talented cast ham their way through a wooden script, delivering a few moments of charm but nothing approximating genuine human pathos, and a whole lot of eye-rolling awfulness.Despite the movie's premise having been lifted from elsewhere, the movie plays out exactly as you would expect. This film treats its audience like children, and could have been written by a committee of younger fans. Perhaps I should have expected that.For me, special effects are not enough: I've seen those before. They must serve a dramatic purpose, but here, the money shots only served to cheapen my overall experience. Mutants are not enough. I know enough about the characters already. It's like ""okay, I get it - finish the story!"" It lacks anything for grown-ups, having a dramatic arc comparable to Saturday afternoon TV offerings like Dukes of Hazzard or The A Team (showing my age there).

Bryan Singer's Crowning Achievement,"The first time this storyline from the comics was used, was in the great 1992 X-Men Cartoon. I suppose there were a couple other cartoon renditions of this as well, but those were not worth mentioning- The '92 Saban X-Men series did a fantastic job of rendering the Core X- Men and animating the tales which kept us saying ""Make Mine Marvel"" and ""Nuff Said"" all these years.Finally, at long last, we have this story told in Live Action. Well, Live Action and some masterfully done SFX.No one can doubt that Hugh Jackman has brought James ""Logan"" Wolverine to more life than any other cartoon rendition of the character, and even in the Comics his antics are always what you are drawn to. He's the best as what he does, and what he does ain't pretty, as he always reminds us.The graphic image of Wolverine in Mid-Flight, Adamantium Claws Extended - The Iconic Image of Wolverine which is on one of the covers of the 1982 limited series, was shown in ""The Wolverine"" (On top of the Bullet Train), and his ""fastball Special"" was shown in The Danger Room scene in X-3, The Last Stand. So, what's left? Plenty: Just keep your eye on Bobby ""Iceman"", in X-3 he Iced Up Solid, in this he is finally able to do the stuff he can from the books.One enigmatic figure from the comics had never made it into the films: ""Bishop"" (Omar Sy) - Other characters from the 'X-Force' side-team are also here, Sunspot (Adan Canto), Warpath (Booboo Stewart), and Bishop's Sister ""Blink"" (Bingbing Fan, in the comics she is actually deceased, and she appears as a Hologram from Bishop's Armband). So we have a nod to X-factor here are well.The Original story had Kitty Pryde (Ms Ellen Page) as the one who this story revolved around, and Wolverine was actually Killed by the Modern Sentinels. In retrospect that story would not have worked as well as this, because of Wolverine's Central importance to the storyline that had been told starting from the first X-Men film.Some of the other particulars have been changed as well, mostly to use concepts (And characters/actors) from X-Men: First Class - So mainly this was a unique opportunity to use two sets of actors for Magneto and Professor X. The only thing that is a problem, is that Patrick Stewart had appeared as a Walking Elder Professor X in ""X- Men Origins: Wolverine"" - And Xavier had lost use of his legs at the end of ""First Class"". But if you watch this film. you will see why it is not a problem: This film deals once again with Alternate Histories and Universes. This seems to be a common concept used in many media lately, most notably in ""Fringe"" which had ""Red and Blue Universes"". In a way, we have this happening in the X-Men Franchise, and if my guess is correct, the next X-Film will deal with the ""Age of Apocalypse"" which is a total mind-bender: IN fact Marvel changed the name of all of their major comics for six months while that story played out.What is great to see always is another appearance/cameo by Mike Dopud, who was notable for playing at least 6 different guys in the Stargate Franchise. He has appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well as in X-2, hes just one of those faces that shows up in Hugh Jackman movies. Look for him here, in ""1973"".This film has Wolverine living in a Split-Level Head: One head in the Present (2025 or so) and the other in 1973, so the action literally spans 50 years. Despite the changes to the story from the comics, this film connects all of the X-Men franchise films in a way I had not thought possible, and as much as I respect the work of the other directors, it took Bryan Singer to pull all the strings back together. IN my view, is was a huge mistake for him to go off- mission to make ""Superman Returns""- A movie that should have been made in 1980, which was actually made in 1978, but the scenes Marlon Brando had shot were simply not used in their proper context- Having Bryan direct that was not the best use of his talents, as X-3 suffered for it. Not that I did not enjoy X-3, Magneto picks up the San Francisco Bay Bridge and lays it across to Alcatraz... In this film, the younger Magneto does something almost as amazing. What was better, Magneto moving the Bay Bridge, or Superman moving a huge Kryptonite Continent? What we see here, makes those titanic events seem small in comparison.Between X-3 and this film, we were shown just how powerful Magneto is, and that Jean Grey was even more so.In this franchise, we've seen Magneto move bridges, Jean Grey Vaporize people, Logan regrow skin as fast as Jean could strip him of it, and Charles Xavier take habitation of his Brain Dead Half- Brother's Body. Prepare to see much, much more in this latest installment, and be prepared for the coming Apocalyptic Age, cos ""El Nabin Sur"" is coming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of the best X-Men movies ever, and one of the best superhero movies you'll ever see – this union of two different teams of X-Men is funny, poignant and thrilling","Slightly more than a decade after setting the gold standard of the Fox/ Marvel franchise he successfully launched, Bryan Singer is back at the helm of perhaps its most ambitious entry yet. Conceived by the previous instalment's screenwriter Simon Kinberg, it attempts to merge two separate timelines with two sprawling casts - the Patrick Stewart/Ian McKellen gang from the first 'X-Men' trilogy;, and the younger generation, led by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, from 2011's 'X- Men: First Class' – by introducing the tricky element of time travel. The result is in a word - extraordinary - combining the best from two different teams for an exhilarating adventure across time.As Stewart solemnly intones at the beginning, a years-long war between the mutants and an army of near-indestructible robots known as Sentinels has devastated the world, resulting in a terrifying dystopian future where mutants and mutant-sympathizing humans have been rounded up in internment camps. Gathered with Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) against the Sentinel threat are familiars Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), as well as some new additions including Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Fan Bingbing), and Warpath (Booboo Stewart).The one hope to their survival lies back in the past - or more precisely, the year 1973 - where Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) assassination of Sentinel creator Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) will not only cement the humans' suspicion of the mutants as a threat but also lead to her capture and the use of her shape-shifting DNA into the design of the robots. Logan/ Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) ability to heal makes him the only suitable candidate for travelling back in time - his mission to convince the younger Professor X (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) to put aside their differences in order to avert the killing that would change the course of history.That's a fair bit of exposition to set up the events that follow, but Singer knows just how to keep the pacing nimble. Showing that he has lost none of his touch for inventive action sequences, Singer unfurls an opening that leverages largely on Blink's powers of teleportation to deliver some truly eye-popping action. Indeed, action is pretty much the language of the movie, which plays to the strengths and powers of the individual characters to move the plot forwards. Wisely though, he eschews the need to build gigantic setpieces in favour of more intimately scoped ones – and of these, the most singularly impressive is that of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), whose superhuman speed gets a stimulating demonstration in bullet-time while on a prison-bust within the Pentagon.That sequence is also an excellent case-in-point of one of the X-factors of his original entries which Singer brings back to the franchise, levity. Most prominently, Quicksilver's brief entry in the franchise (chiefly due to rights issues) is played for maximum comic slapstick – but thankfully without ever tipping into caricature. Singer knows always how to stay on the right side of cool, and despite the catastrophic peril facing our characters, keeps the tone lively and effervescent. It isn't just Singer's credit of course; some of the most light-hearted moments of the film belong to Jackman, who oozes charisma and wryness as he is called to play mentor to the younger Professor X and his student Beast (Nicholas Hoult) in a clear reversal of roles.And yet the one most important element which Singer retains is the humanity of these characters. The struggle between the humans and the mutants has always been at the heart of the best of these movies as well as the comics, meant of course as an allegory to the discriminated and marginalised within our very society by virtue of the fact of them being different from the majority. Here, that struggle becomes even more pronounced with Logan's warning of just what the future holds, exacerbating the ideological differences between Professor X and Magneto as well as their battle for the heart and mind of Mystique as a crucial piece in the chess game of fate.Kinberg's plotting deserves special mention here, juggling multiple time streams and alternate futures effortlessly without ever breaking a sweat. He even manages to contain the inherent logical gaps in time travel, and in the grander scheme of the franchise, forges an exciting way forward for future instalments while respecting the events of the first three movies. Both Kinberg and Singer are also clearly invigorated recreating period here, as they redefine the assassination of JFK, recreate the voice and visage of Richard Nixon (played by Canadian thespian Mark Camacho) and recount these historically defining events with the grainy, bright-colored look of '70s newsreels to give them a touch of verite.As always, the casting of the characters remains spot-on. Jackman has never been more compelling as Logan than he is here, exhibiting restraint and temerity that brings newfound gravitas and pathos to his character. McAvoy and Fassbender continue to make a fascinating pair, portraying their emotionally complex relationship with heartfelt poignancy especially when contrasted against their kinder, gentler older selves who wonder why they spent so many years bickering. Lawrence however doesn't quite make an impact as one may have hoped, but the actress remains a fetching presence whether in human form or in Mystique's blue birthday suit.That's still a minor, very minor, quibble for a movie which gets so many things right. The action is first engaging, then thrilling, and finally at its climax exhilarating. The characters are well sketched out, their dilemmas real, relatable and therefore genuinely affecting. The story is complex without ever being complicated. For a summer blockbuster, it belongs in a rare breed that blends emotional resonance, humour, wit and grand spectacle into one immensely satisfying whole. Like we said, it is in a word, extraordinary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Samey apocalypse,"God, another one of these superhero juggernauts. Perhaps other viewers find each one so much different than all the other Marvel clones, I don't know. They're all a big blur of samey rush to me. I don't find real invention going on in any of them, any freshness in the mythos, any actual difference (which is touted as the big theme here). You'll know this is just tired by the whole apocalyptic / time-travel storyline.So another attempt to construct fate; there's something wrong about humanity at large and where we're headed as a race, in the film this culminates (in the beginning) with humanity defeated at the hands of our own desire to root out difference, and the effort to reconstruct the past, we land back in Nixon's America where things apparently started going wrong, to replay it so that we can be inspired by the message that doom is not inevitable and hope can alter courses.No, the only thing worth seeing for me is what new contraptions these Hollywood teams devise each time to propel the camera. It gets a bit tiresome having to throw out heaps of story to focus on cinematic flows which become merely mechanic without it (story), meaningless, such is the case here.In X-Men, each character is an opportunity to ripple in an unusual way. Someone will erupt in flames or change shapes, okay. The two arch rivals can leverage the most awesome forces. For the bad guy this is confined to matter, the ability to command the material fabric, to undo and rearrange - usually this is an opportunity for awesome scenery, last time a submarine was lifted out of the sea, here a whole stadium is airborne. It's daft destruction, rather suitably as will without empathy.More interesting is the good professor who can enter mind, command vision. This should be the most tantalizing opportunity for scenery of another kind, which also chimes with a recurrent interest of mine; how can we envision a mental space? A girl with similar mental powers propels the journey back in time, through her we have the first glimpse of this, the camera enters inside an eye to swim in a gaseous space of consciousness. Near the end, the professor searches in a similar constellation of minds.And however much they manage to perfect the material physics, there's a nifty scene where time is slowed that almost exists in the story as comedic demo-reel of what can be achieved with all the big studio tools at hand, so much more crude seems the inner dimension.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Chappy Watched: X-Men: Days of Future Past,"Welcome to Wolverine 6: Days Of Future Past!At this point I'm starting to get real bored with Hugh Jackman/Wolverine. Wasn't this why Wolverine got his own movies, so he could be the lead in them? The X-Men comics were published just over 50 years ago; there is a rich catalogue of characters, so let's focus on some of them, yeah?Having said that, it was really amazing that they managed to get a lot of the core actors from both X-Men movie series' back together, making this a pretty epic cast!The first two X-Men films are awesome, the third one made me want to cry with how horrible it was, the Wolverine films are okay but First Class and now DOFP have reinstalled my faith in Fox and the X-Men universe.I'm pretty disappointed Rogue's storyline was cut from the film, I'm pretty sure I could have found some scenes to cut that weren't necessary and I think it sucks that they couldn't give the filmmakers some extra time considering these films are pretty much moneymakers for the studios so what are 15 or so minutes more?I think it translated very well from the comics to the cartoon to the movie, obviously things are different in transitioning it to the big screen but it still makes for a good movie. Makes me excited for the next X-Men film.A very good movie, worth a watch if you are a fan of the comics, cartoons or the other X-Men movies.

My thoughts on Bryan Singer's return to the franchise,"So X-Men: Days of Future Past is about the dystopian future, where sentinel robot drones seek out and kill all mutants and X-Men. The X-Men realize there is no way to save themselves from the sentinels and their inevitable extinction if they don't send someone's conscious back in time to change the course of history, and prevent the sentinels from being initiated onto the mutants. The only one strong enough to go back in time is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and it's up to him to unite Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in the past to prevent the grim future from happening. There is actually quite a lot of depth to this movie's plot, and I did enjoy many aspects of it. This movie exudes confidence from Bryan Singer, and I love how he can take X- Men back for himself after a couple of terrible X-Men movies from 20th Century Fox that put his work in the first two movies to shame. This movie is a sequel to one timeline of X-Men and another at the same time. The cast from X-Men First Class is the same, which is great to see. James McAvoy is really great as Professor X in this movie, and Michael Fassbender is still killing it as Magneto. These actors are more prominent in this movie, and the dystopian future is focused on less. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are given a little less screen time, which is fine by me because they still sell their role. Peter Dinklage as Trask is also the antagonist for a portion of this movie, and he is very good. He always gives a good performance, even if he isn't too picky about his roles. Like how anyone would ever agree to star in an Adam Sandler movie based off of old videogames is pretty beyond me. The performances that stood out the most to me in this movie were definitely James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender and Evan Peters (Quicksilver). The characters all had great chemistry with each other on screen, and the majority/entirety of these actors performances was in the past. We also got to see a new side of Wolverine and young Professor X in this movie, with Wolverine being more reserved and less aggressive, and Professor X being at his lowest low, and essentially a junkie at the start of the film.The best part about the characters in this movie is that you can identify with them. With the exception of Trask, the character motivations are never confusing or unclear, so that at least you can understand one of the antagonists reasoning. Although Peter Dinklage gave a good performance, there isn't that much substance to his character, and he didn't have that much of a motivation for his character. What was a really interesting concept in this movie, was that there wasn't a clear, defined antagonist. The antagonist is different for different characters and their perception of the unfolding events. This movie also had a couple of great action scenes, and some intense moments as well. There's a fantastic scene involving a lot of mutants that sets the third act into motion in Paris, where a lot of civilians witness mutant powers for the first time. The way they shot that scene with different excerpt shots that were meant to look like people filming on cameras from the 1970's really added to the terror of the humans. As for the action scenes, they were all choreographed just fine and were kept to a minimal. I would say that for this type of movie that less is more, because it made room for more creative fight scenes that I won't spoil, but went beyond just average fist-fighting. One problem I had with this movie was that although the story was unique to the universe and really interesting, there were still a couple of predictable points in the movie. The story this movie told was really good, but some character dilemmas or choices were really easy to predict, which took me out of the movie somewhat, but didn't ruin the movie for me.This movie has a lot of hope and emotion stretched throughout, and I like how well balanced all the characters roles and screen time is in this movie. Every person feels necessary to the movie. Bryan Singer did a great job with this movie. I liked how a part of this movie was a somewhat emotional and mental conflict, which can sometimes be hard to come by in superhero movies, where usually the conflict just lies with the antagonist. Bryan Singer did intentionally mess with the X-Men timeline, which I liked since it was basically a big middle finger to the terrible movies in the series. People who are supposed to be dead are still alive, vice versa and a couple of other changes that are kind of confusing if you don't go into the movie with the knowledge that it doesn't build off the last movie. It's a kind of jerk move to disregard another director's work in the same franchise, even if it is terrible, rather than build off of it. But I can totally forgive this movie for it since it solves all the problems that X-Men 3 and Origins: Wolverine had. I had a great time with this movie, with a couple of fun Marvel references that seem to be obligatory in any Marvel movie. I will definitely say that this is Singer's franchise, and this movie just proves it.+ Fleshed out characters - Trask's character pretty bare and dry cut + Compelling story - Somewhat predictable at points + Great Acting + Confident directing courtesy of Bryan Singer 6.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Just a few quick thoughts about ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""","And, no, that is not a lame attempt at a ""Quicksilver"" pun. Honestly.I really, really liked it. It isn't my favorite ""X-Men"" movie — those will always be what is arguably the darkest of the franchise (""X2: X-Men United"") and the lightest (""X-Men: First Class""). But it's definitely a nice addition to the series.Here are a few reactions, with minimal spoilers, in no particular order:-- What a radical shift in tone from ""First Class."" Way to bring the pathos, Bryan Singer. The opening scenes are brutal, and there are many major character deaths. Some of them occur off screen; others do not. Some are violent. I do believe this is the first superhero movie I have ever seen in which a major character and fan favorite has his or her head crushed, in close-up, during the opening action set piece.Speaking of the opening segment, will somebody please validate my uber- nerd-dom and tell me that they saw what I saw?! I KNEW that the overflying airships that are dropping The Sentinels looked familiar. Am I nuts, or are those none other than facsimiles of the lone ""Valhalla"" airship depicted in the woefully under-appreciated ""Marvel 2099″ universe from the mid-1990′s?! If Singer intended that, it's a terrificly obscure and fun shout-out to 40-year-old comic book fans. (Ahem.)There isn't any unnecessary exposition to bore us. This is a major issue in comic book movies. We can forgive the Christopher Nolan films for revisiting Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis, because those films were exceptionally well made. The new Spider-Man films? Not so much. In ""Future Past,"" we have thankfully no flashbacks for every single character. We're briefly told that there is a global pogrom waged by The Sentinels against mutants and innocent humans, and that Xavier and Magneto have joined forces to fight the good fight. Then we're shown various heroes with various superpowers fighting. We don't need to know all of their backstories.The action scenes were very well directed. Nice work, Mr. Singer. The special effects were top notch. What great fun it was seeing Blink, Iceman, Quicksilver and Bishop do their thing.Given the movie's central plot device why on earth are we concerned with Mystique, and not Rogue, given their respective powers? There are a few obvious guesses One, Mystique is a more popular character. Two, Jennifer Lawrence has more star power than Anna Paquin. Still, this bugged me throughout the film.I personally hate the plot device itself, in which various characters can steal or borrow others' powers.Time travel is also a frequently unwieldy plot device, but I think it was capably handled here, thanks to careful writing and a little restraint.It would also be just great if somebody could explain to me how Mystique apparently alters her body mass.I love how this movie and ""First Class"" integrate the comic book mythology with real world events. It's pure fun, especially the nod at JFK.Once again, we have an ""X-Men"" movie in which the darker characters are less predictable and more fun to follow. A better adjusted and more grounded Wolverine makes perfect sense. (We don't need to endlessly revisit the same character arc.) But he actually is less interesting when he becomes more stable. And characters like Beast are flat out boring. I'm happy that we spent a nice amount of time with Magneto, Mystique, and the human antagonists.Speaking of which, Peter Dinklage was perfect as Bolivar Trask. What a performance — especially with respect to making weighty dialogue sound natural — look again at his reaction to the suggestion that he hates mutants. Incredibly good line work. Is this the same guy as in ""Games of Thrones?"" I refuse to watch that show simply because I am tired of hearing about it. But the ""X-Men"" movies seem to do a great job providing us with human adversaries that are threatening despite an absence of super-powers.Michael Fassbender is simply a wonderful actor, and he is perfectly cast as Youngneto. He vocalizes and emotes just like a raging, charismatic ideologue.If I said that Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan were fantastic, that would just be belaboring the obvious.I like Jennifer Lawrence. I do. She was great as a strong, sympathetic protagonist in ""The Hunger Games."" And she deserves her fanbase. But here, she just doesn't demonstrate range enough to play a vengeful, homicidal woman. Rebecca Romjin did a better job of giving us a good, scary, bogeyman to make us think that humans needed protection by Xavier's kids. Or, for an amazing example of a young actress portraying anger and vengeance, look no further than co-star Ellen Page's amazing performance in the brutal, incredible movie, ""Hard Candy"" (2005). Furthermore, Mystique, as written here and in ""First Class,"" just isn't as much fun. No, she wasn't really an identifiable character in the previous movies, but she was a great bad guy — something that a doe- eyed, redeemed Mystique just isn't.Quicksilver steals the show. Evan Peters was awesome. Unsupervised teenagers with superpowers are always fun. This movie takes a lighter look at what transpired in the extremely enjoyable ""Chronicle"" (2012). What would happen if this kid met those kids?It's rather nice seeing how this movie placates fan complaints with ""X- Men 3: The Last Stand.""If you're the kind of flick nut who enjoys movie marathons, good luck figuring out where this film fits chronologically with the other movies! :-Dhttp://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/just-a-few-quick- thoughts-about-x-men-days-of-future-past/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Superhero Movie,"The X-men films have been hit or miss but X-men Days of Future's Past hits it out of the park. Nearly everything works in this film from the superb direction to the complexity of the characters. One aspect that works in the films favor is that there are plenty of mutants and they are all utilized well. One in particular steals the show and one scene encapsulates this proclamation. The usual suspects return of course both young and old and that's what really works in this film. Now seeing them back to back the younger versions truly resemble the older counterparts in terms of personality. It was great to see James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as Magneto and Charles Xavier. Their rapport is truly astounding , I just wish there were more scenes with them. Too much attention was focused on Wolverine. Another issue with the film is the Trask character. He is just too dull to carry a movie.

Best X-Men Yet!,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men movie that we have all been waiting for. The last movie that could give this film a run for its money was 2003's X2. 2011's First Class was a step in the right direction, but this film is very masterful and engaging. I loved the idea of combining old cast with new cast and the results are impressive. The story is written well and there are several emotional moments. The action is also very good and some of the set pieces are just grand. The visuals compliment the action and they come out in full-force during the scenes of Quicksilver.Bryan Singer returns to the helm to direct this film. The main theme is changing history so that the future will be different from which the past set it out to be. Wolverine is sent back to the 1970's to stop a program in which mutants are being targeted by these sentinels which are created to take out and destroy mutants.This movie has one of the greatest ensembles in recent film history. The old cast is here, the new cast is here, and they combine forces to put on a show. Hugh Jackman is ever awesome as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy and Ian McKellan/Michael Fassbender are all great in their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes as Mystique. Peter Dinklage made a great addition to the cast as the main villain and someone to keep an eye on is Evan Peters as Quicksilver.Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men sequel we have all been waiting for. By combining old and new, we have ourselves one of the greatest comic books film ever made. Not only is there impressive action, the storyline comprises of raw human emotion and characterization.

"Nothing really new, but a worthy addition to the X-Men canon","The strength of X-Men films has always been to give a large number of characters a decent bit of the story, and to allow viewers to imagine what it would be like to have that particular power. The moral of X-Men films has always been the same: people who are genetically different have to learn to live in peace. This film is absolutely solid on both of these aspects, along with occasional self-referential humour.However, it doesn't bring anything outstanding beyond the above. It's set partly in the 1970s, and goes out of its way to include odd stuff from the seventies (let's face it, there was plenty); it charts more of the characters' personal development; it performs the necessary reboot that major franchises seem to require these days; and it has plenty of high-tech special effects. All perfectly competent (apart from one 'revelation' concerning a well-known three-letter acronym that nearly made me laugh out loud), and yet I walked away feeling I'd seen most of it before, in one form or another.See it of you're a fan of the franchise and want to watch the story progress.

Pass the Popcorn! review,"X-Men: First Class was a successful movie and a most needed breath of fresh air in the franchise, but everyone knew that the X-Men franchise would be getting its real rebirth once Bryan Singer returned in the director's chair. It took over 10 years, but Bryan Singer finally returned with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which isn't the best X-men movie there is (X2 is still holding that title), but is damn near being so. X-Men: Days of Future Past is the first movie in the franchise that introduces a time traveling element in the plot, in an attempt to fix any continuity errors between X-Men: First Class and the rest of the franchise.In the future, the world has been torn apart by a war between the mutants and Sentinels (giant robots made for killing mutants). In a desperate attempt, the last several surviving mutants send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), because that event apparently triggered the mutant/Sentinel war. But Wolverine can't find Mystique alone – he needs help from the younger versions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). However, Charles Xavier is addicted to a medicine that helps him walk, but makes him lose his mutant powers, and Magneto is locked up in a super secret prison below the Pentagon.The plot Days of Future Past isn't a rather simple one – the movie occasionally shifts focus from the past to the future and back again. The plot is mostly described through exposition, in form of dialogue between characters. The quality of these expository dialogues isn't always that good; especially in the beginning of the movie, when the characters explain to the audience the whole back story in 30 seconds flat. Nonetheless, after getting by that forced exposition, the movie suddenly starts being quite enjoyable, fun and interesting. Days of Future Past is possibly the funniest X-Men movie there is, filled with pleasant characters (Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, stands out the most), great action sequences, and numerous amusing references to other movies in the franchise.All the actors in the movie, with a few exceptions, are comfortable in their roles and are as good as ever (after all – the majority of them portrayed these characters at least once before). The exceptions to this rule are Ellen Page and Jennifer Lawrence. Ellen Page, in spite of having a very short screen time, is very unconvincing in her role; and Jennifer Lawrence is unusually wooden, which is a shame since she is the almost sole cast member who has won an Oscar. Thankfully, there is much going on in the movie, so it's not like their performances badly hurt Days of Future Past. On the contrary, the movie could actually be hurt by its third act which doesn't feel like a real finale. Instead, it is a very mild ending to a highly entertaining movie.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enough Already!,"Spoiler: I didn't see this movie. Maybe that's not a spoiler. It's more of an admission, one I'm damned proud of. I've had enough of these X-Men movies. They're too many already, and they don't even connect to each other. What in the world does 'Days of Future Past' mean? Is that like 'Back to the Future' articulated so clumsily that it makes your head spin? And if these freaks had a time machine all along, why did it take them so long to turn it on? It doesn't even matter, because I'm just exhausted by the idea of humans and mutants waring up to wipe each other out. Have the damned war already. Isn't it like 20 years now that we've been put on the edge of our seats over this war that's coming? My sensitivities have been callused over, I don't care about mutants anymore. Wipe 'em all out or put them on reservations already. They're a nuisance, and I'm sick of them.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Seventh installment a success!,"Marvel brings the seventh X-Men installment and second prequel in the series with X-Men Days of Future Past.It is a very fitting title, reuniting with director Bryan Singer who did the first ever X-Men film, and with Singer brings a connected and comprehensible plot consistent with the rest of the X-Men franchise.It is nearing the hopeless end of the mutant war in present time and humanity is frantic, at a critical and pivotal point, at the start of X-Men Days of Future Past. The remaining X-Men send Wolverine back in time to right the wrong of the past that set the course for this destructive terminus.What follows is a suspenseful, powerful and action-packed flick that is sure to please fans. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always been the anchor to the film franchise and it is befitting that he is the hopeful savior in Days of Future Past and a welcoming addition. All other actors, most of them playing roles portrayed by other actors, inhabit their roles successfully. Jennifer Lawrence is the most awkward of all, especially depicting Mystique's cold malice but brought out the humanity of Raven nicely.The story that follows is flawless and perfectly incorporated into the X-Men's universe, fitting seamlessly into currently known history of its characters as already presented in film. To that I owe Jane Goldman, the story writer, and Simon Kinberg, the screenplay writer, distinction. At first I was a bit confused whether I was to be concerned and emotionally invested but within fifteen minutes everything became clear. The story is surprisingly uncomplicated despite having time-travel as a core subject and has a well formed grasp on its direction.With any X-Men film there are bound to be action sequences and they are particularly spellbinding in X-Men Days of Future Past. They harnessed the mutant characters' abilities to accentuate the battles instead of exploiting them for the typical detracting 'wow' factor effect. I found them especially believable and well choreographed.Audiences love X-Men films because at their core they are about unjust persecution for being different. We all like to think we are unique and looming is the sense that eventually it could be us on the wrong side of discrimination. The sentiment of X-Men Days of Future Past reflects this theme most evidently of all the films and should be a hit with audiences.More reviews of recently released films can be found at our website!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Movie Is Sooo Good,"This movie starts on a really overused premise. Logan goes back in time to save the future. Where have I heard that concept before? Oh wait, everywhere! But, this movie adds the signature X-men bleakness to the concept, and that, combined with some really intelligent storytelling and acting (especially the acting), somehow not only saves the movie, but makes it really poignant and memorable as well. I saw this one before First Class (whoops!), so I'm writing this review as my first introduction to the younger Erik, Charles, Hank, and Raven.Raven is a young woman teetering on the edge of destruction, but stubborn and driven, she refuses to see it. Erik is quite frankly still Erik, a self-righteous, sadistic maniac. Hank is uncertain, loyal to a man who is slowly self-destructing. Charles is the real star here, as the actor shows him unraveling in devastation and self pity. There is a lot of pain, a lot of hurt, and a lot of potential among these younger iterations.Into this Logan comes, and has to try to get them all to work together. Perhaps this movie works so well because it takes the threads of regret, sadness, pain, hopelessness, and lost opportunities, and weaves a tapestry of light through darkness, of hope through bleakness. It is a story of salvation (from a dark path) for some, of return to the good path for others.While much of the movie is extraordinary, the blend of past and future into one gut-wrenching sequence near the end might be my favorite part. If you liked X1-3, this one is as good if not much better. This and X1 are actually my favorites. But be ready to 😢",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Action Packed Movie,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is an action packed movie that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat! I really enjoyed this movie! I do not think it is the best film in the X-Men series, but it's not the worst either. The action in the movie is very intense! The special effects are so realistic you feel like you're actually there! Also the cast is AMAZING! You couldn't get a better group of actors for the roles. The two people that really stood out to me though was Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique! I would also like to congratulate John Ottoman on an OUTSTANDING soundtrack! The reason I gave this movie 7 stars though is because the plot was hard to follow. Also I wanted to see more of Rogue. All you do is see her in the background. I MEAN COME ON! She is one of my favorite X-Man. Overall it was a very intense action movie that I recommend for any comic book fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty amazing!,"X-Men: Days Of Future Past review: -So X-Men: Days Of Future Past is the 7th X-Men movie (if you include The Wolverine) which sees mutants in a losing war in the future with the Sentinels. To save themselves from extinction they send Wolverine's consciousness back to X-Men: First Class to make sure that X-Men: The Last Stand and Brett Ratner never happened! -In other news, I have a new favorite X-Men film! X-Men: Days OF Future Past was quite incredible! can't think of a lot to say that is negative, but I will try. Maybe. Probably not.-Story was great. There were a few little things that did not make sense, but they did not matter that much. Also Bryan Singer pulled off making Brett Ratner never happen. Yup!! -Pace was a little slower, and the tone was darker, but they really had to be. It also had an overarching theme of hope which was great.-Cast did great! Everyone was at their best. Peter Dinklage was a great Bolivar Trask! Also James McAvoy is now Professor X the way Martin Freeman is not Bilbo. Yeah everyone was very good.-Music was pretty good. It features some moments that highlight some of the other X-Men scores, which is great! -CG was good. Cinematography and look and everything else was good too.-Content: Pushed its PG-13 rating. Some moderate language with one F-word and some brief partial nudity. Which I expected both of in this based on the other X-Men films.-So, X-Men: Days Of Future Past rocked! I loved seeing the combo of X-Men and X2 with First Class, which are the three I actually liked. I really like that there are going to be more films too! By the way, stay through the credits.-I will sat X-Men: Days Of Future Past deserves a high 8.5. Which means I had to decide if I liked it more than Captain America, which a just barely do. IDK if I like it more than Grand Budapest though. I'll get back to you on that.-So if you like he X-Men series or Marvel movies, you will love this film! Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tempus Fugit,"X Men: First Class was a clever re-jigging by having new younger actors playing Magneto and Xavier and focusing on the origins of the X Men.However like last year's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the second film gets away from a fresh page and goes back to its franchise history here we have the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen playing their older selves as past meets the future. It might be because both actors are not getting any younger that the producers decided to accelerate their appearance in the franchise.The glue is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as he travels into the past and prevent Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) killing scientist Trask (anagram of Stark!) By killing Trask (Peter Dinklage) the governments declare war on mutants and develop the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels who have almost wiped out the mutants in the future.As Wolverine returns he see's McAvoy's Xavier, addicted to a serum, drunk and without his powers. Erik is in a maximum security prison but aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik and set about to Paris to stop Raven. The prison escape scene is marvellously done balancing wit and bravado.The film is mainly set in the past as there is distrust and anger between Charles and Erik and whether Erik can be fully trusted. The set pieces are well executed with a balance of wit and pathos. Because of the focus on the newer actors there is little time devoted to the classic X Men actors as they are reduced to almost cameo status.As a stand alone film I found the film enjoyable, its well paced the film hardly misses a beat. You can quibble about the time travel elements and the changing of the time strands. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Jackman all deliver in the acting stakes although surely I cannot be alone in thinking that the ageless Logan is actually looking old.Bryan Singer the returning director of the first two X Men films brings a tight narrative focus and delivers a film with little flab but plenty of fab.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Solid Entry,"X-Men: Days of Future Past saw Bryan Singer return to the director's chair for the film series that he helped spark, having something of a mixed legacy since he chose not to direct The Last Stand. Following on from the effortlessly entertaining and swaggering First Class was never going to be an easy feat, especially with director Matthew Vaughn deciding not to return. However, a smart decision was made with Days of Future Past to craft a time-leaping plot with the political and social uncertainty of 1970's United States. Singer's familiarity with the character shines through which leads to an inventive and exciting entry to the series.Story: In an apocalyptic future both humans and mutants are hunted by Sentinels, originally created in the 1970's to hunt mutants. Wolverine is forced to go back in time and prevent the assassination of the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, in order to stop this future from happening. This story works perfectly in both creating a thrilling journey and in merging the old cast with the new. Sending Wolverine into the past to meet the younger Xavier and Magneto creates its own amusing outcomes, but it also allows for loose ends to be tied up. We find out how many of these characters came to be and how they're links to the X-Men were formed. The film also manages to expertly capture the feeling of unrest after the end of the Vietnam War and of the political paranoia found in many 70's thrillers.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is a great lead once again as Wolverine takes centre stage. By this point he has all of the characters intricacies down perfectly and provides plenty of energy as well as humour. James McAvoy is excellent as a much more vulnerable Xavier who struggles to embrace his power and his arc throughout the film is carried off well, while Patrick Stewart makes a welcomed return as the older Xavier.Villains: Michael Fassbender impresses again as Magneto. Showing that the characters conflict began early is a clever move and Fassbender makes his struggle feel so believable. Ian McKellen is also good fun in his return to the role. Peter Dinklage is superb in an understated performance as Trask. Making the character a dwarf is a nice subtle contrast to the mutants, but outside of that Dinklage gives the dialogue weight and provides a reserved intensity that works fantastically.Support: Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique plays a much larger role in the plot here. She being the one who attempts the assassination and the character's DNA being used to craft the Sentinels. Lawrence is simply okay in the role. Nicholas Hoult does standout as Beast, giving the role are geekiness without overdoing it.Action: The action scenes are as slick and stylish as ever before, with the emphasis on the scope of the sequences rather than the physicality. Arguably the highlight scene is breaking Magneto out of the Pentagon. Featuring super speedster Quicksilver, the editing is fantastic and the sheer inventiveness of the scene is a joy to behold. The climax involving the White House is also very creative.Music: John Ottman's score is very Hans Zimmer like. There's a lot of throbbing synths and bombastic brass that can get distracting. That said, his more restrained pieces are very effective and work well as a backdrop to the drama.Production: The visuals in the film are great and Singer shows that he can still make things look classy. As stated, what impressed me the most was that ability to capture the 1970's so effectively, with the film strongly invoking thrillers such as 'Marathon Man' and 'All the President's Men' for its era of paranoia. Switching these social and political issues over to the mutants was handled with grace. The effects were flawless for the most part, with the Sentinels looking unique as well as intimidating and images like Magneto lifting a football stadium looking spectacular. The story and character writings are a strength, with the film doing a really impressive job in explaining all of the motivations behind the characters decisions. I think Mystique lacks mystery, but her struggle between good and evil is played out well. I think the films main flaws lie in comparison to the earlier films in that I think at times it lacks the fluidity of X2 and the enthusiasm of First Class despite its intelligent story-telling.Conclusion: Days of Future Past is another strong entry in the X-Men series, simultaneously developing its universes past whilst building onto its characters futures. There's a great deal fleshed out here and the story never loses focus, which is all the more impressive when you realise just how much is going on. We're at a point now where we really understand these characters and their personalities, so going into the past is actual a good logical choice. There is almost nothing to fault from a technical, action and acting standpoint, while Singer directs as if he's never been away. The film works on both levels, providing an entertaining action trip and for offering some interesting social commentary from that period.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Time bending 2nd best X-Men movie,"Days of Future Past is a good film. A good superhero film and a good X-Men film, good not great. The film is fast paced well acted and a good time, but the one thing I didn't like about the film is how it felt as thou the film was trying to tie in the other films and their messy timelines and contiunities. While X-Men 1 and 2 flowed together, X-Men 3 was a train wreck in more ways than I can count. Then there was X-Men First Class which to me is the best of the franchise.And while there is a lot of fun with Days the thing that stopped it from being great was the the way Singer and company tried to wedge Days into the franchise without having to totally reboot of recon everything we have seen so far. Also having read the classic comic storyline (X-Men 142 & 143) I may have been expecting more, the storyline was there but the future world seemed to bore me t times. Making this mostly Mystique's story was a stroke of genius...while this film was a great improvement on X-3 as a follow up to First Class, I was let down, still recommend but if you haven't seen it yet wait for the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: Days of Future Past leverages time travel to bring its expansive universe and different casts together for one of the most powerful and entertaining superhero epics.,"Days of Future Past was the pinnacle of the 20th Century Fox X-Men franchise. It beautifully unites the original cast with the First Class cast in one of the best X-Men comic book stories. The story feels urgent and high stakes right from the beginning, with the world destroyed and only a small band of mutants fighting to survive and try to prevent this apocalyptic future. The time travel plot of the film allows Hugh Jackman to interact with McAvoy and the young X-Men but also bring back the older cast and correct some of the franchise's past mistakes. Evan Peters' Quicksilver offers some of the movie's best moments with his silly but technically stunning scenes. Seeing Stewart and McKellen back and seeing their performances contrasted with McAvoy and Fassbender was incredible. With great highs like X2 and First Class and disappointing lows like Last Stand and Dark Phoenix, Days of Future Past rises as the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic book films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good Story, Average Execution","I think the movie was pretty good, however I feel that my appreciate of the film is completely different from most people's. As such, I explain why it is imperative that I give my review of the film from a bias position, simply stating the facts of what the movie was trying to portray and what it actually portrayed, as well as the minor film details.Lets look at the minor details first. The effects weren't something I didn't see before, and the acting was very basic. In fact I would say the acting was very mediocre. Even though Jennifer was supposed to have a really big part with her Mystique role, she didn't really shine. As much as I missed the old X-Men, they didn't have a lot of screen time either. Surprisingly, it was Wolverine who had the most screen time and for some reason he was less rugged then he usually is. Within his over 200 years of existence he has changed a lot in the last 5. I don't think this was done well.The plot of the film definitely had a ""Inception"" type feel to it. However the idea of changing the past for the future is such a tricky thing to deal with that it gets irritating when looking at the context of the universe. The fact that the past is being messed with, indicates the fact that everything else that happened in the X-Men series did not happen. It almost adds a pointless element that I could overlook. However, they incorporated so much lore in one movie that its hard to look at the rest of the X-Men films and visualize that they actually happened considering the events that are about to unfold because of Mystique. One would also question the relationship between Magneto and Mystique that we have seen throughout every X-Men series after this movie.The one key thing that I had problems with is the fact that film did not specifically state how the sentinels create the future they are in when the person responsible for their creation was not able to because of the events that led up to his demise of the uncorrected past. Its the small key points that makes a big hit from a great hit. I feel this was so essential to explain the rest of the series. Especially considering we don't see the government showing any signs of dealing with the mutants in such an extreme way. It was obviously an underground group and I feel they hinted to it very vaguely like a girl that looks at you once and expects you to ask her out.One another key element that should have been elaborated on is the fact that the past effecting the future had a few different types of theorems. In one hand the idea that you could change the future if you went back into the past and the other that no matter what you did the future was inevitable. We see at the end all the good guys... but no bad guys all at the School smiling and having a good time. There should have been a point settled in here because no one actually pays attention to this fact. Did they really change the future or did they prolong it? But I feel I am making the movie more interesting than what it actually did. Did you come out of the movie thinking this? Also what happened to Stryker? He is the key antagonist of the films.A movie can have awesome concepts, however, its the films job to really portray them effectively enough. When I see all these ratings of 10 stars, I say to myself, ""give me a break."" It was a decent movie, but people depend on you to give an accurate and fair analysis of the film.Why did people grade it really high? Well for one thing this was the closest X-Men story to directly come from the comic books. Is that really enough to give it extremely high grades? They spent millions making the move, I'd expect an extraordinary story, and I feel people came from the film thinking how finite the time travel continuum really is when the story isn't really about that at all. Only comic book nerds would understand this. Except... nobody else read them and because of the ending they actually need to spoon fed. I also think the dark X- Men look of the future X-Men was completely awesome. It is definitely a new, modern, look that will inspire our current generation to appreciate.As such, though I didn't give it a harsh rating, I am actually skeptical what grade to give it. The film's entire message didn't come out as should have, even though it had an awesome plot already created for it. Many movies have really awesome concepts to them but aren't expressed. I feel like I'm back in high school where a student speaker did all his research and knows what he should say in his speech but for some reason can't get it out. I am also very sad that the real X-Men nerds when all out in the ratings, like a bunch of kids that rated a film high because they saw a nude girl. Because it's the closest thing they've wanted to see they rated it ridiculously. I also know a few friends that went to the college computers and started rating it just to boost the score. Not cool. It's troubling considering their are potential stories that could possibly not be shown in all their glory because the direction of the film and script aren't able to show the important parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best X-Men Movie Yet!,"The new X-Men movie sent me skyrocketing into the sky!I have been an avid fan of the X-Men the Animated Series since it was shown every Friday evening when I was still 9-years old and honestly I've found the previous X-Men films (with the exception of X-Men: First Class and The Wolverine) quite mediocre compared to the stories in the cartoons. I was also kind of disappointed in some of the movies as well, such as X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Now, thanks again to Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men and X-2), the franchise rose to new heights and he finally saved the day in the mutant world.The plot was superbly and (almost) flawlessly done. The time travel element of the movie stayed quite faithful to its canon. It straightened out certain things in the previous installments of the franchise which was really impressive. It also perfectly tied the prequel and the original series together, creating a full force ensemble. I was really blown away of how the story was told.The acting was magnificent. Jennifer Lawrence's popularity put Mystique more in the limelight which seems appropriate because her character is pivotal in the film's plot. She did a fantastic job of portraying her role, as always. Hugh Jackman again proved worthy of his character since the first film. James McAvoy did more justice this time of being the younger Professor X. The acting ensemble really was pretty remarkable.Lastly, the movie redeemed itself from its third film. The special effects were great and the pacing is just right. It sports out random humors which will make the audience chuckle. Also, its explosive ending was just perfect, absolutely perfect. I wouldn't say any spoilers but the ending is really worth seeing, so much refreshing, actually. So those who haven't seen it yet, go see the film. I promise you wouldn't regret it.Overall, the movie was a fun ride from beginning to end. I can't wait to see X-Men: Rise of the Apocalypse in 2016. I'd rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. #feelingmoviecritic",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Believe the hype! Days of Future Past succeeds where so many action films fail.,"We begin in a very bleak future. Mutants are fighting a war they cannot win as next generation sentinels have pushed them to the verge of extinction. The last remaining mutant survivors converge on a single location and hold out for one last stand. Magneto and Professor X have identified a singular event in the past that was the catalyst for their current predicament. If they can prevent this from occurring, they can save not only themselves, but most of humanity. The strain of travelling back in the past on the subconscious is significant however and given his regenerative mutant powers, only Wolverine can survive the journey. Once back in time, Wolverine must race against time to convince the younger Magneto and Professor X to put aside their differences and unite in order to change the course of the future before the sentinels discover their future holdout and wipe them out.Days of Future Past is a fantastic film. Most summer movies have tonnes of action and special effects, but they mostly fail to cast good, convincing actors, create sufficient drama or develop the story necessary to make the action scenes resonate and be meaningful (Godzilla anyone?). This film excels in this regard. Time is taken to develop the story and the inner conflict of Professor X, Mystique and Magneto as they struggle with overcoming personal fear, rejection, past differences and whether or not they can trust not only themselves, but also the humans. The slight downside of this is the film is a little slow in the middle, but this is pivotal to the effectiveness of the last act. Having said that, at no point does the film drag on and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Evan Peters (Quick Silver) provide plenty of humour to keep what is mostly a dark narrative light and enjoyable. Admittedly, as in all time travel movies, not everything totally adds up when you think through all the permutations of how this affects the previous films, events and characters in the Marvel universe. For the most part the story isn't convoluted and is entertaining throughout.The film has excellent casting, from top to bottom and I would say this is the best cast Marvel film to date. There are no unnecessary characters or weak performances; every character plays a key role in the story and is convincing. Hugh Jackman continues to be excellent as Wolverine (sadly, they still can't seem to make a great movie where he is the headline). Michael Fassbender (Magneto) and James McAvoy (Professor Xavier) once again provide solid performances and along with Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) are the emotional centre of the film and elevate it above the usual summer fair. Peter Dinklage (Dr. Trask) isn't given much to work with, but he delivers a fairly serviceable performance. I also really appreciated that Bryan Singer provided some of the lessor known X-Men such as Bishop and Blink with meaningful screen time. All in all, this is as good as you can get for such a large, ensemble cast; full marks across the board.The highlight of the film for me though was the future sentinels; they were fantastic! The special effects for these are incredible and they are the catalyst for some amazing battles in the future story arc. While I was a little disappointed in the interpretation of sentinels of the past (as they weren't quite how I remembered them from the Saturday morning FOX cartoon of my childhood), the design and action sequences with them more than made up for it as they were so well done (and that is an understatement!). Very impressive special effects overall and plenty of action to keep even the most ardent fan boy satisfied. This has to be seen in a higher end theatre such as IMAX or UltraAVX.The film brings together a strong balance of action, good story telling and meaningful performances that lead to an emotionally jarring conclusion as the X-Men fight to survive in both the past and future. As the story lines converge it was impossible not only to be on the edge of my seat as it came to a thrilling conclusion, but also to be invested in their struggle. It was reminiscent of the last act of The Dark Knight, it was that good. This is the perfect summer movie and not to be missed by Marvel or action fans. Not only does it challenge as the best Marvel film yet, it's also the best film of 2014 to date.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Sunny, With a Chance of Sta...(you'll know it when you see it)","In X-Men: Days of Future Past, Director Bryan Singer presents to the cinematic world not just another superhero movie, but a tour de force of a movie going experience. He achieves this by integrating exceptional storytelling and in-depth character development with the perfect balance of faithfulness to both the franchise and comic book. It is realized through world class support from the entire cast and crew. Notable performances are given by Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. As a newcomer to the franchise, Peter Dinklage as Dr. Boliver Trask does a great job giving fans a villain they will have no choice but to love hating. Special mention goes out to Hugh Jackman. In Days of Future Past he truly delivers the essence of Wolverine, portraying with equal aplomb his every flaw and strength.If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, an afternoon spent viewing X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and X-Men: First Class (2011) just prior to attending a show should serve to enhance your enjoyment of the movie; hands down the best of them all. If you are even a casual fan you will not be disappointed. I will leave it to the die-hards and the curmudgeons to quibble over flaws; yes, of course there are some (though not many, to be sure). Days of Future Past is a must see. It will remain a timeless classic not only in the genre of superhero movies, but of film as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men Days of Future Past Review,"It's been fourteen years since the X-Men first hit the big screen, setting the trend for a whole monsoon of comic-book movies. Counting the two stand-alone Wolverine movies, Days of Future Past is the seventh in the series. The X-Men have had so many ups and downs over the years that it's easily become the most convoluted franchise since the original Planet of the Apes. This film fulfills the same role as Escape from Planet of the Apes, redirecting the story arcs to rectify past mistakes and set the path for a bold, promising future.Days of Future Past takes after First Class primarily, but there are vague connections to the other movies. Unlike the previous films, this one doesn't have the same light-spirited kick-butt feel. If anything, it starts off looking like The Terminator, swapping out T-800s for Sentinels, with Wolverine standing in for the T-101, Mystique fulfilling the role of Sarah Connor, and Trask standing in for Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne. However, it never comes off as a rip-off; it's still X-Men to the core. The bleak future we see in the film's opening has always been in the cards, representing the apex of the ongoing conflict between men and mutants; the set-up is laid out very quickly, before launching a double-barreled narrative in both the past and the future with substantial stakes and suspense.In lesser hands, this could have become a hokey affair (and chances are that the most critical of viewers could nitpick plot inconsistencies, especially when time travel is involved). However, this is easily the most mature film of the series, thanks not only to the complex plot dynamics that unfold with this unique premise, but also because of the characters. Their motivations and relationships are as strong as ever, and drives the story into different directions. Charles Xavier in particular emerges as the heart and soul of the whole film, driving numerous conflicts among other characters and within himself that underscores key themes concerning progress, destiny, and overcoming adversity of any kind. A lot of the lesser characters get sidelined, but Wolverine, Mystique, Magneto, and Beast get plenty of screen time.Fortunately, as the plot unfolds, it does pull out a satisfying amount of action and spectacle. It's never overblown or overwhelming, and it's not just a bunch of things blowing up just because; it's nicely-balanced action that builds logically from the story. Scenes in the future show some pretty harrowing super-powered fights, while the rest of the film dishes out a lot of cool fights (including one crazy scene entirely in slow-motion, thanks to one super-fast mutant). It all builds up to a double-whammy climax, which not only ramps up the carnage, but also draws out the suspense.This film features pretty good photography. Editing is fine, although it seemed like there were a lot of scenes in the beginning where a character starts to talk, but then the camera cuts away, and it came off as a little weird, as if the movie didn't want to show you who was talking. Acting is great across the board; James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart both excel as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender continues to dominate as the younger Magneto (unfortunately, I felt Ian McKellen wasn't given enough to do here). It was also great to watch Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, and Peter Dinklage. Writing is good, especially in the way it addresses the continuity of the series and bridges the gaps it needs to, while keeping things fresh and crafting a quality story with quality dialogue. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is alright (you can expect to hear a little bit of a reprise of the theme from the first two movies).Days of Future Past is a movie about saving the future, not only in the movie, but also for the franchise as a whole. Despite certain contrivances, it is a highly nuanced story that rectifies some of the low points of the series. It genuinely kept me interested to see where it was all going. Even after the movie, it kept me interested, leaving just enough questions wide open to leave me wanting more. Best of all, the film accomplishes all this using plot and character more than special effects. So long as you've freshened up on the events of First Class, this film is highly recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good <> Story: Very Good <> Film: Very Good)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-Men: Days of Future Past is an electric, action-packed movie, easily the best in the entire franchise, and maybe one of the best comic book films ever.","I wasn't really sure about this movie, I mean time travel is something that can screw movies real good, and there were probably going to be a bunch of continuity errors, but man was I wrong (at least partially). X- Men: Days of Future Past is absolutely badass! It is a really awesome movie, despite the continuity stuff, this film was so riveting, action- packed and funny that you don't even care about the coherency with the other films, because this one is probably the best one.The acting in X-Men DOFP is really good, everyone does a great job, there isn't a false note anywhere in the movie. In terms of the main characters, Hugh Jackman is always great as Wolverine, I don't really need to talk about him too much, because he is awesome every time. But there's something in this movie that I really liked, we see Wolverine as a more human character, he doesn't go nuts as much as he usually does, and I thought it was pretty cool to see him in a different light. James McAvoy was just incredible! I loved how they humanized his character, when Patrick Stewart plays him, you can't really relate to him, because he's the know-it-all mentor, in First Class too, but in this movie he at an all-time low in life, he's so sad, cynical, and human, really great acting. Michael Fassbender is also really good, he may be the bad guy, but there's this one scene where, despite him being a dick(god, he is such a prick in this movie) you can understand where he's coming from, watching him and Charles interact is really interesting. Jennifer Lawrence is also always incredible, she still has that human element she had in First Class, but she's way more badass here. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and the other old-school X-Men are really cool, (Old Magneto had a really badass scene during the final act in the future, it just made me scream in joy), but the new additions are awesome as well, I particularly liked Blink and Bishop, their powers made for some INCREDIBLE fight scenes. But someone who absolutely blew me away was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. He is the coolest character in the movie, easily, I feel so bad that I was on the band wagon that thought he looked really bad, but he is so awesome! The scene where he demonstrates his powers with the cops is one of the best scenes I've seen, ever. He was such a funny and interesting character. Peter Dinklage is also very good in this movie, I just didn't get his character's reason for hating mutants so much, which is kind of big, but I forgave that one. And there's a point where you think, ""With such a big cast, can I really care about all of the characters? Yes you can! You care about every single one of the X-Men! Even the ones who don't appear that much like Storm and Iceman, they aren't all developed though, but that's okay, because they're just supporting characters.This film is so exciting, it is on from the opening credits which are awesome (hearing the original X-Men theme again was just indescribable), until the also awesome post-credits scene, even when the characters are just talking is interesting. The action is amazing, again the scene with Quicksilver is incredible, but the final act, the one in the future is so awesome! The cinematography, directing, 3D are all top- notch in this film. The special effects here are absolutely incredible, all technical aspects are as well. The directing by Bryan Singer is fantastic, there's this one scene with Mystique, where a person is filming her with a really old 70s camera, and the footage from the camera is played in the middle of the scene, those shots were fantastic! They added such a realistic feeling to the scene, that was a great idea.The writing in this movie is very good, they made the time travel concept plausible (for this movie), they kept it simple. And what they did with the ending was awesome! You could say they kind of fixed some mistakes of other X-Men films. The story is really great, it's a great mixture between the comic story and something new that they created, it works really well. This movie handles its multitude of characters by making them important to one of the central story arcs, and it's great! However there were some flaws, I'm talking about the continuity errors, most of them couldn't be avoided of course, but there was one that really stuck out, and I didn't understand the reason for it, it was Wolverine's Adamantium claws (in the future/present), and this is something that's incoherent with the ending of another X-Men film. What they did there could have been changed, to me there was no logical explanation for his Adamantium claws. And that was my biggest flaw with the film. Another flaw was that the final act in the past was a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the film's fights, it didn't have the intended effect on me, it did not feel like there was a lot at stake, don't know why, but it just didn't. And those were my only flaws.This film is really fun, I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was an intense, funny, action-packed and absolutely entertaining X-Men adventure. Days of Future Past is really awesome, it masterfully concludes the X-Men franchise revival mission, which started with First Class, continued with The Wolverine, and ended with X-Men: Days of Future Past. I recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
World War M,"First of all, because this movie has time travel, there are two time periods where the action takes place. Neither is around 2014, the year it was released. One time is 1973 and the other isn't specified but it is ""about fifty years"" later. That isn't a problem, though, just worth mentioning. Going back in time to ensure future survival isn't new. In ""The Terminator"", for example, the hero goes back in time to the year 1984, and that movie was released in 1984. Also, when it comes to many movies being part of one big film series to tell one big story, this whole franchise lost the way when the two thousands were over. ""First Class"" from 2011 and ""Apocalypse"" from 2016 weren't what ""The Hobbit"" was to ""The Lord of the Rings"", it was not about things that happened earlier in the same story. It was about starting from scratch. So, there are now two conflicting stories within one and the same film series, and ""Days of Future Past"" here wants to stitch them together. Unless you erase your memory and switch your brains off, it does not work. That is a problem. There is an extended cut of the film, of course, but it doesn't help much.The cinematography here could have been better. The bright lights and the dark darkness don't look great. In fact, now, years later, there is another movie that handles the light and the color like that when it comes to the dark future. That movie is ""Terminator: Genisys"" that most seem to hate. Still, the future scenes are the best part of ""Days of Future Past"" because they have some of the scariest movie villains ever. And the visual effects, unlike the cinematography, are good, if not great here. But this dark future does not have much screen time, and what does is the year 1973. There are moments here that show the events taking place through a camera from that year. These moments don't really do anything for the plot of the film, but they have more color to them than the rest of the 1973 footage. It looks very pale as though it was drained of as much color as possible, and when it comes to visual effects, some of it looks artificial. In ""MIB 3"" someone has to go even further back in time, to the sixties, only the footage from that time looks just fine in that film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Awful Display of Blind Robbery Among Movie-Goers,"X-Men Days of Future Past showed just little enough in the trailers to not let you know that the entire movie was going to be butchered, but just enough to make it seem incredible. The entire movie was made simply to rectify the Giant Sh*t that Brett Ratner on X-Men The Last Stand. Of course the could have used about 1/3 of the movie to fix what Ratner did by killing off all the good/main characters. But instead the whole movie was used to follow a story line that doesn't make any logical sense. Movies that depend on moving to the past to change the future are improbably to direct properly, because no matter what the conflict is, there is an easier way to go about it, i.e. go back a little further then planned and stop the beginning conflict from taking affect (hard to go into detail without spoiling.) All in all 20th Century & Marvel did a fantastic job of stealing your money, putting Jennifer Lawrence on a pedestal (Mystique is supposed to stay blue most of the time, that's the point) and showing that Hugh Jackman can be an old man & ripped.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Milestone,"I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with prequels.This film begins in the relatively near future where Humanity has gone to war against mutants, seen as a real threat to the future of the world. And they are winning! There are fewer and fewer mutants thanks to the Sentinela Program's hunting robots, created decades earlier with the mission of developing defenses in an eventual large-scale war. Isolated in what appears to be an inaccessible spot in Tibet, the surviving X-Men allied themselves with Magneto and what remained of the Mutant Brotherhood in a kind of last stronghold of combat. Here, when using their gifts and abilities together, they decide to send Wolverine (the most resistant and the only one capable of self-regeneration) on a risky mission to the past, in order to interrupt the chain of events that would give rise to the Sentinel Program and waging war before it even starts.The film is excellent in every way, but it is necessary to be attentive to understand well, given that it takes place at the same time in the present (which corresponds to a future close to ours) and in the past. Brilliantly directed by Bryan Singer, the film has a very pleasant pace and there are no dead moments or scenes that feel out of place. Everything works like clockwork. Of course, the action is an essential part of the film. The script is original and creative, but accessible enough to be understood without having to think too much. On the one hand, it gives a logical follow-up to the events of the previous films, and on the other hand it creates a temporal paradox where the whole story is corrected, so the films that will come later will focus on this new line of events. I believe that one of the most symbolic moments of this film is the short conversation that young Xavier has with his older alter-ego of the future, a truly anthological moment.The cast is massively inherited from previous films and is composed of great actors. The majority, therefore, are already familiar with the characters, and there are many characters and a large number of great actors. The quality of the material given to the actors was reflected in the quality of their work, which is really good. Hugh Jackman has all the prominence in this film and knows how to use it. The character Xavier appears in its two cinematic versions (the mature Xavier by Patrick Stewart and the young Xavier by James McAvoy) and the same goes for Magneto/Erik (the young version is brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender while the mature version belongs to the impeccable Sir Ian McKellen). Jennifer Lawrence shone in the role of the cruel and cold Raven/Mystique and Halle Berry finally managed to find herself as Storm after a series of average performances. The film also features Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Anna Paquin, Peter Dinklage, Shawn Ashmore, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Famke Janssen and James Marsden.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. Its a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually it is a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The scenes and action sequences are great and the effects are a bonus, although the final fight sequence against the robots sometimes seems excessive. As happened almost always in this franchise, the film has excellent sets and costumes and there is a pleasant feeling of time in the scenes from the Sixties, thanks to all the details that we are observing. Cinematography is good and uses color and shadow well. The editing work was impeccable. I think it is fair to also greet the makeup department and the great soundtrack by John Ottman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"This film was released wide in the USA on May 23rd, 2014","It was only a matter of time before we would see the FOX X-Men universe combine their two eras together. The original series debuted in X-Men (2000), complete with two sequels. The new series began with X-Men: First Class (2011), which precedes this film. There also was a solo Wolverine film, that came out in 2009, so it was time to combine the great points of both eras. Also, you can expect some great Hugh Jackman/Logan moments coming in this film. But, Wolverine isn't all of it. Pretty much, everyone, from both eras, are in this film. For anyone who hasn't seen any of the FOX X-Men film franchise, this is the one to see, because it gives you a dose of both worlds. It gives you the best idea of what the franchise was like. It is not the best X-Men film. I reserve that label for the first two films (2000 & 2003), but this one is pretty good. Speaking of which, director Bryan Singer, who directed the first two films, took a break from the X-Universe, but eventually returned for this film.Another interesting aspect of this film is the idea of time traveling, of sorts. It's actually a brilliant way to merge these two eras together. It's a simple explanation too. Wolverine's conscious is transported back to his current body found in 1973, to find and stop Mystique/Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), from making a huge mistake. Raven, who through the wrong intentions, is the catalyst to the creation of the mutant-killing androids, known as the Sentinels. These killer robots, built off of mutant DNA, in Logan's original time period, are on the verge of wiping out the planet Earth. So, it's back-to-the-future style, only with mind-transfers. It is Logan's connection to both time periods, that allows us to see what is happening in both places. It's Raven's actions, that set the course of the film. It's a great way to utilize these creatively complex Marvel characters.Michael Fassbender finally settles in well with his antagonist, Magneto character. The leader of the evil mutants, bent on making mutant-kind king. The opposite view of the heroic mutant X-Men. The X-Men have always stood for coexistence with human-kind. It is the Sentinels, that makes them set aside their differences and all if them have to band together to stop this horrible threat. In the future (or a possible present), we see Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), a duo of classically trained actors, use the wisdom and strength of the roles they have been doing for almost 15 years. The rest of the cast comprises of some of the younger students from Xavier's class, like Kitty Pride (Elliot Page) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). In the past time period, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy, the Beast (Nicholas Hoult), are the ones, who first meet the mind-time-transfer of Logan in 1973. It is a complex meeting. A meeting that proves things might be difficult for Logan's mission. It is this point, that takes the film onto the direction it needs to go, as we venture into this new time period of 1973.There also is a cameo from a stand-out character, that debuts with a huge flash and ends up being a break-out character and fan favorite. In order to find Raven's location, Logan, Hank and Charles, enlist the aid of a young man, Peter (Evan Peters), who is a speedster, to break Magneto out of his specialized, metal-free prison. The year before Pietro/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), debuted in the MCU (not counting his brief cameo in the end-credits of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), a month before this film was released), this is when the world meets for the first time, the Marvel character, Peter/Quicksilver. Trust me, there are plenty of more characters, who return to this film from all over the franchise, plus plenty of surprises too. Bryan Singer directs another good one. Ignore how things have changed for the X-Men film franchises since 2014. The future of these characters will be fine in the MCU's hands moving forward, but the FOX X-Men franchise ended, overall, a huge success and has become part of film history. Try and watch this film in a 2014 frame of mind. It's probably best not to compare the X-Men films with the MCU, because they are proving to be completely different from each other, but still based off the same intellectual property.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just okay,Saw X men today and I was really expecting something great if you read the reviews but I have to say it was just okay. I guess I must be suffering from superhero overload because I just can't get in to one movie after another that is about wanted destruction of some city. I guess my biggest gripe about this movie is that once again it's just the Wolverine show. Yes Professor X and Magneto are in the movie along with Beast and few others (yes the speedy guy was funny) but most are just window dressing for another Wolverine story. I wish we had gotten to see more of the Sentinels. I wish we had been about to see them from inception to the end. That might have been a halfway decent movie plot instead we get lets go back in time to save ourselves from these really cool robots. Too bad.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most underrated X-Men movie out there,"I'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, ""wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!"" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault.X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique.Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame.And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2.Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm looking forward to the next installment, Apocalypse.Wasn't too excited about the future Sentinels design, it looked way too CG so I'm hoping the next movie will incorporate more practical FX.So far in the X-Men series, I enjoyed Mangold's The Wolverine and X2 the most.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The story a good idea but (for me) they just dragged it out 20mins too much without ever adding any more real substance to what we already knew. The big scenes stole the show and the storyline 'stitching' and character interactions, developments, back stories fell a bit to the wayside.You always know they going to be OK (as already signed up for the next xmen film) so you watch a film in very much a different way as know the expected ending before the film even starts.A good film in the series but Xmen: First Class still my favourite one to date.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No Action!,"Being an X-Men fan, I was expecting superb action in the movie. Whereas the storyline is decent, the movie seriously lacks noteworthy action. This is an ongoing trend that movie goers in US are giving more weightage to story than action. And that's what probably drives the directors to focus more on script.However, last thing we expect from an X-Men movie is inferior action. Even a single comics of X-Men, a single episode of X-men animation, has more action than this movie. Lack of action means all the fun has been dragged away this time. The only fight I really enjoyed was the slo-mo action sequence with QuickSilver. Now that was IMPRESSIVE!Coming to plot.Q1. Wasn't Quicksilver the son of Magneto? Then what's with the new story?Q2. Why can't Kitty send Wolverine back in time to kill Trask before he creates Sentinel program? Or stop him from even being born?Q3. What's with Magneto's mood. First he tries to kill Mystique. Failing which he tries to kill Nixon! Wouldn't killing Nixon only ascertain the inevitable?Q4. The ending was most questionable. If the past is changed, wouldn't the future be changed in a PARALLEL universe instead of the one from which Wolverine's sent? OR, if there is NO PARALLEL universe, the future should have changed the moment Wolverine's consciousness was sent back.Instead, the future remains unchanged for the same time for which the past is unchanged. So, basically you are applying the concept (timeline) of Parallel Universe WITHOUT ANY PARALLEL universe. Wow!I know that Mindless action is appreciated by none. But please don't forget that it's a superhero movie for god's sake. See Avengers for example. Decent story, lots of comic moments and great action. Yet even with Sentinels in this movie, action is far from explosive.If story is what you want from an X-Men movie, by all means do enjoy this one. But if you want decent action, you are better off watching X2 for the nth time than Days of Future Past.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest X-Men Film,"X-Men: Days of Future Past was one of the most dramatic, emotionally driven, well-written, well-performed X-Men films. At just the right pacing throughout the film, the scene where James McAvoy's Charles Xavier and Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier meet in their minds was just one of the best; well-written and well performed. Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart made this film even more intriguing with their presence.Special mention must go to the music composer John Ottman. The musical score of Days of Future Past was simply amazing! It not only captured each scene perfectly, but drove the film deeper into drama and deeper emotions. The music in the scene mentioned above, as well as the near-ending scene when Mystique had made up her mind finally, was top-notch, keeping the viewer intensely engaged!Great job Bryan Singer, and the cast of Days of Future Past.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best X-Men movie up until Deadpool!!,"X-men Days of Future Past is the best X-men Movie of the main series and second if you count Deadpool. It is based in the comic of the same name and for those in the loop here is the basic story. After devastating War against the Sentinels ,robots programmed to hunt mutants, the team of the X-men sends Wolverine back in time in order to stop the cause of the fight from ever happening and by that preventing the War from occurring.The future itself is terrifying and comparing it with the mid seventies,where Logan has gone, makes you wander how an action decades before a tragedy can make or prevent the event. In the seventies also we meet the main cast of the characters of the First Class and thanks to Wolverine they are completed in the persons we all know and love. Personally after seen the flick for a third time I think that this is a Mustique film because her characters' actions show if we humans can become better or not and I really liked the portrait of Lawrence ,she is the end all Mustique ,from point of view. Pity that after the newest film she will leave the role, but she at least gave us a career define role.Although the director has made some changes of the original comic the basic is there and Singer adds something more : Hope. Apart from time travel, the fear created by racism , amazing action and see both the previous cast and the new in the big screen, this X-men movie has based on hope for the future ,hope for no matter how bad it gets we can still find a solution and as Patrick Stuart himself said in the movie: ""If someone lose his path does not mean that he will stay lost"" .In the end I love this flick and is my favorite comic book movie of 2014 ,even more than the Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy! With Bryan Singer on the director chair I feel safe that Apocalype will be good and the main cast are as solid choices as they get ,so Mutant and Proud comic and in general geek comrades :) !!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"X-Men is back, and better than ever!","I just got back from seeing this and I'm awestruck! I heard in an interview with Bryan Singer, the director of this film, the original film that started it all, 2000's X-Men & the sequel X2: X-Men United, that in this film, he was trying to tie everything that had happened after the first two movies and fix the problems. In that I say he did a spot on job and bravo! If you are a fan of these films, I guarantee this will be your favorite of the franchise! It is so good! The action is wonderful, the story is intriguing to follow and the film looks great and sounds awesome. I'm one of those film fans that noticed that the first three films in the franchise, start out in the same way in that after the 20th Century Fox logo comes on and then fades to black, the 'X' in Fox stays a bit longer before eventually fading too. I was hoping since Singer was back with the franchise, that this little treat to the fans would return too, and it does!

Best X-Men yet,"The advent of the outstanding X-Men: First Class (2011) revitalized the franchise and enabled a new sequence of stories to be portrayed. Based loosely on the iconic comic of the same name, Days of Future Past depicts another astonishing story.In a dystopian future, mutants are facing extinction courtesy of Sentinels, robots designed for the solitary purpose of obliterating mutants. In order to prevent such mass genocide of their species, Wolverine must travel back in time and alter history before everything unravels.Adjacent to a fascinating narrative, the stellar cast is one of the movie's USP's. Days of Future Past features Oscar winners like Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry and franchise veterans such as Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Furthermore, the eclectic array of thespians is completed by Michael Fassbender and the standout performer, James McAvoy.Playing a desolate Professor X, McAvoy delivers a sublime performance. So often the major thematic thrust of the story, the central conflict between Professor X and Magneto is a recurring theme and provides excellent character moments between the two. The supreme dynamic shared by the duo is still intact.The premise also allows an epic scope and features unprecedented action in the X-Men series. The sentinels provide a dominating adversary for mutants, which results in exquisite action sequences, both past and present.Moreover, Days of Future Past also signals a return to form for director Bryan Singer, following his last outing in the comic book genre, the insipid Superman Returns. The X-Men represent some of Marvel's most enduring characters and this installment is an impeccable testament to that.The writers also deserve an honorable mention: the difficult concept of time travel is handled well without glaring loopholes. Also, tying proceedings to actual historical events, such as the Cuban missile crisis in First Class is a masterstroke. The outcome is a more cogent and captivating story.Yet another unique aspect of X-Men is its social relevance. It retains laudable cultural context and tackles universal themes of isolation and discrimination. The notion of mutants is an extraordinary way of providing societal commentary, pertaining particularly to racism and sexuality.The latest chapter in the X-Men saga does have minor glitches though. The costumes or lack thereof, remain poor. Keen observers will also notice that the inconsistent timeline and continuity are in disarray as well. However, these represent only slight concerns and take little away from an otherwise pulsating movie.Ambitious and engaging in equal measure, Days of Future Past is action packed, brimming with emotion and has the feel of a comic book come to life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's going to be tough to top this.,"X-Men: Days of Future Past sort of blew me away. And here's the kicker - you don't need to have seen the previous movies in the series to understand what's going on. There's an unerring blend of past and present characters, real heart-in-your-throat tension, and stunning effects. Yeah, so I sort of liked it a little bit.I don't mean to fawn, but sometimes it's appropriate. This is a great movie. In a nutshell, here's your story. It's sometime in the future (2029? not sure). The Sentinels, robots built with the sole purpose of eradicating all mutants, are on the rampage, tracking said mutants down and slaughtering them, full stop. In fact, they've become so advanced that when a mutant defends against/attacks a Sentinel, that mutant's powers are absorbed by that Sentinel. Get it? It's a bad scene.Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellan), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and other assorted X people have holed up in the middle of nowhere, awaiting their doom. Xavier believes that the only way to stop the war on mutants (and on sympathetic humans, by the way, in case you missed the analogy) is to travel back in time to prevent the creation of the Sentinels in 1973. Now, Professor X wants to be sent back (don't worry, Kitty Pryde is on the job), but because of the long time period between '73 and the present, Pryde thinks the journey would snap even the Professor's mind. Instead, they opt to send Wolverine back, because he's essentially unchanged from 1973 (more-or- less ageless, really) and would therefore adjust better to the trip. And so back he goes.A solo, rogue mission by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), in an effort to destroy Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels, merely gave the public and the government cause to turn on the mutants, thus sparking the war. So: Wolverine is to locate Mystique and persuade her to give up her cause, and he won't be able to do so without the help of...the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Aye, there's the rub, huh? Older, wiser Magneto regrets fighting Charles Xavier all those years, but younger, angrier Magneto isn't so shrewd. (They're just like people!)So there's your setup. Young Magneto is being held secretly about 100 stories below the Pentagon in a super-ultra-mega-maximum security cell for the murder of...well, never mind. Young Xavier, on the other hand, is hiding out at his School for Gifted Youngsters, which no longer is a school nor houses youngsters, except for Beast, who helps his mentor faithfully. Thus the movie unites not only good mutants and bad mutants but younger and older versions of themselves, more or less. And because of the trippy time shenanigans, you could possibly see familiar mutants, from movies other than the First Class one. Sounds like this would make for a crowded cast, but the action centers around the younger Magneto and Xavier, Mystique, Wolverine, and the younger Beast (Nicholas Hoult).It feels so good to have Bryan Singer back behind the wheel. The story flows in sync with the dazzling, but not distracting, effects, as if a steady-handed auteur was in charge. This feels like the most authentic and personal X-Men film to date, and I (yeah, yeah) liked each of the others. And heaven forfend if I bust out a spoiler, but you know what they say about time-travel movies: they can change things, man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Save your money,"Leave this one for DVD or cable. Definitely not worth going to a movie theater to watch it. I learnt it the hard way. A lot of sissy fights between Xavier and Magneto, that's about it. Wolverine, as usual, was the only saving grace. Hank McCoy gave a subtle but good performance. At last, Jennifer Lawrence is finally learning to act, she does show some good emotions instead of her usual stony face.The movie loses pace in between with footage being wasted on the above mentioned sissy fights between McAvoy and Fassbender. Haven't we seen enough of this war of words already? It nearly put me to sleep right in the theater. It was only the second day after the movie launch and the theater was barely two-thirds full.

The future looks bright for the X-Men franchise,"I have waited months for X-Men: Days of Future Past to be released and finally got the chance to see it yesterday. I had high expectations going into the film due to all of the marketing, trailers and build up and it's fair to say the film exceeded my expectations. The film delivers on all levels from the acting, visual effects, storyline and action. All of the cast give impressive performances, but James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence stood out to me the most. One of my favourite scenes in the film is the prison break scene where we get to see Quicksilver in action. Not only do we see Quicksilver in action we get to see things from his perspective when he's moving at superhuman speed. I liked how the film slipped in a little reference to the father and son relationship between him and Magneto.A lot of new characters make their big screen debut such as Bishop, Warpath, Sunspot and Blink. Although most of the new characters have little screen time they make a big impression and we get to see them go toe-to-toe with the Sentinels. It was great to see characters like Blink and Bishop in action and how they use their abilities to battle the Sentinels. Another highlight of the film for me was seeing Iceman (Bobby Drake) in full ice form performing the famous ice slide. The overall tone of the film is a lot darker than previous X-Men films, but there's a lot more at stake in this film. There's still humour in the film and a few one liners that will give you a laugh. In my opinion X-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best films of the franchise and it's a good job Bryan Singer returned to direct the franchise he started on the big screen. Bryan Singer also rectifies a lot of the events which took place in X-Men: The Last Stand giving the impression that the film never happened. The future looks bright for the X-Men franchise and I can't wait for X-Men: Apocalypse to be released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best non-Marvel studio Marvel film!,"I love Marvel studio super hero films... All of them. I gave Avengers a 10/10, mainly because it's an incredibly well put together entertaining film that successfully collaborated multiple heroes into a film.With that said, I am one of thousands of Marvel fans who wants to see all marvel character rights go back to Marvel Studios...But... the X-men films... Which are made by Fox... I have a reservation with. Fox has done a respectable job and I don't mind them handling X-Men... First class reinforce that belief of mine...But with Days of Future Past... I'm a believer that Fox should keep X-Men (until they mess up anyways).This film reminded me of the epic sentinels vs Xmen cartoon episodes I watched growing up, it was surreal watching the first 20-30 minutes. It was magnificent!!!The film never faltered IMO, it was simply a job well done... The characters introduced were memorable, the villains felt invincible and you really feared them and for the Xmen.If you like action films you need to see this, if you like hero films this is the best hero film since Avengers. Yes, even better than Winter Soldier which was fantastic. It's a can't miss film.It's a classic and I was shocked how well Fox were able to do it. Acting, pacing, story, characters etc... It's all here and done well.9.5/10 - Extremely highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunning,"I can't tell you how incredible this was. This would probably the best film of X-men series, why? First, the story was fantastic and never lost my attention. Secondly, the characters were pretty amazing, especially Wolverine. While he always the central character of the franchise, Hugh Jackman portrays him well and his performances never gets old. Jennifer Lawrence also did decent job as Mystique. The rest of the characters were pretty good as well.The fight action scenes were definitely the best parts of the movie, mostly because of its eye popping special(and visual) effects. The opening scene with the mutants fighting against the sentinel robots and the final battle towards the end were my favorite scenes of the movie.This is best movie I've seen this year so far. I'm excited for the this series next installment, which is called X-Men Apocalypse and set to be released in May 2016.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Consider this redemption for X-Men,"Not too long ago, I really thought X-Men went off the rails, especially after the last movie. I didn't really care for X-Men: First Class. However, after re-watching Days of Future Past on FXX, I think I was too harsh on the film when it was first released in theaters. If you think about it, it's basically the Terminator set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (YES I'm saying X-Men is apart of the cinematic universe because I'm sick to death of all those dumb asses who call themselves ""true Marvelites"" who are saying ""X-men isn't.""). That's the dumpy, pathetic moneymakers at Disney talking. Well, X-men is and always be Marvel's favorites, even as the years wear on. Without spoiling the entirety of the film itself, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a redemption mark for the entire X-Men franchise.

X-Men: Days of Future Past 2014 Review,"Time travel can really be a mixed bag, either they hit it home or they just make no sense. Days of Future Past does it just right. It can be confusing at points, and especially at the end, but you can still piece it together pretty well.
The action though, is definitely the highlight of the film. Right from the start Days of Future Past really shows off an amazing range and use of powers from some new mutants, and some old. That really carries through the entire film too, making you even care more about side characters from the previous X-Men installments.
The Quicksilver kitchen scene was probably my favorite.
Acting wise, other than McKellen, Stewart, and Jackman who have all proven themselves in the past films, James McAvoy does an amazing job as young Prof. X.
I really think my only complaint with this film is the pacing, I had a real probably with this movie slowing down, picking back up, slowing down, and picking back up. It made the film seem a lot longer than it was and honestly made it drag a bit.
But other than that, action was amazing, the execution of time travel was well done, McAvoy had an amazing performance and was all around a good watch. Definitely a good mix of the old, and the new enough to make any X-Men fan happy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest superhero films of all time,"I have never been a full X-Men fan, I have enjoyed each one of them, with the exception of Wolverine Origin (which was garbage). First Class was a great reboot of the franchise, but I never thought the sequel to that would as as great as it was.Right off the bat, you are thrown into a fantastic story-line that draws you in. Seeing the old cast along side the new, was spine-tingling. The futuristic themes of this film work very well, and the film is edited perfectly to merge and blend the past and future. There is next to no complaints I have about this film, while this isn't the realistic superhero movie you would see in the Dark Knight trilogy, this film most definitely matches it in terms of emotional impact and entertainment,The acting has never been so good in an X-Men film like here, every single actor in this film gives a top-notch performance, with James McAvoy being the stand-out. Jennifer Lawrence is also fantastic here, and it was good seeing her as the character blue Mystique rather than Jennifer we see in the first one. It is difficult to say who the main villain of this film is, as there is many to choose from, but Magneto does a great job.Quicksilver is in this movie, and despite his limited screen-time, he gives the best scene in the film. The action is also very good as well, with no shaky cam, and no serious fast cuts.This is the best X-Men film so far, and a perfect superhero movie.9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Honest Review,"Hey, Days of Future Past. 10 out of 10.You have Singer back at the Helm adapting one of Claremont's most loved story arcs (and really one of the shortest) into pure pop corn chomping escapism.But then. he had to do a great job on it. X-Men is a beloved title. The X-Men spinoffs are beloved. Days of Future Past is one of the X-Stories that gets crowned time and again by us nerds.Singer walked in there knowing that if he messed it up he'd be lynched by fanboys and that is an extremely embarrassing way to go. There are certainly more painful ways to die, but few that are more humiliating than death-by-fan-boy.Thankfully he did pull it off. He adapted it nicely to fit into the established chronology of the X-Franchise and he did with style and grace.You get glimpses of favorite characters, epic battles in the future, the return of characters we loved from the original franchise, a fun romp through the 70s and, just because he is THE fan favorite, Logan gets to time travel instead of Kitty. Besides, neither this Shadowcat nor Ellen Page have ever seen the 70s.And to top it all off you get a fun new character. Sure, Quicksilver was more true to form in Age of Ultron, but the X-Franchise version of him is utterly entertaining.It is a win on all counts.Unfortunately, like X2, it's the sequel that stands out before the reboot does a Last Stand swan dive into horrible.So, as with X2, if you are going to watch one X-Reboot, watch Days of Future past. 10 out of 10, pure geeky entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the rare gems of this year's movies,"The story follows Wolverine as his mind is sent back through time, using Kitty Pride's powers, into his old body to stop a losing war between mutants and the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels. He then finds and convinces young Charles/Professor X and Hank/Beast to help him. Charles is able to walk by taking Beast's serum, in exchange of temporarily losing his mutant powers. Aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik/Magneto from his concrete prison. Logan tells the group that the war starts from the moment Raven/Mystique kills Trask, the scientist who designs the Sentinels. The group catches Raven just as she's about to kill Trask and her cover is blown. Trask escapes and Erik shoots Raven to prevent anyone getting her DNA that can help Sentinels against the mutants. Hank disrupts Erik but he manages to fire and hit Raven. Logan sees Stryker in the room and he goes haywire, injuring Kitty in the present. Erik keeps on hunting Raven, as bystanders watch in horror, but Beast tackles Erik as Raven escapes. Erik manages to escape after subduing Beast. People panicked at the sight of mutant powers in public and Trask wins funding for the Sentinels.Raven ambushes Erik, but Erik tells her Trask has gotten her DNA from the blood on the street. When Logan's group reaches home, Charles goes ill as he needs the serum. Logan convinces Charles not to take it and to read his mind, by which the old and young Charles converse. Erik slips into the Sentinel shipment and reconfigure the non-metal Sentinels into having metals. Charles locates Raven but fails to stop her. Logan's group then goes to the Sentinel launching event in the White House to stop her. Erik goes to the same venue. Logan's group arrives then Charles locates and subdues Raven. Suddenly the Sentinels, under Erik's control, turns on and go haywire so the VIPs flee to a vault bunker. Erik then drops a stadium around the White House, pinning Charles in the debris. Erik yanks the vault up. At the present, fighting also rages on and the mutants slowly but surely losing their ground, dying one by one.Logan and Hank attacks Erik, but he sends a Sentinel on them. Hank handles the Sentinel, but Erik incapacitates Logan, tying him with metal bars then throws him into the river. Erik then rips open the vault and makes a speech about the mutant world order. Raven, disguised as the President goes out from the vault and challenges Erik. Hank patches his serum and the Sentinel goes from him into targeting Erik and Raven. Erik disjoints the robot and Raven shoot him and removes his helmet. Charles then subdues Erik but Raven aims then gun to Trask. Charles reasons with her. As the present Sentinels fire beams to kill the remaining Logan and Kitty, they all disappear. Raven yields in, dropping the gun thus altering the future. Logan wakes up in the present Xavier school, seeing all those who have died still live. He meets Charles and Charles realizes that it is the Logan from the past and begins explaining what Logan has missed from the past to this altered reality.The base story is just exceptionally great. Though it's not as epic as other sci-fi gems, but it's able to present a complex story without differing from the original comics story characteristics. It is by far the first movie to successfully marry the concepts of super-powers and time-travel in one story and executes the story greatly.The movie also offer some epic moments, some never before seen in any movie. I personally liked the Quicksilvers resonating hands and of course Magneto's stadium drop. The dialog contains many catchy comments. I liked Magneto's words to Logan as seeing his claws ""Imagine that with metal"" that sounded just as vividly as a premonition of what is to come.One thing that's not so satisfying is that the movie looks to be too limited by a duration length target that it doesn't spare any character development on any of the newly appearing mutants. I just hope that they get more spotlight in the next movie.There is little to complain about the acting. A-list cast of stars is a great choice in doing this movie. The parts composition for each characters is great, able to showcase the senior talents in enough duration and at the same time still keeping the younger and newer talents to keep the lead roles. Hugh Jacman's Logan is an exception on this though, due to his character have a great relevance to the story's technical aspect.The score department is good that is helps to build the scenes' mood well, keeping the focus at the characters and without being overbearing. The costumes and set department did great in reliving the 1970s era in the movie, though unfortunately, there's not much scenes that focus on things that are particularly special to that era.From me, I'm glad to say that this is one of the most deserving 8 out of 10 scoring movie this year, and a recommendation is an absolute certain yes. I watched this in the streaming sites, and will definitely watch this again on DVD or any other higher quality medias.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It is not quite smart, sophisticated or even epic as the hype, just a piece of entertainment and technically well made sequel","""Days of Future Past is not your brainless blockbuster film, it is moving, entertaining and classy, but the main focus of the story, time travel adventure is not intriguing or that sophisticated or mind blowing. It was plain and simple working as a plot device, so this X- Men movie is not ""The Butterfly Effect"" or ""Donnie Darko"" of X-Men movies. By the way, in social media, this film is compared to ""The Usual Suspects"" and it is said that ""Days of Future Past is as brilliant as that. I have to disagree. Briefly, there is an event which shouldn't happen and our team tries to stop it before happening, but there is no really a puzzle to solve. Personally, my favorite X-Men film is the first one, it has a special place in my heart. X-2 was great and the most powerful film in the series maybe. As for The Last Stand, I am terribly sorry, but I liked and enjoyed that movie very much. The third movie had the best action and the most ""close to comic book"" tone. It was not cheesy like some other super hero movies and some deaths might be frustrating for many fans, but it was realistic and dark. The second serious problem of ""Days of Future Past"" is that the future depiction in the film was pretty disappointing like a sci-fi movie made for cable TV and the designs lacked creativity. It was like I was watching Mortal Kombat 2. By the way, I would have wanted to see Storm and old Magneto more. Those characters have very short appearances. Briefly, the future scenes were poor somehow. At the beginnings, the movie has a light tone, but it gets darker after a while which is good. The characters? Well, The Beast is more intense here, Fassbender steals the show and as for Jennifer Lawrance and her Mystique, she is gorgeous, she has a charming beauty and as a character, she delivers, but I still looked for Rebecca Romijn for some reason. Toad is passive here. Sentinels are impressive, but I had problem with their size. The famous Quicksilver scene is brilliant, the best scene of the movie, but it was like a copy of Nightcrawler scene in X-2. The action in the film is neither over the top nor bad. Days of Future Past is not an action packed like the third or the first film, but the action was solid. I disagree that drama and action is perfectly balanced in the film. The stadium scene is another must see part of the film. Finally, like The First Class, the tone of the movie is more realistic rather than fantastic, by the way The First Class is a way better film than DOFP. ""Days of Future Past"" is not a masterpiece or even great, but a pretty solid film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good movie, however ratings here are overrated","Okay, they've got a wonderful list of casts in there. Great acting, great special effects, great showcase of fictional characters, but... the only thing that's not so well done is the plot.Time travel has always been a fascinating movie theme, one that's difficult to get right, because time traveling is a fantasy, it could NEVER be real, physics would not allow that. But, there are some fantastic time traveling movies -- Back to the Future (especially the first one) is a good example. X-Men: Days of Future Past, however is NOT. I'll just leave it at that.If I were to compare this with the previous X-Men movies, this has got to be the least interesting one. This movie lacks focus. Okay, maybe Mystique was the focal point of the movie (character wise), but we didn't get to know her any better than we did going in, so that couldn't be it. The story was pretty generic, the only redeeming quality of this movie, that's new to its prequel, is the coming about of the sentinels.To sum up, it's a good movie to be watching around with families, but if you step into the theater expecting a 8.5 or 9 movie, you'd be disappointed. Although you'll get to see all your favorite actors and characters, you'd leave feeling kinda of empty. Maybe a good meal would fix that up!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very average.,"Unless you are one of these people still dazzled by fight scenes and graphics, this film will be very average for you. 7/10 is about the most I would expect any sane person to bestow upon this (and IMDb has proved yet again that there are far more stupid people about than intelligent ones).Firstly, when going into a film based on a comic book, you have to extend your suspension of disbelief. If I came into this review lambasting the far fetched powers, then that would be rather silly. Although X-Men is based in our world, being a comic book, it is afforded some leeway. Even so, I would just like to point out that much of what goes on in the X-Men is scientifically impossible, so I don't rate it as a sci-fi... more a sci-fantasy.I won't go into a big review with this film, because I don't think it really deserves that much attention. Instead, I will summarize: The Good: 1. The film is mostly well paced (apart from that stupid video game sequence at the start).2. The acting is good.3. The visuals are good. One scene in particular, which is in slow motion (you will know what I mean when you see it), is pretty cool and well made.4. The characters are likable.The Bad: 1. The X-Men's abilities are far too powerful, especially Magneto's. Not only does it come across as laughable, some of the things they achieve, but more importantly, it breaks the tension. Instead of fearing the worst for our heroes and for their future, we are constantly allowing for an 'anything can happen' scenario. There is one part of the movie where Magneto lifts a giant structure (no spoilers) off the ground like it is a piece of play-doh. That's all well and good, but without a shred of believability (even for X-Men), and without seeing some sort of limit to these powers, there is no dramatic tension. The movie does at least place limits on some of the other characters... for a time.2. The plot is very basic. When I found out this film had a time travel element, I was interested. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted here, so don't go into this movie expecting some really well written time travel stuff. The way in which the time travel works in this film is not original either (despite some claims), and has been done countless times before- for example in Babylon 5 (my favourite show, and infinitely better written than this). The general plot is way too simplistic. The pacing may be decent, but the story just plods along. No decent twists or parts where you have to engage your brain. It's just auto-pilot storytelling.3. JFK was killed by Oswald. I am sick and tired of seeing conspiracy garbage portrayed as reality. If you are a logical person, and have done proper research, you will come to the sane conclusion that Oswald did it. The odds on it not being him are astronomical, based on the wealth of evidence that exists. The film does include a twist in this regard, but it's an absolutely absurd twist.4. Evolution does not work like this film supposes. There are too many writers out there that have no idea how it works, or how science in general works. When dealing with a film like the X-Men, you'd think they would hire proper advisers.Overall, I was disappointed with the film, but it was still worth the watch, and the day out to the cinema. 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great visuals and ensemble of characters but plot was pretty average.,"Having only watched one of the previous X-Men films, I wasn't really expecting much. But after watching this, it rekindled the little kid in me that used to watch the animated X-Men shows on television. It was great to see all kinds of mutants (and actors/actresses) with different powers, even though I didn't know their background. Cool stuff. The visuals and effects were really well done. It seemed like a more mature film than I had imagined based on the previous films.The acting too was on point, everyone played their parts and got into their characters really well. At one point I even consciously acknowledged this when McAvoy as Xavier was concentrating really hard and you could see the vein on his forehead bulge out. The character developments was also well explored and it showed on screen. The character of Quicksilver was a really good addition. He added a comedic effect and the slow motion scenes were great and accurately complimented the character.However there are quite a few things I have a problem with, mainly with the plot. It seemed a bit too easy for Wolverine to convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to believe him, when he didn't really do much himself. And why are Xavier and Magneto the only ones ageing? There's a strong difference between the characters from the past and present..hmm now that I think about it, it's probably because the rest of the mutants weren't in the present (with the exception of Wolverine who's immortal). OK like I said, I didn't watch the other films. I'm wanting to now though.Anyway, it was a really cool film, with cool characters and a kind of cool plot. It's just that it kind of made everything seem...redundant. If you've watched it, you'll get what I mean.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sentimental Joyride that gives us hope again.,"Spoiler-free review!After Brett Ratner's unforgivably ""meh"" X-Men: The Last Stand, mutant rights when down the toilet, and the government unleashed their most powerful and flashiest weapons yet — The Sentinels.These fan-favourite enemies are giant robots — though here they're more medium-rare robots — who have all but destroyed mutant kind and almost the entire world with them.Professor Patrick Stewart hatches a plan to employ Kitty Pryde's time-phasing power and send Wolverine back in time. He embarks on a mission to prevent the initial development of the Sentinels from ever happening.This lands us in 1973, the only place Wolverine was ever fashionable. He must reunite the cast of X-Men First Class, convince them that he's not a crazy steroid junkie, and change destiny.As you may have seen by the ten stars above, I was insurmountably impressed by this film. As someone who grew up with the excellent X-Men 1 and 2, then crying at number 3, then shrugging my shoulders at the adequacy of the rest of them, I am glad to say that X-Men movies are at last really, really good again.This film delivers enjoyment for both fans of the original film series and the (sort of) First Class reboot. While the film primarily takes place in the past, with the young un's, the original cast are utilized wonderfully in their awesome post-apocalypse future. (Pun!)In a sea of drearily plotted and overly flashy superhero movies, this film displays a surprisingly intelligent plot line, incorporating elements from over half a dozen previous films in a way that will delight old and new fans.Some initial worries of mine were the executive mandated appearances of Quicksilver and a larger Mystique. (not a comment on Jennifer Lawrence's weight) However the film takes these plot points and utilizes them to the greatest effect. Quicksilver is brilliant, his hair is brilliant, and Mystique's role within the film fees natural and provides great drama and character struggle.I have only small criticisms, mostly directed at the film's technical aspects. There's an unfortunate overuse of slow-mo, which is effective for the sequences of Quicksilver, but otherwise very annoying and it gives me horrid memories of The Amazing Spiderman 2.Overall, the film is a superb experience and I highly recommend to everyone. There is great action which serves the plot, top-notch acting from old and new, and even a surprise ending which will usher the tears from fanboys everywhere.Go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lazy retconning undermines an otherwise fun film.,"The film would be a lot more engaging if it wasn't in a much larger series. The storyline uses an interesting take on time travel and the writing keeps the mechanics mostly clear and clean. Likewise, Singer's direction keeps the proceedings grand and satisfying with inventive scenes and period detail. But fundamentally this film is a soft-reboot of the series that mainly exists to erase X-Men 3 and other media properties the fans were not fond of. In short, it is fan service.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Three tales unite into one, well done Singer","Happy Memorial day weekend my friends, and what better way to welcome the weekend than with another movie review. Today we cover the new X-men movie, a series which over the last 14 years has split into three story arcs that has led to a mixture of receptions. Yet director Bryan Singer has returned to the project to hopefully clean the mess others have made, hopefully returning the spark the first two movies held. Did it work? Read on to find out.From the trailers, X-men Days of Futures Past is a time traveling adventure that sends the rugged Wolverine back into the past to meet up with the youthful, though distraught, X- men. The goal of this mission is to stop the construction of the legendary mutant hunting sentinels, and prevent a dark future from arising that could mean the end of humanity.I know a bit cliché, but despite the stale time traveling story line the latest X-men feature has a lot of great qualities. We'll start with the acting. Days of Future Past has a lot of characters that fans will recognize and perhaps be excited to see. Hugh Jackman has stepped back into the Wolverine role, still bringing the tough guy with a big heart and even bigger edge back to the screen. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as young X and magneto, bringing back some of their chemistry, while bringing other qualities to their characters. Of course most are interested in Ms. Popularity herself, Jennifer Lawrence, playing the young, and deadly, Mystique. Of all the characters, she has the broadest emotional spectrum, which Lawrence once again brings to life in her typical fashion that makes many lover her. The rest of the group does well, but due to space limitations and the fact they are secondary, I'll move on.Despite the story being just another time traveling tale, X-men Days of Future Past has great delivery to pull it off well. The first twenty minutes set the stage in an explosive opening, setting the pace and time limit of the movie. Once back in the past, Wolverine sets out to accomplish his goals, bringing in the rest of the crew gradually. This is where Singer's work speaks for itself as he somehow reveals more of his character's, while still keeping the film moving. I didn't see too many scenes where the mission had to stop while the group had a heart to heart *cough Batman *cough.As these characters changed, for better or for worse, the story twisted, keeping the plot fresh and more unpredictable than some of the tales in the past. It was great trying to figure out what the characters would do next, wondering how far some of the mutants would go to destroy the evil without throwing the events further into chaos. Of course, there are plenty of hints that take away from the surprise that, if you pay attention, will help you predict what is coming next, with a few exceptions of course.Yet the thing I really loved about this movie was how balanced everything was. Singer once again brought a blend of traits to his project that was done in the appropriate amounts. The comedic timing was top notch, having both old, new, and X-men reference styles present that were not overdone nor rubbed in my face. Drama was spread out evenly, not focusing on one character's drama for too long nor was it focused on a single type of drama (i.e. just on romantic affairs), keeping me interested instead of asking when will this end. Even the action was done well, with the opening getting the pace of the movie started, and ending with heated excitement to wrap up the intense story line. Such balance is key to many movies my friends, and something that many other genres lack.Of course there is no perfect movie, and X-men does have a few flaws for me. While they did a great job tying the three stories together, Singer and company had a few story stretches that were a bit too far-fetched for me. The explanation for how Xavier could walk, or how the X-men could so easily sneak about were just two examples. Another flaw included how some of the characters, primarily first class, were written off, requiring some close attention to detail to determine their fate. I know there are probably good reasons for this approach, but they best be careful for their next films to avoid any conflict. As for the action, while very balanced I wanted more. Special effects wise it was great, but the scenes lacked some excitement, and were surprisingly shorter than I had anticipated from the trailers.Overall Days of Future Past was one of, if not the best X-men movie I've seen. All three stories are integrated into a tale that will keep you on the edge, and is one of those suspenseful movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a balanced plot line, well done action, and some great acting, fans of the series may have their faith restored that this series can be good. Yes they still have some things to work on, but I trust that the next movie can be just as good, especially with the end of the credits scene. Just make sure to bring Singer back for that as well!Score overall:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie overall: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It holds its own.,"I was brought to this by a friend when I had only seen the 3rd movie before so if this was a little incoherent, perhaps that is my own fault.This cacophonous, mile a minute comicbook spiel is fun when you just let it wash over you (aren't they all?) If there's any more to it than that I missed it but there is definitely a sense of the formidable and touching int here somewhere.To be honest, the premise and the development make it feel like a very long episode of a TV show rather than a feature film. So there is that sort of casual but epic quality to it, more like certain episodes of Game of Thrones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men Days of Future Past,"This one of my most favourite superhero movies ever. I loved that this film brought the original cast and knew cast together. The performance are great, it's fun and there are great character interactions. There is some great action and the plot is great. I liked Mystique in this much more then in the previous film. The villain is ok but doesn't have much motivation to be doing what he is doing. Overall a fantastic movie in my opinion.9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I wish they would have ended here,"This movie is not only an amazing superhero movie, but also an amazing movie overall, the story is managed in an almost perfect way, it has some details that can annoy people that do know the timeline of the X-men movies, but those are very few and samll to even matter. This movies ending would have served as the perfect ending for this saga of X-men, and I say this because what they did in the next two, kinda changes this ending, and I think a better option would have been a reboot, with this being its own little saga. Still, those arent issues with this movie, this movie is near perfect in every way. The Best X-men movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is a movie that proves superhero movies are not just some cringe garbage for kids such as fantastic for. This is much more then that. It makes you feel the emotion and suspense that is going on and tho the main villains are robots and lack emotion, they still manage to strike fear and emotion when on screen.

"Very cleverly executed, THUMBS UP","I was reluctant to watch this film. Because the previous movies frustrated me a lot. But this time I am glad I watched it. Probably because I finally accepted this series will never climb above 8 stars in my book.The movie stands strongly for itself alone. But when I try to connect all the movies from this series, everything collapses.It's a superhero movie so I can't criticize the acting. Visual effects were good. Not stunning, I repeat not stunning. There was one particular quicksilver scene that everyone talks about. It was a brilliant scene. But not because of the visual effects. Yes, definitely not because of the visuals but for the cleverness. (Note to DC: your Flash better be better)The movie have clear plot holes and unscientific stuffs. But I can't blame the movie for them. It's because X-Men is originally a comic books series. But still when someone transform a comic into a movie, it's his responsibility to make it believable. 'Cause motion pictures don't have the liberty to get away with illogical stuffs. They have to be believable. Yet I enjoyed the entire 2 hours of this film.I liked the cast very much. Finally a X-Men movie with Wolverine, where the focus is not on Wolverine. It was nice to have the old X-Men casts and the new ones in the same film.Final Verdict: 68%. Very cool movie. Definitely the best X-Men movie. But my negligence for this franchise got increased a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best of the Franchise,"This is probably the best the X-Men franchise is going to get, especially considering the ensemble approach most of the films take. I think there's some unfocused storytelling going on that keeps it a hair's breadth away from greatness, but overall this is the best balancing act the franchise ever pulled off, managing two different casts and timelines with shocking style and seeming ease. Bryan Singer really brought his A-game, making possibly his best movie here.This franchise fits best together when you don't think about it too hard, keeping up generalities about relationships in mind without demanding specifics. In a surprisingly bold move, the movie starts by skipping ahead into the future to give us the X-Men version of a Terminator future where mutants are chased down by Sentinels that can detect them, adapt to their powers, and easily dispatch them if caught. The opening is nearly on par with the Nightcrawler attack on the White House that opened X2 in terms of cinematically introducing the audience to the world and the threat. This is a shockingly good action scene with almost no dialogue to explain who's what, the stakes, or the overall purpose, but it's still amazingly good edge of your seat entertainment with a handful of very specific goals: the danger of the Sentinels, the overall world, the minor characters, and the basic power that they will use to send Wolverine back in time.In 1973 Mystique killed a man named Bolivar Trask who was developing a mutant hunting weapon called the Sentinel. The assassination convinced the world that anti-mutant weapons were the best course of action instead of stopping development, and decades later they perfected and implemented the weapons, creating the dystopian vision the movie starts in. Professor Xavier, Magneto, Storm, and Wolverine find our minor characters led by Iceman and Kitty Pride in order to use Kitty's power of sending a person's consciousness into their younger self, how they were able to undo the attack that started the film. The plan would be to send Xavier back to 1973, but the length of time would be particularly difficult on the physical body, something his elderly frame couldn't take, so they send back Wolverine, ageless and able to heal instantly. Now, all of this is explained very quickly through clunky exposition, its only saving grace being that it's done so quickly. We don't have a couple of ten minute long scenes to explain it, it all comes out in a couple of minutes and then we're off. So, I can wish all day long that it was explained more elegantly, but at least it's done quickly.Sent back in time, Logan searches out Xavier who is taking a serum to suppress his powers and give him the ability to walk at the same time. Guarded and accompanied by Beast, who takes the same serum to suppress his new blue visage, Xavier has become jaded from his mission after the saving of the world from nuclear war at the end of First Class only led to a temporary understanding with humans and the Vietnam War robbed him of many of his teachers and students. Disillusioned, he refuses to listen to Wolverine at first, but mentioning Xavier's childhood friend, Raven/Mystique, is enough to get him out of the house. In order to convince her, though, they decide that they need to free Magneto from his prison several hundred feet below the Pentagon. In order to do that, Wolverine points them in the direction of Peter Maximoff, a young man in 1973 that Wolverine knew as an older man in the future but is a kleptomaniac youth who can run faster than the eye can see.The breakout is a fantastic sequence, told with energy and humor. It's the absolute standout moment of the movie as Xavier and Beast mess with the video surveillance, Maximoff takes a guard uniform, speeds Magneto from his cell, and then takes out a room full of guards as they fire guns at the group in a kitchen with the sprinkler system on. The use of ""Time in a Bottle"" fits perfectly with the scene, also providing an auditory counterpoint to the action that helps sell the comedic aspects of what's going on.This movie does a better job of including the overall political climate than First Class did. Trask is brought into a Senate hearing early. Xavier is jaded by Vietnam. Trask goes to Paris to participate in the Paris Peace Accords where Mystique plans on assassinating him, needing to use her ability to mimic people by copying a Vietnamese general. The mutant team arrives just in time, and Magneto just has the most amazing moments. He bend a bullet's path to shoot Raven in the leg. He uses the bullet in her leg to drag her towards him. He's going to kill her to protect their future. I'm a broken record on this, but Michael Fassbender is the best casting choice made in the X-Men movies.Everything comes to a head in DC where, at the same time in the future, the Sentinels have found the mutant hideout and both confrontations happen at the same ""time"". Now, that's just solid story construction right there, but it falls apart slightly on a second viewing. First of all, Magneto pulling Robert F. Kennedy Stadium up off the ground, flying it over to the White House, and plopping it around the Executive Mansion to cut off any police or military support from the ground while he uses the first generation Sentinels to provide air support is just great stuff. Xavier using his powers to plea with Raven as she gets within striking distance of Trask, who's on stage with President Nixon, is very good. Wolverine, though, he doesn't have a whole lot to do, and when Magneto throws him away from the scene into the Potomac River he's done with the scene. Where this ends up mattering is how it interacts with the future segment as the mutants steadily lose ground and people to the incoming threat. It's unclear at what point Wolverine has set the future on the right course, but it's long before Kitty Pride breaks the connection with him. His lack of involvement in the third act where he is a lynchpin of dramatic tension undermines that really well done third act a bit.Every character is going through different emotional arcs that aren't really related. Xavier is learning to re-embrace his powers after being jaded. Raven is learning that violence won't solve everything. Wolverine is learning, well, not much. The movie's focus isn't on these journeys and they're done well enough on their own, all tied together through the machinations of the plot so we never feel like they're unrelated scenes just plopped in out of nowhere, but I can wish that they were more in line with each other thematically. However, in a big spectacle driven action movie, that's not a huge problem at all when the focus is mainly elsewhere.Overall, this is a rousing fun time at the movies. An intelligently constructed adventure through time that uses special effects and action filmmaking tools to propel the audience the whole way through the two hour experience. This is comic book filmmaking on a grand scale, and while it may not be perfect, it's really enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrific blockbusting beginning of summer,"""So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?"" Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)It's not set if you can, like Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), go 50 years back into 1973 and stop the creation of the Sentinels, Terminator- like robot warriors created by scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), whose robots always defeat the mutants: ""From the beginning, the Sentinels were targeting the X-Men. Then they began targeting everyone."" (Wolverine)So the plot of the exciting X-Men: Days of Future Past begins. The use of mutants in the Vietnam War, and the war itself, serve as a conflict backdrop to show the path to annihilation begun even without the help of Sentinels.This iteration of a Marvel Comics hero collective is more complex and philosophical than its predecessors with new characters (mostly young versions of the X-men and women) that lend variety and interest and a measure of actor charisma. Besides the usual sturm and drang of robot arms like Gatling guns with eyes like beacons, this film has heart and humor as mutants and their leaders, Professor Xavier and his nemesis- now-bud, Magneto (Ian Mckellen), convene to send Logan back to convince their younger selves (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender) to save surviving humans and sometimes to deal with misunderstood loves and friendships.When director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg open with a moving shot of downtrodden mutants and sympathizers marching in unison, Fritz Lang's silent-movie Metropolis immediately comes to mind, and it evokes the theme of the oppressed waiting to rise up against the ruling class. Holocaust-like images of mutants and their sympathizers herded for internment camps chillingly reveal a doomed New York City.The mutants are, after all, different, and in current conservative thinking, enemies of the good American life, lily white that is. As the various outliers, including the X-Men, fight for equality and against suppression, Hollywood again does a credible job of mixing imaginative action with contemporary lives of the disadvantaged.Our heroes struggling with a vendetta-prone Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) adds interest to the usual survival motifs. She kicks butt with the best of them while she carries through her plan that actually dooms humans and mutants even more.The cast is terrific, even if the story goes on too long, as the film moves thrillingly from a sober beginning: ""Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction...."" Professor Xavier",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fattest Mystique, Casting Ruined Prequel to a Great Original X-men Trilogy, Reason I think for such bad casting choice inside the review.","If you seen original X-men trilogy Rebecca Romjin personified Mystique perfectly any true geek could rave about it for hours how she was supple, agile, mercurial and rubber like she was imagined to be. Superhero movies like any other good fantasy fiction have to be best make believe as it can be especially each character. Here comes prequel movie series to original Classic X-men movies with The First Class and we get Fattest Mystique anybody could imagine Jennifer Lawrence, it was disrespect to the character. I mean how did she land the character in 1st place, she could never be the actor that would come to anybody's mind when imagining the cast.Even let us say Jennifer Lawrence comes to audition how could somebody of her physique would pass the audition, what did she do for casting folks to overlook the main aspect the character. Only thing that comes to mind would be casting couch which Hollywood biggies don't like to talk about and boy she must be really good at it too. If you seen the movie she in pure Mystique form she looked more like somebody who ate Mystique rather than the supple mutant, considering she was also actress who played main lead in "" The Hunger Games"" around same time didn't seem to one prepared for that. Sorry if you think I am being disrespectful but as a absolute geek I was hurt when they disrespected the character by that casting choice. Even the best way she used to show Mystique's physical ability herself without a body double was by doing that side squat bend like if you remember when she did when she was on table in Paris hiding behind Xavier from Magneto.The height of Jennifer Lawrence worship is so extreme that the complete story concept was changed, Mystique powers just mimicked to look like somebody not take their powers. So same way the sentinels made from her DNA wouldn't be powerful with powers but just mimics. Now that was big goof but now the director knew that therefore made a Rogue Cut.This all really ruined the movie for me cause like I said before Superhero movies all the actor must look the character more so than any other movie type. Some folks might argue she is acts well but they surely could find somebody who acts well and actually would fit the look and physique. I do appreciate she slimmed down a lot by third installment of the movie series but then there were even worse casting goofs in that movie.But since the movie is from amazing original X-men storyline and hence got a hit but would have been bigger hit if the makers had been sincere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A disappointment,"I went to watch the movie looking for a action movie and what I got was a drama....!!! Definitely not worth watching in 3D. So do calibrate your expectations before you book this show. The movie starts off and it had me glued .... For a moment I thought it was Xmen combined with the Matrix , the attack on Xmen is almost in similar manner and by similar threats - sentinels, and same dialog ( ""they are coming"" , ""they found us "") but that's the limit of similarity . The action sequence was a bit boring or rather More confusing then exciting. The seniors come in after that and then it enters the drama mode and becomes a drag. The scenes with Quicksilver brings some excitement but a short lived one - Worth watching. By the climax magneto comes in action, makes things interesting for a while, but again doesn't get his normal exposure, what one would be used to seeing. Halle Barry / storm almost non existent in the whole movie, so don't expect to see her much. Off the female Xmen only Raven gets a good footage, but in most of it she is shown as the naive little girl... All in all I would say not that great to talk about and the 2 hrs + duration doesn't help too..... :-( .",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Single handedly erases all bad x-men movies,"he long awaited 7th X film that merges the universes of The Wolverine, X-Men and X-Men First Class is finally here! If you know anything about the X-Men movie franchise you know it's been a hit or miss series and in my opinion there have been more misses than hits and even then, the hits aren't misstep free. Now, any other studio would have just hit the reset button, so to speak, and rebooted the franchise with whatever pieces they wanted going forward. However, hats off to the writing team of Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn who instead undertook the truly herculean feat of not only telling the classic Days of Future Past story from the X-Men comics, but also writing a story that effectively rights all the wrongs done over the past 14 years of spotty movie making. Days of Future Past is quite possibly the best X-Men movie yet! The story is complex but in a nutshell, Wolverine is sent back in time to stop a series of events that start a catastrophic war in the future. Again, it is complex but the story is well put together and the cast is bursting at the seams with dozens and dozens of memorable X-Men and even more Easter eggs for the truly savvy fan. But you don't have to be a super fan in order to get enjoyment out of this movie. I'll admit I didn't know half of the mutants mentioned here, but I still left with a smile on my face. The special effects are great, the cinematography is first rate and the overall feel of the film plays like a gripping action thrill ride. X-Men: Days of Future Past does the seemingly impossible by making it OK to see even the bad X-Men movies. The bigger the mess is made the more fun it is to see it cleaned up I suppose. Of course, it is a movie about time travel and there are a few strange things in regards to that which made the movie a little confusing, but in the end its just small potatoes compared to the massive victory of a film this is. X-Men: Days of Future Past gets a 4.5...out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good. Evil. And somewhere in between.,"""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins solidly if unremarkably. New and well-known characters are introduced. A legendary enemy is revealed. A plot linking present with past is established. This is engaging stuff, and the film quickly sets itself up as an engrossing adventure with a serious tone and high stakes. It all makes for something entertaining but not special.Something happens along the way, however, and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins to resonate stronger and appeal more deeply. In a scene where the Charles Xavier of the past is confronted by his future self, the film ceases to be a run-of-the-mill superhero adventure. It becomes the story of a man with the power to impact the world. It becomes an observation of his journey and his impact on the characters and world around him, past, present, and future. It becomes the human story of understanding fear and embracing hope.Bryan Singer's spectacular ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is more than a sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"" or a prequel to ""X-Men."" It is a wrap-around event that courses through and changes the world of the previous films. It is a grand piece of entertainment that respects what has already been established in the franchise's universe and opens up a dynamic future. Pulsing with memorable and exciting set- pieces, the film is a solid action outing but, more importantly, has the soul of a character piece. It observe the journeys, the developments, the shifts, and the fulfillment of its colorful, comic book characters.The story is involving, but the story's characters are its highlight. They generate humor, warmth, anger, and excitement. Their arcs are tragic, epic, and triumphant. Their eyes are haunted and hopeful. They are the comic book gods of a new Olympus, but they are as human as their audience.Bryan Singer is blessed with a cast that is able to at once communicate not only the fantasy, mutant elements of their characters' bodies and brains but also the disparate humanity punctuating their actions. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen serve as godfathers and guardians of their younger charges. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender are both brilliant and burdened. They are ideally cast as broken men on separate paths.Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult both capture the vitality and impetuous juvenility of youth. They have suffered loss that colors their arcs, and it shows in their words and reactions. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, is an underutilized revelation with spirit and humor.Anchoring all of this is Hugh Jackman. Here, he is asked to stay in the background, but his charisma and knowing ferocity hold the rest of the cast, and the film, together. Jackman's Wolverine is now a leader and a less an antihero. His mantle of teacher, like that of Xavier's in the previous films, suits him well.Singer turns in a film composed of exhilarating action beats and satisfying character drama captured with a subtle visual style. His 1970s are subtly swinging and sepia-toned. They are as vibrant as the cinematic world makes them out to be. The future is dark and cold. It is drained of color in crisp contrast to the 1970s.Singer's tendency to shoot his cast in closeup accentuates the importance of character over spectacle. It is a refreshing change of pace for this type of film. Cinematography, editing, and score all complement each other and sell the film's overall quality.All of this results in one of the most accomplished and, in short, best superhero films ever made. The drama, the humor, the action are all sharp and well-measured. The production is outstanding with its blend of artful comic book flash and focus.Of all these well-appointed elements, what makes ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" so excellent are its themes and emotional center. The film is more than a superhero romp. It is a film about struggle: not just the struggle against larger-than-life enemies, but the personal struggle with what human beings are and what they are meant to be. It is about struggle against the march of time and memory. Most importantly, it is about the triumph of hope over fear and over that struggle. This beating thematic heart of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the reason the film succeeds at such high levels. It is the grandly important center of a fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Take your brains along. Not popcorn!,"I have always loved the X men franchise. Its always fascinating to see more than 1 super powers in a film. After the ""X men- Last Stand"", the franchisee focused on prequels and sequels(The Wolverine) to connect to this big movie. Bryan Singer back in the director chair gets almost everything right to bring this magnum opus to the big screen.As the title suggests this film's set in the future, which takes us to the past. In the future, both the human and the mutant species are on the brink of extinction due to a war against very powerful weapons sent on mutants to wipe them off the planet. However Charles Xavier and Magneto find a way to prevent that from happening by sending Wolverine into the past to change those events which lead to this war which mainly focuses on the character Mystique. This time Wolverine also has the challenge to convince the unstable Xavier and Magneto of the past and get their help in doing it. The rest is how it is accomplished and what does it change with respect to the present/future. Yes, its complicated. But its fun and we might have all the answers in the coming Xmen movies.Though the movie focuses on Hugh Jackman as a lead character, its a different wolverine we see. Not the irresponsible, easygoing but the mentoring. Hugh Jackman with his beast of a body impresses yet again. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has a meatier role this time and considering the success she's having these days nothing can go wrong for her. James McAvoy, Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen give life to their Magneto and Xavier characters in both the timelines. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is an interesting addition.Since its Xmen there are so many characters and its difficult mentioning each one of them.But I personally felt, Peter Dinklage's acting talent was bit underutilized in his role as Dr.Bolivar Trask.There are some extraordinary action sequences like Quicksilver's ultra speed motion fight, Mystique changing her form on course of the fight and of course some Magneto's powerful scenes.There are hardly any disappointing moments in the movie and you'll come out of the cinema hall with some answers and a lot of questions.Bryan Singer keeps us on our toes and makes us ready and curious for the next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bryan Singer's emphatic comeback,"DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is the best x men movie, or say at par with X:2 & First class. Thanks to Bryan Singer, who again does a brilliant job in stuffing the entire x men universe. There are a few minor flaws and as expected some under utilized characters. Especially Halle Berry's STORM. But it didn't bothered much since there is truckload of masterclass actors and actresses. Peter Dinklage having blast, Sir Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart sharing screen together again, James McCoy & Michael Fassbander's rock solid chemistry, Superb Jennifer Lawrence in dynamic action, SCENE STEALING EVAN PETER's Quicksilver (I wished for more of him), and Hugh Jackman's cut short action but acting avatar which was great and suitable. There are more actors who does a fabulous job but the mentioned guys were the most enjoyable of the entire lot. This is the darkest x men movie, even more than the last year's WOLVERINE and it has a solid emotional core attached to it. The time travel plot and the differences between the mutants is executed flawlessly. Visual effects are top-notch but 3D doesn't adds much depth. Background score is fine.

The end also left some untied spaces, which is good for the franchise to leave some suspense to the fans.

An Epic Film that blends the two timelines,"Next in my line of X-Men films to watch is the film that bought the two timelines together, X-Men: Days Of Future Past and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a future where Mutants are hunted down and destroyed by machines called Sentinels, Professor Xavier & Magneto send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must find there younger selves and stop Mystique from killing the creator of the machines.Main Character
There are a few main characters here so I am going to put them together. First of all is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and he is fantastic here, he is still the charming and charismatic guy here but it is also nice to see a more veteran version of the character that has to be a mentor to a young Xavier. In some of the previous films he has been given screen time over other characters but he is here the appropriate amount and it doesn't overshadow some other amazing performances. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are back as young Xavier and Magneto and they are amazing here. First of all McAvoy is fascinating, they really humanise Xavier here and they do a really good job of making him interesting and compelling, he feels even more human here then he did in First Class and it is a real highlight here. Then onto Fassbender who totally revels in his role as more of an antagonist but once again he is a remarkable antagonist, there is one scene on a plane that shows the strength of his performances and character. Also their chemistry together is still brilliant and really shows that Fox nailed it with this casting.Supporting Characters
I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a good job as Mystique in First Class but she steps it up a level here. She ups it in the action scenes and really feels closer to the Mystique that we saw in the original films, she also has a really interesting character arc and it feels like her emotions are stuck between Xavier and Magneto and it puts her in a really interesting position. Sir Ian Mckellen and Sir Patrick Stewart play the older versions of Magneto and Xavier and once again do a great job, they get less screen time here as the film mainly focus on the younger cast but they still add plenty to their roles and deliver when needed. Peter Dinklage, Nicolas Hoult and Ellen Page also give good performances in there smaller roles, also Evan Peters as Quicksilver is a show stealer, he isn't in the film much but when he is he owns every scene that he is in.Story
The story is really good, the characters are at the forefront of the story. We spend the majority of time with Wolverine and the younger cast and the position that the film puts them, I mean Xavier, Magneto and Mystique are really well handled and it makes them interesting characters. The contrast with the future scenes are great to, it is a dark really grim world which makes you realise why this drastic action is taken by the mutants. The last act is also fabulous and does a great job in showing how much the characters develop throughout the film.Script
The script is really great here, there are some fantastic dramatic moments and dialogue here. Plus the questioning of ideology is here in a great way, looking at the ideology of Xavier, Magneto and Mystique is great and that all of them are different. In this film they aren't really heroes or villains throughout but work towards their roles in the moral spectrum which is well handled. Also when needed the humour is good and it adds tot he quality of the film.Style
The style of the film is great, the 1970's looks great and the future scenes look really good and it fits the time periods that they are in and what has happened. The action scenes are really great, the powers are pushed to higher levels and the design choices are really unique and truly great and yes Beast looks so much better in this film.Overall
Overall, this is a brilliant comic book movie. It has great acting, great action scenes and a great narrative and is a must watch for anybody with an interest in The X-Men.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Profoundly Second Class,"If you like X1 and X2, you might like this, but if you are a big fan of X-Men First Class, like I am - you should be warned that this is a different animal. I was quite disappointed in this one.The point is: One of Matthew Vaughn's biggest strengths is pacing. Say what you will about him; his movies have a great flow. The same thing, however, seems to be a weakness with Singer. Compared to First Class, this movie was SOOO SLOW. It was badly paced, and it was also heavy-handed, repetitive and sentimental. Not emotional, I like emotional - it was sentimental. Singer is too fond of these characters, especially the old X-men (everything to bring them back!) plus the Charles-Raven-Erik conflict. God, that conflict got tiring! I loved Xavier as the brilliant, funny, warm teacher in First Class. Now he was suddenly ALL ABOUT Raven/Mystique. Ugh! Kill your darlings, Singer! You've lost your critical sense!Quicksilver was one of the few good things about this movie, but he was gone too fast.This movie had some good action scenes and glimpses of humour. And nostalgia, I guess, if you're a big X-men fan. First Class, however, had better pacing, script, score, was much more fun and also more poignant.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not only the best x-men film but up there as one of the best superhero films.,"This movie is freaking spectacular. The best x-men movie of all time and also one of the best if not the best superhero movie of all time. Seriously this movie is amazing. The performances are all very compelling especially from standouts such as James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrance and pretty much the whole cast. The movie is smartly written and very emotionally satisfying. The dialogue is smart, funny, compelling, emotional and gets you invested with all the characters. X-Men Days Of Future Past one of the most visually stunning, epic blockbusters ever to grace our screen. Let's hope Apocalypse can live up to the expectations it now must met.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
eXplosive and eXalting X-men,"Riding on the wave of success of the highly successful (and highly entertaining) franchise, comes this latest blockbuster, 'mutant' of a movie, The Xmen – Days of Future Past. Bryan Singer, the guy who gave us the original X-men way back in 2000s, created 'the' perfect sequel to 'X-men: First Class' and opened up avenues to the forthcoming sequels.As the name suggests, the movie has some zip-zapping into past and present (the title's aptly chosen from the franchise's comic). This is going to be the biggest hit of this summer; only party spoilers can be Age of Extinction and Dawn of Planet of Apes. However, this will go into the annals of history as one of the finest made X-men movies. Period.You may notice some uncanny semblances with The Matrix (stop-motion sequences and even the sentinels), Déjà vu (quantum physics about changing the past), Watchmen (of Vietnam War and Nixon) and to some extent, Terminator 4 (ravaged future earth). But the resemblances stop here. Of course revealing anything more will spoil the fun.There are quite a handful breathtaking, rather, breath-stopping moments; particularly one scene where QuickSilver zaps with his supersonic run while time almost freezes for the others.Technically the movie is great, is a sort of an understatement. The cinematography will give you goose flesh. The music is intense but a tad lesser than the score of First Class. Micheal Fassbender as Eric Lehnsherr continues his cold and callous form from First Class. And he steals the show along with James McAvoy. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven is outstanding; so beautiful yet so Mystique. The X-entourage - Hugh Jackman, Ellen Page, Ian McKellen (to name a few) do more than justice to their roles. The sentinels, however steal the show, for they are hyper-intelligent and are far more powerful than the mutants themselves.If you haven't seen any of the X-men movies, please do that first and then go to watch this one. You will enjoy each and every minute of it. The movie starts off with some fantabulous action sequence, but the adrenaline pumping slows down for a while, giving way to some intense drama. And while you are immensely engrossed, the movie catapults you to a higher level of pure action and edge of the seat thrills. You are allowed to bite your nails, pull your hair but don't take your eyes off the screen.Behold the glory of X-men, for all-ye X-men fans. The X-men series is getting better with the inception of First Class (my best X-men movie ever) and there is more to come. Viola. Post-credits show En Saba Nur and the four horsemen – a perfect teaser to the upcoming X-men: Apocalypse in 2016.EXperience the eXplosive and the eXalting X-men. It's eXquisite and eXemplar. Highly and heavily recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An excellent beginning to the large group of summer blockbusters.,"""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"" (12A) Director: Bryan Singer. Starring: Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Peter Dinklage.Since Bryan Singer departed from ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" in 2006 (to direct ""Superman Returns"", we could have done without it, right?) and foolishly left it within the incapable hands of Brett Ratner, the franchise never felt that it reached the same heights as ""X-2"", despite Mathew Vaughn's well received continuation of the series, ""X-Men: First Class"". However Bryan Singer has finally returned to the directing chair to deliver drama, action and interesting Sci-Fi, in his classic style.Set in the year 2023, ""X-Men: DOFP"" finds our world in absolute apocalyptic turmoil, as the mutant-slaying, robotic hunters known as the Sentinels, scour planet Earth in order to rid the world of all Mutant- kind. Now with only a small pocket of Mutants left (including Wolverine, Magneto and Storm) acting as the resistance, they realise that the Sentinels are an unstoppable force.As Patrick Stewart's Professor X so rightly states, ""Is the future truly set?"" It seems not, as Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page, where's she been these past few years?) argues that due to Logan's ability to heal at lightning fast speed, his consciousness should be sent back into the past to seek the help of the team's former selves, in order to change the events of history forever. Despite its slightly confusing plot-line ""X-Men: DOFP"" deals well with the interweaving stories, and presents itself as perhaps this summer's most inventive blockbuster.In regards to being inventive, Singer once again directs with a perfect balance, as he directs his ninth film with expert camera-work and beautiful cinematography from Newton Thomas Sigel (""Drive"") to match.The cast itself are (as always) uniformly brilliant, along with Jackman, McAvoy, Dinklage and Fassbender delivering great performances amongst the large and ambitious set-pieces; it's Jennifer Lawrence though, who ultimately receives the largest amount of screen-time and character development as Mystique, and rightly decides to once again prove her undeniable talent for acting. Despite this ensemble cast however, it unfortunately seems that there are far too many characters to actually keep a track of, and are (like the characters of ""Godzilla"") ultimately missed.In spite of its misused cast, we are (briefly) introduced to the character of Quicksilver (AKA Pietro Maximoff, played brilliantly by Evan Peters), a young man who has the amazing ability of superhuman speed, who sets about saving the team from many a misfortune, including an exciting scene in which Maximoff sprints around a villain-filled room so fast, that whilst running, he rearranges the directions of each security guard's guns, hats and fists, leading to a humorous climax.There is also a welcome return from Singer's regular film composer John Ottman, who produces an often dramatic and exciting score, which is reminiscent of Alan Silvestri's soundtrack of ""The Avengers"" (2012).The overbearing cast was an unfortunate step to have made, but Singer and his screenwriter Simon Kinberg eventually make up for their minor mistake, in the form of some much needed, yet reserved character development, which is what the first two ""X-Men"" instalments prided themselves upon; being a Superhero film that was intelligent and dramatic, yet action-packed.Verdict:""X-Men: DOFP"" is an impressive return from Singer and despite the misuse of this high-calibre cast, it works almost as well as ""X-2"". It's most definitely not perfect, but it is an excellent beginning to the large group of summer blockbusters.7 Stars out of 10Written by Scott Gentry.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Only got better with rewatching,"Probably my favorite movie out of the entire superhero genre. It can't compete on pure cinematography with Whedon, or the creative reinterpretation of Nolan, or even the visuals of Snyder.Consider, though, that it adds meaning to 4 prior movies that were made in the shallow days of hero movies, retroactively creating motivations and plot foreshadowing in almost 8 hours of cinema that weren't meant to go anywhere, while developing the relationships between the main characters and progressing the story lines of side characters in the background.It's an incredible work of art, and the piece that made me a huge can of Bryan Singer.However, it does sadden me that to get the full emotional impact from the film you have to watch X1-3 (and Wolverine Origins, too), which are nowhere near as good films and are extremely dated by today's genre standards.When I really want someone to watch this movie, I still do make them sit through the 8+ hours of backstory, but at least I feel a little guilty about it =P",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of the better X-Men, but moving a lot towards hard core fans","I didn't really expect too much from this film, but I had to see it, as I have watched all X-men movies and some of the cartoons. I am not a hard core fan, but I know a thing or two about the X universe. That is why I think the film, while good enough, will be harder to digest for casual movie goers.The plot revolves around the attempt to change the fate of the human mutant war by sending Wolverine's consciousness into the past to prevent the one event that causes that war to begin with. Peter Dinklage's character is the inventor of the Sentinels, the dreaded anti-mutant robots and his murder at the hand of Mystique was the original trigger for the Sentinel program and the war. Now Professor X, Magneto, Beast and Wolverine need to prevent it.I liked that the Sentinels were really presented as terrifying. The character's shenanigans were less impressive, since most of their efforts were spent contradicting and even battling each other, which makes the whole premise of the film moot. Also the disgusting light filter they used at the end to show that ""all is well"" didn't sit well with me. The actors played well and even Wolverine certainly looked and acted better than in the horrible Wolverine movie. They completely ignored any law of causality in their interpretation of time travel as well.Bottom line: fantastic actors like McAvoy, Fasbender and Dinklage have to do roles that are kind of silly. The movie is not bad, though, I would even call it engaging. However the unexplained details of the film could push casual viewers away. At the end of the credits there is a scene preparing the next film: Apocalypse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The return of the prodigal son....,"X-Men is considered as one of the very first superhero-movie franchise that proved superhero movies have it's market. It also was a franchise that chopped away from it's roots right when it was flourishing at it's peak. Then came a lot of spin-offs. In the beginning, there was the visionary Bryan Singer. Then came Brett Ratner, who somewhat broken the hearts of fans worldwide. The spin-offs and directors extended into a long list including Mathew Vaughn and James Mangold. There were movies that we love, movies that we hate and movies that we tries to forget. it was inevitable that the circle should be closed so that the franchise could survive, and who might be the better person to do that other than Singer???X-Men:Days Of Future Past is a movie which is prepared with so much grace and soul, so that every bit of it feels enjoyable. Not only it gives a clean chit for the franchise, it also saves the movies from being rebooted. Much of the courtesy goes for the directors Bryan Singer and Mathew Vaughn. X-Men:First Class was a unique movie that presented a strong ensemble cast and a much deviated yet successful story-telling. It was that cast and storyline helped singer to rebuild his once adorable franchise.The word is at a verge of extinction, for both humans and mutants. There is only one way to stop these from happening, and is by rewriting the past. so, the X-Men sends Wolverine in to the past to fix it. The plot goes like that. It is kind of familiar since most of us are repeated viewers of Back To The Future movies. Just like Biff gets the sports almanac, something undesired happens on the past and certain measures should be taken to prevent it from happening. What moves the plot forwards is the path that Logan chooses.As mentioned earlier, the greatest asset Singer had was the cast of First Class including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. This trio shared the major amount of screen time and they utilized it with electrifying performances. Others including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen have also done their part impressively. Evans Peters as Quicksilver was a treat to watch and Peter Dinklage has done another important part. The visual effects and background scores were so much in tune with the visuals that it all came in as a single block of visual treat.There isn't much of a negative side for the movie aside from a few facts that were left unanswered such as old Logan's metal claw and Kity's time-phasing power. Even though the movie is brilliant in its own marks, I won't deem it as the best of X-men since I still love X2 and First class the most. Still, the importance of this movie over the whole franchise is immense since it gave a new platform that can be used for a lot more movies, and lets hope 2016's Apocalypse going to utilize it to it's maximum.....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Haven't got a clue,"It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of X-Men: Days of Future Past: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'demon warrior' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'demon warriors' that are out there.There's some English religious mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed – a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of X-MEN, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Bryan Singer needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular !,"It's difficult to talk about all the good things in this movie. Magnificent actors ,a story so great that no matter how difficult it was for Bryan Singer to deliver , in the end the satisfaction was there. No pointless action was also a plus for my review . I always wanted to see the depth of the story , the emotions of the characters , and this movie's got it all . Also bear in mind that this movie was also a try to fix the problems that the latest x-movies had created. Yet that is also done in the end . Another thing is that Hugh Jackman not only once again proves how he can perfectly perform the same role in a different mode ,since wolverine is more like a mentor in this one , but also how he can still be in 100% body shape for years in success. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen bring their experience in and a combination with Fassbender's and Mcavoy's great performances is a boost . Now i can't wait for the next one .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best X-Men Movie Ever By Far.  Best Marvel Movie Ever Too!,"Not going to give spoilers, but let's just say this: I haven't watched a movie in theaters like this since TDK trilogy where you were actually hoping the movie wouldn't end and that the story would continue.This movie from beginning to end is top notch in story telling, action, and in keeping to the source material. As a huge fan of the time travel saga from the X-Men cartoons, this movie was just amazing. You get all the characters of that time which include Bishop and his friends.On the other side, you get the past and present characters of the X-Men. You get cameos here and there. Mystique and Wolverine were awesome.For those that want jokes, this movie has them. However, this movie is a lot darker than the Avengers, Captain America, and Thor movies. I would put the ""dark"" level in between TDK and Ironman 1.Overall, see this MOVIE NOW! Also stay for the ending. You haven't got goosebumps yet until you see what I saw!!! 10 out of 10!

Nothing new with Marvel ...,"With a strong cast, high-budget production, great effects, and non-stop action imbued with humor, Marvel usually manages quite well to mask the lack of a quality story. Maybe the story has no meaning, nor much sense, but you just do not have time to notice that, especially in theater.But by now we have got used to this cast and characters, who bring us nothing new from film to film. These days visual effects pop out from every corner, so even that is no longer fascinating, except when a major shift is made, which is not the case here. They gave us just a spoonful of humor, and the strongest action scene is at the very beginning of the film. Everything after is just one confusing SF story that reminds me too much of ""Terminator"" and didn't hold my attention at all.I can't say that the film is technically bad, or that it's boring, but I have nothing to praise. I watched it last night and I'm already not sure I could retell it anymore. If you're a Marvel fan, take a look. If you skip it, you won't miss much.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is still by far the Best X-Men Movie to date and Its actually my favourite Marvel Movie!,"I was completely blown away after watching this movie. This movie was fast paced and filled with fantastic action sequences and great direction from Bryan Singer. One of the best things about this movie is the story itself, it is very well written and very interesting and it also provides some emotional scenes that motivates the characters including the audience to have hope and conquer your fears. Even though there are lots of characters in the film, They don't feel overcrowded and overstuffed and they don't feel like they are shoehorned in . A lot of these characters are well fleshed out and likable. This movie was never boring!If you don't know the plot of this movie, It's about a dustopian future in 2023 where the mutants are facing extinction because they are being taking over by the sentinels (Mutant killing robots). The sentinels have already hunted down a large population of mutants and humans who are helping mutants to survive and killing them or sending them to prison. Wolverine and the X-Men has found refuge and has decided to send Wolverine back in time to 1973 to recruit the younger versions of Prof. X, Magneto and Hank Mccoy to prevent the assassination of Bolivar Trask being set by Mystique. This assassination is what started this sentinel chaos in the future 2023. Prof. X thinks that if this assassination is prevented, that means that the future is reset and all of the X-Men characters are all alive and safe and sound. This also wipes out the sentinels in existence when this assassination is prevented.My favourite part of this film is Quicksilver. That quicksilver scene is one of the best and coolest scenes in a comic book movie ever! and probably my favourite scene in the movie. The Soundtrack for that scene was frickin perfect!Michael Fassbender killed it as Young Magneto! He was such a bad ass in this movie! and James McAvoy was great as Young Prof. X. I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a pretty great job as Mystique. She was a bad ass in this movie.There are a lot of great scenes in this movie that I will not spoil but if you watch this movie, you are going to like it! I definitely have no issues with this movie.What's so great about this movie is that it's never boring. even if the action isn't there, you are still invested and interested in the story for this movie and the interaction between these characters. The Time Travelling story of this film is very interesting as well.Overall it is a great comic book movie filled with awesome action scenes and emotional scenes to it and the characters are well written and fleshed out and you can actually care about them and be able to understand their motivations. The standout of this movie like I mentioned earlier is the story. It is so well written and satisfyingly epic at the same time. therefore, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie ever!I'm gonna give X-Men: Days of Future Past an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nothing has beaten it as Tim Millers Deadpool really did not get close to this and X- Men:Apocalypse is clearly not over this here. Bryan Singer does it great and cool, playing with his awesome characters and rooting them to do stuff they do all very well.

The whole idea about the different timelines, was so hard to understand and it was kinda unneeded. Besides that, I really enjoyed the movie. It was very intense and all the fight scenes were well portrayed. The graphics and the special effects were award worthy. Actually, that movie was sort of a prequel and a sequel.

The best of X-men is here!,"The days of the future past is then a sequel to both x men the last stand and x men first class. The movie is based on the background that; in the future the sentinels are wiping out the race of the mutants and wolverine is sent back into the 70's to eliminate the sentinels before they are ever created. It is really difficult to find any flaws with the movie.Bryan singer has done an exceptional job and could have possibly returned with the best x-men movie we have seen.The character of James McAvoy which feels more moderated and is since x- men first class. Unlike the mentor figure of professor X who is a bit grim to relate to. There is also extremely clever humour in the movie like when quicksilver/peter rescues Charles Xavier, wolverine and Eric lehnsherr from the security in pentagon. The movie feels really well connected even when there are no fight scenes, like in the scene; where Eric lehnsherr and Charles Xavier are talking there is not any action going on but you're really interested in the conversation. You can just feel the endless amount of back story already taken place between them. That's one of the best ways to present compelling characters.The main characters of the movie are mystique and wolverine. Jennifer Lawrence has done an incredible job with her character, but Hugh Jackman has done even better (as expected). He takes off from where he left of in X-men last stand and you can feel the good old bad ass wolverine.There are just so many characters in the movie and that can be easily messed up. But Bryan is able to make all those characters to relate to the central story even emotionally and that's when it really works well. Overall it's the X-men movie we have been waiting for and are much pleased to see that it delivers the expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cliché mixture of The Matrix and Inception and Back to the Future,"I don't know, maybe I've just seen too many movies and shows that deal with the idea of time travel, but this film is cliché down to the roots.So what angered me off the most? The whole idea of time travel. If time travel is possible, then you wouldn't be living in the world you're living in right now because you would have sent someone in the past to change things forever.Again, if time travel is possible and someone's trying to change the past right now, why would I care what might happen to the people who live in the present? The person in the past has all the time to change their fates! There is no tension in what might happen to these guys. And of course, this is a superhero film so everything's going to work out just fine so really again there is no real tension in the scenes. Altogether, the film felt like a bizarre mix of three films:1. The Matrix: in that film there were machines that connected humans to a program. Here we have Ellen Paige who sends people's conscience back in time. You decide which is more convincing! Also so much acting, Ellen: Just put your hands around Hugh's head and moan and groan a little. Just top notch. 2. Inception: the original film had three different levels of dream, pretty good idea. X-Men however decided that what happens in present time matters as much as what happens in the past and so lost my any kind of attention to one of the time lines or a quarter of the film. 3. Back to the Future: Not as much as the humor but actually the idea of time travel which doesn't make any more sense here than it made in that film. At least that one was funny.Now I have criticized the film pretty harshly but there are some good moments here just as well.The CGI is pretty cool, the 3D effect alright and the acting is quite acceptable, at least they shut Halle Berry up for most of the time and kept Ellen Paige to a minimum and painted Jennifer Lawrence in blue which actually made her more tolerable than her Oscar worthy performances!Again if you have watched a total of 5 episodes of Family Guy, Rick and Morty or Community about time travel, there's really nothing you haven't seen before. If you're a fan, eating up a popcorn and enjoying the glasses, this might be just the film you've been waiting for.PS: Don't waste your money on the 4D versions if they're around. The whole shooting scenes and kicks and rainy weathers just feel uncomfortable when they're turned into kicks in the back, hisses of water and actual sprinkles. Stick to the 3D version for Christs sake.Final Rating: 5/10. Cliché but actually OK and at times enjoyable. Recommended for non-fans? Not really. Pretty basic time travel stuff.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent addition to the series,This is the film as it should be - Singers fears of interrupting the tension buy inserting new scenes are unfounded because it brings a dull section of the film to life. In the theatrical cut the future is a boring bloody place where the kings of mutants - Magneto & Xavier do NOTHING. In this they go on a mission & it helps no end. It's not a hugely changed movie at all and Rogue is not on screen very long at all - barely 3 minutes I think more or less if even that - but what makes her important is that her addition adds an extra dimension allowing more action to be added.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best of both worlds!!!,"Bryan Singer is back at the helm and he nails it with Days of Future Past, hands down this is going to be one of the best movies of the summer.I was a little scared how the story was going to pan out because of the poster that shows Jenifer Lawrence just as huge as Hugh Jackman, fearing that the story would reflect her status as an Oscar winning star, but unlike most of the other X-Men movies this movie is not even the Wolverine show. Every major character got more of a chance to shine in this flick.And of course the best part of the film is the mutants. We got to see some old ones like Shadowcat, played by Ellen Page, who uses her powers differently in this film, and new ones like Quicksilver who proves super fast heroes are awesome. It was great to see them use their powers, but will admit Singer still has a long way to go with special effects.Peter Dinklage brings the drama to the cast. His outing as Bolivar Trask the major bad guy was perfect, and it's good to see him do stuff outside of Game of Thrones.The movie does not fully pay attention to the continuity of all the films, but what's good about time travel is that it sets everything in place. Now we are fully completing with the Marvel cinematic universe over at Disney. Can't wait to see X-Men: Apocalypse now.You got to see this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I ended up leaving, thinking it was possibly my favourite X-Men movie.Rewatching it, for only the third time today, I still had the same initial thought, and the same thought at the end.
I have to applaud this series of movies for hitting some interesting social and political hot zones. I love both versions of Charles and Eric, but I prefer Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique over Rebecca Romijn. I really enjoyed Quicksilver too. The kitchen scene in The Pentagon is a real highlight.The movie also has an excellent villain in Game Of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, playing a mutant-hating arms manufacturer with an awful name Bolivar Trask.

outstanding,"This was an outstanding entry in the X-Men/Marvel Comics series of movies. The only disappointment:no cameo by Stan Lee! The movie centers around an assassination on a scientist 50 years earlier by Mystique/Raven, which will lead to an attack and subsequent war with android-like characters called the Sentinels. The war is very devastating. The solution-send one of them back in time to prevent the assassination, and that someone turns out to be Wolverine. (Doesn't this remind you a bit of the Terminator?) He tracks down the younger versions of the Mutants and makes an attempt to thwart the assassination.This movie features superb action, characters, special effects, and surprises.

Good solid film,I really enjoyed 'X-men first class' so I had high expectations for this film. It was definitely not as good as the first one but was a good solid follow up. The film features less of the witty charm of the first. But encapsulates the complicatedness of the characters lives.I felt that Erik / magneto was a bit one-note but other than that the characters are good. Evan peters as quicksliver adds a comic personality maybe lacked by the rest of the characters.This film felt not darker but just less funny. It felt more of a direction of an avengers or other average superhero group.Over all decent solid film.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just because the X-Men series stumbled and lost its path doesn't mean it can't be saved,"Great marriage of the first two X-Men films with First Class. Its primary function is as a sequel to First Class but it also works as a clean-up of the mess made with Last Stand. That the series has rebounded from that film and now ""fixed"" itself is surely a cinematic miracle. Hugh Jackman continues to be the backbone of this franchise. I really can't predict what will happen when he's too old to continue in the part and they have to recast. I'm not looking forward to it, for sure. Let's hope that is many years off. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen step back into their old roles seamlessly. Both are perfect as always. It was nice to see Halle Berry and the others return. The First Class crew (McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Hoult) are all excellent actors and do well just as they did in that film.The new characters are good, especially Evan Peters' Quicksilver, but it would have been nice if some of the old gang had been given more to do. I like that Storm and Iceman got some action and I understand why the others who appear at the end were only there briefly but poor Rogue was left to a two-second cameo. That's just sad when you consider how important she was to the start of this series. It would have been cool, considering the future angle, if they could have shown her for once being more like the Rogue from the comics. I think most fans would have gladly sacrificed a mort like Warpath to get that. I also shouldn't complain that Rebecca Romijn had no cameo considering she had one in First Class, but still it would have been a nice bonus. But these are minor quibbles with an otherwise very entertaining movie.The special effects, action, and music were all well-done. The script was very smart and although I'm sure I could find some holes if I tried, the effort to keep a sense of continuity in this series despite its missteps is certainly appreciated. I was skeptical before the film for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that they were loosely adapting one of my favorite comic book stories and I didn't want to see it besmirched. What they wound up doing resembles the comic story only in name and using time travel as a plot device. Everything else is different. But I'm okay with that. I value the comic story for what it was and this for what it is. Bryan Singer's triumphant return puts him at 3-0 in X-Men movies. Hopefully he makes more of them as it's clearly material he connects with and is good at.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yet another great entry in the series,"The X-Men series consistently delivers style and substance you don't generally find with fantasy films. I enjoyed the different characters, and the actors - as usual in these films - are very good. Although the film is a sequel to 'First Class', it starts in the future, and then goes back in time to follow on 'First Class', and then simultaneously plays in the past and future, so it can be a bit confusing. But - in typical X-Men style - they handle it so well that everything makes perfect sense.The visuals are insane!

The film is pretty entertaining from start to finish. I don't think I'm giving too much away to also mention that there's a great advantage to the series in this storyline. If you change things in the past everything is reset for the present - everyone can either live or die and their characters can also be totally different.

Easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed!,"'X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh 'X-MEN' movie is once again directed by Bryan Singer (returning to the franchise for the first time since 2003's 'X-MEN 2') and written by Simon Kinberg (who also co-wrote 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND') with Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Vaughn and Goldman also co-wrote 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS', which Vaughn also directed). It's based on a 2 issue storyline from the Marvel Comics comic book 'The Uncanny X-Men', called 'Days of Future Past' (written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, in 1981), which has the X-Men using Kitty Pride's abilities, to time travel a person's mind back in time, in order to stop a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and killed by Sentinels (giant robots). Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart all reprise their roles from previous movies. Anna Paquin also returns as Rogue but most of her scenes were cut from the final theatrical film. Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Bingbing Fan, Booboo Stewart and Adan Canto all join the cast this time around as well. I found it to be highly entertaining and everything I hoped it would be; easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed.The story begins in 2023; a dark dystopian future where mutants are being killed off by shape-shifting machines called Sentinels. A small group of X-Men have been able to survive by using Kitty Pryde's (Page) power to transport another mutant's mind, Bishop (Sy), back in time (to warn them about future Sentinel attacks). Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart), now working with Magneto (McKellen), comes up with the idea of time-traveling back to a crucial event, in 1973, in order to prevent the current nightmarish world (they live in) from ever happening. Wolverine (Jackman) is the only one who can survive several decades of time-travel (due to his healing powers), so it becomes his mission to find the young Xavier (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) and get them to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from assassinating a man named Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). Trask designed the Sentinels and became a martyr, in the war on mutants, when he was killed. Mystique was also captured and her DNA was used to give the Sentinels the abilities they now have (to replicate any mutant's powers). Stopping these events should then change the future and it's up to Wolverine, Charles, Magneto and Beast (Hoult) to pull it off.I read 'The Uncanny X-Men' comics when I was a kid (and all of it's spin-offs, like 'X-Force', 'Cable' and 'X-Factor') for multiple years (and read several years of back issues too, including 'Days of Future Past'). So I'm a big fan; next to Spider-Man they're my favorites superheroes. The X-Men stories have always had very cool sci-fi elements, and plenty of action, but they've also had deeper themes about dealing with bigotry and being an outsider (like Spider-Man). This is why I could always really identify with the characters and the stories. I love Singer's first two movie adaptations ('X-MEN 2' is one of my all-time favorite films) because they do such a great job of bringing the characters, and those issues, to the big screen. This movie is equally as impressive; it has all the spectacle and action (that all of the films in the franchise are known for) but it also does a really good job of capturing those human elements (and emotions). It's probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series and it's great to see almost all of the cast back for it. I especially enjoy watching Jennifer Lawrence, in the role of Mystique, because she makes a great badass action heroine and it's cool to see her playing a kick-ass villain this time as well. Jackman, Fassbender, McAvoy and all the rest are of course good once again too but it's Singer (back at the helm) that truly gives the movie it's masterpiece status.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much-needed shot in the arm. The X-men live. And die. And live again.,"In 1994 David Carson linked two eras of the Starship Enterprise with his Star Trek: Generations. It wasn't entirely successful but was far from being the biggest turkey in the cinematic outing of the franchise. With X-Men: Days of Future Past, Bryan Singer returns to the series (as director) with a more audacious link between eras and with markedly greater success.X-Men: Days of Future Past is a convoluted but thoroughly enjoyable excuse to throw two Magnetos, two Professor Xs and a host of our favourite mutants into a time travel romp with evil doings, minor destruction, moderate violence, naked pecs and blue breasts. And what's not to like about that? It's a hit, it'll be a success and there's clearly a market for more.Waaaaay back in 1973, money-grabbing, almost villainous Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) develops a blueprint for an army of sentinels to hunt down the pesky mutants, aided by the DNA of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Fifty years later, the sentinels are not only wiping out the mutants but also the humans who aided them and time is running perilously short for the remaining X-Men. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) opt to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to persuade the young Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to prevent Raven from inadvertently initiating the demise of mutantkindThere's lots on screen that doesn't quite make sense, there's an awful lot of action packed into the 131 minute running time and there'll be plenty of viewers who emerge scratching their heads, having had a great evening but not really following all of it.But no matter. X-Men: Days of Future Past is great fun that packs in the cameos, ups the ante and opens the door for a whole new chapter of X-Men movies. The Marvel world has always been in good hands with Singer at the helm and his reappearance has strengthened it just as the attraction was beginning to wane.Where X-Men: Days of Future Past rejuvenates the series is that it remembers not just to thrill and entertain, but to have fun being fun. The introduction of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is a most welcome injection of adrenalin and the scene in the Pentagon basement is an absolute joy. Singer takes his time, slows the pace down and enjoys constructing the sequence as though choreographing a ballet with the mother of all punch-lines. It is thrilling, funny and a superb change of pace that will have you pressing the rewind button when you watch it again at home.Yes, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a little cluttered and there is the sense that drastic steps needed to be taken to put the franchise back on track and refill the Marvel bank account, but far from being desperate, it works. It's fun and it's too long to wait for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best X-Men movie so far,"This is an excellent movie. (Can you tell that I'm sort of surprised?) The science-fiction story, the writing, the pacing, the acting, the franchise exploitation and the CGI effects all come together really well in this latest X-Men film.It helps that three of the finest and most versatile actors on the planet are at the heart of the movie.Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) has done what is necessary to bring an intense physicality and masculine presence to his demanding superhero role. I liked that he was not at the centre of things all the time, although Wolverine was a key player, as in all X-Men movies.James McAvoy (the young Charles Xavier) owns his role and conveys the required emotion so movingly. Such a superb actor. What a stroke of genius it was getting him to play the younger version of Patrick Stewart. For me, he was the emotional heart of the film.The appearance of Michael Fassbender (the young Magneto) on the screen was like a punch to the stomach. Here this versatile actor plays an intense, driven, icy character, and he absolutely nails it. One of the best scenes was one where Magneto confronted the presidential entourage in front of the world's cameras. Mutantus terribilis.The other actors also rose to the challenge. Jennifer Lawrence, in particular. Wow, Raven/Mystique is one female mutant not to mess with. And then, on top of all that, we also had Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.This struck me as an intelligent and often moving film, despite the endless fight scenes, superhero powers and city-destruction scenes that you see in every movie nowadays. There were a few nuances and profound messages in this film, for those who were looking for them. And the dialogue never seemed off. There were also a few truly hilarious scenes (I'm thinking now of Quicksilver). The writing is good, very good.I was worried because I couldn't quite follow the plot at the start. But it soon sorted itself out. I also thought it was a little anachronistic to have such technology in 1973. But hey it's science fiction, and it didn't ruin the movie for me. Loved the 1973 setting, by the way.Kudos to Bryan Singer, the writers and actors for pulling this off. This is surely the best X-Men movie made so far. It's worth about 8.5.

CGI seems to be a valid substitute for acting. WRONG! CGI doesn't kill a movie. There are plenty of good movies that use it. If you think that I'm bashing CGI you can go fack a tack. I'm saying that you can't have a film that scraps acting just so you can have some puffed up sex bots That strutting and fretting their hour upon the stage, and then are heard no more.

He, too, pandered to the ""lower class,"" but the difference between Shakespeare and most of these Block Busters is CLASS. Shaky had class. Most people in Hollywood don't.So fellow movie lovers... let us attempt to refrain from BUYING these dullard films full of action sans-acting. Purchase a ticket for a movie like X-Men... Go see X-men... and if you still want to see your brainless Block Buster, hop on over after you've seen X-men... WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. Because we need to stop this dreadful trend. Brilliant films seem to be far and wide these days... Unless they're independent and/or foreign and either can't afford or just plain don't get advertised.Sorry that this wasn't exactly a review, but it's my opinion regarding the greatness of this film as compared to the slop that we willingly watch which turns our brains into just that.... slop.Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Next to ""The Avengers"" (2012) this is the best superhero film ever!","This takes place in the future. All mutants have been enslaved along with humans who tried to help them. Only a small team of the X-Men remain. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) have an idea to send Wolverine (High Jackman) back into the 1970s to stop a killing from happening and change the future. They send him back but can he change things in time?Next to ""The Final Stand"" this is easily the best X-Men movie ever. I wasn't going to see it because I hated ""X-Men: First Class"" but (technically) this isn't a sequel to that. It ties into that movie but also works with the first three movies. There are plenty of action sequences that are exciting with flawless special effects. It's sometimes however a little TOO violent--one character gets beheaded and another is torn apart. That's going a little too far. Also we're introduced early to a bunch of the X-Men who I didn't recognize...and their names (or powers) are never explained. This was a problem in a few of the earlier movies too. And James McAvoy was back as a young Professor X...and is terrible. All that aside however I loved this. The acting was good and there are many cameos from previous X-Men (it was great seeing Storm and Colossus again). Stewart, McKellan and Jackman easily hold the film together with their wonderful acting and Michael Fassbender is clearly enjoying himself as Megento. So a great film--well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Starting All Over Again,"Powerful Sentinels from Trask Industries were decimating all the mutants, leaving only a handful of the hardiest ones alive. Logan is sent back twenty years into the past during the inception of the Sentinel program, to stop this project before it destroys the mutant race anymore.Young Charles Xavier was up and about but without his powers. Young Eric was incarcerated in a subterranean cell within the Pentagon because on his implication in the JFK assassination. Young Raven/Mystique was intent to kill Trask himself before he kills more mutants. Logan must make them all see how their actions now will impact on the very existence of mutants on Earth in the future.Because this is already the fifth X-Men film, we know each mutant individually and are invested in their collective mythology. This installment gives us further details into the past of each of the main mutants and we see how each one evolves into how we know them in the present time.The visual effects are expectedly awesome. My favorite scene would be the sequence where Charles and Logan attempt to break Eric out if his prison with the help of the super- speed powers of Peter/Quicksilver. The stop-motion, sense of humor and the song ""Time in a Bottle"" in the background makes it very memorable. The other epic sequence was that when an entire sports arena was lifted from its foundations and used to corral the White House itself.The actors we know and loved from all the previous films: Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine), Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier, old and young), Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender (as Eric/Magneto, old and young), Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven/Mystique) -- all do excellently in their respective characters. Nicholas Hoult reprises his role as young Hank McCoy/Beast. There will be shorter and shocking appearances by Halle Berry and Anna Paquin as Storm and Rogue, respectively. Towards the end, there will be surprising cameos by Mutants who had taken already their leave in previous episodesFor the new cast members, Evan Peters shines in his outstanding performance as Quicksilver, a character who was both quick in action and in wit. Ellen Page appears as Kitty Foyle, whose power made it possible for Logan to travel back in time. Newly-featured mutants Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan) get prominent action sequences in the climactic battle sequence.I thought it was an inspired idea to cast Peter Dinklage as the genius scientist Trask. He brings his ""Games of Thrones"" acting intensity into this film in this dark character. It was also interesting to see how Stryker got his sinister character into the X-Men canons. Josh Helman portrays him with the necessary antagonistic swagger.As with the other Marvel films, do wait up for a breathtaking short extra clip of a robed figure in and the Pyramids. This bonus scene teasing the next X-Men film Apocalypse (2016) is seen only after all the credits roll up.This film had so many characters (even former US President Nixon plays a key part) and so many events shuttling from present to past and back. Despite all the potential plot holes a time-travel storyline can present, Director Bryan Singer still manages to tell his story in one cohesive whole. This is yet another excellent proof that the X-Men film franchise is indeed the best among the Marvel collection. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best  X-Men movie,"I really enjoyed watching the movie. It had it all, if you ask me. I mean; seriously, it was emotional, exciting and the visual effects were amazing.I was expecting a lot from this movie because I used to watch X-men cartoons and the Days of Future Past episodes were the best ones and the cast is amazing and we all know what Bryan Singer is capable to do.The Quicksilver character was surprisingly successful. And I have really no words for James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence, I just hope to see them more in good movies like this.It is the second best movie based on a comic(Dark Knight is first) and the best X-Men movie.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"By far, the best X-Men movie ever!","I was totally blown away after watching a couple of seconds of the end credits were rolling. Mouth wide-open, palms sweaty. It was by far the best X-Men movie I have ever seen, simply because of the narrative storytelling. It was outstanding, original and probably the most emotional one yet as we truly see a dark side of the mutants suffering with the human race and quite frankly getting fed up with their existence. What captured my attention ever since I knew this film was going to be made, was the fact that actors from X-Men: First Class and the original 00's X-Men movies were all working together, which was exciting stuff! I'm a massive fan of time-travel and the fact that the old and the new actors were in the same film (in the past and future) was majestic. I will say though is that you have to watch the previous movies before watching this one. If you're watching this with a fresh mind, then the story is not going to be clear for you (good thing that I'm a X-Men fan!) cause there's a load of references that link the previous movies to this current one, especially the very first X-Men films.But once you've done your homework, analysing and understanding what's happening in the X-Men world, then you'll truly appreciate this movie.

Creating and depressing the 'narrative reset' button.,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is a standout entry in the franchise, masterfully blending the original cast with their younger counterparts. The time-travel narrative is ambitious yet coherent, offering a fresh perspective on the series' themes of identity and segregation.Hugh Jackman anchors the film as Wolverine, guiding the complex timeline with his usual charm and intensity. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender bring depth to the younger versions of Professor X and Magneto, showcasing their tumultuous relationship with emotional weight. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique adds complexity, balancing vulnerability with fierce determination.The action sequences are meticulously choreographed, with innovative displays of mutant abilities-most notably in the exhilarating opening battle. The Sentinels are visually striking, reinforcing the film's high stakes. Smartly written, emotionally resonant, and packed with thrilling set pieces, Days of Future Past revitalizes the X-Men narrative and stands as one of the franchise's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Glitzy Special Effects, Waves of Star Power and a Beloved Source Can't Compensate For a Murky, Dated Screenplay","Wolverine gallops through time and space to deflect an ugly outcome for all of humanity, pausing frequently to give old cast members the time to wink directly into the camera and strut off set. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a lot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines, but it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often associated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time delivering fan service when it should've been examining character motivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely play a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm still struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third act. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments that I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly pandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First Class. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting face-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new guys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and McKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced efforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made me yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad - the effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the little love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action roars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble shutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so demanding in that department.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The X-Men movie franchise is still alive, and better than ever","It's very rare that you get to see a film franchise make it to its seventh installment and still have the ability to impress fans and critics alike. But never before has a film franchise made it to its seventh installment and actually topped all of its previous efforts.However, when I say seventh installment, I suppose I should include an asterisk. First this includes the two Wolverine films, the second of which didn't even have X-Men in the title. And secondly, The X-Men movie series, like the comics, is a bit of a convoluted mess, and it's sometimes difficult to figure which films are part of the ""official canon"" and which aren't. The comics have the excuse of being around for over 50 years with dozens of spin-offs and thousands of comics/graphic novels between them. That's a lot of story continuity, so it's understandable that things will become convoluted after awhile.The movies don't have that excuse, and the cracks in continuity began to show as early as the fourth film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Indeed, some would argue that the previous film, X-Men: The Last Stand, was the beginning of the end. Those two films, though entertaining, were definitely a dark period for the X-Men films, and many of us were beginning to think the franchise would end with the disappointing fourth installment.But if Fox failed to make another X-Men movie in a timely manner, they would lose the rights to the franchise and Marvel Studios would take the reigns. For awhile I was hoping this would happen. X-Men would then be able to exist in the same universe as the Avengers, a team that has close ties with X-Men in the comics, and has shared more than a few members (one of whom, Quicksilver, actually does appear in both this X-Men movie and the upcoming Avengers film).But then fox released X-Men: First Class. At first I thought it was a reboot since it seemed to ignore most of the continuity of the last four films. But no, it turns out it was a prequel, and a fantastic one at that. It's very rare that prequels turn out to be better than the originals they are meant to precede, but First Class managed to do this, and it even managed to do it without the star character, Wolverine, who only made a brief cameo appearance.It seemed that the writers had learned that the key to a good X- Men movie wasn't Wolverine, it wasn't the action or even the mutant powers. It's the deeper competing philosophies that X-Men puts forward as exhibited by the two most important characters: Professor X and Magneto. The originals had these two amazing characters portrayed by Shakespearean stage play veterans Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. But it was fascinating seeing their younger selves as portrayed by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Both pairs nailed their respective parts to perfection.This film, using one of my favorite science fiction plot devices: time travel, manages to bring both pairs together in the same film to brilliant effect. It's wonderful seeing the older and wiser Prof X and Magneto contrasted with their younger, more passionate selves. Peter Dinklage, playing the fanatical Bolivar Trask, manages to paint a sympathetic picture of the villain. If one thing X-Men does right, it's in its portrayals of villains. Very few of them are actually ""comic book evil"". They're just people, usually with deep convictions, who believe they are doing the right thing. The deeper themes of fanaticism, the horrors of war and genocide and how the road to hell is paved with good intentions is brilliantly adapted from the source material.I remember reading the ""Days of Future Passed"" comic book double issue as a teenager and it had a deep impression on me. Many people have accused this film of ripping off The Terminator, but what they probably don't realize is that the original story-line was written in 1981 by Chris Claremont. If anything, The Terminator ripped off Days of Future Passed.That being said, aside from the premise, this film is quite different from the original 1981 comic book story arc. But those changes were necessary since the movie franchise exists in a very different universe than the comic book franchise. Still, major themes and the heart of the story is preserved, and that's really all that matters.So did this movie ""fix"" the plot-holes and continuity issues of the previous six installments? Well, it's hard to say. Once you introduce multiple time-lines into the equation, I guess any plot-hole or inconsistency can be explained away simply by saying ""this movie exists on a different time-line where things happened differently"". It doesn't exactly explain why Professor X is suddenly alive again at the beginning of this film, but I guess it doesn't require an explanation either. It's not perfect, but I try not to let it bother me. At the end of the day the film stands on its own as an excellent bit of cinema. If you're looking for plot-holes, you're going to find them. But fortunately, the movie is so good that you forget to look for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great But Cap 2 Was Better,"The trailer really leaved me with high expectations about the movie but after watching it, it was OK but I wasn't really that satisfied with it as expectedOnce again, this really felt more like a Wolverine movie than an X-Men movie because time and time again they focus too much of him and its getting really boring for me. Fine, many people say that X-Men is all about Wolverine and that maybe true but still, the other characters still deserve their fair share of screen time as wellWell, to get to the movie, its an interesting story. Preventing the war in the future from happening. In a way, it reminds me of Back To The Future movies. The actors did well for their respective roles. Hugh Jackman shows why he deserves to be in the role as Wolverine. He shows all the is to the character and it will be tough to a replacement for him once he decides to let go of the character. Nicholas Hoult does well as Beast. Michael Fassbender also demonstrates why he is the ruthless Magneto but for me, the best character of the film goes to James McAvoy's Charles Xavier. He played played the role really well and was definitely the savior of humanity. The other mutants from the future didn't really do much in the movie apart from appearing there from going up against the sentinals as expected. This movie for might have some issues for younger children especially situations when Mystique appears but other than that, nothing much to worryOverall, a great movie and something to the superhero different to the superhero genre but in my opinion this movie can't topple Captain America The Winter Soldier for me",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best X-Men Yet,"I love time travel science fiction; however, I'm wary of sequels based in traveling to the past in order to wash away problems created in previous films. The storytellers need to have a strong sense of purpose, some stylish originality, and a good amount of self-awareness in order to pull it off (think Abrams brilliant ""Star Trek"" reboot). Luckily, Singer has nailed it with X-Men: Days of Future Past. Granted, it teeters on convolution and an over-abundance of comic-lore, but the story plays out gracefully and the characters are a blast. Add impeccable sound design and some top-notch scifi action, X-Men:DOFP is a tight and fun superhero romp. X-Men:DOFP follows Wolverine, sent to the past by old Magneto and Professor X to meet up with young Magneto, Professor X and other X-Men in the 1970s, in order to stop an event that sets course for a world war that destroys all mutants and much of civilization itself.confused? Don't worry, the Inception-like levels of plot are better focused within the film, and the emphasis is more on the socio-political themes of the first two X-Men: equality, weaponry, freedom. On top of this, the period piece look is outstanding, and the performances are great, especially Fassbender, Dinklage, and Jackman, who is a Godsend as Wolverine. The ultimate selling point here is the action, which while a bit overly violent for its rating, is stellar, especially with some truly unique use of bullet-time slow motion. This helps us overlook the silly and unnecessary over-explanation and exposition spewing. With strong direction, impressive visuals, and taut enthusiasm, X-Men:DOFP is the best X-Men yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Super,"I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie of the summer. hands down.,"I kinda knew I would probably enjoy this movie going into it, and my expectations were exceeded. This is an enjoyable take on the X franchise, it stands on it's own while taking baby steps into paying homage to the source material (let's be honest, while those original stories were iconic, the writing wasn't always great.). All actors provide performances with emotional resonance without being too heavy or overbearing. There is a nice balance of humor and drama. Even the original cast (who I have never been much of a fan of, aside from ellen page) provide a great action based counter point to the more character driven 70's characters. While there are a whole bunch of characters in this movie, the writers knew who to focus on and who to give a small amount of screen time (though more havock and rouge would have been awesome.). You really get a sense that singer and the writing team put time and effort into allowing the actors to play to their strengths in the right places. Mackavoy and Fassbender kill it in this movie. Hugh jackman is very enjoyable and inhabits the role way better than he did ten years ago. Jennifer Lawrence is very good here, and performs way better than she does in those crappy hunger games movies. Quicksilver is the most surprising highlight of this film, and kinda steals the show. Overall I think this is one of the best comic based movies ever made (sorry X2 sucks) and they didn't need to create too much collateral damage to get it done (hey magneto is very careful with that stadium ;p )",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The X Franchise Comes Full Circle,"I am compelled to write this review, that is how good this film was. X-Men DoFP, in my opinion, builds upon its predecessor i.e. First Class and man does it deliver? It is everything one can expect from a sequel-prequel-hybrid. The Sentinels were brutal & ruthless killing machines, the way they should be and honestly I was a bit skeptical going in.Bryan Singer proves that he is a force to be reckoned with. Call it his comeback, rebirth or his love for the franchise but he didn't disappoint one bit in the director's chair. The cameos were a welcome sight with just the right amount of humor at every turn. Not to mention, it was superbly written with attention to most tiny details (or what the film could manage, considering two simultaneous time lines).A must watch.

As it is clear from the name ( xmen days of future past) and from trailers that it is connected from past and future you will see both younger ones and older ones of the same mutant that will be more exciting and there will so much twists in the movie that will definitely blow your mind and yes hats off to brian singer. some new excellent mutants will be seen whom you will definitely like and yes no one can forget wolverine( hugh jackman) again with more power great action. purhaps because of time limit of the movie and there is so much actors inspite of that brian has manage there rolls very decently and you will definitely not blink your eyes while watching movie......10 on 10 no doubt :-),10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is why we go to the movies,"X-Men Days of Future Past is an epic, and emotional adventure filmed with drama and with memorable performances all around, and from so many characters too. When hearing about the scope of the plot I was a little hesitant, because the introduction of mutant after mutant didn't work so well in cases such as X-Men 3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine which were jam-packed with action but little to no character development or weight behind it, it felt rushed and artificial.But the returning director of X-Men and X2, Bryan Singer doesn't overdo it at all. The characters all have a role to play with the leads going to Wolverine (Jackman) and Xavier (McAvoy). This is not an action movie by any means. But when there is action it's really heavy just like the drama - everything in this movie is heavy and epic. The end of the world, both mutant and humankind is what's at stake here and the future is a horrible, horrible nightmare that could very well become reality if a grief-stricken, young Professor Xavier cannot find hope and pull himself together in time.Xavier having to find himself, with the help of his older-self (Stewart) as seen in the trailers was a touch of brilliance. An epic scene which sent chills up my body. This is why we go to the movies for this kind of roller-coaster experience.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bryan Singer gets this series back on track,"After Singer's last film, the box office fiasco and poorly done Jack the Giant Slayer, Singer shows a command of his craft that has been missing from his big budget work since he left this series in X2. The film starts out in a hostile future where the robotic Sentinels hunt down and wipe out what's left of the mutants. Either this film is purposely ignoring most of X3: The Last Stand or there's some glaring continuity oversights in this series, such as Professor X being alive in this grim future. But Days of Future past has a strong enough narrative to stand on its own, so it's easy to ignore events from the previous entries without impacting this film. Things get going when Wolverine is sent back to the 70s to seek the aid of a younger Professor X and Magneto to change the course of history. Even with crossover casting, time travel and mutants entrenched in powerful political positions, Days of Future Past is remarkably straight forward and well written and never gets convoluted with so many characters and plot threads. The money spent is up there on the screen and even with this colossal budget, the effects and action set pieces aren't overproduced, but remarkably well rendered and the period detail is more than convincing. The 3D was adequate, but didn't add anything to the experience except a few extra dollars to the ticket - two dimensions are more than enough for Days of Future Past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than I expected, still wanted more...but maybe that's a good thing!","Like most X-Men fans, my support of the X-Men franchise has always been rocky for a number of reasons but I won't get into that because those explanations have been exhausted through the years. But, I've always remained optimistic and First Class and The Wolverine are the main reasons why I was excited to see this film because I had almost given up and I'm glad I didn't. DOFP is everything it was supposed to be, although it lacks in areas, the overall result was an amazing experience from beginning to end.The Bad: I understand why they focused more on the 70s era but I wish we saw more of the dystopian future. I wanted to at least see some character interaction between all the X-Men in the future. All of the characters served their purpose enough for me to want to see more, but I mean we could have at least gotten some more dialogue between them all. I've come to the conclusion that Storm will never get her just do. I have many questions about where the franchise will go but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing it just means that I am anxious to see more movies. Too many characters are introduced just for show, but what can you do. *sigh*The Good: The time travel element is not confusing at all. The script is solid and there aren't any cheesy scenes or bad dialogue. Visual effects are amazing. Seeing everyone use their powers and how they work together was totally fun to watch. It was great seeing how Charles becomes Professor X. James McAvoy's performance was so compelling. Opening sequence was on the same caliber as the opening sequence in X2 with Nightcrawler. Everyone's performance and it was nice to see that Wolverine wasn't the main focal point. The Sentinels are scary as hell and everything just builds to be great.I'm not sure how to really reviews this film without giving spoilers, but you can tell that Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg really took their time in structuring a well crafted movie. It combines science fiction and action with depth and emotion very well and that's what I think a comic book movie should be about.My faith in the franchise has been restored and all the ester eggs moments and possibilities they can do with the franchise makes me very excited for what's coming next. I just have to say that after X-Men: Apocalypse, I don't want to see anymore origin movies. I want to see a full on X- Men movie. Avengers managed to give us an amazing spectacle of what a team up battle should look like. DOFP delivered but the climax is nowhere near as Epic as Avengers was but I'm fine with that because DOFP did it's job and I'm ready for more.This is definitely the best X-Men movie of he franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent Movie But Not Great [7.5/10],"My Live Reaction / Review for X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014): I love the how the cities look absolutely destroyed, it's cool. So the plan is to go back and change the past to prevent the creation of these creatures that destroyed the world? Sounds interesting. It's awesome how they included both the old and the new actors. Quicksilver's powers look super cool. First hour is pretty good, an 8/10 I would say. Erik tried to kill Raven? Damn.The first hour has some action scenes but not intense enough in my opinion. They had a plan and Magneto didn't care, he once again works alone without caring about the others. I really like the scenes where Magneto uses his powers. The second hour is good but not as good as the first one. I think that the imdb rating is a bit high (7.9/10). Beautiful performances from all the actors.

X-Men: Days of Future Past is the key for the super-hero-movie evolution.,"Back in 2000, X-Men was relished, and it proved that super-hero films can be realistic and serious. In 2003, X2 proved that sequels can be even better. X-Men: The Last Stand proved that super-heroes films can be huge disappointments. Then X-Men Origins: Wolverine was even worse. The Wolverine a bigger improvement than Origins, but again it wasn't full filing. But in 2011, X-Men: First Class brought back hopes for the franchise. This saga had uppers and downers for the last 13 years, which Bryan Singer brought the genre into a new level, by making the first two films, that after him many others followed. Now, he's back by bringing an all-star cast into X-Men: Days of Future Past. So, is it a letdown or a success? It's definitely, the best X-Men film till now. Singer is the father of this franchise and he makes one of Marvel's best projects. One of the biggest concerns of the film since the begging of the production was the oversize of the cast. There is this great balance of use for every character in the story, which you don't even care that most of them don't have much dialog. But the main heroes of the story are Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto and Mystic. Hugh Jackman once more plays the tough Wolverine, in probably in his best show run and he constantly reminds you why you love him in this role. Also, one of my favorite elements in First Class, which is the relationship between McAvoy's Xavier and Fassbender's Magneto, is here and in a more hostile environment. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystic was one of the main parts in the film, and the way her character was made for the development of the film was one of the smartest elements. But the film is based on the theme of Hope, which is connecting with Charles Xavier, who from James McAvoy's broken Xavier evolves to the mentor and leader Patrick Stewart's Professor X. McAvoy gives an astonishing performance which provides you most of the most dramatic moments of the film. Meanwhile, the biggest surprise is Quicksilver. He is the most entertaining part of the project and his scene in the Kitchen gets in main highlights and shows us the most interesting and awesome use of super speed. Without giving spoilers, this film is the redemption for every mistake that the previous installment had made. In verdict, Days of Future Past is an emotional action journey to the best X-Men film ever made, which gives the opportunity to an ever bigger Future for this amazing franchise. With this and Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2014 has become my favorite year for super heroes and being an even bigger fan for Marvel; next stop Guardians of the Galaxy, but it would be very difficult to surpass those two.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The things we do for box office,"I was a die hard fan of the X-Men comics in the 80s. And DOFP & Dark Phoenix was the best. Granted, time past, and I don't recall much. BUT what I remember, was that Kitty Pride was the main character. Now they of course have Wolverine, since he is a much more secure, sexy box office than (the former) Ellen Page. It would have been interesting to see this story trough Kitty Pride, but Fox knows what they want Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence. Besides that, this is one of the best X-movies. Which granted doesnt say much. Dark Phoenix was barerly a better remake of sorts of X3. But it's really cool to see every actor, young and old, in an burlesque soup between past and future. And even if Trask (the wonderful Peter Dinklage) reminds me more of Oppenheimer, he has a big point, which we see when Mystique jumps trough a window. Having mutants among us in an alternate reality is scary. So Trask is not really a villain. It's an interesting dilemma, specially when you know the genuine, scary powers Magneto possesses, which in full show later in the movie can kill thousands whenever he wants. But again I wished that they would stick to Kitty Pride. Besides the superior Logan, Wolverine and Jackman is starting to be X-fatigue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Days of Future Crap!,"I've had more heroic poops than ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""Where to begin? Am I the only one who thinks Hugh Jackman is getting a little long in the shorts to play Wolverine? At this stage of the game he would be better off in an episode of ""The Crotch Chronicles."" As for the rest of the high-powered cast, may their next film have ""X"" in the title not because it's a sequel, but because they'll have been banished from Hollywood and forced to make the naughty motion pictures!I caught this one at an early screening and everyone in the audience walked away looking like Robert Hegyes after catching the red eye. They found themselves actively rooting against the time travel plot, the Croation-looking special effects and the overall sense of poopiness. One child cried as the beans spilled out of his hand.You've got to give Bryan Singer a lot of credit. The man is the directorial equivalent of Bull from ""Night Court."" But what did all of that work amount to? Over two hours of glib gibber-gabber, George Foreman-like cinematography and even ""Facts of Life"" ripoffs.Overall, I do not recommend ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On to the next one,"X-Men: Days of Futures Past simply amazed me. Best X-Men yet and everything was perfect to me. It was a very complex but yet brilliant script. I really did love everything about it. If you have vigorously watched and appreciated all the X-Men (like me) then you will truly appreciate this movie more than any other ordinary super-hero movie goer. There are some questions that are left unanswered and I am not sure if I missed something or if it's because they are trying to lead you onto the next movie in the franchise. But whatever it is I can't wait for the next one. This was beautifully put together and is without question the best X-Men yet. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and just when it scoots you back in your chair it then slingshots you back to the edge of your seat. This definitely has competition with films like Godzilla, Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Edge Of Tomorrow to determine the best movie of the summer. I would go see this if you are a super-hero fan... If you don't appreciate super-hero's.... then first of all... you don't have a life, and I wouldn't recommend seeing this even though it's perfect in almost every way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: DoFP = Not Just Another Superhero Movie,"I saw X-Men: Days of Future Past twice now. And man; it IS a good movie. First of all, X- Men series always weighs more than other superhero movies because it is built on very strong issues such as: discrimination, self-control, alienation, balance, racism in some level, a persons inner fight to be better... So as a result, the X-Men movies become more than just some superhero movies with people who can do interesting things in it. These are REAL movies and behind all that imaginative world, dealing with REAL things that we can all relate to.Days of Future Past is one of the best-seller stories amongst all the Marvel stories for 20 years now. So it is normal to have high expectations from the movie. But the thing is while I was looking forward to see DoFP, I told myself to lower my expectations because I liked X- Men: First Class more than any superhero movie before (and I am quite the nerd on that end) It couldn't have been better than First Class, right? Well, sorry ""me"" from 3 days earlier, you were wrong...DoFP is an ensemble movie and we know that Singer is very good at those. (I mean, Usual Suspect right?) It gathers a lot of the original cast and the younger-self cast together in a story that would make you believe. The action scenes are just enough and well-balanced with everything else. I always thought since First Class started and ended with ""Magneto"" and more than anyone we saw him develop through the story, it was actually Magneto's movie. And now I am sure of that cause this one starts and ends with Prof. X and he is the one who develops through the story this time and boy, did James McAvoy done a good job with it! Amazing. His acting is superb, along with the others.The future scenes convince you on their side while the 70's look just like 70's with costumes, usage of technology of that time, with designs and with dialogs... And there aren't as much as plot holes as they say, who says that just didn't watch that movie and the others very carefully... Just some holes on the time traveling - changing the past side but hey, it is the destiny of all time traveling movies isn't it? And DoFP did a better job at this than many other.I can say so much more about this movie but I am sure if you are a true fan of X-Men on screen, you'll feel the same way anyway. This movie will stuck with you for some time because and I repeat of its depth. It is not just a super-hero movie. It is a treat for anyone who loves a good movie but also; it is everything you could've asked for if you are a true X-Men fan on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bryan Singer﻿ is back and how!,"X-Men: Days of Future Past﻿ - Bryan Singer﻿ is back and how! Finally after 3 disappointing movies (with the exception of X-Men: First Class﻿ which was awesome) we finally get one which is as good as (or perhaps better than) the first two. Every scene was memorable. There wasn't a single boring moment. Thanks to Hugh Jackman﻿, James McAvoy﻿, Nicholas Hoult﻿, Michael Fassbender﻿ and of course Jennifer Lawrence﻿. They were all amazing in their own roles. Special mention must be made of Evan Peters﻿. No matter how weird the costume looks, his take on Quicksilver was awesome. Not only was his prison break scene one of the coolest slo-mo scenes we've ever witnessed but one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. But yes, the future scenes could've been a little longer. The little details here and there throughout the movie were really good. And of course, Peter Dinklage was really good. The 'future' scenes weren't that long, but the Sentinels were kickass. All in all it was arguably the best movie of the franchise. Now that Singer is back, and X-Men: The Last Stand﻿ is *SPOILER* gone, hopes are sky high for X-Men: Apocalypse﻿.P.S. Watch out for the last scene in the future. Everyone who we lost, are back! Also, the post credits scene. EN SABAH NUR! EN SABAH NUR! EN SABAH NUR!4/5Oh and FYI, John F. Kennedy﻿ was, apparently, a mutant :P",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent For Comic Fans,"The X-Men send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.There is plenty to enjoy about this film, but I think it has one shortcoming: without a knowledge of the comic, a viewer might be a little confused. The sheer number of mutants (and other characters) is a tad overwhelming. Of course, some of this is helped if you saw previous X-Men films (as you should), but it is still quite a large amount.What is very interesting is how Quicksilver appears here, and is also in the ""Avengers"". And these two films do not share the same universe. I am a bit unsure how the rights worked out, but somehow they must have found the character to be acceptable in both worlds. Still odd having him in two movies at once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie Meshing The Old With The New,"Since the first X-Men movie began over 14 years ago, the entire X-Men franchise has exploded into a huge success. The original X-Men (2000) movie with the original cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, etc. was great because it was one of the first Marvel movies to be shot in real life and the special effects were amazing. It was pretty much the start of a new era of superhero films.. Fast forward a decade after the first movie, you've now got a new series starring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the two main characters.What fascinated me about this movie was the fact that Bryan Singer returned and was able to mesh up the old with the new in such an interesting way that makes the movie work. It's very rare nowadays to keep actors on for sequels...but to keep the original cast from 14 years ago to play the older counterparts of the main characters from First-Class was a marvel in itself. Now you've got the best of both worlds, and it does not disappoint!I thought that this movie was amazing. As many reviewers have said, it touches on a lot of themes, some of which include discrimination, adaptation, hope, and preservation. Most importantly, it focuses on the idea of change and how one person can make a difference in the world. But also how teamwork and the forces around you can drive you to do the things you end up doing.Overall, the storyline was good, the themes stood out very clearly, and to top it all off, the entire movie was action-packed and highly entertaining. I'd recommend watching it if you haven't, as it's a movie suitable for everyone, even if you're not a superhero junkie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth Your Time,"Viewed on Disney+.In this X-Men Pre/Sequel, mutants are nearly extinct after being hunted down by highly adaptive killer robots called Sentinels. Their only hope for survival is to send Wolverine back in time (in a manner of speaking) to the 1970s in hopes that he can get Professor X & Magneto to team up & put the project on ice before it can get off the ground.Pretty solid. It was fun to see the cast of the original X-Men trilogy again (even if most of the film stays in the past), though I can't say I liked it as much as ""First Class"". I really enjoyed how that film worked the geopolitical landscape of the time into the narrative (particularly the Cuban Missile Crisis), and although this film tried similar with the end of the Vietnam War, I don't think it was as successful/effective. Still an enjoyable enough movie though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

They concentrated too much on the 1970's.° I wanted to see Bishop more.° Why doesn't Quicksilver follow them on the Mission?Overall, It was a Good Film but they really should of put more time into the Future X-Men.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is just like a Official reboot,"Well acted,fantastic script and best post credits scene for a marvel movie.X men days of future past had everything that a x men movie should have every character had played its part .Charles Xavier portrayed by James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart is one prominent character in the movie along with magneto portrayed by Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen .The good thing about the movie is that the character of mystique has been taken seriously unlike other movies where mystique was shown just as a side villain .Hugh Jackman as wolverine as always did a fantastic job .Out of all the characters the character which i liked the most was quicksilver .Though i am not a big fan of this character thanks to Evan peters as quicksilver i want to see more of this character .The only problem was that his character was short although his performance was one of the highlight .By the end of the movie you feel like it had a re boot you will know it when you see it .And the end credits i say that it is the best end credit of a marvel movie .I think that it is the best sequel and the best x men movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: Days of Future Past,"So in the best spirit of ""Terminator"", the X-Men conclude that the best way of securing the future is to send ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman) into the past to try to stop history from causing the demise of both human and mutant alike. Why? Well that's because they realise that modern science, which has created the unstoppable robotic ""Sentinels"", is capable of destroying all in it's path - and them fighting each other will merely ensure they all end up going the way of the dodo. The task assigned to ""Wolverine"" is to try and convince the 1973 version of ""Mystique"" (Jennifer Lawrence) upon whose DNA these metallic creations are based, to co-operate - and that is not going to be an easy task. Especially as she has no idea that she is the crucial source of their genetics. This is easily the best of the series for my money. The amalgam of new and old cast deliver the best, meatiest, of the stories efficiently and entertainingly. ""Wolverine"" takes the lead but there is plenty of scope for the other characters to shine, use their powers, have a bit of romance and generally keep this 2¼ hour action adventure moving along quickly. We are spared much of the repetitive close-combat scenes that Jackman's character usually delivers; the visual effects are lively and vibrant and the denouement offers a degree of food for thought amidst the chaos and mayhem. Great to watch on a big screen and well anchored by the (slightly side-lined) Thespians, this is well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest X-Men ever! Truly.,"The best movie in the X-men movie franchise by a distance. Keeps you completely engrossed from the start till the very end (Pity me I missed out on the post credits scene). Dark future, not-so-perfect past with a ray of hope, a shining light in between the two zones. What a concept!Superb direction by Bryan Singer who returns to the franchise and starts delivering from the 1st frame itself. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan is a treat to watch any day. He is completely owned this character and as always been cheesy here and there, which is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Lawrence excels as Mystique/Raven. This girl knows how to play a part in a movie and not get overshadowed by bigger stars. The most exciting part of the movie was actually watching the younger Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto/Erik played by James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender respectively who are strikingly different in character from their present selves. Not to miss the breath-taking stunts by supporting mutants like Beast, Quicksilver, Blink and Shadowcat.Action sequences are amazing, and will leave you in awe (i was literally screaming WOW). The script has been improved and flaws removed from the previous editions. Everything is near perfect. Marvel studios deliver another marvelous flick. Not to be missed as a movie on a whole, and not a scene to be missed. In short, this part does what other parts couldn't. And yeah, don't forget the post credits scene.

Old director of older xmen movies ruins this one as well,"In first class you got amazing acting all around, great story telling, new and fresh faces with cool powers even though there was a cameo. Singer just wanted to control the xmen universe again because of how good first class actually was. After watching it he probably swore and thought he had to do something quick before he gets forgotten for his bad xmen movies. Why first class is rated lower than this movie is beyond me.First thing on his list was to bring back his old cast. Second, was to kill off most of the new cast from first class. Third, add some bad storyline that involves one of the main characters from his other xmen movies because of the popularity of this certain character and the actor combined.Honestly I don't wanna write more about this movie. I just never wrote a review before. I was suppose to write a review for that new mad max movie because I felt like I needed to but this xmen movie got in the way and put me on a detour. It just appeared and I just instantly thought about how bad it was.I never want to see this ever again.

One of the Better X-Men Movies,"X-Men: Days of Future Past was an interesting movie. I think that the whole Kitty Pryde being able to send people back in time was stretching her powers a little lot. However, I did enjoy seeing many new characters come to life on the live-action screen. Even though characters like Blink, Warpath, and Sunspot all had minor roles, I enjoyed seeing them in action, and think that they should get more prominent roles if they are integrated into the MCU. I think that Mystique should've been more true to the comics and been a true assassin, but that's not the way Fox took it unfortunately. The only reason I rate this movie higher than most of the other X-Men movies is because of the diversity in characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"There is enough outstanding acting and effects in the film to make it worth seeing on a big screen, but the movie is forgettable.","X-Men: Days of Future Past, a random point review, off the cuff1. You will never see better acting in a superhero movie. While emoting lines like, ""You sent me from 50 years in the future to stop the sentinels from destroying us all"" and other seemingly silly science fiction lines, the actors sound somehow credible.2. The sets and filming are fine, especially a couple of fantastically filmed scenes. No 3D was required. I think the days of the 3D fetish are over and only a few 3D films will be made in the future, those that will benefit from it.3. Costumes, fine, but they didn't make enough of the 70s styles like American Hustle did.4. Plot, okay. Not great, nothing new, kind of a hodge-podge of plots from Star Trek and X- Men smashed together.5. The super villain machine. Pathetic, the worst in the movie. While the transports were interesting and different, the monsters, for lack of a better word, were a combination of monsters from Terminator, Thor, and other movies. You would think someone on the creative team could come up with something mildly original. Perhaps a monster based on a centipede...6. Music--I barely noticed it, and that's a good thing.Bonus: There are two scenes that tapped so deeply into my teenage nerd mind, as if Dr. X had contacted that part of my brain, that I was blown away. Seriously.Oh, did I say that Raven/Mystique was fabulous? That Jennifer Lawrence can act, and hopefully she will get better, more challenging roles as her fame increases.Rating: Matinée.

The future is bright,"X-Men Days of Future Past sets the tone for future X-Men movies. It was both stunning in its great special affects and great in its story line. Both done right make a great movie. What makes X-Men special is the unique characters they have. And how you can have so many people important to the story, relevant and meaningful. From the bad to the good. This constant theme of mutants and humans seems to always find a way to keep the story both unique and entertaining.When you watch this film you both feel relived and excitement which is what anyone could ever ask for. From this film you feel that X-men is starting to feel like its finally on the right track. Personally i have never been the biggest X-men fan but after this film i am glad i started paying more attention to it.The evenness of both action and story is what gives this movie a good tone. You have the story line which progresses over the film which grabs your attention the whole way. In this all the characters have those developments as well. Going back and fourth between every character. We feel both the importance of now and whats next.The action is amazing, what gives X-men a good feel the different skills the mutants have. You see some new ones which i enjoyed. The stunning graphics is great. Its what you expect from a movie these days. The action scenes are all exciting and worth watching. A good action scene has meaning and that's exactly what this movie provides.Overall this movie is deadset great, watch it whiles it still in the movies and buy it when it comes out.

Ran out of magic,"I think the X-Men movies had a good run and now it seems it should just end. It was choppy, it was dark. And unless you really follow the X-Men in both the movies and comic books, this movie will leave you confused. I watched the movies and I was still confused. When it comes to time travel, it just opens a tall bottle of questions. Of course Magneto is back as the bad guy. That adds to my angst. Did the X-Men have no other villains? Just like the Batman franchise, always the Joker. Just like the Spiderman franchise, always the Green Goblin. So why wasn't I surprised. Nothing in this movie stood out to me. No one character grabbed my attention. Though it was refreshing to see Kitty Pryde / Shadowcat finally getting air time and not all Halle ""lookit me lookit me"" Berry.

A movie worth spending money on..Go watch it! :),"X-Men is a franchise that has earned the trust of the fans to always entertain and this time too it fulfills its promise. A dark, thrilling start with coffin like spaceships shooting bodies in the air towards the land, the viewers are left aghast at the devastation left behind by these bodies which are apparently a sort of robots called the Sentinels made to destroy all mutants. The world has been left in ruins with the human as well as the mutant race on the brink of extinction. The only solution to save the humans and the mutants is to send Logan (Wolverine) back in time to the year 1973 and stop the sequence of events that led to their present situation!Out of the box thinking, terrific acting, A- class star cast and exciting action sequences make this movie worth every penny spent. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress and if she did a admirable job in the previous movies as mystique then just wait and watch her in this movie. She is completely awesome! A vulnerable, confused girl as Raven and a dangerous, unbalanced mutant as Mystique; she plays her role to perfection. Hugh Jackman is his usual splendid self and plays Wolverine with ease. The variations in his character are flawlessly portrayed by him and as always one is left totally thrilled watching him on the big screen. The older Professor X, Patrick Stewart; and Magneto, Ian McKellan have limited roles here but their performance is perfectly A- class. Their younger selves, McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Fassbender as Eric enchant the fans with their power pack performances. The actors playing Kitty, Beast, Iceman etc. also do justice to their parts and each is able snag the attention of the fans irrespective of the length of their part in the movie. However, worth noting here is the new entries, Peter Dinklage as Dr. Trask and Evan Peters as Quicksilver. The perfect villain who creates the Sentinels, Dr. Trask is a genius with a twisted admiration for the mutants. He has created the perfect weapon to end the mutant race. Quicksilver is quick and the scenes where he gets Magneto out of prison are totally magical and thrilling. Peter and Evan are sure to get a huge fan following after this movie.The 3D portion is okay but a bit disbalanced with the major portion in the first part and almost no effects in the second part. The climax is entertaining but the sense of urgency that should have been present is lacking. The Direction and editing is admirable. The scenes flow fluidly from one event to another. Make-up, sets, special effects and photography is as usual done by expert people who make everything believable. Several story lines are opened in the movie and a base set for the upcoming movies.All in all, a movie worth spending money on.

A brilliant sequel to First Class and the original film trilogy,"The X-Men film series has been ""hit-and-miss"" throughout the years, from the successful 2000's X-Men and 2003's X-Men United, the mediocre and pointless standalone Wolverine films (2009 and 2013), to the terrible Last Stand (2006) and the excellent First Class prequel (2011). It's been 14 years long since Bryan Singer directed the first X-Men film that kickstarted the whole franchise. This time around, he's back directing the franchise's 7th installment (His third X-Men film), Days of Future Past.Loosely adapted from the 1981 Chris Claremont and John Byrne comic storyline of the same name, Days of Future Past intends to bridge the gap between the original trilogy of films and First Class, melding together the disjointed history of the X-Men world, erasing or fixing certain plot holes, continuity errors and inconsistencies that exist in the franchise, start anew and open up possibilities for future films. With that being said, this is considered the most epic and ambitious taking of the X-Men films to date.Days of Future Past fulfills its long-term promises and achieve the 'impossible'. This film wouldn't work without a solid foundation laid over throughout the years. We have known some of these characters for so long (4 films, 2 spin-offs) that we can identify with them strongly. Fans would definitely be pleased with the numerous cameo appearances of Marvel characters in the film as well.Because the film involves time travel (a story that jumps back and forth between 2023 and 1973), it is intensely plot-driven, linking the events that happened in past films together with historical events as part of the story. The film has decent pacing and story flow, successfully integrating both future and past timelines together, avoiding many of the typical time paradoxes without overcomplicating the story.The film takes the best thing about the X-Men and show it to the audience: taking all of these 'gifted' individuals and make them into a team, watch how they face and solve issues inherent to teamwork. Forget The Avengers. This film has two generation of mutants from two different timelines (14 of them) teaming up to prevent an apocalyptic future that could mean the extinction of both mutants and humans.Finally at last, Marvel fans get to see how these individuals complement one another in terms of power, weakness and personality by teaming up to fight against an army of mutant-hunting, lethal Sentinels. There's also one amazing action sequence involving Quicksilver, which is probably one of the film's highlights. The way he infiltrates and stages the prison break from a highly-secured Pentagon cell is simply brilliant. Not to mention, the song that comes with the scene is spot-on as well.While many would have thought this film is overcrowded with characters, but this is not the case. The film cleverly focuses on young Xavier's character arc, which acts as the central story that ties the various subplots together into a single narrative, watching him go from a guy who lost nearly everything...his legs, his best friend, his adopted sister, his students due to the Vietnam War (his school as well) to a guy who will become the powerful, wise, compassionate teacher and leader of the X-Men in the future. There's a wonderfully shot, exceptionally acted, heartfelt moment in the film...the conversation between the young and old Xavier. ""Please...We need you to hope again..."" pleads the older and wiser Xavier, with emotional heft and gravitas to his broken and disheartened younger self.However, the franchise has yet to provide a compelling villain that poses a huge threat to the X-Men. The series have always been repeatedly dwelling with themes of discrimination, prejudice and social injustice...with the human race always in conflict with the mutants. (This will soon change in the next sequel) There's another gripe regarding the CGI effects presented in the film. Some of the shots aren't realistic enough and shown to be rather sloppy, which is definitely not expected from a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster film. Overall, this latest instalment of X-Men film series have left me incredibly hopeful for the upcoming sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse. Highly recommended.Rating: 9/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future- past.htmlNote: As usual with many Marvel films, please stay for the after-credits scene.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular Story,"You may underestimate this entry even if you overestimate it. Emotionally, the story, actors and scenes take you to a place you never thought it could go. Whether fan-boy or average movie goer the new X-men with Bryan Singer back at the helm keeps you guessing with all your favorite mutants once again like you've never seen them. Hugh Jackman, who seems to be the face of the X-men delivers as always with his dry sense of humor. Jennifer Lawrence is more a focus in this one which makes sense. However James MaCavoy steals the show as the one and only Professor Charles Xavier with a great performance you'll never see coming. Not to exclude the rest of the cast, this rivals The Dark Knight franchise with a thriller like mentality that you won't wanna miss on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My NEW favorite Marvel movie!,"I have been a fan of the X-Men trilogy. Especially the ones directed by Bryan Singer. And then, I heard that they were going to make an installment that unites the X-Men and their younger selves. That caught my attention. I loved the cast of X-Men: First Class especially James McAvoy, who brought an outstanding performance. The other cast members did an excellent job portraying their characters. At the premiere of X- Men Days of Future Past, I was so excited.The movie was spectacular, thrilling, and funny at some points. Bryan Singer did an outstanding job. The visual effects and slow motion sequences were extremely amazing. The performances of all the actors/actresses were outstanding, as well. Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, James Mcavoy, Patrick Stewart, Michael Fassbender were absolutely amazing portraying their characters. Evan Peters was the perfect actor for Quicksilver. The story was amazing and very unique.All in all, the movie had the perfect combination of visual effects, action, drama and some laughs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If They Had Called It Something Else ...,"...I would have bumped my score up a couple of notches, at least. While I do have problems with the script being unwilling to present the story that was laid-out pretty well in the comics, I feel that the production was a try at getting as many name stars of the franchise together in a ""last ditch""-feeling effort to jump-start or revitalize this franchise. Get the big stars before they are too expensive. Highlight characters that aren't highlighted in the actual story that goes by the title used.Still, there were moments in the movie that I actually enjoyed, the main one being the ""Time In A Bottle"" sequence. Evan Peters is a remarkable gent, when given the good stuff to play. Also, the fight in the present/future. The effects were fun to watch.I think that my disappointment, even more than deviation from the source material, is that the movie I ended up watching was so very paint-by-numbers. Of course Plot Point 4v happened, that's how it always happens in these movies. If I wanted predictable, I would stay home, save the $12 of buying a ticket and concessions, and watch a classics station running older TV shows. I don't pay to see Sir Ian, Sir Patrick, Ms. Lawrence, Mr. Fassbinder, Mr. McAvoy, Ms. Page and Mr. Dinklage be predictable, not when they can be gloriously dynamic.I am disappointed in the filmmakers, not the cast, but I am not wishing for that amount of time back. It entertained, the least I ask of something that I pay to see. That's why the rating of five. It did not outrage or enthrall. It was whelming.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maturity shows on the actors,"So it's been 14 years since the original X- Men movie. Many actors were teenagers when this series started, but in this version they have grown up in more ways than one.Maturity shows on their acting and their ability to express subtle nuance in the acting which makes this movie more rewarding to watch.Dare I say that this is the best of the many X-Men movie that came along. Bryan Singer still have the ability to turn all the subtitling of the plot into convincing visual landscape. This is a very entertaining movie at all levels.I hope they would continue the X-Men franchise in this direction in the future. A movie well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
From Geek to Geek!,"Before i start my review i would first like to tell you that i am proudly a long time fan of the Marvel universe and deep lover of the comic book universes it has created. When i watched the original trilogy i enjoyed them but was disappointed feeling they lacked a certain something, and after the devastation of the disaster that was 'The last stand' i had thought it would be a long time before professor Xavier and his X-men returned. Thank the universe i was wrong.When First class hit the cinemas it was like a breath of fresh air had revitalized the stagnant body of the franchise, everything i had wanted it to be it was. We were shown superb acting and cinematography, a beautifully written plot and there was a constant sense of energy and drive. And most of all it made me think and reflect and lose myself in my imagination and thoughts. First class had me pining for more.So it was that i saw 'Days of future past' as soon as it was in my local cinema. I don't know where any of the two hours and ten minutes went, i was hooked from start to finish and so engrossed that time sped past. 'Days of future past' takes us on a tremendous journey from the bleak reaches of the future back into the past. We see X-men from both the old and new franchises face their toughest battles and some of their most defining moments. The wonderfully crafted script makes for a seamless smooth ride despite the cuts between past and present and even gives tasty titbits in a nod to other x-men story lines. The characters are better than ever and the sheer acting power behind them drives them forward to greater heights. I must in particular tip my hat to James Mcavoy and Jennifer Lawrence. Despite the dark brooding storyline which X-men fans will already have an idea of there is still plenty of laughs to be had. A certain scene with speedster Quicksilver is in my opinion the funniest and coolest scene in all X-men films. A nod to young peter evans who we will be seeing more of in the next film i am certain.Without giving away too much you can be assured that 'Days of future past' will have you ensnared in your seat, leave you stunned, laughing and maybe even have you deep in thought by the end. If that's not enough to convince you of this films brilliance than i shall say but one last thing, All wrongs of the past are righted, all things become full circle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely the worst X-Men till now.,"Slow, too much boring bla bla (of the bad one, just emotional stereotypes) and way too few action. I do not go to watch X-Men to see cheap Rhetoric, I go to see epic fights, special powers, amazing characters. I was not moved nor excited not even for a second. All what happens is very predictable, the characters are few, and all what happens is about Charles, Magneto, Mystique, and the omnipresent Wolverine. Always them. BORING. Just a few new interesting characters on the future side of the story, which only the connoisseurs can enjoy, because there is absolutely no introduction and their appearance is relegated into few short weak scenes. I think this Movie shows clearly that X-Men became a a sort of TV Series, just in the Cinema. Here the writers sacrificed an entire Movie to the ""development"" (=low level stereotypical) of the personality of a couple of characters, cutting away action, epic, speed, diversity, news, etc. Problem is that this is a Movie, not an episode of a TV Series (which you have to wait a week to see the next one), a Movie for which people had to wait years, as they will have to wait before the next. The writers are going in circles. Nowhere.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cinematic brilliance,"Days of Future Past is by far, the best of the X-Men films. I can't recall when a film franchise managed to weave in the past and the present like this before, and even though the writers tried hard to throw in tidbits of info for the sake of continuity, but I can't help but applaud Brian Singer for putting it together in such a seamless manner. Expect to see some cameos too!This is Brian Singer's most beautiful film, and I'm not biting back any words when I say that it truly is a brilliant piece of film-making. The camera-work, the lighting, the vantage points, the use of Slow-Mo, the blur effects during the Charles meets Charles scene...it was just so masterfully done and unexpected. There were some instants where the action was shown from the perspective of old 1970s grainy TV footage, and it seemed as if we were watching real, historical, archived footage that was locked away in some CIA vault!The main cast, as expected was nothing short of brilliant--and I'd like to start with Micheal Fassbander. He stole the show in my opinion, and I also thought McAvoy, and Lawrence had some Oscar worthy, tear-jerking scenes. Besides the fantastic acting by this young, talented trio, they also had the some of the coolest action scenes. There was an airport scene in the film that featured Mystique and McAvoy, and I thought it was amazing--both on an artistic and technical level. I thought Magneto's superpowers were really stretched to a whole knew level in this film, such as the scene where he was disarmed and still fired the gun as it fell...so creative! However, the single best action scene belonged to the character Quicksilver. His scene was absolutely beautifully shot and should be shown in film schools!As for the rest of the cast, they all put in solid efforts. Hugh Jackman made for a good wise-cracker as usual, Stewart and McKellan had their moments, however brief they might have been. I really would have liked to see more Dinklage in this film, and I thought Peter Dinklage did such a fine job at playing a scientist that was deeply concerned with Homeland security. However, his screen-time was sadly limited.Other than that, I really have nothing negative to say about this excellent film, except that it may require multiple viewings for some people who aren't accustomed to Time Travel based science fiction. I myself, am a die-hard Star Trek fan, and so I had no trouble with the complex plot. Just hearing Patrick Stewart say the words-- ""We must go back in time"" was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this is one of the top 3 best superhero films ever made!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Disappointed,only half expectations fulfilled",I am a big fan of x men franchise I had watched and liked all of the x men movies but what happened with this one? Not containing too much action only based upon story.When I had watched the trailer I was really blown up by the trailer and thus I had too much expectations but this flick had full filled my half expectations only.First of all the 3D effects were not so good and also lack of action sequences had disappointed me I had really tried to like this movie but because of these 2 reasons I was disappointed.But I have to say that the story line was brilliant and also the acting by all actors and direction by Mr.singer.But still I am an x men fan and I wish if it gets a sequel in future my expectations will be 3D effects and more and more action please.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie,Very good movie. I was waiting for it since many months. The movie is superb and the wolverine is very good. i liked it very much. Now waiting for next movies of x-Men to be released. In this movie the magneto runs then what will happen in the future. Next parts will be gonna interesting. The effects of the x-men days of future past were good and when the wolverine goes in past there are sentinels and it looks awkward to see the technology which is not present today and there in the past there is such an advanced technology. Although the movie was great. may be we can see aliens in the next parts or a mutant powerful then everyone with ability to do any mutant powers.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Holding up the tradition,"My daughter saw this movie before I did and told me that she fell asleep, so I was hesitant to see it and didn't go the first week. Yet I was not disappointed. This movie was funny when it needed to be, and action packed at other times. It's subplot was palpable and more importantly made sense. The main plot seemed a little obvious as to it's immediate resolution in the movie but even though you knew it was coming you had several places where they could've put it so it kept me guessing. Unfortunately, the writers got a little lazy and allowed convenience to enter the movie a couple of key times. My biggest problem was that I wished they'd have done even more with the speed guy, you'll see what I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bes X-Men Yet,"This is my first review for the site, and what a movie to start with. Now, as a kid I was a giant comic book nerd. Only thing was, I was only into Spiderman. Because of this I have very little experience with the X-Men comics. Because of this movie, that will soon change. My friend whom I saw this with, informed me that this was very close to the comics however. Now, this movie starts in a future (obviously) where things have gone wrong. Mutants, mutant sympathizers, and parents of future mutants, and being hunted down and killed preemptively in a cross between Minority Report and 1984. In order to stop this, the mutants decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to 1973 in order to convince Professor X and Magneto to stop an assassination of a wealthy weapons manufacturer. This is a very deep story however, as it goes into the mind of Professor X as not only his school and best friend are ripped from him, but also the love of his life. It's almost painful to watch this wise old Obi-Wan figure turning to drug abuse just to stay sane. Wolverine does play a huge part in this movie, but don't worry. He may be the main character, but he doesn't overshadow anyone at all. In fact, the other characters almost overshadow him instead. In true X-Men movie fashion, there are deaths, and they are brutal. There were also quite a few scenes that made me flinch, and I'm saying that as someone who can gut a deer. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 13, but I can't speak for everyone out there. There is quite a bit of comic relief to balance out the painful parts though. One scene in particular which involves breaking into the Pentagon had everyone in the theater in tears they were laughing so hard. So it's not Dark Knight depressing I would recommend this for anyone who has enough willing suspension of disbelief that they can take comic book movies (because let's face it, they aren't even remotely possible). Anyone else would probably be better off watching something boring while we're having fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Fox-Xmen movie,"X-Men: Days of Future Past, a mutant masterpiece that had me hooked from the future to the past and back again. The ensemble cast, featuring the powerhouse duo of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, delivers performances that are nothing short of magnetic. The film editing orchestrates a seamless dance between timelines, creating a narrative that's as intricate as it is exhilarating. The strength of Days of Future Past lies in its ability to balance character development with high-stakes action, a feat that few superhero films achieve. The music, while not stealing the spotlight, complements the emotional beats with a subtle grace. The only weakness might be the occasional convolution of its time-travel narrative, but the payoff is worth every twist. Cinematography captures the grandeur of mutant abilities with breathtaking visuals, making every power surge and battle an awe-inspiring spectacle. At 8/10, Days of Future Past is a time-bending thrill ride that not only resurrects the franchise but propels it to new heights, leaving me with a mutant-sized grin from ear to ear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not what you would expect,"Days of Future Past is a swell X-Men film since the original trilogy. It included a very in-depth and complex story that involved the progress of saving the mutant race and restoring peace to the world. Even after his most recent hit major film, the Wolverine once again stars as the primary role during the process of saving the world from certain terror. While the rest of the original cast hardly had any extraordinary roles, the way the overall story was produced was at a level that proved to be interesting and thought-provoking and the end result to the film overall was quite satisfying indeed. Whether it's a new generation X-Men or the beginning of a new era, X-Men: Days of Future Past will certainly be considered one of the highest rated out of the new generation of X-Men filming and special effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bryan back............... Xmen cool again!!!!!,"What to say........... when i came to know that Bryan was directed I couldn't have been less excited for it . I had too many expectations for it but it was less!!!!!!!

Lets go through the timeline: 1. X-men= good 2. X-2 = better 3. X-men 3 = Yucks 4. X-men Origins= boohoo(it can go on) 5. X-men First Class= At last a good X-men Movie 6. The Wolverine= OK.. we like it 7. X-men days of future past= Best marvel movie 8. X-men Apocalypse = Gotta Watch it!

Why are people rating this so highly?!,"I fell asleep. Yes, I actually fell asleep during this nonsensical mish mosh of a movie. I don't know that I've actually ever fallen asleep in a movie theater before, except one time when I had just got off a 10 hour flight and went to a movie to try to stay awake to avoid jet lag. Fail!But back to this one. If you like a movie with intelligence, a coherent plot, characters you can care about and great acting.... don't bother going to see X-Men: Days of Future Past. Really. Just don't waste your time.About the only good thing in this movie was the guy playing Nixon. The whole opening sequence and its matching sequence later in the movie is a chaotic mess where you have no clue really of what's going on. There's not too much logic about any of it!I love Fassbender, McAvoy and Stewart but oh man, they need to get involved with better projects than this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and Its Bold Mission,"These are remarkable times for Marvel comic fans as film effects have enabled story and imagination to produce a visually stunning, realistic experience. With X Men: Days of Future Past, a strong team of writers and director Bryan Singer have created a highly entertaining quasi-sequel/prequel which reinvents the X Men world from all the previous versions. A logistical challenge from the get go, this film has accomplished the near impossible and approaches the excellence of The Avengers.In a bleak vision of the future, mutants are being hunted down along with any human sympathizers by enhanced, robotic Sentinel hunters. With the last vestiges of hope at a remote location, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr AKA Magneto (Ian McKellen) join forces in a last ditch effort to alter the timeline using Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) transferring powers to send Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to his body in the 1970s. His desperate mission is to convince the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to stop Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), from carrying out a vendetta against humans including a scientist named Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage), who holds the key to the Sentinel army. However, tracking Raven is problematic while the younger Charles has lost his purpose having withdrawn into seclusion, and a young, embittered Erik is locked away for a significant crime. How Wolverine can 'put the band back together' is just the beginning of a convoluted storyline that not only involves time travel but exposing old, emotional wounds and the fleeting hope of salvation from a doomed future.From the opening 20th Century Fox fanfare with its highlighted 'X', you know Singer has got his mojo back (after the misfire of Superman Returns). Having started the current Marvel era of filmmaking with X Men (2000), he knows these characters better than anyone, and the screenplay has a strong narrative with some genuinely funny lines. Like X Men: First Class, this film crisscrosses the globe from Vietnam to Paris to Washington D.C., and much of the early period parallels actual historic events and figures as in Watchmen.Fate and destiny: can history be altered and can people change? The film has such a complex plot you wonder if it will shortchange the emotional content. It doesn't. In fact, you could almost have made this a two part film and expanded the possibilities. By trying to link the old with the new into one cohesive plot was challenge enough, but by sprinkling in bits of references to the Marvel canon and providing a great ending, comic fans should be giddy and thrilled. You don't have to have seen every X Men film, but it helps to enrich the experience for fans of Marvel lore by connecting a lot of dots.Once again, the interplay between the younger Charles and Erik forms the core of a paradoxical love/hate relationship. First, Charles must find his way back from his self-imposed exile amid personal loss, and then it becomes a fascinating triangle of wills; Raven may be the target, but Erik and Charles struggle for her soul. Stewart lends authority (as the older Charles) as he narrates in grim tones the opening sequence which has parallels (as in the first X Men) to the Holocaust and human intolerance.The large cast shines especially McAvoy and Lawrence, who gets to speak in Vietnamese much as Fassbender espoused German in First Class. You wish there were more of Stewart and McKellen, who are so good together, and despite relegating some cast members (including Halle Berry as Storm) to brief cameos or short scenes, plenty of familiar faces reappear from previous films to lend an air of continuity, and you feel the casts of both past and present are adequately represented.New characters are introduced with cool powers particularly Evan Peters as Quicksilver, whose rapid speed proves instrumental in the film's standout sequence that ranks up there with X 2's opening White House assault by Nightcrawler. The special effects are that good. Just watching the final showdown where the mutants utilize all their unique powers to do battle with the Sentinels is a treat. Mystique's special morphing powers are on full display along with her acrobatic fighting style, and Magneto's powers are dead on as he literally raises RFK Stadium when the action shifts to DC and The White House.Ambitious and well executed, X Men: Days of Future Past reaches the heights of X 2 and successfully merges two different universes both past and present, resets the timelines and events in a massive reboot, and results in a cohesive, entertaining story with an expanded, marquee cast. By applying equal parts reverence and boldness with the X Men mythology, Singer and company have accomplished a nearly impossible juggling act. With visionary directors like Joss Whedon (whose The Avengers is the gold standard) and Singer, the Marvel brand is likely to be an exemplary force of film entertainment for many years to come.(Yes, stay until the end of the credits for a brief, elaborate setup for the next film!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The BEST of the X men series !!!,"This latest installment in the X men series is by the far the greatest and in my humble opinion the most entertaining superhero flick since the batman. DOFP although not a reboot, brings a breath of fresh air into the franchise and presents a film that everyone can enjoy, fan and non-fan alike.If you've seen the last 6 movies, you'll notice a drastic difference i.e compared to the previous titles this movie has a very dark tone but it fits well with the story and the alarming situation the characters are caught up in.DOFP lives up to the hype and then some;interestingly, its more about the story and less about the action (mind you it has enough to get anyone by).Jackman and James have great chemistry, the only let down for me personally was that the other characters had very small roles(enter Storm).Much to many peoples delight, this movie corrects some of the 'wrongs' seen in the previous films specifically 'The Last Stand'. I was wondering how they would go about it and Days of Future past couldn't have been a better way to retell those stories and let it fit perfectly within the time line of the X universe.This film is WORTH every penny and will lead you craving for more, the good news is 'X men Apocalypse' will soon be upon us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh what a sweet ride !!!,"Summer movies rarely get better than this just let me say that. The X- men series has been plagued by inconsistent changes from the comics that rarely even make it from film to film. Making any true continuity between each film very wishy washy at best. That being said I have enjoyed all of them despite sometimes taking liberties with the source material (X-Men The Last Stand). X-men The Last Stand by many hardcore comic followers is a big let down for the liberties it took and while I admit being disappointed with how they handled the Phoenix Saga I did find it overall very enjoyable. But I wont lie and say X-men Days Of Future Pasts had me very excited with its promise to go back and fix some of those liberties that were taken in The Last Stand. This is very much Xavier's story as it was in First Class, here we see a broken and unhappy Xavier who is dealing with the events of First Class. The dynamic between James McAvoy Aand Michael Fassbender is just awesome. Michael Fassbender brings so much intensity to his role as Magneto that he nearly steals every scene he's in. And of course we have probably Hugh Jackman's most human and caring portrayal of Wolverine ever seen on film. Jennifer Lawerence does a great job capturing the complexities of an angry and fed up Mystique who is very much essential to the story here. We get some amazing action scenes featuring the original cast in the future scenes and it all lends itself to the story very well. This is a dire situation that has come about and you certainly see quickly that something has to be done to fix it. Wolverine is an essential piece on the chess board in this film but it is truly Xavier who is the King. The movie fires right on every cylinder and delivers perhaps the best superhero movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises. We've had some great comic book movies since then but none of them were on this level. This isn't trying to be a comic book movie full of action its trying to be a story driven by comic book characters and the end result is one of the most satisfying chapters in the X-men Saga.. I can say when the movie ended the only emotion I felt was dread. Dread that I had to wait 2 more years to revisit this great characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Strong presentation of good story,"Plenty of action to go with this non-stop story. Most of it is not predictable. Things seem to go from bad to worse for the future of mutants.We are tempted to focus on James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, not to mention Hugh Jackman, but despite being fourth in the credits the center of the story is Jennifer Lawrence. She plays the pivot pin of the entire situation. Raven is a product of her past and Lawrence does a great job of showing her struggle to overcome it. Why is Lawrence fourth in the credits?I recently saw Logan and can't help but make comparisons. Both have action and destruction right and left, but this movie manages to do it without the gore and mutilation. Logan has little substance in the plot, but this movie delivers an engaging plot. In this movie we have good acting from most if not all of the majors, while in Logan, all the performances were mailed in. The reason I compare the two is because Logan has a IMDb rating of 8.2 and this one, as I write, an 8.0. This movie is so much better, in all aspects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disillusioned,"I actually loved most of the movie - Until the very end - they decided to erase x-men 1-3 + the wolverine movies in a single stroke and I feel robbed. The fact that Jean Grey is alive just because they managed to kill the centurions, just doesn't make sense - Her powers are to intense to live with and Erik is still full of hate, wanting to kill of the humans, so even without the centurions everything that happened in the first movies should still have happened. Right now we're thinking did Wolverine get his claws - seeing that Mystic pulled him out off the river??So all in all being a x-men hardcore fan - I'm thinking what the F*** ???",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
