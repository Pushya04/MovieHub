Not As Bad As People Say.,"Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Solid Film For a Comic Fan,"This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I enjoyed this movie,"And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable, but the weakest of the series","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spider-Man 3 is adequate, but adequate just isn't enough.","My feelings after watching the third film are somewhere in the neighborhood of satisfied, but that feeling is fairly disappointing. Satisfied more or less means adequate and to follow a sequel that I consider excellent with a film that's only adequate is a certainly a step down. Positively, Spider-Man 3 does reasonably well at maintaining a feeling similar to that of the first two films. I never felt like I wasn't seeing the same world or characters and that's important to me. Continuity in tone really helps hold a series together. The Matrix Reloaded never felt to me like I was witnessing the continuation of the story and world presented in the first installment. The scenery and characters felt like weak and dull recreations and that really bugged me. The New-York of Spider-Man 3 is about the same as before, as is Peter's apartment, The Daily Bugle offices, etc. Peter, Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May, etc. also carry over well and it's easy to jump back into their lives. Where it doesn't feel like its predecessors is in its pacing and scope. The film tries to tell a lot of story for one film, much more than either the previous installments. This makes it messy. If you took Spider-Man 1 and 2's stories, wove them together and compressed them into one 2 hour film, you'd have a mess pretty similar to Spider-Man 3. A lot of this has to do with poor exposition and the decision to include three villains. In good exposition, events lead to other events and it all seems to flow naturally. Some films end up feeling like a story wasn't really even written, but instead a series of well-crafted scenes that don't necessarily fit well together. A bunch of smaller scenes are then written to connect those scenes. These scenes can feel very forced because they often rely heavily on coincidence. The Matrix Reloaded is full of these contrived scenes and so is Spider-Man 3. They're frustrating because they act like speed bumps where the plot suddenly feels awkward and my enjoyment of the film drops. One scene sticks out particularly in Spider-Man 3 as too awkward. Venom, one of the super-villains, is swinging through alleyways when he is ambushed by the Sandman, another villain. Venom proposes they team to get Spider-Man together, Sandman agrees, end scene. This scene is needed to set up the final, huge battle of the film but just seems poorly worked in. For one it's very short, and two the characters don't know each other and have completely different motives for being villains. That the two would decide that quickly to become partners after coincidentally running into each other is just sloppy to watch.Despite how it seems, I didn't hate the film. I was just disappointed in its flow as a narrative and thought it aimed much higher than it should have in terms of what to include plot wise. Regardless though, many scenes were very enjoyable to watch and I don't just mean action scenes. The Daily Bugle scenes, as always, were great and funny. The addition of Topher Grace as Peter's photographer rival, Eddie Brock, was great casting. His line delivery works perfectly with his character's sleazy personality and his scenes with Peter are some of the best. The character Harry Osborne returns and becomes one of the film's three villains: a new Green Goblin that takes over where the Goblin of the first film left off. Harry and Peter's relationship is probably the most interesting part of the story. Their struggle between being friends and enemies makes for some tense moments. One of my favorite scenes in the film is a verbal confrontation in a diner between Peter and Harry. Playing off Peter's presumption that he and Harry are back on good terms, Harry orchestrates a bit of nasty drama that sticks a knife in Pete's love life. He has Peter meet him in a diner just to drive the knife in a little further. As Pete storms out, Harry is awash in sadistic joy with himself before making a fast and creepy exit. Harry is really the best handled villain of the film. Not only as the Green Goblin Jr. fighting Spider-Man in the sky much the way his father did, but as Harry, Peter's estranged friend, using their friendship as a pretty sharp weapon against him. The villain I could have done without was the Sandman. His character was interesting but his place in the film as a main character seemed unnecessary and forced. He's an escaped convict running from the police who accidentally falls into a big science experiment and becomes the Sandman. He is also apparently the actual killer of Peter's uncle Ben thus giving Peter motivation to go after him. This reworking of the first film's story seems very far fetched and unnecessary. The computer effects used to create Sandman are terrific as is the performance by Thomas Hayden-Church, but I think the film would have improved without him. More time could then have been given to the conflicts with Harry and Eddie and likewise Goblin and Venom. Venom is particularly nice because he's the only villain not the product of some crazy experiment gone wrong. His creation is almost entirely Peter's fault. Venom acts as a slimy toothy grinning anti-Spider-Man, who hates Spider-Man on a personal level after Eddie Brock loses his job and girlfriend and holds Peter responsible. Two villains definitely would've been enough for one film, especially two villains that feel wronged by Peter personally, not just Peter as Spider-Man. I don't really want them to continue this series, but since it seems like they may anyway, I hope some lesson is learned with number three that less really can be more. If the time that was spent awkwardly packing too many stories into one film was instead spent working on one good story so that it flowed naturally, Spider-Man 3 could have excelled the way number two did.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I'm so sorry, Spidey...","As I was walking down the stairs and out of the theater, I was trying as hard as I could to pull a smile out of my face. My friends tensely asked if I liked it, I said ""Yes, of course!!"" They nodded weakly in response. On the way home, I kept thinking to myself. ""You liked it! C'mon! It's Spiderman!"" Now, it's two days later, the euphoria of waiting for Spidey to come out has subsided, and I've begun to look at this flick a bit more (shall I say it?) critically.It's plain to see that Sam Raimi is a fantastic director. He knows when to do what and realizes that he is making a superhero movie, which is why the Spider-man movies have done so well. It's not like the recent Batman and Superman who try to hide the fact that they're just fun superhero films. Raimi knows his material and embraces it. The effects were astounding as usual. Spiderman's one-on-one fight with the Sandman and the crane scene being the major highlights. I thought these features would outbalance the weaker spots of the film, but unfortunately they did not.As far as acting goes, I'm surprised to say that Topher Grace stole the show. I remember how outraged everyone was when he was chosen, but obviously someone knew what they were doing when they let him on as Venom. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst played their usual selves (I can't help but think of Dunst dreaming of getting back to work with Sofia Coppola while doing these films). However, Tobey Maguire REALLY disappointed me. I've always thought he was so great at Spidey, which is undeniable in the first two films and even in this one...when he has his red suit on. Maguire is a one note actor, at least as far as Spidey goes. He just could not pull off the black suit; he wasn't good at being bad. Then came the horrific bridge scene with MJ. Along with most other people I've talked to, my entire theater erupted in laughter when he started crying. It was just...sad...and not in the way the writers intended it.Speaking of the writing, I hate to be beating a dead horse, but c'mon: 3 villains, Sandman's background, trouble with MJ, Harry's changing attitudes, 2 different Spidermans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, etc. It was just WAY TOO MUCH! Even if you had four hours, it's just too much to cram into the audience in one sitting. The great thing about Spiderman 2 (the best of the trilogy) is how focused it was. You had the inner struggle, the villain and his relationship with MJ. There it was! Beautifully filmed and written. From the first 15 minutes of Spiderman 3, I knew that all these parallel story lines were going to crash within the next two hours. The sequence that shows how far they've fallen from part two is the whole emo/hair in the eyes/eyeliner/oh so cool ""bad"" Spiderman scenes. The first few minutes of this was funny in the same way that the ""Raindrops are Falling on my Head"" scene in part two was great, but this time they stretched a good thing way too far. This whole sequence is what sticks in my mind and refuses to let me think that the film was just as great as the rest.I tried to like it! I really did! I just can't fool myself any longer. Some critics like Peter Travers for Rolling Stone are saying that we can let this one slide because it's Spiderman, but I couldn't disagree more. Spiderman 3 missed the mark and, deep down inside, we all know it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some great action sequences are lost in a film who's script tries to do too much and be all things to all people,"Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others.There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Big-Budget Special-Effects Extravaganza, Out Of Focus","""Spider-Man 3"" comes really close to being as difficult to follow as an ""X-Men"" movie. Well, maybe not that close since an ""X-Men"" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with ""Spider-Man 3"".I was most disappointed with the use, or misuse, of the Harry Osborne/Green Goblin character. We know that Harry must become the Green Goblin if he is going to have the ability to take on his super hero nemesis Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The makers of ""Spider-Man 3"" waste no time in picking up where ""Spider-Man 2"" left off. Not only does the movie not allow the viewer to observe Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin, but Harry doesn't even dress appropriately for his role. He wears a black uniform and never becomes the public menace his father did. I was looking forward to the Daily Bugle covers about the return of the menace of the Green Goblin. Instead Harry's campaign of revenge against Peter is quickly side tracked by a bout with amnesia after suffering a blow to the head in a fall during his first fight with Peter. After all, the film needs to introduce two more villains, Sandman and Venom, before it ends.Whereas, in the first two films the viewer really gets to know the Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius characters, in ""Spider-Man 3"" the length of time devoted to the villains amounts to a movie short. Along the way Peter Parker must also contend with his dark side and his troubles in his relationship with his love Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter, Ursula, is back to amuse viewers once again with her adolescent crush on Pete. Add to all this the time needed to develop the Sandman and Venom villains, plus Gwen Stacy, and I was left wondering exactly what the movie is about.""Spider-Man 3"" is big budget extravaganza that is out of focus in the areas of character and plot development. While it has its laugh inducing comic moments and the best special effects sequences money can buy, it has little else to offer. While I really wanted to see the first two movies again, because I enjoyed the transformation of the main characters into super heroes and villains, it feels like the only reason to see ""Spider-Man 3"" is to check out the special effects again. If there are more Spider-Man films made, and there is no reason to believe there won't be given the money involved in releasing another film, then I would hope that the makers would simplify the story once again and do what made the first two films so enjoyable to watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My favourite movie in this trilogy in terms of sheer enjoyment,"Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Let Down.,"There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
some good things but it never comes together,"Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fans!  - Don't let your expectations run away with you!  Sit back and enjoy!,"Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst of a great trilogy but that's not all bad,"I didn't care much for this movie after the first viewing. I thought it was hammed up and bloated with special effects that are hallmarks for most summer releases. However, after watching it a few more times the movie has grown on me to the point that I think this was, while not a great masterpiece, a very good film.Sure, there are plot holes and characters that aren't truly developed or fleshed out. Some scenes are down right ridiculous (the night time experiment that spawns Sandman). Yes, some of the CGI borders on cartoonish - the fight between Sandman and Spiderman in the subway comes to mind. And there are clichés, like the old damsel-in-distress scenarios that Mary Jane continually finds herself in. But this is a superhero flick and it's not supposed to be completely realistic. So like Steve Winwood says, just roll with it.What makes this movie rewatchable is the acting and the overall theme of forgiveness as it pertains to Peter Parker and Spiderman. Tobey Maguire, Thomas Haden Church, and of course J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson rise above the hokiness and give great performances. Even James Franco delivers - he just plays a great jerk. And Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited role as Aunt May and gives a high quality performance. Kirsten Dunst is the weak link again I don't know I just don't like her in these films.The final scene between Spiderman and Sandman was very touching and done so well. In the end, Peter learns how to truly forgive, an act that releases his heart from all of the pain he's been carrying around since his Uncle was murdered. Although I despised this final scene on the first viewing, thinking it was a little too tidy and contrived, I now realize that this was the culmination of the trilogy that finally rounds out who Spiderman truly is. The dark, vengeful corner of Peter's heart which the Symbiote latched onto was exposed and destroyed by the love he demonstrated after Sandman's confession. Peter saw what he would have become - Venom - if he did not confront his hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone. In all, one of the better superhero and summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could be so much better...,"This film had the hallmarkings of a great! After the first two films literally set the character scenes and the hopeful return of the goblin this film could have been fantastic!Sadly however by slipping in some terrible and cheesy dialogue, an over-abundance of new characters and then trying to take on one of the greatest characters from the comics and cartoons the film comes out with an average marking!Firstly I have to say I enjoyed this film, it was fun, the special effects were fantastic and the fight scenes therefore played out very well.This film did however destroyed any character building made by the previous two and results in a serious lack of cohesion to the other two and because of this cannot be placed within the same league.Sandmand and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and thats not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!Anyway, I appear to be ranting, I would recommend you watch this film, its fun, its got great action and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once.

When will Hollywood LEARN?!,"*** SPOILERS *** As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, I enjoyed this film. As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watching from the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's seconds from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography. If there is a SM4, let's hope for a less contrived and convoluted script.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

While it boasts some visually impressive moments and retains the charm of its predecessors, it's ultimately a film burdened by an overstuffed plot, uneven tone, and questionable character choices.The film introduces a trio of antagonists: Sandman, Venom, and the New Goblin (Harry Osborn). While Thomas Haden Church delivers a sympathetic portrayal of Sandman, the other villains feel underutilized. Venom, in particular, is a missed opportunity, reduced to a one-note, overly aggressive character.A central plot point involves Peter Parker coming into possession of a black alien symbiote, which transforms him into a cocky, arrogant version of Spider-Man. This drastic character shift feels jarring and inconsistent with the established character. The dance sequence, while memorable for its absurdity, ultimately detracts from the film's overall tone.The romantic tension between Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry Osborn becomes increasingly convoluted. The introduction of a rival photographer, Eddie Brock, adds unnecessary complexity to the love triangle.The film's climax is chaotic and underwhelming. While there are visually impressive moments, the resolution of the various plot threads feels rushed and unsatisfying. The final confrontation with Sandman is particularly underwhelming, given the character's tragic backstory.Despite its flaws, Spider-Man 3 isn't without its redeeming qualities. The visual effects are impressive, particularly the Sandman and Venom designs. The film also features some memorable action sequences, and there are moments of genuine humor and emotion.Spider-Man 3 is a disappointing conclusion to the original trilogy. Spider-Man 3 had the potential to be a powerful exploration of the dark side of heroism. Unfortunately, it's bogged down by excessive plot points, inconsistent character development, and a rushed climax. While the film boasts some visually striking sequences, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise of its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bully Maguire,"The character arc of Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) becoming Bully Maguire is just unreal. My favorite part was when Spidey-Man says to Harry ""Look at little Goblin Jr., gonna cry?"" now that got me. I love how this movie expands on Peter's ""bully"" persona by just raising the meanness of what he says like when he sees that Eddie Brock forged a photo to make Spider-Man look bad and Pete says ""I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye."". And that only leads to him telling Brock he's trash and getting the idiotic fool fired from The Daily Bugle. And if you don't know what I mean when I talk about how the bully aspect of Peter shines more in this one, well in the first two he does things that Bully Maguire would do. For example in the first one where he says ""I missed the part where that's my problem."" and in the second where he gulfs down half a hot dog after seeing ambulance and police cars go by. But in the third installment he just goes all out and I love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not good as the first two, but still great!","My opinion is unpopular, but hear me out. The story is my least favorite out of the three but it's still good considering Sam Raimi was forced to add a storyline he didn't want to. The only villain was supposed to be Sandman but he was forced to add Venom. If you ask me, the Venom storyline is just as good as the Sandman side of the story. It also has more stakes than the first two. It's still as attracting as the first two. It also keeps its responsibility theme. The acting is still great considering the dialogue and certain scenes (the fans know what I'm talking about) can be pretty corny. The cinematography is really similar to the 2nd movie while both of them are very different from the 1st. The editing and pacing is similar to the 2nd even though some scenes just shouldn't be in there at all. The effects are still great! And it's sound, especially for Venoms screeching is awesome. And of course... it keeps the amazing and iconic score. While I wouldn't say it's one of a kind like the first two, Sam still did an amazing job after what he was given. 9.0/10!

It could have been better....,"I've just seen it, and I have to say that it's very entertaining, and it seems to me that although it's very good, it could have been better, but then again so could a lot of other good films. As soon as it came out the comic book nerds started whining about how Sam Raimi did something wrong and whatnot. The truth is that someone will always find something wrong or different from the comics, and it could have been... but it isn't!! So stop whining and enjoy it.It's very good (gave it 8/10), filled with cgi and fast-paced action, along with a decent script and dialogue. Maybe not as good as the first two, it has weak spots like several plot holes and insufficient character development. Casting was great, with Thomas Haden Church as Sandman and Topher Grace as Venom, along with the original cast. The acting was great, sometimes awkward, a great cameo from Bruce Campbell, and a great job from Raimi. It's what someone should expect from a summer blockbuster, and even more, something to expect from a Spider-Man like movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely a Surprise Disappointment,"Alright, I will admit that seeing it in IMAX at midnight was definitely worth the $16 I paid for it because the CGI and fight scenes were just amazing. So I guess this movie is worth seeing once on the big screen. But I am not going to buy it.Why? Because Spider-Man 2 was an amazing film and although it had those random cheesy scenes of slow-motion and stuff, it still was amazing and had wonderful plot and Alfred Molina really brought some depth to his character. But in the end, Spider-Man 3 lacks those qualities. It lacks strong plot that really brings this movie together cohesively. Instead, the film is really just a mess of stuff happening. It was overkill in every region of the film: too many characters, too many villains, too many dramatic shifts, too many unexplained scenes that didn't fit into what was going on, and by far, too much weird creepy stuff.What I mean is that Tobey Maguire's character is supposed to be influenced by the symbiote like it influences Brock to become Venom, but in the end, Tobey Maguire can't play evil or bad so much as just creepy. And although the film really seemed to be going for realistic unlike the first two (less campy comic stuff and more dramatic feeling), it still ended up with the one sequence in the middle of the film which was just UNNECESSARY!!!! You will know what it is when you see it.Furthermore, as far as the acting goes, Tobey Maguire didn't do much for me. He seemed to finally show the fact that he really just wasn't right for the role in the end. Surely he fills the costume out right, but when he's walking around as Peter Parker, he really doesn't fit the role. In this film, James Franco is truly the scene-stealer and best actor of the film! They finally gave him screen time as he is in it quite a bit. I loved him and he definitely made the movie worthwhile in the end. Kirsten Dunst also surprised by playing MJ as a much more mature MJ and less like a damsel in distress all the time. She really did a good job. And she sings, and she actually sings well!!! It was a shock, I thought it was someone else but you can tell that it's her voice! It's a total shock! And also, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman was a very good choice, but unfortunately he just totally was not given enough screen time. Again, too many villains to focus on so Sandman and Eddie Brock as Venom become little more than appearances for the ending battle. Venom was done well and Topher Grace really did a good job, but again, lack of screen time. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard appears for about ten minutes and does a decent job with what little she was given. Unfortunately, although I think she's going to be an amazing actress in the future, her role in this film made me angry because all it did was make Spider-Man/Peter Parker very unlikable.All in all, this film lacks direction and story and is just a webbing of random connected scenes and events and ideas that were thrown together. Extreme deviation from the comics is present in this film and I think the deviation is definitely bad because it makes the film too predictable and too sentimental and gooey. Oh, and this is perhaps the most pro-United States propaganda film I have seen in recent years! Beware the scene when Spider-Man is seen in front of a giant American flag: you will laugh your butt off it is so obnoxious.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thought it was great,"Let me start by saying I see some reasons why fan boys are upset, and some of the issues people had problems with. Yes, it packed a ton of things into it, but it made it feel more like an event. I have read comics in my life, mainly Spider-Man and Batman comics... I'm familiar with the original comics origin story of Venom and all of these characters before they hit movie screens, but I still can't understand some of the hatred and criticism that the film got. There are issues, which I'll list below, but the film has a strong emotional core with its characters that shines through here.The dramatic elements, according to many reviewers and critics are done poorly here, but that's not the case. It's easy to feel the hurt Peter feels when MJ has to break some horrible news to him, you see his anger when he realizes Marko's connection to his murdered uncle, Ben, and the roller coaster that is Harry throughout the film even lets you sympathize with his position because you see, for the first time since the first film and done even better here, a more ""innocent"" side to Harry, though it doesn't last long.Also, I did read plenty of online reviews prior to viewing and many of them gave me the feeling that the only way Peter's anger and 'dark side' is shown is through a dance number in a jazz club, which is not the case at all. You see Peter going overboard and saying and doing hurtful things all throughout the mid-section of the film, causing problems for himself and other characters and fully descending deeper and deeper into his own vengeance and anger. A lot of this part of the film is lightened with comedic elements, which is true. There is indeed a dance number, but there's a point to it and plays into a more emotionally charged scene later on. If you've read anything about tonal shifts or the film being called a ""mess"", I'd say don't believe it. It's done with class and maturity to make it a bit more fun, yet it doesn't take away from the more emotional and mature scenes that come prior and afterward.Of the fight scenes, all were done well. Sandman's scenes throughout are usually the most beautiful and interesting, while Venom is done quite well too. One thing I did sorely miss was the use of the plural speech from Venom. A ""We're not Brock... we are Venom!"" line might have been nice. Its a minor grievance though, and all of the action scenes are done quite well, specifically the first and last.The film is flawed, yes, but it's also quite fun. This is a small list of issues that are present throughout the film that are result of mostly lazy scriptwriting/storytelling, but didn't ruin the movie, at least for me.Issues: - Harry's Amnesia: Amnesia always feels like lazy writing, in almost every case (except maybe Memento). In this case, it's fairly weak but its forgivable as it allows you to see a side of Harry that hasn't been seen in a long while. It opens him up to more feelings and truly allows for sympathy when things go bad for him, and particularly the end. So, to me, it was quite forgivable as I saw why they used it.Suit's Introduction: Yeah, the odds of the meteor crashing right next to Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man are quite slim. The comic origin is out, of course, but perhaps tying Jameson's astronaut son from the second film by having his ship be attacked by the suit and need rescue from Spidey would have been a better way to incorporate the suit... it would have allowed for another action sequence, tie in MJ's ex-boyfriend and tied the symbiote in a little more neatly. However, perhaps such a sequence would put the budget or time limit too high.Butler: He mostly kept his mouth shut through the first two films, but in this one he delivers an important message to one of the characters that changes the course of the film. It's slightly forgivable because he's given a more humanized part in this film, but it's still a display of some lazy writing.Aside from those issues, I disagreed with many of the other critiques that I've read. I don't find the comic aspects disheartening, they were done well, but from the reviews I thought it would be light on the serious and dramatic content of the films, ie, I wouldn't be emotionally invested in the characters this time around. That turned out to be false though, at least it was for me. The special effects were great, the action was great, the acting was great... but what really holds this film and makes it all feel worth it is the emotional attachment to its characters and the way it builds your feelings for them. All of these characters are flawed, some very seriously, but you care about what happens to them all and brings the first two films full-circle in terms of pretty much everything. It wraps up what's been done in the previous two and does some of those things even better.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated,"My favourite of the three Tobey Maguire Spider Man movies. More character depth than the other two, more complexity in the plot.

Very little to say which makes me wonder...,"Firstly, i was really wondering whether to give Spider-Man 3 a 6 or a 7 out of 10, and then i realised that i couldn't really remember much about it so came to the conclusion it couldn't have been that worthy of the 7! I went to see this and was looking forward to it mainly because it was the first BIG movie of the year, excluding the few reasonably big earners that emerged! Unfortunately, this film really is a let down, especially if you were to be a huge fan or really enjoyed the first two films! The major problems were the storyline, the feeble attempt at trying to include comedy in it, and to be honest, the acting isn't that great! I also think they tried to put too much into it instead of making it more of a classic superhero film! I don't really think there was enough action in the film and therefore it didn't use the characters to their full potential, especially Sandman! Wasted in my opinion because they could have done so much more! The big budget obviously still allowed them to make the film look good with the special effects, but unfortunately the visual was actually the best bit about the black suit and the whole 'good Spidey vs. evil Spidey'! Now, this does sound like a bad review but all it is really is meaning to say that they had so much they could have done, and they just didn't hit the mark! But hey, it's made a shed-load in the box-office already so... !!

disappointing,"I've always been a Spider-man fan.. I got the comics when I was a kid (sold then later (bangs head against the wall)) and I've seen and bought the previous two movies. But after seeing this for the first time, my first impression is that I am not going to buy this one.There is the obvious criticism about the black suit, of course, and how Peter gets it (don't worry, won't spoil it for you), but that's a detail, really, as the way he got it in the comics would take not just an entire movie, but a whole range of characters we haven't seen on screen before, so there is no way they could make that work. The solution they chose is fine, albeit somewhat unimaginative.I've wondered why I felt disappointed when I left the theater. Part of my disappointment lies in the fact that apparently for Spider-man 3, better had to mean: more. More action, more enemies, more Bang. And I disagree with that. So much is dealt with in this episode, that nothing gets much depth. Or rather: it doesn't come together as a movie. There's no glue, and when the dust settles in the end, we're not left with much.Another issue was credibility. At several points during the movie I shook my head in disbelief and asked myself: why does this happen? What's the motivation, the reasoning behind it? That question applied to the actions of at least 4 characters. Getting from A to B in a movie can be necessary, but do take some care as to how you pull it off! I'll go see it again, see if perhaps I'm just having a bad day. I mean: there's some good stuff in there as well, and the scene in the jazz club is awesome. There's enough for me to tell you you should probably go see this if you're a Spidey fan, but I didn't feel the spark.For now: 6 out of 10 - I'm disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great! But Not In Comparison To It's Predecessors,"Easily the worst of the original trilogy, Spider-Man 3 is still a very enjoyable film!Whereas in the previous two the casting was faultless, the third not so much. Haden does make an excellent Marko/Sandman and plays his role well, but others do not. Grace isn't the most intimidating actor they could have gone for for Venom, making a very evil character a bit limp. Even the previously great Franco is transformed into something disappointing. Not only did they bypass Hobgoblin for the 'New Goblin', but giving him a snowboard glider (etc.) just showed that they were trying way too hard to make him cool. Howard as Gwen Stacy isn't too inspiring either, thankfully Simmons as Jameson is continued brilliance.It is ambitious in the introduction of three villains, perhaps only faulted by none of them particularly interlinking. Scenes do jump about a lot as each arc is continued. The Sandman arc is great though, and perfectly supported by the soundtrack. However Venom is not given nearly enough time, but that's probably a good thing, as it looks and sounds terrible.In comparison to the previous two Spider-Man installments, there seemed to be a backwards step in CGI action. Plus camera shots at times were poor, the type of things that take you out from the story.Known more for the subsequent memes than iconic scenes, badboy Peter Parker will always be infamous but utterly enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gives You Your Money's Worth Of Entertainment,"I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining.Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying.For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best of the bunch,"I'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman franchise but I have to say, this is the best of the bunch so far. Story - as always - is complex with not one but 3 villains to contend with but (unlike the last batch of Star Wars) you can actually follow the story. And that's saying something.Least interesting parts of the movie were the (very obviously) digitial flying/fighting scenes. It's a bit sad that with all the hundreds of millions thrown at the screen that it still looks fake. In its own way original Superman's effects were just as good - Just a different kind of fake. Digital extras stand out like a sore thumb.Best thing in this movie is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman. Best supervillian performance in a while. Credible, fearsome and very moving. Tobey Maguire also stretches some acting muscle, playing a bad guy and a psychotic '77 John Travolta. There's are some genuinely funny scenes. Didn't even recognise Bryce Dallas Howard.

Action packed and entertaining...but still has problems,"Spider-Man 3 has been the most anticipated film of the last 3 years without a doubt. Unfortunately, it is one of those 'hate it or love it' movies. The story is very complex, but the incredible visuals (including all the actors being very good looking) make up for it...a little bit. All in all, Spider-Man 3 might disappoint some, but there are those who will have a great time. Don't go in with high expectations...just sit back and enjoy the ride.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) appears to have finally found balance in his life. He is in love with the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and all of New York loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. Despite this beautiful scenario, trouble lurks ahead. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the man actually responsible for Uncle Ben's death, has escaped from prison and genetically combined with sand particles, and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is plotting his revenge against Peter/Spidey for the murder of his father. To make matters worse, Peter and MJ's relationship is threatened by other people (including Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy), and there is a competing photographer at the Daily Bugle named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a young man with a venomous future ahead of him because of an alien symbiote that has landed on Earth, eventually taking over Peter's suit and changing him as a person...confusing, ain't it?As always, Spider-Man 3 is very well casted. I'll start off with our returning 3 stars, Maguire, Dunst, and Franco. Maguire needed to show even more acting muscle this time around, as Peter changes drastically throughout the movie. He pulls it off well, and some scenes are so different from the Peter we know to the point of extreme laughter. Aside from that, Maguire captures the often changing personality of Peter with ease, and gives a great performance. Kirsten Dunst gives her best performance as MJ, but she still isn't really that likable, which is a shame because MJ is supposed to be a character the audience loves just like Spider-Man. She has her moments, however. James Franco is extremely likable in the film, even though he is a villainous character. You'll identify more with Harry than you will with Peter, and I'm not the only one who liked him more than Peter. Franco's performance is layered and unpredictable (except the end), very similar to Willem Dafoe in Spider-Man 1. Thomas Haden Church is also likable, and he hopes people like him because he must've worked out for a century to transform from a scrawny middle aged man to a very cut and muscular man. He transforms into the Sandman, a villain that isn't really popular, but his inclusion really allows for some phenomenal effects that will blow you away. I'm sure filming that part was a pain. My favorite performance of the film was Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, and eventually Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, Venom. Grace is sickeningly sarcastic in the character, and when he does become Venom, will be scary. He gets some of the best lines in the whole film. Grace nailed the role when so many people doubted him, and I'm really happy with the way he played Venom. Definitely one of the most unforgettable bad guys of recent memory. Bryce Dallas Howard is also likable in limited screen time (maybe it's because she's absolutely beautiful). Dylan Baker has a slightly increased role as Dr. Connors, and his involvement in this film (you'll get this next statement when you see the movie) leaves a small window of chance for another Spider-Man movie, because of the material that he keeps.The visuals are breathtaking, especially the climactic fight sequence, which incorporates almost all the main characters. The two main villains of the film are computer generated, and that is incredible because they really don't look like it. Venom especially. The detail added to each scene is remarkable. It's amazing what a flip or web shoot every now and then will do to improve your action sequences. The action is by far the strongest point of the film. The weakest is the writing. The brothers Raimi crammed way too much into this film. 3 villains plus all the inner turmoil Peter suffers is too much to keep track of in one 2 and a half hour film. That is another fault. The movie is way too long. It focuses too much on Peter and not Spider-Man, making it have moments where it'll seem like a chick flick because of all the relationship drama. Sam Raimi forgot to make a movie about a superhero. Instead we've got a movie about a guy who happens to be a superhero. I enjoyed all the acting and action, but the story was way too rushed and should have been spread over two movies. While Thomas Haden Church was good, the movie could have been made without the entire Sandman storyline. They could have left the Uncle Ben subplot alone, and given all that time (Sandman has by far the most screen time of any of the baddies) to the wonderful Topher Grace and Venom. It was really disappointing to see Venom go to waste like that. Because this route was taken, the stories behind Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock are chopped and sadly nonexistent. Brock was turned from one of the most developed, dark, and three dimensional characters into a two dimensional sadistic crazy man with little motive, and the writers should be ashamed. That's Carnage, not Venom. Venom has very little screen time, and in my mind should have had his own movie to fight Spider-Man...after all, he is Spider-Man's worst enemy.Spider-Man 3 is a good film. It's definitely up there with the better comic movies, but it didn't reach my expectations. Due to some strong violence and the scary Venom, Spider-Man 3 probably isn't appropriate for kids 11 and under.7/10 --spy",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very Disappointing,"'Spiderman' was clearly conceived from the beginning as a story about Peter, Mary Jane and Harry. Whether you want to see it as a love triangle, or a retelling of ancient mythologies concerning revenge, betrayal and the ghosts of father figures, these three characters were introduced in the first movie's opening scenes, and it their dynamic that has driven the narrative ever sinceuntil now.While 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as it should have been and fails to satisfy for the simple reason that Sam Raimi forgot what these movies were about. For the first movie, Raimi had the writing talents of David Koepp, one of the most successful screenwriters around. For the sequel, Pulitzer Prize winning Michael Chabon contributed to a screenplay written by the Oscar-winning Alvin Sargent. For the third installment, Raimi makes the all too common mistake of developing delusions of grandeur and feeling that he can take over the writing duties himself. Though Sargent is credited as a co-writer, it's clear from the mess of a screenplay that his input was limited. Raimi's screenplay forgets everything that the two previous movies stood for and were clearly moving towards, and abandon all dramatic consistency and cohesive storytelling in favor of redundant characters supplying equally redundant CGI set-pieces.'Spiderman 3' feels as though it was made by different people with a different vision. The emotional drama between Peter and Mary Jane, so carefully built over the last few years, becomes illogical soap opera theatrics. Harry becomes a leering painter of Impressionist masterpieces. Peter starts crying all the time and develops a 'Saturday Night Fever' obsession. Sandman is completely redundant, receiving no character development and vanishing as inexplicably as he arrived. Similarly, Eddie Brock serves absolutely no purpose in the movie other than to become Venom in the final scenes. Very little of New York or its citizens are involved in the story, which is claustrophobically self contained  there are barely two scenes in the newsroom and the citizens of New York rarely seem to be in real peril.Again, it needs saying that 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad film, but it does nothing to close out the trilogy or provide anything close to satisfying emotional or dramatic closure, the fault for which can only be laid, unfortunately, on Sam Raimi.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very good, worth the wait...","I have just come back from a preview of this film and can inform everyone that it is rather good. OK I'm going to mention the plot as little as possible for fear of any spoilers but I will presume that people have seen the trailer.This is a bold third instalment by Raimi in so much that it really does not rely on any key action scenes or set pieces to maintain interest. Indeed like the first two the film is very much character driven, but importantly a much darker and essentially more fun side of Spidey is seen here, which reminded me of aspects of Superman 3.All three of the bad guys are excellent particularly Thomas Hayden Church as the Sandman. Compared to the previous films the baddies occupy much less screen time particularly Venom, which I imagine people will miss, indeed Peter Parkers psyche is much more under scrutiny than before.Stan Lee has a nice little cameo, and Bruce Campbell has a scene stealing turn as an hilarious Maitre D, which unfortunately ends too soon. The CGI barring a couple of odd moments is generally excellent and like every Hollywood film these days at least 15 minutes could be cut off this. Slight catty comment here, but Kirsten Dunst really was not looking particularly good in the second half of this film, presumably this was deliberate maybe to subvert the expectations of the babe girlfriend, which in itself was a nice change.It would be nice for the series to go out on a high, but I see Spiderman 4 has already been announced, but to be honest I'm not really sure where else the series can go and keep its high standard.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too many villains Too many story lines,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally getting good press for Spider-man. However Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)'s life is spiraling after a bad review gets her fired from her Broadway show. A new lady Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes into Peter's life. She's his fellow student and gets rescued by Spider-man. Harry Osborn (James Franco) still wants revenge as The New Goblin. Love complications abound for Peter when MJ gets jealous and Harry loses his memory then regains it back, only to blackmail MJ.There is more. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict. When he gets caught in a experimental machine, he's transformed into the Sandman. Later Peter finds out that Flint is Uncle Ben's true killer. Also a black substance from a fallen meteor attach to Spider-man forming a symbiotic relationship. Spider-man becomes dark in more ways than just the color. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Gwen's boyfriend and a competitor for Peter's job as photographer. He's a little weasel. When Peter rips off the symbiont, it attach itself to Eddie Brock and he becomes Venom.There are just too many villains, and too much story. Director Sam Raimi struggles to squeeze everything in. It's hard to lay all the blame on Raimi, but he has to take on his share. It still has its entertaining moments. There is good action, and the new villains look great visually. Let's face it. When the villain gets amnesia then switches back and that's a side story, this thing is overstuffed. Also the tone of the movie is problematic. Bruce Campbell and J.K. Simmons are making childish campy fun. Tobey Maguire looks silly desperate to be believable as dark. That part is cringe-worthy. Topher Grace also overdoes his weasel character. Too many times, the movie goes into silly territories. The best thing in the movie is the theme of forgiveness. Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and even MJ have to find their better angels as they escape their individual darkness. At least, all the stories have that connective tissue.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Was a good film,"When I first got in the cinema I was expecting something truly amazing and to be honest at first i was a little disappointed because I felt that everything was happening too quickly, but then by the middle of the film everything seemed to fall into place and i began to really enjoy it.The bit when we see Peter as a different person when he has the new suit was absolutely hilarious in my opinion and made the film worth watching for that bit alone.For anyone who had any queries about having another goblin in the films, then let me reassure you, Harry was like a whole new character when he was in the suit and when he wasn't. He also surpassed the first Green Goblin in my opinion. James Franco really stepped up his game again for this film and to me he was the best actor involved.Venom was brilliant to watch although he did only have a short time on screen, however i'm not sure we've seen the last of him (and I was one of the people saying he wouldn't be back). Sandman was just as good as I was hoping and overall it was a fun film to watch.If you didn't like the first two then I doubt that you'll like this one but if you did then you'll love it because it holds all of the same characteristics that we have come to expect from a Spider-Man film.Most of the plots were closed by the end of the film and I will say this last thing. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face, really glad that I watched it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If it makes you happy...,"""Spider-Man 3"" has more or less the same strengths and weaknesses as the first two entries in the franchise. The CGI is quite good (although not perfect), the action sequences move at a breakneck speed and the villains are charismatic. At the same time there are unbearable lengths with sappy dialog (and no, this movie didn't have to be over two hours long!) and some really crappy acting.As much as Tobey Maguire seemed like an interesting pick for Spidey/Peter Parker at first, his performance in this one really makes you wish someone else had gotten the part in the first place. When he plays bad-boy Parker at some point in ""Spider-Man 3"" it's totally unbelievable and annoying. It's not solely his fault, though. That whole scene is completely exaggerated.The character developpment is a mess at times. Characters swith from good to evil to sick to good again without any logic, just so at the end the right characters can be killed or die a heroic death that also rids them of any guilt they had brought upon themselves earlier on.Among the whole big name-cast, the special effects and the spectacular action sequences, the hidden highlight is once again Bruce Campbell, who has a ""Fawlty Towers""-esquire little cameo here.The main flaw for fans is probably that Venom, the one villain they waited for the most, doesn't get enough screen time and yes, it's true that the main villain, Sandman, just isn't very interesting. It would have been a good idea not to cram so many different story lines into this sequel, but to concentrate on one of them and flesh it out carefully.As it is ""Spider-Man 3"" is certainly no improvement over its predecessors but it's still quite entertaining. It would be a good idea if Raimi ended it right here on a relatively high note.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man takes a Venomous turn!,"First of all, this was a very entertaining movie. Not without its problems but surely this is quite definitely the popcorn entertainment movie of the year. Upon immediate completion of the movie I was torn because I was aware that what I had just watched was indeed a great entertainment movie but I was ever so slightly disappointed because of the inevitable comparison to the second movie of the series which remains the best of the bunch by far.First lets start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is quite clearly having fun with the character this time around. He gets to delve a little more with Peter Parker's negative sides. We see a more confident (bordering on complacent) Peter Parker and Maguire suits this change in the character. Maguire gives great credibility to the character despite some very foul overacting when Peter turns 'bad'. However, Maguire still looks and sounds incredibly like Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst does a rehash of the character from the first two movies. J.K. Simmons is as always hilarious and all the scenes with him are loaded with charm and humor and he truly steals every scene he is in. James Franco returns as Harry Osborn and this movie is truly his swan-song. He produces the greatest acting I have seen from him yet and he makes his character truly interesting to watch and his personal enigmas are at the very least as interesting as Parker's. Thomas Haden Church is one of the new additions to the cast. He is Sandman a lowly thug who by mere chance gets powers that make him almost unbeatable. Unfortunately he doesn't get that much character to work with and Sandman becomes just a reason to show off some admittedly awesome special effects. He only shows his talent by the very end of the movie (you'll know when you see it). Topher Grace gets the honor of playing the arguably most beloved villain in the entire Marvel universe, Venom and surprisingly he's very good. I was a little worried when I heard he had been hired to play Venom because of his history of comedic parts but he turns out to have dramatic flair as well. I have to admire Sam Raimi's guts for hiring such a new name for the part. Grace works hard and it shows. Eddie Brock Jr. becomes a very likable character and that is almost to his credit alone.Story wise the film is solid if a bit uneven. The pace is like in the previous movies well structured and there are very few slow points. The films primary strength is the central conflict with Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn because this part is very well told and filled with tension and emotion. The dialog is like in the previous movies not always completely believable but that hardly matters taking the source material into consideration. The new characters are introduced well enough if a bit hastily and this is the films primary flaw. There are simply too many characters to keep track of and unfortunately this means we do not get nearly as much of Venom and Sandman as we should have. And since we are on the subject of villains I should say that Venom is every bit as menacing as he should be. He proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man and that is the way it was in the comics so kudos to Mr. Raimi for that. However, my primary grudge with the entire movie is that Venom simply isn't enough in it. Had it been up to me I would have split the movie in two. By that we would have gotten more screen time for Sandman who would then have become a much better villain. Also it would have given us the opportunity to get Venom as a primary villain in a possible fourth movie.Effects wise the movie is of course breath taking. We see some of the most spectacular action sequences ever committed to celluloid and taking the film's budget into account that is hardly surprising. The action and effects in the previous movies were spectacular but in this one they go completely over the top and I for one enjoy this development. It somehow brings the movie closer to the source material and I have always claimed that this is what the series needed to do to attract the hard core fans. The end sequence is simply stunning and indeed a very worthy finale. Comparing the effects to the other big summer movie event, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, I would say that Spider-Man comes out on top as the effects are nothing short of groundbreaking.Christopher Young was chosen to compose a score instead of Danny Elfman after Elfman and Sam Raimi had a falling out at some point while making the score for the second film and while he did produce a decent score it is by no means memorable like the scores from the previous movies. However, credit must be given where credit is due for Danny Elfman casts quite a shadow and the score is adequately bombastic and grand for a super hero movie of this kind of scale.Spider-Man 3 is a great summer movie but try not to judge it by the standards set by the second movie because it does not add up. All in all, however, Spider-Man 3 is a fantastic movie loaded with special effects and a good story. I know that the Spider-Man movies have generated a lot of money and there will in all probability be a fourth Spider-Man movie and I for one welcome the prospect because I believe that there are a lot more stories from the Spider-Man universe that deserves a chance to be seen on the big screen. I do hope, however, that in the fourth movie they try to simplify the story somewhat.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast paced tale of a super hero,"I heard this film is good, and it certainly impressed me! The special effects are amazing. The action scenes are so fast paced that it is sometimes hard to keep track of everything that is happening. The scenes are so well made that everything looks completely real. I particularly like how the sand moves to create the sandman. Every detail is portrayed in the film! The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching! I really liked the ending. I think the final scene could have been cut away for better pacing, but maybe for some it is necessary.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An enjoyable film with many flaws!,"Spider-Man 3 was enjoyable but out of the 3 this is the least best. Now I would say this movie had the best visuals, special effects, perfect action scenes, and directing.Another good part was the cast Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst do great work playing Peter and MJ, Topher Grace does a good job playing Brock but not Venom, James Franco does the best playing Harry in this one, the best character in this movie was Thomas Haden Church as Sandman playing the character that got the most character Development, J. K Simmons is the funniest in every scene he is in!What makes this movie kinda bad is that there is to many villains that all their character Development are rushed and Venom was very underused in this movie and that sucks.Overall enjoyable film with some many flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'm gonna put some dirt in this movies eye...,"Ok, not really, but I will 100% say that of ALL of the Spider-Man movies, at least the Sam Raimi Trilogy, this one is my least favorite. It's unfortunate to say because I see what Raimi was trying to accomplish. Peter Parker is put into a position where he's become egotistical, and overconfident in himself. And that's affecting his relationship with his friends, his love life, and his superhero life.The BIGGEST weakness of this movie is that there are too many story lines, and because of that, the overarching theme and message of this movie is messy. The Harry Goblin storyline was under baked, the Sandman storyline was under baked, and the Venom Symbiote storyline was wasted potential. (Don't get me started on Emo Peter. I hate you internet memes...) If Sony didn't interfere, the movie would have faired so much better. If you lost one story line of the movie, it would have faired better.Still though, it's entertaining, it's has fun action scenes, and it still has the heart of a Spider-Man movie. I can still watch it, and have fun with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overhated,"Spider-Man 3 is easily the weakest of the Raimi trilogy, but nothing about that superlative means it's a bad film.

"Not the best, but good","The final part of the trilogy about the adventures of Spider-Man turned out to be much weaker than the first two parts. In this part, the writers and director tried to pay attention to the inner, dark world of Peter Parker and at the same time made a huge number of enemies, so that the plot threads got mixed up and it was not possible to show the potential of the characters in full. But first things first:The first is the hero. Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, is having a good time, his girlfriend is performing on Broadway, and city officials are giving him the key to the city. Everything is fine, criminals are even afraid to go outside. And the hero has no doubt whether he should be an ordinary man or a super hero, he can combine everything.Secondly, the villains. As mentioned above, there were too many of them. It is clear that Harry Osborn has not gone anywhere and his revenge has not cooled either, this is the strongest aspect of the plot, the theme of friendship and hatred, the director and screenwriters did not miss it and presented it as it should. Venom is the best villain in the history of Spider-Man. But the screen time of the main villain is too limited. Flint Marco is an escaped prisoner who killed Uncle Ben, this character is not that superfluous, he is connected with the plot, he was not poorly included, they made his story well, but there was already too many plotlines going on at once.Third is the film itself. Spider-Man 3 is a good film, but there are just too many storylines, too many events and characters, all of this is very difficult to comprehend, and especially to convey in two hours of screen time. From the point of view of pure entertainment, there are no complaints, as before, this is a well-made movie, with a lot of beautiful special effects. Still, it's a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sam Raimi has done it AGAIN!!,"First of all I would like to say ""What the hell was Sam Raimi THINKING, when he directed this movie?!"" The fact that this sequel is by far the worst of the Spider-Man trilogy is stated as an actual FACT. Just when I thought that there couldn't be more drama in the Spider-Man trilogy Sam Raimi proves me wrong! Sam forget the drama lessons you've learned at directors school, and focus on telling the story of Spider-Man properly. Watch the 90s animated series, and read comic book or two. You had a great Marvel francise, which would have been a great movie trilogy. But you've messed it up with all this drama junk! As a Spidey fan! I've got to say quit while your down!!

Director has given a new form to Spider-Man in this movie but that doesn't quite fit up. But the villain in this movie is top notch.

Good but not as the previous ones,"""Spider-Man 3"" swings into action with a 7/10 rating, and I have to say, it was just okay. Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker remains solid, and the film editing keeps the story moving at a brisk pace, although it juggles multiple plotlines. The film's strength lies in its exploration of the consequences of power and vengeance, with the symbiote-infused Peter Parker providing an intriguing character arc. However, it falters with a somewhat cluttered narrative, too many villains, and occasional tonal shifts. The music adds to the film's emotional depth, and the cinematography captures the kinetic energy of Spidey's web-slinging with flair. ""Spider-Man 3"" may not reach the heights of its predecessors, but it's an okay installment that explores the dark side of heroism while providing moments of web-slinging excitement for fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely not a total misfire,"I'm so torn on whether this is good or not, and if so, how good it is.It pales in comparison to the excellent Spider-Man 2, and while it's sometimes on par with the first, I'd say in the end it's a slightly less satisfying film than that one, too.Still, it's not really ever boring, even at 139 minutes. Everything with J Jonah Jameson is gold (as expected), most of the action satisfies, Bruce Campbell's cameo here is hilarious, and the concept of Spider-Man becoming cocky and letting his ego run rampant is an interesting and compelling contrast to how down in the dumps Peter was in Spider-Man 2.Some setpieces don't fare super well though- namely the first action sequence, which easily has the weakest special effects of any scene in the film, and as such makes a bad first impression. As every reviewer will also tell you, there's too many villains, and while some of the infamous Emo Peter I'm sure is supposed to be funny, I feel like a lot of it crosses into unintentionally hilarious.It's a messy but far from worthless ending to Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.

2 is better but I have a soft spot for this one,"Alright so the beginning lowkey kinda sucked like I was not a fan of the first half of the movie I don't like how MJ & Peter feel out of character and what they were doing to their relationship like it just didn't feel right how they'd fight and everything went down, like I like Gwen as a character but her whole arc involvement in this movie was just not it personally although for once I actually really like what they did with Harry it feels like they actually made him a bro for Peter for once but then when he went back he didn't fully turn like his motivation and his actions made sense which I didn't feel the in the previous movies. The second half of the movie though I do really enjoy a lot like once bully Maguire appears that's when it actually gets good and I become a fan of this movie, part of it is nostalgia but I also think it's a bit of a guilty pleasure. Like I really enjoy the sandman and Eddie Brock fight and for once I actually enjoy Harry I have not enjoyed Harry throughout these movies so I enjoy what they did with him. So while in general 2 is a better movie i definitely have a soft spot for 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

11 years and I still enjoy this movie.,"As a kid, this would be my personal favorite Spider-Man movie. A decade has pass and now I'm start to see some people hating on this movie and it left me shock to see many people dislike it. I started to research to see why the movie was bad and I'll admit...it made some valid points. Too many villains in one movie, Eddie Brock and Venom, emo Peter, the writing, and probably more. I had to watch the trilogy again to understand it and I get the hate...and I still like the movie.To be honest, I think the memes from this movie just makes the movie more entertaining. What I like about the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is that each character has their own story.

The only good thing about this movie was Bruce Campbell,"I expected something silly, with a quality even lower then Spiderman 2, but it was worse. Tobey has nothing to do with Spiderman and the only thing that made this watchable was the comics and cartoons on the subject that made Spiderman more of an icon than a character. Thus armed I could ignore Tobey altogether and just focus on the story...The story is not completely stupid, but compared even with the plots in the cartoons, it just lacks. The moralizing aunt and the nice Russian landlord don't help either. A nice landlord... in New York.

They destroyed Spider Man completely,"While I really enjoyed Spider Man 2, I have never been so angry after watching Spider Man 3. They have completely destroyed it. The script is extremely weak. The actions are nowhere near expectations - in fact, I found myself growing impatient wondering when the next action scene would be. 90% of the time in this movie focused on the characters' emotions which failed to deliver anyway. I felt no sympathy, no emotion, just itchiness of wanting to leave the cinema. I walked into the cinema expecting actions and good fun, or at least a good strong script. I did not want to go in there to listen to tasteless words, to watch stretchy scenes (that were supposed to be meaningful but were oh so disappointing), or to witness a directing disaster such as of the scene where Spider Man danced in the Jazz Bar. It was HORRIBLY directed, just terrible! I could not bare the last 5 minutes of the movie. I just wanted it to end right away because I didn't want walk out on something I paid for. I guess everyone else felt the same because the minute the credits started to roll, EVERYBODY stood up at the same time like there was fire under everyone's bottom.We left the cinema feeling frustrated, cheated, misled by the trailer, and, we couldn't leave the cinema fast enough.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entangled,"Its not going to be another comment about how large complex projects have to be unimaginative for the simple reason of coordinating all the geographically dispersed teams working on bits that need to integrate. I've studied this in some detail in the film business. Its a mundane insight and I won't bore you with it.Let's just say that of all the superhero movies, this one has the most possibilities for giving us exciting dimensional vision. ""King Kong"" did it, and I saw some titillating motions in another WETA project, ""Van Helsing."" And there was some promise in the last Spiderman's fight with Ock. And its not as if dull studios can't do dimensional: just watch that first chase in ""Casino Royale.""But this is as pure a cinematic waste as I've experienced, so let's talk about why it fails and why it appears not to.Film is a matter of assembly across different worlds. There's the central world of the embodiment anchored by the actors of course, and there's the world of the cinematic cosmos, how the world works and the eye we borrow behaves in it. On these two armatures are assembled all sorts of bits that each are placed individually but that we seldom see as bits. What we are meant to see is the overall organism, the being of the thing.There are only two ways for this to emerge. Either you use convention or you rely on some coherent orchestration, usually from one mind. Here it is mere convention and why this is ordinary, even ordinarily ordinary. I've given up on Raimi, and so apparently have all his talented collaborators: Dykstra, Elfman the most obvious. He's the new Verhoeven.He's interested in events and not circumstance. Snapshots (as is Jonah Jameson) instead of story; parts instead of assemblies. Its film-making 101, this, that real film is not about independent panels like a comic book. There's motion involved. That motion has to behave in accordance with and at the same time define and illustrate the world we see and the dynamics of how we see it.Those rules of motion are negotiated over time between us and the filmmakers, and constitute an evolving vocabulary. What he have here is the cinematic equivalent of two hours or ""you know"" and other such automatic, meaningless utterances. Part of what we pay for is this game, and under normal circumstances the question we decide is whether we want sugar or meat. Here we get cardboard.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worthwhile for the memes it spawned at the very least,"I think the reaction to SPIDER-MAN 3 has mellowed over time.

The dance scenes are gold.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why so hasty?,"I find Sam Raimi's filmmaking style to be musical-like, I mean visually. He balanced that with a compelling story in the first two movies. But in this one, things got out of hand for Sam. I don't understand why Venom's scenes had to be so rushed and so few. There are too many characters to develop and if it's going to work, maybe 1 movie Spider-Man 3 isn't enough. I disagree with those who say this movie is bad. I can say that Venom's appearance here is quite good and reasonable. Maybe the problem is that there is too little time for this character. The action scenes are still very interesting and enjoyable. The way Peter Parker changes is probably closer to the playful and humorous version of Spider-man in the comics. The characters are well-developed and even sympathetic like the Sandman. But the short time for the story to develop too much leads to weird details. For example, MJ is willing to ignore Peter and sell him to Harry even though she knows he wants to kill Peter. Then Harry was willing to come back to help Peter after the fight between the two, Harry's butler's reasons were clearly not enough to change Harry. And I know adding Sandman into the story of Uncle Ben's death was to connect the characters, but it was obviously quite ridiculous and did not bring any surprise to the viewers. Anyway I just wish the finale of this series was split into two parts. Venom would have been bigger and emotionally separate from Eddie Brock.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This Summer, the True Battle Lies Within...Hollywood.","I don't want to get into how the ending scenes left me hollow, or how the telegraphing lines foreshadowed way too heavily.I just want to say, too much, too soon.

But 2 was so much better than I ever thought a comic book movie could be. This one...well, it's just another comic book movie.

Mediocre ending,"Spider-Man 3, a very difficult case. The movie undoubtedly has its qualities, but unfortunately also some weaknesses.At the beginning it seems that Peter has found his balance. He is happy and everything is going as it should. This is how it looks at first glance. It doesn't take long and you realize that his success is going over his head and he's getting cocky. Of course, this is human to a certain extent, yet he becomes arrogant and suddenly everything is no longer running smoothly.The movie really has its strengths. Starting with Sandman. He's not an evil person, but is still a criminal by his actions. Supposedly good intentions do not justify crimes. For me this is really interesting figure.The Symbiont and Venom are of course also highlights of the movie.But now we come to the biggest minus point. Peter's new hairstyle, his overly arrogant behavior and especially his ridiculously embarrassing dancing moves. What the hell is this? I know what this is trying to symbolize, but it's just too much and anything but believable. These inserts seem like foreign bodies in the movie.Peter's ego could have been portrayed much better and more credibly at this point. Up to this point the movie war really good.The final fight with Venom was epically staged and fun. However, the final exit was meager and didn't do justice to the entire previous performance. You feel that the maximum running time of the movie was reached and a cut had to be made.Overall, we are talking about a very successful trilogy. The last part also had its highlights, but it couldn't keep up with the first two parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You people are being was too harsh with this movie.,"Spider-Man 3 (2007) was the first Sam Raimi movie that I watched in the theater and I really enjoyed it. Over a decade later, I started to not like this movie. However after rewatching the movie for this review, I can say that Spider-Man 3 (2007) is easily the weakest of the original Spider-Man Trilogy, but it's still a great movie.Positives for Spider-Man 3 (2007):
I did like the movie's story and while I have my issues with some of the things in this movie, I was still on board for what they were doing here. Tobey Maguire is still great as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and that's the one thing that these movies have always done right. You still get those great dynamics with Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn and Aunt May. I also liked Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman and his transformation in the movie was done very well with some amazing CGI. There are still a lot of fun action sequences in the movie. Now, let's talk about Emo Peter Parker and I'm going to say it, I don't hate this version of the character and I enjoyed all of his goofy scenes. You have another fun cameo from Bruce Campbell. When Peter Parker rips off the symbiote suit, it's done very well and Eddie Brock's transformation to Venom was awesome. And finally, the way how Harry Osborn dies in the movie is similar to how his father died in the first movie and it felt poetic.Mixed for Spider-Man 3 (2007):
I wasn't too crazy with Flint Marko being revealed as the guy who killed Uncle Ben and while I understand what Sam Raimi was going for, it didn't sit well with me. I was also a little annoyed with Mary Jane and she became a little unlikable in the movie. Despite me enjoying the goofy dancing in this movie, it does feel.out-of-place in this movie. Also, there are a number of action sequences that are done with green screen and that took me out of the movie for the most part.Negatives for Spider-Man 3 (2007):
There are too many villains in this one movie. I didn't like the inclusion of Venom and the symbiote in this movie and thkse two things were forced into this movie by Sony Pictures, Sam Raimi has stated that he didn't wanted Venom in the movie and I'm on his side in this argument. I also didn't care for Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy and she doesn't even feel or act like the Gwen Stacy that we all know and love. And finally, I couldn't stand Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, he was such an annoying crybaby in the movie and I just wanted to punch him.Overall y Spider-Man 3 (2007) was a great ending to the original Spider-Man Trilogy and while it has its issues, I would still recommend this movie to fans of Spider-Man and Marvel Comics.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man 3 - Review,"I don't know, I liked it. I get the criticism, which is flowing alongside this movie, but hey, I've seen a lot worse than these and even this movie has some great action sequences and emotional scenes. I liked the Sandman, the love triangle between Harry, Peter, and MJ and even the ending is somewhat emotional and enjoyable. Yeah, Bully Maguire is a fantastic meme, but in this movie, it doesn't really work, yet it has some logic in it, but the execution isn't the most proper in this movie. So yeah, I respect the people who dislike this movie and I accept the fact that this is easily the worst of this exquisite trilogy, but in my opinion, it's good. Not great, not super-good or excellent, but still a solid comic-book movie. And yeah, I'm sad that the 4th installment didn't happen, because this trilogy had a lot of great moments and has a lot of fans. Instead, we got The Amazing Spider-Man and - ehm, ok I guess. Watch this movie, and don't be that harsh on it, it's still just a goddamn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
rampant overkill,"Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining. There is such a plethora of characters, plot lines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.The ostensible selling point of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy. The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time. No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel-fatigue). The others foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father's death; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker's uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero's hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well). One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn't have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment. In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion. While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles. Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn't all that convincing when he's trying to play the bad-boy villain either).I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why ""Spider-Man 2"" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him. In ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, Parker essentially has his ""evil"" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking. Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spiderman's ""flying"" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed). The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy. And talk about villain overkill!With ""Spider-Man 3,"" the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333. Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Glad we watched this despite the bad reviews - AMAZING MOVIE,my son and I had concerns if to watch this one after reading the reviews here. We don't get what all those bad reviews are all about as this is a great Spiderman movie and maybe the best from the first three and not only in terms of special effects but also acting and awesome character development. The movie is also touching unique subjects in a very interesting way. We enjoyed not only the best action that was ever done for the series but from the whole movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just forget the dance ever happened...,"As a 28 year old man I watched the Spider-Man franchise in full for the first time. Never having seen Spider-Man 3 at all, and hearing what I heard, I wasn't optimistic. There were accurate comments, and others who were unrealistic with their reviews. This movie had a fantastic base plot. Topher Grace is a huge pussy but, hey, so is Toby Maguire. So if you can get past the worst dance in movie history, this was a valid addition to the trilogy. Some of the CGI was questionable, I blame the saturation of characters. Too many people with too much maintenance, leaving major story arcs left most untouched. I just got a major feeling of deja vu from seeing the Batman franchise crash and burn after Batman & Robin. With Spider-Man 3 being far less of an atrocity there was still plenty of room for a Spider-Man 4. Now with Spidey joining the cinematic universe hopefully they can finally get it right.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Friends will always be friends, but a hero won't be a hero forever.","The story is truly terrible. All the dramatic conflicts relying on MJ's design became extremely tiresome in the third installment, and there is a complete lack of logic behind the important conflicts (especially the kissing scene between Spider - Man and Gwen). It's extremely boring. On the other hand, the action scenes in the third installment are truly top - notch among the Spider - Man IP series. Even among superhero movies, it's hard to find rivals that can match them. Although, seen from today's perspective, the disjunction between the characters and the background is clearly visible, the dynamic momentum within the shots is still powerful. It's an extremely perfect storyboard design, truly making the viewing emotions rise and fall with the scenes (few superhero movies nowadays can achieve this). And the long - take CG shot of Sandman's resurrection is probably the best visual expression in the series. At least at that time, they were really respecting the presentation of ""visual spectacle"" instead of regarding it as a mere appendage of box - office results.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some new additions but Web 3.0's no upgrade,"Sam Raimi's Web version 3.0 proves that  like the increasingly shoddy sequels to Batman - when it comes to comic book villains, less is more. Really, does anyone remember anything that Two-Face and Poison Ivy actually did? After building his rollicking action empire with tight, one-on-one contests between our friendly neighbourhood hero and his nemeses, Raimi falls into the trap of taking Spider-Man 3 a villain too far. It has nothing to do with the CG qualities of either Sandman or Venom (they're as well-rendered as you'd expect from the next instalment of an $800million franchise). It's simply that the film introduces so many problems for Peter Parker to deal with, it doesn't fully focus on any.On the verge of proposing to Mary Jane, Peter is so caught up in his own hype that he has become a self-absorbed prat. Outwardly, they're fine, but he is so busy enjoying the adulation and attention - hey, police chief's daughter Gwen Stacy, how YOU doin'? - that he's oblivious to any problems MJ might have.And anyway, there's also some unfinished business with Harry 'Goblin Jr' Osborne, cocky photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after his job at the Bugle, and convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is now a much bigger problem than when he first escaped after having his DNA replaced with sand. The guy's a walking building site.Then a black goo from outer space which feeds on human aggression (drug metaphor ahoy!) transforms Peter into a swaggering, greasy-fringed idiot - like a member of The Killers who's seen Saturday Night Fever too many times.But his turn to the dark side is reflected in the spider-suit's cool new look which is later adopted by Brock when the terrible treacle turns him into Venom. Let's get ready for a tag-team rumble Needless to say, it all looks fantastic. But, for all its impressive, whiplash-inducing set-pieces, jokey interludes, cute cameos (including Bruce Campbell as a Pythonesque maitre d') and general vertiginous pizazz, the plot regularly loses momentum.How many messages on commitment, redemption and doing the right thing does one film need? What's with the ridiculous climactic commentary from that TV reporter with the bad English accent and her geriatric, googly-eyed anchorman? Would Bryce Dallas Howard like to give me a call the next time she has this little to do in a movie? Like Spidey himself, Raimi appears to have gotten carried away by the success of his previous exploits. Webby 3.0 certainly gives you plenty of whiz-bang for your buck, but it doesn't get that spider sense tingling.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Egad, could a film truly be this terrible?","To put it in context- it's easily the worst film I've seen this year, and I'm usually happy to watch dross.I struggle to pick out a single positive aspect of the movie. In almost every aspect it was overstated, leaving the audience no room/need/desire (delete as appropriate) to interpret/appreciate situations for themselves. When a director has to cut to a (bad) English accent yelling ""I don't know how much more of this he can take"" to tell you that the protagonist's taking a spanking you really have to question the quality of a production.Sure, a lot of money has been spent on special effects, but they fail to serve as more than eye candy... I didn't feel drawn into the action scenes at any point. The only genuine reaction the film pushed out of me was a slight jump when the goblin grabbed MJ.There was plenty of plot I suppose, but none of it convincing or engaging- the characters were entirely selfish and unlikeable (not necessarily a bad thing in a movie, but hardly appropriate for a light superhero film) and deviated so wildly from their templates that I simply didn't see the link to their comic book namesakes by the end. Venom's potential as a foe was utterly wasted, not because of a villain overload- 3 bad chaps is perfectly doable- but because it was barely addressed as a character or an idea. The only information we received as the Symbiote were a couple of statements Parker's teacher plucks from thin air.Instead of exploring the themes of Spiderman and his opponents, or even just giving fun action, we were given two and a half hours of Peter Parker acting like a turd. Even that was over-baked. I cringed, I despaired, I regretted the fact that I've already signed down to see it on a staff social tomorrow as well.Truly lamentable.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Requests for Emotion,"I thought the movie was great. I was disturbed by some of the laughing from the audience at key points. There were a lot of moments in the movies that asked its audience for emotion. Maybe too many for some people. I felt like this required knowledge from the previous two movies. The characters were built really well through the three movies and I felt like this one had rights to ask emotion from us. I guess I can be a sappy guy or hopeless romantic. Whatever you want to call it. I did enjoy the movie throughly. I don't know if I gave it the emotion that Mr. Raimi was looking for. I was on the verge of tears at some point but just the verge. All in all I would say its worth the price of admission. Great action sequences and great build up of the characters.

No, a **much** better product.Sure some of the CGI was good, although too quick to keep up with in some cases, but without a good story and character development to back it up..... you know the rest.SM1 - 7, SM2 - 9, SM3 - 5 (and that might be a bit generous)Worth seeing?

"SPIDER-MAN 3 (Sam Raimi, 2007) ***","I loved the first film (which I watched twice in theaters) but recall that the second installment was rather less enjoyable; this seems to me to be slightly superior to its predecessor. Unfortunately, however, the action set-pieces are too dizzyingly-edited to be properly evaluated; still, the high-rise stunt early on and the climactic battle of the mutants are undeniably spectacular.Besides, the complicated plot results in gross overlength - featuring yet another round of the Tobey Macguire/Kirsten Dunst/James Franco love triangle, too many adversaries for Spider-man (with allegiances shifting frequently and unconvincingly), and a baffling insistence on the deaths of the Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson characters from the first film! A platinum blonde Bryce Dallas Howard brings some much-needed freshness to the proceedings - though her role, ultimately, proves of little consequence.The Sandman's back-story is especially ludicrous and sentimental with an utterly wasted Theresa Russell as his resentful wife; Venom, however, is interesting (especially in the way he represents Spider-man's alter ego) - but comes to the fore far too late into the game: his demise is nicely handled, too, but it's then ruined by the apparent necessity to eliminate the Topher Grace character. The scenes involving the 'Evil Peter Parker' swagger, then, are eye-rollingly embarrassing, as is the musical number sung by Dunst during her disastrous Broadway stint! The film allows Bruce Campbell yet another delightful cameo, and there's even a wonderful bit involving Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee. In the end, SPIDER-MAN 3 succeeds mainly as a slick and solidly entertaining ride (as long as one doesn't analyze it too deeply).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Grade-B Movie,"Spiderman 3 was considered ""the most anticipated movie of the summer"", apparently. While this might have been true, do NOT get your hopes high about seeing a fantastic movie.

But it did have a good start.

Spider-Man 3 is Not to Be Missed!,"45 Years Ago Stan Lee created what would become the most successful Superhero in all History:Spider-Man.With abilities that all of us would like to have,Spidey gathered millions of fans as the years came by.The Story was captivating,the Villains tough,the Moves Cool and Mary Jane nice.Spider-Man represented the superhero in all of us.He wasn't an alien from another planet,he wasn't a rich businessman,but the Guy next door.The Shy Guy,that rarely talks and is considered boring,but that when the moment comes,changes his personality and his alter ego saves the day.Yes,Spider-Man came closer to teen fans more than the other superheroes exactly because of this:He was just a student,with lots of problems,exactly like most of his readers.Years passed and the period when superheroes started appearing on the big screen came.Due to the complexity of Spidey's moves,every attempt to create a Spider-Man movie failed.All Up to 2002,when at last a man took Up the Challenge.This man was Sam Raimi(the director of The Evil Dead).The timing was right,since this is the age of special effects and almost everything can now be turned into a movie,and thus the movie was a success for a first try and fans were pleased.2 Years Later,Spider-Man 2 was even better,with more action and a greater villain.However,it was clear the the first two movies were just warming up. Raimi hadn't unleashed his best yet.Now he has.Spider-Man 3 isn't only a great sequel,it's the best Spider-Man ever.The reasons are obvious.We got even more action-packed scenes.The story is as good as the ones before.All actors give good performances and manage to bring,yet again,the comic book to life.Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is lovely as MJ.Bryce Dallas Howard makes a hot appearance as Gwen Stacy,Parker's 2nd love interest.All this and a Cameo from Bruce Campbell(Ash from The Evil Dead)makes the movie nice.But those reasons are not enough to make it more special than the other Spider-man movies.What is it Then?The Villains of course! How can't a Spider-Man movie be good,since it features 3 villains at the same time?We got Spidey's childhood friend Harry Osborn,who follows in the footsteps of his father and becomes the evil Hobgoblin(or New Goblin as mentioned on IMDb) and makes the skies insecure as he flies menaciously.Then we Got the Evil Sandman,who makes for a great enemy.How can u beat a man made out of sand,who can regenerate every part of his body? Well,you'll have to find out in cinemas.But the show is truly stolen by the Great Venom!Combined with an alien symbiotic costume,Eddie Brock finally becomes Spider-Man's strongest(and scariest)enemy.Almost all the merit for the greatness of this movies goes to him.Ever since I first saw Venom in the animated television series,I couldn't help but doubt and dream how would he be in a possible movie.At last my wish came true.Venom looked awesome on screen,I couldn't have imagined him better. He will surely be this year's best CGI character.To Sum Up,Spider-Man 3 is not only one of this summer's best movies,it is also the best Spider-Man yet.Fans of Spider-Man 3,watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.With Venom finally alive,this movie is Not to Be Missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Second Best Entry,"Last year about this time, I was supremely excited about X-Men 3 or The Last Stand as it is titled, but I was supremely disappointed. It had a bunch of action and thin story. It butchered the series for me. I glad to announce this film didn't have the same affect. I was more wary this time, yes, but also still excited. The writers handled the story very well and there was plenty of eye popping action. Still the film lacked a good strong drive like its predecessor.I will address the short comings first. I will point out the obvious. Kirsten Dunst can't sing very well, but that is addressed in the film. The thing is that we have to hear her sing twice, a very bad idea. It wasn't the most pleasant thing to hear although she is decent. My next point of minuses is the origin of the symbiote. It just falls from the sky. A rather weak way for it magically appear, but they had few options other than go with the Ultimate origin where it is man-made. Still little more cause for its arrival would have made it stronger. My third and final point is in regards to the final ending. It was needed at all and added nothing to the progression of the characters other than for a happier note to end on.Now onto the positive stuff of which there is a mass. First the stupendous battles, and let me tell there are some big ones. They were very well staged and brought to being. The final battle especially did a great job of bringing everything together. The special effects are dazzling especially Sandman. The first appearance of his is pure film magic as we see the cells change in Marko's body and the reconstruction after being turned into sand particles. Venom was great to, but nothing spectacular aside from the ""Alien"" moments.Before I go on praising this film I will provide a brief description of the plot. Picking up from where the other film left off, MJ and Peter have finally gotten together and things are looking fantastic for Spider-Man and Parker as he has the girl of his dreams and has the city on his sides even the newspaper, a shocker. But things quickly go south when Harry Osborne swoops in and tries to kill Parker as revenge because he believes Spider-Man/Parker's to be the murderer of his father. He looses not only the battle, but his memory after taking a few nasty hits. Flint Marko is then brought on the scene as a misunderstood runaway convict. Through crazy chance he falls into a test area and is turned into the Sandman. Parker is mad at Marko at this point because he believes him to be the true murderer of his Uncle Ben. I won't reveal much more, but Venom/Eddie Brock does have a pretty big part in the last section of the film as does the symbiote about half way and a little before when it falls from the sky. All in all, it is a nice setup for some serious encounters/fights.The relationship between Mary Jane and Peter Parker is pretty key to the film as it drives much of Peter's personal decisions and problems. It's done quite well, aside from Mary Jane singing. Peter wants to ask her to marry him, but it doesn't work out. Aunt May has some great moments in here where she really shines. Everyone is back and more. Jameson is as steaming mad as ever and provides quite a few laughing fits involving his temper. Even the great theme is used to great affect from beginning to ending, something that was sorely missing in the last X-Men film.The film is one of the best entries in the series, but not quite up to Spider-Man 2 which was pitch perfect and never stumbled for a moment. It successfully engages three villains with Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but it doesn't quite resolve everything as grandly as Spider-Man 2 did. Still far from a disappointment which is sure to please most everyone action wise and for those romantic fans it will frustrate you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rare Territory,"Raimi has done it again. I feel that this franchise continues to get better and better. It is because the director has learn the great secret of great movie making. If the audience cares about the characters the effects just enhance the experience. I am a fan of the comics. So it is suffice to say don't go to this movie expecting a concrete copy of the characters comic lives. What Taimi has done is capture the soul of the characters. Peter Parker is interesting because he continues to have problems. Not just the enemies he faces but the enemies within. I felt that the first films theme was responsibility, the second film's theme was choices, and this new movies theme is about forgiveness. This is what I love about this film though it is dark the hero still manages to rise up and face what ever odds are against him. Each character is important and the villains are delightful.

Spider-Man 3 Surprises...It's Awful,"OK, well, let me start by saying that I enjoy the Spider-Man series. I thought 1 was good and 2 was excellent. Yes, a lot of the dialogue is cheesy, but it's a comic book series. It's based on action and stories.Now that we got this out of the way, let me say that if this wasn't a part of the Spider-Man series then this would be on every critics bottom 10 list for the year.I was so excited to see it, but they really took the cheesy dialogue, really lame scenes and horrible attempts to elicit emotional responses to an all time high.By now, we all know the story. Peter Parker is a photographer with an alter-ego...he is Spider-Man. He's in love with the emotionally hard to figure out Mary Jane Watson.Very early in the movie we get one of the 'anticipated' matchups when Harry and Peter fight. Not Spider-Man, but Peter. Harry is all done out in his father's goblin suit.Of course this first battle ends out in a victory for Spidey. Harry takes a huge hit to the head on a bar and is knocked out and is dying. Peter gets him to a hospital where the doctors are able to save him, but he now has what could be permanent short-term memory loss. He can't remember his anger for Peter, he can't remember if he has a girlfriend or not...he pretty much only remembers up until high school.The other 'Bad guys' are played by Thomas Haden Church, who is a character called ""The Sandman"" who can do amazing things after being involved in a freak accident while on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, and the other is Topher Grace who plays Venom. We'll get to him later.Peter finds out that his grandfather's murderer was not found originally and that the convict escaped from prison is the one who did it.With his anger growing, a black, sticky, ooze creeps on to Peter and takes over. He is now Venom. He has nothing but anger and revenge in his heart.After a series of unfortunate events, he feels the need to get rid of the suit. He fights himself to get it off and finally does so only to have the black ooze transfer on to Peter's arch enemy from The Bugle, Edward Brock.I can't say much more without giving away the plot, but good gosh this was bad. There are many scenes that make you cringe because of how bad the dialogue is and there are plenty of scenes that tested my gag reflex (Harry and MJ doing the twist, Peter walking down the street with a new attitude and pointing and winking at girls as he goes along, Peter doing pelvic thrusts in a men's store, Peter dancing and playing piano in a jazz bar, etc.) Peter's Venom side is actually quite intriguing though. When he is Peter, he has an attitude. He will willingly fight people on the street without his suit. Not bad guys, he'll fight people who just plain tick him off. His edge is nice, but not really useful except for in a couple of scenes.Overall, this is probably the worst comic book movie ever. Not kidding.I'd avoid at all cost, but knowing that it's Spider-Man, I know most can't resist. They're curious and they have to know.Well, don't say I didn't warn you...",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
disappointing; too much melodrama; too many villains,"I feel cheated after watching Spiderman 3. Part two was had a lot of merit, but Spidey 3 is just an effective marketing job and Sam Raimi has finally yielded to the pressure of the movie's backers. The fake melodrama, especially towards the end, makes your stomach turn. No amount of CGI can make up for a poor plot line. Both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were on the BBC to plug the movie. Then it was already obvious that Mary Jane's part would be disproportionately inferior to that of Spiderman's. Actually, nearly all the good scenes in the movie occur when Spiderman meets his dark side. It was kind of fun rooting for the bad guy. The rest of the picture was far too cheesy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Sam Raimi, you've destroyed a franchise.","Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of comics and of the first two Spiderman films, most especially, Spiderman 2. My brother works in the comic book industry and I simply could not wait to see this with him and the rest of my family. (Insert enormous sigh here). I've read many of the negative comments and feedback, and I can unreservedly say that I agree with them ALL. My family and I were HUGELY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and that simply SUCKS since we were expecting SO MUCH more. Our theatre was packed, and when the movie *finally* ended, the reaction was definitely mixed, with most of the feeling being in the ""What the?!"" category. Many people sat shaking their heads in utter disbelief and shock. I just cannot believe that Sam Raimi is now on the same shameless loser level as George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers. I won't go on with any more tedious remarks about WHY the film sucked, since many of you have already eloquently expressed the same views. But I will say, that I left the theatre feeling pretty much the same way I did after seeing ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Matrix: Revolutions"". This will go down as the most hyped and most surprisingly disappointing movie, EVER. I won't even buy the DVD.When I asked my brother afterward what he thought of the movie, he simply responded: ""What movie?"" It's our inside joke for when a movie's SUCK FACTOR is off the charts. We simply deny it's existence. Spiderman 2, however, will always be my favorite superhero/comic book movie. It was sheer genius, and I guess, lightning in a bottle for the filmmakers, since they've now become creatively anemic. So as far as I'm concerned, there are only TWO Spiderman films. And maan, that hurts.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not bad, but could have been great","Spider-Man 3 had the potential to be a deep character study, but it ultimately misses the mark, skimming over Peter Parker's internal struggles in favor of spectacle. While it builds an intriguing setup with Peter's newfound ego and the darker influences at play, the film quickly loses its grip on these themes, turning away from the introspective journey it could have been.The film stumbles in some of its art direction, from the exaggerated eyeliner and ""emo hair"" choices to Peter's sudden wardrobe overhaul. These visual cues feel more gimmicky than transformative, failing to truly capture Peter's shift into a darker, more self-centered persona. Is this really the extent of Peter Parker's ego shift? Instead of exploring the true weight of pride, guilt, and revenge, *Spider-Man 3* seems more preoccupied with superficial changes.The playful approach to Peter's ""evil side"" undercuts what could have been a powerful narrative. At one point, he kills his friend, and the next moment, we're treated to a jazzy, lighthearted sequence. This mismatch between action and tone diminishes the stakes and makes it hard to invest in Peter's journey. A darker, more grounded look at his humanity-his pride, his vengeful side-could have given the film the depth it was reaching for.The film's moving parts provide a good foundation, yet halfway through, it disbands from what could have been a profound character study, settling instead for a standard superhero film. It's not that *Spider-Man 3* is bad; it's just a missed opportunity for something deeper. The Uncle Ben subplot also falls into lazy writing, recycling familiar beats instead of innovating with new conflict or more intelligent character motivations.And on a lighter note-did Tobey gain a little weight? It's a small detail, but one that's noticeable as the film leans into Peter's supposed transformation. All in all, *Spider-Man 3* leaves audiences with the sense that, despite a truly promising start, it ultimately hesitates to fully dive into the human side of the web-slinging hero.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good enough... but tangled up too much.,"Oh how we love those summer blockbusters... it's true we expect too much from them, especially when they're sequels to really quality films. And it's also true we pounce to criticize them with harsh cruelty when they fail to meet our expectations. 'Spiderman 3' is a perfect summer blockbuster at its own credit. But it has got two wonderful movies as its prequels... so, it faces a tough challenge.Three villains... one of them my favorite - Venom. Where the movie really fails is its attempts to show the backgrounds of all three of them. OK, the goblin needs no background. But Venom gets the least screen time and I'm not satisfied. A good villain needs time to grow... See, all of the major Spidey villains have their brighter pasts from where they slowly transform to villains. In this film this transformation is hurried and shown abruptly, which quite kills the movie's mood. I believe the film wastes more time on Sandman than it needed.Another major aspect of the film is Peter Parker's alter ego as the black spiderman after he's infected by the symbiote. I loved the sequence in the jazz club for sure, but I also think the character is shown overtly egomaniacal and unnecessarily irritating. Maguire tries hard to create the contrast between the real Peter and the infected Peter and thus in both cases, he over-acted. Along with his acting, several scenes are also written with excessive emotions and often they are laughable.But, there are also numerous bright points in the film of course. I just loved the use of humor in this film... especially in scenes involving JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell. And the special visual and sound effects are awesome, you know, as they should be. The fighting sequences, though not very innovative, but always fun to watch. The overall acting is not bad... with James Franco and Topher Grace both stealing the show.So, to wrap it up, one would definitely enjoy the film. But every time I think about Spidey2, I compare them... and this one somehow loses.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i was very bored and disappointed,"i was not at all impressed. the movie had little to no action and was more about the characters real lives then it was about fighting against sandman, venom or the green goblin. it was confusing and the way it wrapped up in the end was just total garbage. very disappointed and very bored and very stupid of me to watch the midnight release and to skip work the next morning. i guess it was good for them to start developing the characters real lives, but it seemed to be to long. i didn't really care, i just wanted to watch the fighting between venom and spiderman and there really was only one major fight. so yeah i was a little disappointed. oh well... i still like the franchise a lot.. just don't think that it was worth all the hoopla that surrounded the release. i was just bored.. sorry",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Movie Review: Spider-Man 3,"Would it be fair to say that 3 is not better than 2? That is if I make a comparison between Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 2. But regardless of comparison, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie. It just isn't great, that's all.The movie began with a lengthy title intro, throwing in snippets from the movie Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, which left me with a bad feeling to how things will turn out. The intro wasn't well done. It was quite shabby, even lazy if to put it more harshly. Aesthetically speaking it wasn't impressive.It was like as if portraying the way Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man is living his life after being celebrated as the city's hero. Life is good, so good that our hero has forgotten his place and purpose. Spider-Man, in this latest from the franchise is missing its spunk. It has forgotten what made it great. I'm talking about having the audience emotionally touched by Peter Parker's struggle, having mind-blowing actions that leaves the audience in awe, and the impact of the dialogues that inspires.My suspect is that the filmmakers tried to put too much into this movie. There must be something somewhere that went amiss producing it.Let me explain. While the main focus of the film revolves around our hero's disposition from fighting the darkness that exists in him, there were too many sub-plots that took away and undermine it. There was the love story between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). There was the meaning of friendship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco). There was Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) being linked to the murder of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). And there was Venom (Topher Grace).With so many motives to act out, it is inevitable that the film would fall short. There are too many pieces in this puzzle too trying to piece together in one film, despite its length. The tempo is really slow right from the start. If not for the hilarious-ness of some scenes, with quite a few notably of James Jameson (J.K. Simmons), Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle, the movie can be considered rather dry for a comic genre film.Sandman and Venom, the main villains, were not well depicted. There were supposed to be much more about them, yet in the film they were reduced to just mere bad guys with bad luck that ultimately led them to become Spider-Man's foe. Character play is weak.It is agonizing to see Spider-Man 3 following X-Men 3's path of condensing story lines and mixing in Superman Returns's mellow love story attempt. This is not the best formula for an inspirational Superhero movie.The last fight sequence toward the end where Spider-Man battles Sandman and Venom though became the savior for this Superhero film. Thank goodness for it.All in all, ""With great power comes great responsibilities"" wasn't that great. But I'll like to agree with this message that Spider-Man 3 brings and that is in life we are given choices, some will lead to good and some will be bad. When confronted can you do the right thing?Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) told Peter Parker in the film, ""Do yourself a favor by first doing the most difficult thing, forgive yourself.""All of us had made choices in our lives. For all those that went wrong, there is no longer anything we can do about them, but we can always learn from them so we can make right choices in time to come.At least that part in Spider-Man 3 is right. ""May"" Spider-Man 4 be ""right"" after 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Save your money, it sucked","not a good movie, the only reason i gave it a 6 was for all the effort put into it because of how much better the first two were. They didn't elaborate on how this meteorite came from space, and how this ""amoeba"" formed. When Tobey first turns ""evil"" there is are two awful scenes where he thinks he's a bad@$s. and it sucked. The last fight scene is also a big disappointment. Topher Grace is a fantastic actor, he just isn't the person to play venom, when everybody knows him as that goofy kid from that 70's show. The Sandman's character was really stupid, he just wanted to make his daughter better and he tried robbing banks. He didn't even really hate spiderman. Every little thing that was predictable and clichéd. I don't want to give too much away while informing you how bad it was in case you may still want to see it. all in all, bad movie. don't see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wish there were an option for 0/10,"I will preface this by saying that I was never particularly a fan of 'Spiderman,' however I found the first 2 movies somewhat enjoyable and entertaining. The third is a different story entirely, and what angers me most is that I paid $8 to see this epic flop. The acting was horrible, but this was to be expected having seen the first two films. What set this one apart is the corniest screenplay imaginable. If you are going to see this movie, be prepared for the musical and dance numbers, with the atrocious crooning of Kirsten Dunst and the unnatural, revenge-of-the-nerds gyrations of Tobey Maguire.

"Good, but not good enough","Let me start off by saying that Spiderman 1 was one of my favourite superhero movies, and Spiderman 2 was even better. Both these movies had very good acting, excellent writing, and great choreography and action. But what made both these movies so good was the fact that they were very well paced, had just one antagonist, and had a lot of drama.Spiderman 3 was my absolute ""must watch"" film for the year. However, after the first hour or so, I was getting more and more disappointed.The acting wasn't fantastic. Good performances by most of the cast, but Tobey and Dunst (who happen to be the most important), weren't as good. The writing was done well, especially the comedy, but towards the end I thought there was just too much. You want to laugh a little, but you don't want Spiderman to turn out as a comic. That's where this movie fell flat for me.The pacing was terrible. The build up as good, and the entire climax and all the post movie drama happen in no more than 15 minutes. It's as though the movie just suddenly races past, and then immediately stops. Just like this review.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Seriously?,"That's how they're ending the Spider-Man series? The acting is poor. The writing is predictable and cheesy. The action, which the Spider-Man series has been so good at portraying, was jumpy and short-lived. I couldn't believe that the plot had to go in so many directions. It was a bit hard to follow at times and did not lend itself to character development. Although the same writers and directors were employed for this installment, it seemed like they were grasping at air. Take everything that you liked from the previous movies and make it completely over-done. They should have stuck to a single villain because there is not a lot of development of the Sandman character. It also suffers from the success and critical acclaim of the first two movies in that the movie tries to include every good thing but fails miserably in the amalgamation. The previews make it look great and totally appealing but you can really show an extremely lacking plot in a 30 second TV spot. Yes it will make a boatload of money but that can't overrule how utterly disappointing this first summer blockbuster is.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A perfect conclusion,"It's better that they didn't do a sequel because this is the perfect final of the trilogy. It ends all the story lines of the characters and you understand all of them. Some people says that there were too many villains but I think there were necessary to sum up the story at the best way. This film reveals the dark side of spider man (because after all he is a human) and then his redemption and become a real superhero. This is the best final they could make.P. S. Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right. 😉",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man swings back in style!,"Well, I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I walked out of Spider-Man 2, and despite all the bad things I've heard about it - Spider-Man 3 certainly didn't disappoint! Sure, you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to, but what's the point? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies, and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it. I have to say that I'm not a 'Spiderman fanboy' and have, in fact, not even read the comics; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone. The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two. Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City. His private life is going well also. However, good things never last long; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father, as well as a 'simian' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer, this time in the guise of powerful new villain 'Sandman'.The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects. The fight scenes are brilliantly realised, and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together. The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals, as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style, and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up. The visuals are obviously important in a film like this, and the film contains many a memorable scene. The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains, and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient (Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand...), it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human/spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City. Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also, albeit it a brief one. However, the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has.One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on. It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that. But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one, and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans, stay true to the comics and entertain the audience. He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well, as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment. Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant, it was obvious that the likes of J.K. Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief (and they do), but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit. In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked, Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a (sort of) suave lady-killer with hilarious results. The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned 'dark'.The acting is largely decent also. The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there, while the new additions fit in well. Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role, but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be, and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character. Overall, Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.,"Like a middle-aged man on a mission, Spider-Man 3 sags in the middle, takes a while to get somewhere, but still likes the girls, swells a progress or two, and shows some of the old idealism that fights with maturity's pragmatism. Most disappointing of all is this pre-mid-life hero, Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), obsessed with his love, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his desire to marry her.Enough already. He needs to save New York from the Sandman (an interesting new villain played by a fine actor, Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace). Director Sam Raimi, who knows a thing or two about split-personality Spider-Men and the evil forces overcoming good men with his Simple Plan, indulges his melodramatic longings through most of the film's mid section with the endless exchanges between Peter and MJ.Raimi does do well with the dueling good and evil theme, starting with Peter's sudden change brought on by black globs from another world. When he supposedly eliminates the Sandman for murdering his uncle, Peter is confounded by his will to do it and his moral compass, which keeps getting into his conscience. Even the Sandman struggles between his devotion to his little girl and acting like King Kong to scare the heck out of Manhattanites. Raimi does a service to the youngsters of the audience by stressing the importance of choices, a kind of comic-book existentialism.But Marvel Comics and Stan Lee live on. Yet, at 139 minutes (12 more minutes than SM2), SM3 is 39 minutes too long, notwithstanding the outstanding FX. SM 2 was much better, not just because Pulitzer-winner Michael Chabon was one of the writers, but because it took Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) so seriously he seemed to have more lines than Dunst, who here is petulant and self-centered enough to lose my interest. As I wrote in 2004, Spider-Man 2 ""is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did."" SM3 is an add on, an amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider Man's back and he's gonna be trouble,"My friends and I just saw the premiere of Spider-Man 3 and we had a great time watching it! The theater was packed and everyone was so hyped to see it, I mean, could you ask for a better movie experience? Spider-Man 3 has massive special effects that I have to admit were very impressive, the actors were fun, and the story was pretty good, but I have to honestly say that after all that hype, I wasn't incredibly impressed. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 left me and my friends with no closure to what could have been an excellent trilogy. But still this was indeed an exciting summer blockbuster that I'm sure you won't wanna miss.Spider Man has been given a day in dedication from New York, he is admired and loved by all, and quite frankly, it's getting to his head. Peter however is still the geek in real life, not too respected by anyone, but he still has Mary Jane who he wants to ask to marry him. Mary Jane is struggling in her career and is questioning her relationship with Peter and Spider Man. Harry is also back and during a huge fight between him and Spider Man he is knocked unconscious and has short term memory, but slowly realizes that he is still thirsty for revenge on his father's death. But that's the little of Peter's problem when a black goo turns him into an evil alternate of Spider Man and when Peter finds out that the man who actually killed his uncle is at large, he lets the evil out and is only out for cold revenge.Spider Man 3 is a great blockbuster that is the big start to our summer of trilogies, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone, it was a lot of fun to watch. But I wouldn't expect the greatest movie, I still love the first one the best, but I'm sure you will get 2 hours of pure entertainment, the special effects were awesome and I hope there is eventually another Spider Man in the near future.

Spidey still spins a mean web...but the romance is wearing thin...,"First of all, let me say that the romantic angle is played up more so in SPIDER-MAN 3 than it was in the other Spider-Man films, which is a distinct handicap for what is primarily an action film based on the famous comic book characters.It seems to drag noticeably in all of the quietly played scenes between TOBEY MAGUIRE and KIRSTEN DUNST, as his girlfriend May Jane whose singing career is stung by bad reviews. Then too, the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS, a warm and engaging actress, add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side.But fortunately, there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard. BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring. And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J. K. SIMMONS as J. Jonah Jameson, the harried boss of the Daily Bugle, notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills. He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene.There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man, the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City. His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves. He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role.But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick. He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing.Not as well scripted, but easily among the best performers in the film, is TOPHER GRACE, arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom. Unfortunately, this comes pretty late in the film (almost as an afterthought by the writers) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted.As it is, it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout, for such a long film. Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications, it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department.TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch. When his darker side takes over (and he's wearing that black suit), he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films, and his arrogance with dance moves--while staying in character with his nerdy side--are played for laughs which are intentional.BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray (the Queen of Scream), and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs. Marko.I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can.The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences, all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset.But, personally, I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spiderman as a goofy b-rate comedy,"Never have I uttered the words ""Oh God"" so many times well watching a movie. What happened to the captivating dialog of the first two films, the interesting characters, the breathtaking special effects. Everything positive that the first two films brought to this franchise seem to be thrown out the window in Spiderman 3. Putting aside all the cheezy graphics that this film brings and what could be the worst performance of Tobey Maguire's career one major thing is missing from this movie...a good director. Sam Raimi has massacred the whole venom plot line of Spiderman. Venom in the comic book makes Peter Parker evil, but in the film he just seems, for lack of a better word, goofy. The whole sequence where Spiderman is taken over by venom, where he apparently turns emo, is absurd. He turns pure evil, even going so far as to dance with another woman in from of Mary Jane.

Go watch the Amazing Spider-Man series, and enjoy as the so-called ""Peter"" does a flip on his skateboard and write ""I love you"" with his webs on bridge (Ha-ha-ha!). Sam Raimi didn't want to include Venom in this movie, but was forced to. All the fans complain about is that he didn't get enough screen time. Touche to that, truly. BUT, even the little screen time given to him was enough for us to see what he did in a very little time, and we wanted him dead. Now, for the best parts, tell me, didn't you guys like the Sandman part? The bad-ass villain was everything I wanted in this movie, and more.

"It's too American, too over the top and too bad.","I can't believe I wasted 2 hours on it. It takes ages to get going, there's awful camera-work in some of action scenes - so shaky it seemed like a child was holding the camera and when it smooth and stable in the CGI bits it's at weird angles (like Matrix 3 in the final fight sequence) so often you can't really tell what's going on as it all moves too fast to get any visual references. The bad Peter Parker is laughable, as is the slow mo landing besides a giant waving American flag. You can invariably predict what's going to happen next.

Best comic book movie ever,"This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Worst Film of 2007, or the new Milena?","It's sad to see a great trilogy end so horribly. That is, if Spiderman 3 is the end of the series, (i.e., it has made so much money another sequel may already be in the works). Spiderman 3 is not only the worst film in the series; it is one of the worst films of the new millennium. The third outing in the otherwise excellent film series centers around an assortment of characters; Peter Parker, (Tobey Maguire), and his acceptance of being a hero loved by New York, Mary Jane Watson, (Kirsten Dunst), and her anxiety of being a failure as an actress, Harry Osborne, (James Franco), and his obsession with killing Peter, Eddie Brock, (Topher Grace) a photographer compelled to take Peter's job, and Flint Marko, (Thomas Haden Church), a criminal that turns out to be the man who really killed Peter's Uncle Ben in the first Spiderman film. The intimidating cast of characters seems to be too much at first, and in the end, it still is. There is too much time spent on introducing the characters and getting to know them that the plot loses screen time to the characters. There are about 5 more main players in the film that I haven't mentioned already, but if I tried to explain them this whole review would be filled with names and pointless plot lines. Sadly, in a stellar cast, only three actors show their excellent acting abilities, in little screen time; Bruce Campbell (of the cult film Army of Darkness from the Evil Dead trilogy), who plays a gut-busting Maître d' at a French restaurant, Thomas Haden Church, (Sideways), as not so much of a villain but more of a lost soul in a role as a criminal and villain Sandman, and Topher Grace, (That 70's Show's Eric Foreman), as an aspiring photographer whose hate eventually turns him into the infamous Spiderman villain Venom. One of the films major downfalls is its ridiculous plot. The most important element of the plot, the black ooze that turns Peter from normal to evil, and Topher Grace's character into venom, comes from an asteroid that falls out of the sky. To showcase how evil this makes Peter, the filmmakers put makeup on him, have him strut through New York snapping his fingers and eyeing women for nearly fifteen minutes all while wearing his ""evil-spidey"" black outfit underneath his clothes. What is supposed to be funny turns out to be dumb, tedious, and irrelevant, ultimately killing any chance of the film being good enough to view more than once. There is so much wrong with this film that I could fill up all of Rolling Stone with its failures. I hated this film. Even if you loved the first two films, Spiderman 3 is boring, brainless and not worth seeing. Ever. Let me put it this way; instead of dumbing down the plot to get to the widest audience, the plot is so dumb it may actually lower the audience's IQ.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Welcome to Summer '07!,"This is first giant blockbuster of the year, and like most of them, it's not very good. Unfortunately, it follows two pretty good Spider-Man films, so that's kind of a disappointment. If you've seen the previews, you can probably guess what goes wrong: too many villains, and too many characters in general. If you thought Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was sloppily written with all its stories going on (and I didn't myself), this one's going to look like Hell. They have to cut between Peter and MJ, Harry Osbourne, Flint Marko (aka Sandman), and Eddie Brock (aka, at least late in the movie, Venom). A million things happen, and the screenwriters (only three listed, but my guess is there were dozens) have a difficult time keeping it together. They seem to forget characters' motivations at times, and they forget to explain some things, or explain them so quickly that, when they're referenced later in the movie, you have to backtrack and figure it all out. My favorite is the whole relationship between Eddie Brock, Peter Parker's photographer rival, and Gwen Stacy, a classmate of Parker's who becomes Mary Jane's romantic rival. Gwen serves as about ten different plot points at once; it becomes pretty amusing. And she's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, most famous for her extremely bizarre turns in M. Night Shyamalan's last two movies (and to a lesser extent her excellent performance in Lars von Trier's Manderlay). It's just weird to see her as the blonde bombshell type. Gwen and Eddie's relationship is briefly mentioned twice early in the film, with the two barely making contact in the two scenes they share. Later, once Brock is Venom, he is apparently angry at Spider-Man for stealing his girlfriend. This whole thing just made me giggle. Oh, and don't even ask about Harry Osbourne's butler, who magically appears at one point and delivers the stupidest deus ex machina in recent movie memory. Okay, so the movie's badly made. Doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, though. The action sequences are fun, even though a couple of them are so fast you can't tell what's going on. There are a couple of comic sequences which are amusing, even if they feel weird in the context of the film. Particularly funny is the scene where Peter Parker struts down the street wearing the evil black Spider-Man costume under his clothes (it amplifies his aggression, or some such swiftly explained nonsense). And, hey, although it's bad, it's never boring, and I'd even say it's close to entertainingly bad. I mean, I can't hate a film too much that has a climax where Tobey Maguire fights the mechanic from Wings and Eric Foreman.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, but still the weakest Spider-man film so far.","It becomes pretty obvious why this ""Spider-man"" film is the weakest of the three when one looks at the plot. After two movies of nothing but bad luck, things are finally going well for Peter Parker. He's loved by all of New York, he's acing his college classes, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane. In fact, his life is going so well that he doesn't seem to realize that his relationship with Mary Jane is failing. Meanwhile, Harry has finally decided to try to kill Peter to avenge his father's death, but a head injury causes him to lose his memory and basically go back to being the best friend that he used to be to Peter. Meanwhile, an escaped convict named Flint Marko has a bizarre accident and becomes a being made entirely out of sand (naturally called The Sandman). It is also revealed that he was involved in the death of Peter's Uncle Ben, which drives Peter to seek revenge. Peter is also competing for a staff position at the Daily Bugle against a sleazy new photographer named Eddie Brock. While all this is happening, a strange alien substance that crashed to Earth on a meteor has bonded with Peter, which increases his powers and gives him a cool new black suit, but it also turns him into a cocky, angry, arrogant, violent jerk.Any one of the main story lines could've made a good movie by itself. The problem here is that we get all of this as well as a handful of minor subplots in one movie that still isn't long enough to handle them even at nearly two and a half hours. It doesn't handle any of this stuff particularly badly, but it's still way too much for one movie to handle. The film seems to introduce one subplot, focus on it for awhile, and move on to something else. Some genuinely interesting characters are introduced and quickly disappear until the film is ready to pick up whatever subplot they're involved in.That's not to say this is a bad movie. There's still a lot to like here despite the obvious flaws. The acting is still on par with what we saw in the first two movies. Tobey Maguire still plays Peter Parker like a geeky yet earnest young man that the audience can't help but like, yet he's giving something new to do here for the first time in this series. The main plot focuses on Peter's dark side as it is brought out by the black alien suit, and the film really has fun with that. There will probably be a lot of complaints about the fact that Peter's transformation is handled with more of a sense of humor than anything, but I for one enjoyed seeing Maguire act like a total jerk. That's really the best way to describe Peter's behavior. He gets angry with people over small things, he starts dating an attractive classmate to make Mary Jane jealous, he orders his coworkers at the Daily Bugle around like he owns the place, and generally behaves with a cockiness and arrogance that we haven't seen from the character before. Like I said, this is usually handled with more of a sense of humor than people might like (there's even a goofy moment where Peter struts down the street like he's John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever""), so I have a feeling the hardcore Spider-man fans who know about this subplot from the comics will be divided. The supporting cast is largely the same as in the first two movies, with J.K. Simmons once again stealing the show as Peter's quick-tempered fast talking boss J. Jonah Jameson. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst once again make up the main supporting cast as Harry and Mary Jane. Franco has probably the most interesting and tragic story arc here, with his character undergoing numerous changes that are all surprisingly believable. On the other hand, Dunst is practically wasted. The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane has always been at the heart of the ""Spider-man"" movies, but I just didn't care for Mary Jane at all here. She comes off as selfish, petty, and so unlikable that I really didn't care when she was inevitably placed back into the role of damsel in distress. As for the newcomers Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace, they do a great job as long as they're on screen. Church plays The Sandman as a reluctant and genuinely remorseful villain who almost has a good reason for doing what he does, and Grace manages to make the audience hate Eddie Brock for being such an arrogant prick while still giving him a great story arc that turns him into a real threat to Spider-man. Both of these characters make great villains, and it's a real shame that the film can't go into greater detail with them.The action and special effects are about what I expected from this kind of movie. They never reach the heights that they did in moments like the great fight on the train in ""Spider-man 2,"" but they still manage to be exciting. The two best moments are clearly the birth of the Sandman (in which Flint Marko slowly pulls himself together after turning into a pile of sand) and the final battle royale where all the major characters fight it out at a construction site. Like I said, there's nothing that tops the train scene from ""Spider-man 2,"" but the film does come close.Despite it's obvious flaws, this really wasn't a bad movie. It still retains plenty of the charm of the first two ""Spider-man"" movies, but it just tries to do way too much for one film to handle. I would've rather seen Sam Raimi go the route taken by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and film two much tighter movies instead of one rather sloppy one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks,"Attended the sunrise screening of Spidey 3 in Alabang and the place was buzzing with excitement. It was most fortunate to premiere the film open on a holiday (May 1) because it was pretty packed.The verdict: not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks, but it's recommended viewing anyway just so you can form your own opinion on it.True Spiderman comic fans might be disappointed to see that a lot of what's in the main comicbook story lines and characterizations were not dutifully translated on screen. The movie also runs on too long, but nevertheless, the special effects are amazing.We also get to see a more human side of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) developing a split personality: Plain vs. Mod Peter Parker/Spidey. In this installment, Spidey's fame inexplicably gets to his head, much to his girlfriend MJ (Kirsten Dunst)'s dismay. He comes across an alien symbiote that attaches itself to him and feeds his darker, more aggressive side.We get a few laughs when Peter embraces this more vengeful side of him, and his style suddenly gets more mod: dark eyeliner, dark skinny suits, sleek parted hair. He looks like he belongs in an alternative/punk/rock band, complete with the attitude.Meanwhile, the villains were pretty impressive: Goblin Jr. (James Franco) battles it out with Spidey to avenge his father's death. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) plays the powerful, indestructible and ever elusive Sandman, while Topher Grace (That 70s Show, In Good Company) plays Parker's nemesis Eddie Brock/Venom. However, there are quite a number of plot holes (like, how come Peter can control the symbiote as a suit but on Eddie it attaches itself fully and gives him really bad teeth?).The movie entertained the kids in some parts, but the natives grew increasingly restless as the movie culminates to a flat close. It was as if director Sam Raimi just wanted to throw everything in there. Nonetheless, this movie is pretty sure to rake in the big bucks just with all the hype alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Are you kidding me?!,"I wanted to like this film, but I didn't. It is extremely shallow and disjointed. Here are just a few examples without spoiling anything:1. Peter and MJ's non-reaction to the thing that happens near them close to the beginning of the film. 2. Eddie Brock's attitude and line to Captain Stacy after the ""incident."" 3. The Butler. THE BUTLER!!!!!The dialog is atrocious. The action sequences are pretty good. I wish someone had given me the time codes for when the action sequences occur and I would have sat in the hallway until the times came up. I felt embarrassed for Topher Grace. I think he succeeded in making the best out of an extremely poorly written role. James Cromwell. Tobey did fine, but the director needs to remember that less (weeping) is more. (Future directors of Claire Danes, I'm talking to you.) Some of the emotion that Tobey was forced to create from thin air (due to the lousy script) also made me feel embarrassed for him. I fear that some of the odd choices he appeared to make were actually the fault of the editor or director, because several times I found myself asking, ""Why did his eyes just widen like crazy? Why is he making that face?"" James Franco did fine with poorly written dialog. Kirsten Dunst obviously knows where a body is buried. She emits zero honest emotion in her performance. I defy you to watch a scene from the first movie with your hand over her eyes and then distinguish any difference in the emotional output of her face. I WANT to like her. It's as if she's never gotten out of the line delivery from ""Interview with a Vampire."" Also, I'm sick of movies preaching to me. Desiring justice and being filled with revenge are NOT the same thing. Reacting to a violent attack with violence does not ALWAYS make the attacker and victim equally guilty of wrongdoing. Did you notice ""James Cromwell"" earlier in this paragraph? ""Why was he stuck in there?"" you might ask yourself. That's the same question you'll ask if you see this movie; such is the case with many poorly executed character arcs. Thank God for J.K. Simmons. The audience I saw this film with seemed relieved and appreciative to finally be hearing some good line delivery. Thanks J.K! Bruce Campbell also did a good job. Other comedy in Spider-man 3 feels so contrived that it cheapens the entire film. I'm not saying it's not funny, but...well, you'll see. You'll see when you no doubt pay to go see this film and you, like me, will probably have to look at your shoes during the scenes with some of the worst dialog since Jar Jar Binks.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Despite having some problems, this was very entertaining.","Stars: Tobey Maguire, Kirstin Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson.For me, this was probably the most entertaining Spiderman. Not the best however. In this Spiderman film, it seemed like the villains were there just to give the movie an actual bad guy. It focused a lot on Peter Parker's inner feelings, along with Mary Jane's. The bad guys in this were The Sandman (Church) and Venom (Grace). It felt weird to me having Topher Grace as Venom, or even including Venom at all. The character of Venom doesn't appear until late in the film, which felt weird passing him off as a main villain at the last minute. Topher Grace, however, was great as the photographer that became Venom. He played a small, but great role. Thomas Haden Church played a quieter villain with not much to say, but he has a screen presence that came across quite well. James Cromwell was in this for some reason, I have no idea why. As for the movie itself, it was very entertaining. Sometimes it would become too much of a comedy for it's own good, or too dramatic, but it still was fun to watch, so I can't say I was disappointed. One more added bonus to the film was a hilarious cameo that worked well by Bruce Campbell as a maitre'd.My rating: *** out of ****. 136 mins.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am sorry but it's all a tad disappointing!,"Before I get hardcore critics and fans of the film blasting my comments I must make the point that I do not in any way, shape or form pretend to be a professional film critic. I am however a long standing Scottish cinema manager, have a love for films and have (like everyone else here) an opinion. When commenting here I draw from my film experience as well as my boy-hood love of the arachnid hero!I am fortunate to have had an advance screening of the 3rd installment and had been excited for weeks and months and yes, I probably did build my expectations up too much but this was only setting me up for a plumit to earth with no web to fire and save me! On a positive angle I could not have been more impressed by the action sequences. This is a fine example of what C.G.I is capable of and is really the saving grace of this film and is what is going to pull the punters through our cinema doors.Unfortunately I found these sequences lost in what was a fairly average and lost plot. There seemed no structure with this movie and I felt it was always just too long a wait until the next 'big scene'. Please tell me also why I should have to cringe at least 3 times in this film after watching scenes which seemed to be better placed in a 3rd rate rom-com. You should not be cringing at Spiderman...you should be on the edge of your seat! Didn't want to give spoilers away, just my opinions.

Could have been way better,"Why why why aren't they making movies like Batman Begins anymore...In Spider-Man 3 almost everything happens without a reason and explanation. The black fluid that drops out of the sky in the park ? Where did it came from ? What is it ? Why did it drop on earth ? The criminal escapes to some facility where they are working with strange machines on the sand so that this guy becomes the sandman. What are they doing at that facility ? What do they want to get as a result ? Venom. A pretty cool character but in the movie they never call it Venom. It just has no name in the movie.Alter-ego: When Peter Parker feels good he dances on the street and doing macho-things. If he's doing this in real life, it's his choice, but why put this stupid scene in the movie, it has no use at all.So, after all this said, I really think they made 2 movies of Spiderman 3 where they add more depth to the story so that it just won't feel as a cheap entertainment movie.Kirsten Dunst is a lovely girl. But when she visits Harry and they go dancing on the song 'Twist' or whatever it's called I am wondering what the producer wants to say with this scene. It's not what I want to see when I go to the cinema for Spider-Man 3. I want to see him fighting tugs with a story. Not just 2 enemies with no story (not in the movie) It's just too bad.

I don't care about haters,"When I first saw spiderman 3, I loved it and thought it to be a best Spidey film because for taking the franchise to next level.

Because I still enjoy 3rd part like the first two. Its true that film has some drawbacks. Obviously the film suffers because of multiple villains(because raimi was forced to include venom). There are many loopholes in the script eg: why that butler was silent for so many years when he knew the truth about norman's death way before. And the climax gives us a sense of déjà vu where like the previous two films mj is kidnapped by the villain in order to reach spidey.Despite pressure from studios Sam raimi managed to keep it as entertaining as the two.

Well whats good or bad in this movie.,"Hi I'm a 12 year old kid and it was my birthday on may 3. The Spiderman 3 movie came out on May 4 and i was dying to see it. There was a time that was worldwide at midnight! My parents took me there for my birthday. After waiting in line for 50 minutes then sitting for 2.20 minutes on a seat i came out of the the place and was frustrated. My dad asked how the movie was and i smiled and lied ""the best of the year"" What i was really thinking was this is the worst movie and how come my birthday comes once a year and i choose this movie.Now its 10 days after it came out. This movie was a waste of my time and i made a list of bad and good things. Here we go! The Good: Great Effects. (The Giant Sandman at end of movie) Great Action. (Venom and Spidey fighting) Great Story ( The Whole movie) Great Villains ( Venom) Great Comedy ( J. Jonah Jameson) The Bad: Costumes ( They don't look really cool such as Spider-man. its just a suit but nothing else special, seeing Brock's face in a costume is stupid, Harrys costume is not so cool ) Mary Jane ( Mary Jane obviously ruins the whole movie. Why is everything about Mary Jane. 3/4 Of the movie is about her. For God Sake ever since Spider-man 1 started he starts talking about Mary-Jane) Time Limit for Venom ( When Venom appeared the movie was almost over and he was only in it for 15 minutes.Then he explodes with the suit. How Ridicoulous) Ideas: ( Whos stupid idea was to have venom and Harry The Bridge Scene ( God how embarrassing for Tobey Maguire to have him and his fake crying act) WE WILL NEVER FORGET.Explanation ( Since when does some strange liquid come from a meteor) Emo ( Stupid Idea of Peter going emu) As you can see there are positive and negative for this movie.

Spider Man 3,"This Spider Man is a bit too long, bigger than before and from my point of view a bit better.There are four plots carried forward from Spider Man II  mainly his girl friend Mary Jane Watson; his friend turned enemy Osborn Junior, his grand mother and lastly his job / boss. There are a few more sub-plots  an alien black organism transforming Spider Man and later his competitive reporter to evil ones, and lastly the Sand Man. So in this movie as you must have noticed there are three enemies that Spider Man has to fight  Sand Man, Osborn Junior and the alien. With love story, action, drama and emotions - in the end Spider Man triumphs and I liked the movie just for its total entertainment value.The Director Sam Raimi has himself taken a shot at co-writing the screenplay with his elder brother Ivan Raimi. I think Sam has handled the complicated story line in a very sophisticated way on screen. He has given ample time and scope for each character to develop. The under-lying emotion in the script is obviously the love-story of Spider Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider Man is vulnerable, funny, humane, emotional and lovable when he is Peter Parker. There are good sequences of actions spread across the whole movie from time to time. With the number of enemies growing  we become eager to watch the ending on how Spider Man will fight all of them. This Spider Man also dances and grooves like John Travolta on the street showing his mean side.Toby Maguire excels in his role and it would be difficult to image any other face than him as Spider Man. Kristen Dust, James Franco, Thomas Hayden (as Sand Man) have played their part with director's cut.If you ask me what is not there in the movie  I have to think a hundred times to answer that question. Everything is there. The movie has all the entertainment cliché  but I never expected more than that from a Spider Man movie.I was happy to see for the first time - young, old, boys, girls, man and woman people  a whole range of mixed crowd enjoying the movie. Being a spectator I too enjoyed it. Take a huge bag of pop-corn, bottle of cola and chill out with die hard Spider Man fans  I think you will enjoy it more than me.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
so bad i don't even no where to start....,"Normally when you go to see a movie at 12:01 am on opening you would surpirsed if people starting walking out a little more than halfway through.

"""Spider-Man 3"" - You wanna talk about a ""tangled web""?","Director Sam Raimi returns for a third time to direct another ""Spider-Man"" movie, ""Spider-Man 3,"" which promises to not only be an excellent summer movie, but a spectacular closer to a marvelous superhero saga. Darker than its predecessors, it asks the question that has plagued us for three years now: How will ""Spider-Man 3"" condense so many Marvel Comics' story lines and sub-plots into a 140-minute feature-length running time?I had my own reservations about such notions when it was first announced that Spider-Man would be facing not one, not two, but THREE super-villains, each with long, drawn-out back-stories (and many comic book issues) of their own. As a lifelong fan of Spidey, the creation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics, I was glad to hear that my favorite character (aside from Spider-Man himself) would be making a big-screen appearance now. After viewing the movie, another character becomes a favorite (more on this later).The ""Spider-Man"" title is well-known in the comics industry for being one of the best examples of a superhero whose problems outside of saving the world were given times and places in print to be properly fleshed out. Peter Parker (played superbly in the movies by Tobey Maguire, who's unsure if he'll return for part IV, if one ever manifests itself) was a geek, a loner, in grade and financial trouble, and had romantic woes; a bite from a genetically altered spider only compounded his problems. So this is why so many average Joes, like me, could relate to Spider-Man so easily. Although DC Comics had Batman and Superman, who both had great story lines, adventures and romantic entanglements of their own, it was Spidey's persistent personal problems that won over readers. The first two movies have addressed these perfectly.In ""Spider-Man 3,"" things seem to be looking up for our hero, both as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, though they won't be that way for long. It seems he's finally gotten his life together and everything is going his way: Spider-Man has saved New York City from certain danger so many times he's finally getting the respect he so richly deserves (including the Key to the City). At school, he's at the top of his class, and he's about to pop the question to girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).However, he is still haunted by his inability to patch up his friendship with best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spider-Man and Peter for his father Norman Osborn's/Green Goblin's (played in the first film by Willem Dafoe, who also shows up here posthumously) death, although much is still unknown to the son, who eventually transforms himself into the notorious Green Goblin II, the first villain. And even though Mary Jane is a great Broadway actress and Peter tries to reassure her of that fact, she earns terrible reviews for her performance and is painfully distressed by the news. But because Peter is letting his newfound fame go to his head, it's difficult for her to express her real feelings to him.The meat of the story gets underway when a mysterious black ooze bonds with Peter, and the alien symbiote brings about a darker side of his personality that threatens to destroy him. Once in the new ""black suit,"" he comes to add revenge to his list of to-do items when he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was involved in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, in flashback). Marko, on the other hand, while fleeing the cops, falls into an experimental vat and has his molecules zapped away, later reconstituting himself with the sand to become the Sandman. The Sandman becomes villain #2.Meanwhile, a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), wants Peter's job of peddling photographs of Spider-Man to editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). Brock is also dating Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who may or may not be flirting with Peter. Needless to say, when the two share a kiss and Mary Jane sees it, she doesn't take it lightly. The Black Suit continues an assault on Peter, who becomes increasingly hostile and once realizing what it's done to him, separates from it, the symbiote later bonding with a vengeful Eddie Brock to become Venom, villain #3. Can Peter Parker/Spider-Man overcome Green Goblin II, The Sandman and Venom (favorite), his inner demons, and get back Mary Jane and save the world within the allotted 140 minutes?Co-screenwriter Raimi returns to his love-labor project triumphant. While some things could have been better fleshed out, the 140-minute running time was really pushing it in terms of story. Still, he and brother Ivan's screenplay manages to play itself out reasonably, although I still believe much was left on the cutting room floor. It's also obvious Raimi's taken cues from the ""Superman"" movies on how to craft an epic story. It is true that ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to do a lot, but you have to give Raimi credit for doing what he was able to do, combing the pages of Marvel Comics and combining basically 40 years worth of storyline into 2 1/2 hours.While I doubt Tobey Maguire will probably return for another sequel, this is undoubtedly the actor's finest performance. It's amazing how well he was able to balance the tangled emotions of his tormented character. Although he has to be the least expressive good actor out there, I really liked him here, especially in his ""darker"" scenes. The other actors were good, including the great Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and especially Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman, who, like Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), earns our hearts as a sympathetic villain.For this fan, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a bit of a mixed triumph, but it's a valiant effort from actors and filmmakers that know the heart of their material well.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thanks for BUTCHERING Spiderman!!!,"Wow...just...wow. If I had to talk about all the things wrong with this movie in-depth, I could probably go on for hours. Hours that would be better spent than the hours I wasted sitting at this cornball cry-fest. First thing's first: Where exactly has Spiderman's ""Spider-sense"" gone?How does someone who can sense even the least amount of danger to himself (ie. getting hit by a car, etc.) not sense or see the spiraling meteor of fiery, gooey-black death falling 10 feet away from him? Oh yeah...he's too wrapped up in making googly weepy-eyes at Mary-Jane. That's another thing. This is in NO way a superhero movie. If you go into this expecting to be as blown away as you were during Spiderman I and II, allow me to pop that bubble. At most, amidst the random singing, dancing, weeping, angsting, and general ""WAH"" from Peter Parker, this comes off as a musical romance. A dramatic, musical romance. And here I thought I was sitting down to watch...oh, I don't know...Spiderman? All the awesome CG and special effects and acting of the last two movies seemed to have vanished into the night, as it seems the makers behind this little suck-fest hit bottom of the barrel and vomited out the worst possible script in superhero history. This was even more painful to sit through than The Hulk.The villains are non-existent. Want to know why? Because there are NO villains in this movie. Only...*sniffle*...misunderstood victims :'( Aw...waaaaaah. Sandman and Hobgoblin both are but beaten-down shadows of themselves, and the only semi-saving grace in that particular department has to be Brock in his Carnage-suit, and even that was a far stretch.As for Mary-Jane and Peter...never have I hated both characters more. Peter Parker is reduced to a whiny, emo-spouting gothchilde (seriously, he wears eye-liner at one point...EYELINER!) and Mary-Jane is sufficiently slutified, becoming a jealous, entitlement-obsessed ninth-grader, just enough to send Parker over the edge.All in all, avoid at all costs unless you want this particular franchise ruined for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I have two words to say - Uh oh!,"I have been amped for months to see this movie - this week I have been almost insane. As a 37 year old high school teacher who has grown up with every version of TV cartoon Spidey ever, I was thrilled in 2002 when the big screen version lived up the legend. Again in 2004, I was not disappointed with S2. I bought special 12:01am midnight tickets to see Spidey 3 tonight before most everyone else. Huge crowds of loyal fans filled three theatres at these sneak shows, and most of us are wondering - um what was that? I will not spend the time ranting about issues or spoilers, just let me say this - you may walk out of the theatre, scratching your head going What were Sam and Tobey thinking? It's not awful, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two. And the possibility of a fourth is in serious jeopardy. But I still love my Peter and his Mary Jane.

An awesome film to end Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. This film has the darker tone. 👍,"I was still in community college when the third film was released in 2007.

There were some emotional parts that I almost cried.What an awesome film to end the trilogy. Well done, Sam Raimi. 👏👏",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The No Win Scenario,"The first in the series was groundbreaking. The original, while fresh and exciting was not without it's flaws. With all of it's back story and build-up we were left with only the beginning, the first chapter in adventures yet to come and thus not as inviting to multiple viewings. A strong, charming film and a worthy realization of Spidey on the big screen, but it still, like Peter Parker himself, certainly had room to grow and mature. Enter Spider-Man 2. Hilarious, exciting, heartbreaking and sometimes all at once (look no further than the tour-de-force finale) it is not only a stellar ""superhero"" flick but a well crafted, emotionally powerful and sincere film of any genre. It had raised the bar for blockbusters across the board. Now comes Spider-Man 3. With word of a mammoth budget and incredibly high fan expectation, meeting status quo will and has been interpreted by many as failure. Public perception seems to be as of this writing, that the film is not up to snuff of the previous 2, however in truth it is as good in different ways than it's predecessors, just not better. This is a no win scenario as it no longer has the benefit of first time novelty and must raise the stakes across the board to not only deal with it's own track record, but several franchises that have become more mature and complex in their own right (Batman Begins, Superman Returns and even non-superhero pulled from comic epics like 300 and Sin City). So the film piles on even more battles, more set pieces with outcomes determining bigger stakes and even bigger sacrifices. As a whole it is quite a wonder to see how it all gels in the end and makes sense because there is a lot going on here. Unfortunately, fans and critics (especially critics) are often cynical with ongoing installments of any series, and here the most vocal and easily annoyed are given some legitimate ammunition. 1) There is far too much emphasis in getting characters out of their masks and reminding us of the actor's abilities and not realizing the characters themselves. Voices are rarely altered (this vocal oversight is most noticeably a problem with Venom) and characters rarely wear the full costumes and masks they have been celebrated and associated with on page for decades. It seems quite obvious the studio paid for names, and thusly want bang for the buck. So we not only get a number of big ""thespian"" moments of tears, songs and dance (literally) to satisfy actor needs to ""showcase"" but we also get Spidey to often without a mask, Goblin 2 who rarely uses the protective mask that you would assume he needs to be safe during his acrobatic daring do and a constant facial reminder of who exactly is playing Venom (and at times in poorly chosen moments which detract from menace). The viewer is often ""taken"" out of the film. 2)Not enough forward progression. Some loose ends are tied, but the film leaves many still dangling and some rather large ones open altogether! While there is redemption, on the whole there is a feeling that this is an ""installment"" rather than true closure. That being said, anyone who tells you the money isn't on the screen must have been watching a different film. From the quiet almost poetic creation of the Sandman as he forms human shape; to the many brawls throughout the film, leading up to the juggernaut finale, you get your CGI money's worth, even if you do loose a little of the humanity in all of the many computer pixels buzzing around. The human moments are still the franchise's strongest points and there's more drama here than a full night of 1980's prime time soap opera. The whole endeavor may be a victim of it's own excess, but only the truly jaded and cynical viewer wont appreciate the tapestry of spectacle and emotion woven by director Sam Raimi and Comapny for what is still a Summer blockbuster entertainment that aims to be more than a clichéd collection of one liners and eye candy. It has a lot to live up and to, and sometimes fails but it remains a worthy successor in truly unique escapist franchise. 'Nuff said.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Super dumb and super fun!,"Look this movie is hated so much and yes it is easily the worst of the trilogy but it's really not that bad. The action scenes like most of them in this series are super fun and entertaining, the final battle with all the villains is really cool and exciting. I really like Harry's story arc and how it finally concludes in this film, I really like sandman and his compelling story and the way his story ties back to Peter is a cool way to give his character motivation. The main problem with this film is the symbiote because it's just super unnecessary, venom is a throwaway villain in this film and the black suit is just an awful side plot that ends up with the iconic cringe fest that is the dancing scene, Mary-Jane is a manipulative cow and I cannot stand her character in this movie, Peter is dumb as hell and makes some of the worst life choices I've ever seen. Yes this movie has a lot of dumb stuff in it but as a massive Spider-Man fan I just can't help but love this movie, and to be fair if you watch all these movies back to back they just feel the same.

I liked it,"I liked Spider-Man 3, but the only problems i had was the dancing part, and i don't think there was enough Venom.

The black costume was coll, but the dancing part going on for 10 minutes was too much, but when the black spider-man fought Sandman in the subway, was awesome. I though that James Franco played Harry Osborn very well, Bryce Dallas Howard was good as Gwen Stacy but i don't think they used her good enough, and J.K. Simmons is always good as J. Jonah Jameson.

Yes it is a trilogy Mr Maguire,"Why is everyone raving over the special effects? At times some of the explosions from the green goblin no.2's grenades were hilariously bad. Also, the girder smashing through the building, again, hilariously bad. Blatant greenscreen at times also and some terrible backgrounds. Then there was the film. Overlong, stupid and forced performance by Maguire, the moneys gone to that ones head....Didn't the plot just plod and plod and plod?! It felt like a better movie on pause, seriously. I was just sitting in the theatre and the good side of my movie viewing brain was rotting, ever so slightly. Who wrote the script for this?! It was very funny, that it was so pathetically written 80% of the way. 'You gotta get back on the horse MJ.' 'oh don't gimme the horse thing again.' Classy. I mean haha, I've heard better dialogue in porn. Then like all the dialogue was about the woes of MaryJane. Reiterated about 20 times. Yawwwwwwwwn. We don't care. WE DON'T CARE. Story was superbly boring. Simply one of the dullest action movies I have ever seen. Not even saved by the action sequences. Which were generally weak, to short and very repetitive choreography wise. The action sequences came out of nowhere quelling my interest in them whatsoever and the score for the film did little to get the blood pumping. The action just felt sub par the whole way through. venom was a little pussy with no personality. Definitely a poor, poor screen treatment. What was Raimi thinking? Before seeing this I felt a little disappointed at hearing rumours that Maguire wouldn't want to be in anymore spiderman films. Now I think his explanation that it felt like a trilogy is more a nice way of saying I don't want to be in this film. Hell, maybe he performaed so annoyingly badly on purpose so as to give a more competent actor a chance in the role of spidey. If this ends as a trilogy its been a weak finish.Summed up in less lines: Weak baddies, weak fights, a slow, slithering pace. poor performances all round save for maybe James Franco. Script could have gone through many more drafts. So much unnecessary bits in there. Scores a couple points for the bit where parker has the venom power.4/10 Sorry about the convoluted way in which I sum things up here.

Do not mistake that the third is the best because it's not, that is what I thought as well but the best is the second. The film looked really amazing in the trailer with 3 villains but I was more interested in Venom not Harry or the Sandman because Harry is just the same as his dad in the first one and the Sandman is a similarity to the T-1000 in Terminator 2, but unfortunately Venom hardly appeared for about 10 minutes. The first appearance of all 3 villains was awful; the whole film is far too slow with a lot of useless scenes and lacks a decent story. It is supposed to be the most expensive film ever with a budget of $250 million but there is hardly anything I can see that looks expensive.

"""This movie make you feel your dark side!""",I gave this a 10 because I'm in favour of this movie. Please do not write to me messages about your opinions keep them to your selves.While the main hero struggles deeper with relationship with new characters shouldn't be considered a flaw. The movie isn't trying to focus so hard with the new comers which I'm glad about. It means more involvement with main characters and theirs struggles with one another.Uncle Ben death twist doesn't bother me. Since there are different recarnations of spiderman which have different circumstances to one another. There was a similar twist where Black Cats Dad is the real killer in the Spectacular Spider-Man show which was made shortly after this film.But please this film may have flaws but doesn't every other super hero film do.I'm a generous critic and some flaws are difficult to avoid no matter how hard you try. I'm not treating this film with arrogance or discrimination but with respect.I criticise with my opinion and not use other people's. Because I'm my own human being and I am no hypocrite.The reason I love this is it's different to the first two. In this film Spider-Man allies with a anti-hero who was villian at the throughout the film. To help him tackle the likes of Sandman and Venom.

What... Where.. And why did that just happen???,"I'm a great spider-fan, and both of the first 2 movies made my must-see-list, but the 3. just lacks a natural flow.It could appear like Sam Raimi did every thing right. More villains than the first two combined, SF that are breath taking and the spider get a new cool suit. Sadly it seems that despite the much larger budget than the first two, that the money came right out of the fund for the script. This is apparent in the ending or should I say endings. The script is so weak that it takes three fade-outs to tie up the most of the storyline and still you feel like something is missing, but luckily at this point in the movie, you have already stopped paying attention to the storyline.What ( I believe) is the problem with the storyline, is not, that it is all that bad but someone got something wrong, and wrote a movie that was supposed to be an hour longer. Then higher up someone said ""hmm we've already spent too much money on SF let just cut out all the cool parts and epic scenes, and make a movie out of those."" The end product became a movie that never builds any suspense and the web that holds the plot together is so weak, that the motives of both the heroes and the villains feels unreal, You never feel any empathy with any of them, with the two first movies really had going for them.The only thing left to comment is the characters. Mary Jane has suddenly completely changed from being a sweet, fresh, smiling girl, that is vibrant and always in touch with life, to something quit the opposite. In this movie she is weak, repressed and just depressing to watch. Peter Parker on the other hand changes his personality several times i the movie, signified by a different hairstyle and a bit of eyeliner (real subtle). This could have been cool but it just looks like a bad The Mask impersonation and make Parkers meeting with the dark side look like a joke.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Flawed finale,"Spider-Man 3 is a flawed finale with too many villains, out of character moments, a weird retcon and a rushed ending. However, it's still a good closing chapter to the trilogy that's emotional, epic and fun.Tobey Maguire is reliably incredible as Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot more emotional moments. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are great once again and J. K. Simmons continues to steal all of his scenes. Thomas Hayden Church is really good but sadly, Topher Grace is a pretty weak villain who lacks any screen presence.Sam Raimi's direction is great, his trademark sensibilities are still present and there's some extremely impressive action sequences, despite the annoyingly inconsistent CG.

Fragmented yet watchable.,"Spider Man 3 teaches a strong lesson: over expectation is not always good. Like most of the sequels Spider Man 3 could not, unfortunately, excel its antecedent Spider Man 2. Alas, Sam Raimis Spidey is caught in the web of too many foes this time- foes forcibly cut and pasted from the history of Spider Man 1( Sandman), and foes cosmetically invented. Like Dickens novels the movie has too many threads to be handled by the viewer. Obviously one or the other thread would be left untied in the end. There would be no other option amidst yawning audience in 2 hours 20 minutes duration but to feel bored at times. Character wise Mary J Watson disappoints through out the movie by means of her egocentric-ism. However it is Peter Parker/Spider Man who shines in his negative energy. Also the variety of shades in Harry Osbornes character are occupying. Although there is a feeling of fragmentation throughout the movie. Yet it could be lauded, clapped for and recommended because it seems to be propagating what is known as humanism. Remember Spider Man 3 is strictly an art NOT for arts sake. It is something beyond. The villainous projection of each bad man like Sandman and Venom is sort of justified in the light of human nature. Their demeanour though is loathsome, their psyche is never the same. We hate them not as we did Green Goblin or Dr. Octavius. And more ironically , perhaps for the first time viewers frown at hero and sympathize villains. However Spider Man 3 could be watched for its thrilling action sequences and portrayal of contradictions of human life.Sam Raimis 3rd Spidey is not as weak as the first part but nor is more stronger than the 2nd.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The greatest battle is for story development,"""Spider-Man 3"" is the latest installment of the ""Spider-Man"" superhero series. For me, this film represents the worst of the trilogy.The main problem in this film is its script. It has many threads, but never develops any of them strongly, so that the film becomes muddled and tedious. Rather than focusing on a jumbled array of side plots and three villains, this film should have focused on developing some side plots and one or maybe two of its villains instead. As it was, the plot developments that were put forth were mostly lax. The development of the ""dark Peter Parker"" subplot was actually laughable as Peter suddenly decided on a more conspicuous and blackened hair style and makeup. Even the film's final conflict wasn't particularly exciting.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's roles in this film aren't on par with what they had to work with in previous films. James Franco is proficient as Harry and did have some notable scenes. Thomas Haden Church is effective as Flint Marko, but the character was very underdeveloped by the script. Invariably the best performance of the film was from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Topher Grace's character was developed as a trite ""office rival"" and was unnecessary. However, Bruce Campbell's cameo as the Maître d' was amusing. Overall, though, ""Spider-Man 3"" was a disappointing entry into the superhero genre.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed and deceived by the trailer.  Still worth seeing for the action,"Overall I did enjoy it, but quite a big let down after the fantastic Spider-man 2. From the trailer, I thought spidey fighting his dark self was the main theme of the sequel, which would have been terrific. It turned out that self-conflict portion wasn't that a big part of the story afterall. The goo falling out of the sky was very interesting. I would have like to know more about it, where it comes from, and the way that it bring the darkside of someone. Well, maybe in SM4. I felt that actor was not a good choice to play Venom. I can't find hatred in that face, or just bad acting. Another problem I find is that this one has more lame dialogues than the previous 2 movies, some of the lamest. Nevertheless, it does have some of the best action sequences that I'd seen, awesome actions.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good, not Great.","The movie was good. Not great. Good. It was entertaining, but disappointing because it did not live up to the 2nd (which was an amazing film). I like Venom, I thought he looked very cool and I think Brock was good. The Church scene was great, just like the comics. Sandman just wasn't developed enough, I did not feel for him and his daughter story, nor did I really know what he wanted or much else about him. I really liked Harry. I thought he did a really good job acting and he was a pleasant surprise at the end. However, two thing REALLY bothered me: 1)The parts in the street with Peter dancing and flirting were so lame, I wish they were not in the film. We get that he's a ""bad ass"" as Venom already, they were unnecessary. Instead, they should have worked on developing Eddie Brock or Flint Marco more; 2) The American flag behind Spidey. Oh god! Did I ever want to puke! I mean come on!! Did the American government sponsor Spiderman??!! Just awful. Overall, it was a tad disappointing considering I'm a bid Spidey fan and I LOVED the 2nd one, but I enjoyed watching it and I plan on buying it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"very entertaining, both comically and action wise; not Venom's best portrayal, but given the time it was meritable","I recall abhorring this movie on my first watch, but that was 15 years ago. Rewatching it with a fresh outlook on film and being less judgmental than I used to be, I found myself enjoying it far more than I originally did. How they handled Venom was immensely disappointing when I first watched it, but now that we have a more proper Venom film, I can see the merit in this one. Besides, who doesn't love Topher Grace? He seems born to have played the polar opposite of Tobey Maguire, who I never loved as Peter Parker but thought he was a decent enough fit. That said, the weird and comical manner in which they portrayed Venom through Parker was odd, but Eddie Brock's ""version"" was much more satisfying. The ethically conflicted villain played by Thomas Hayden Church was great, and James Franco surprisingly effective both humorously and seriously. Then there's Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, perhaps my biggest reason for giving this a rewatch. And I'm not the least bit disappointed. Action and effects wise, everything was phenomenal especially for '07. Structurally the movie was kind of all over the place and way too long, but pacing never felt like an issue. Inferior to its predecessors but still very entertaining; and I'm not really a big Spider-Man fan to begin with.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Tale of Two Spideys:  Review of Spider-Man 3,"Life is perfect for Peter Parker. He has the woman of his dreams (who is making her debut on Broadway by the way); his freelance photographer job has him getting paid with some consistency, and there are even rumblings that a staff position could be open soon; and on top of all that, when he wears his pajamas in public, everyone adores him. Spider-Man 3 starts out all rainbows and lollipops for Peter and his friendly neighborhood alter-ego, but anyone who is a long time fan of Spider-Man knows the good times never last. Complicating Peter's moving-towards-perfect life are a former best friend who wants him dead, a grease ball of a photographer gunning for his job, and a little alien glob looking for a good time. Unfortunately for director Sam Raimi and co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alan Sargent, the problems with the script far out weigh any troubles Spidey is about to encounter.Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problem that many comic book sequels do  trying so hard to out-do your predecessors that you feel the need to add more villains, rather than focusing on the story-telling that made the original so good. In this movie we get Sandman, Venom, New Goblin (VERY creative) as well as Dark Spidey himself. The charm of the original story was that we got to know our hero and villain as people before we saw them with powers. With this many new characters, that evolution is lost, necessitating quick set-ups that turn the aggressors into cardboard cut outs and stereotypes. On top of that, while trying to force the action and origins of the villains, we get contrived set ups that bend our imagination to the limits. I'm all for ""Suspension of Disbelief"" when seeing a movie, but don't try to get me to suspend my intelligence and just accept what you're offering no questions asked. And therein lies the biggest flaw of Spider-Man 3.The storytellers expect you to take enormous leaps of faith with the story, asking you to blindly accept some major coincidences and convenient timing to keep the story moving forward. In example (and don't worry  no spoilers here), we're expected to believe that the experiment that eventually turns Flint Marko into Sandman is happening at a very insecure location close to New York, that it is not being visually monitored, and even when a scientist notices an abnormality before the experiment begins his report is ignored. The movie is riddled with inconsistencies like that, which makes the experience less enjoyable.What IS enjoyable about Spider-Man 3 are select performances, and the humor Sam Raimi weaves throughout the picture to break the tension. Tobey Maguire is allowed to have a lot more fun as Peter Parker, first allowing the city's love of his alter ego to go to his head. Then when that alien glob connects itself to Peter and starts playing upon some of his less admirable traits, Maguire shines. He's lovably out of place as a nerd with an attitude, then eerily overconfident when showing off to anyone who will pay attention. And it's even better when Spider-Man loses the conscience of Peter Parker.Topher Grace is a perfect anti-Parker as Eddie Brock. Cocky, uncaring for anyone but himself, and willing to do whatever he can to move his vision of a perfect life forward. You hate this guy almost from the get-go, and that's a good thing. Thomas Hayden Church's turn as Sandman doesn't give him much material to work, and every time they try to get a tear out of us for this unfortunate man, it leaves you rolling your eyes instead. For the lighter moments, J.K. Simmons reprising his role as Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson is a godsend. He embodies everything Spider-Man fans over the years have loved to hate about J-J-J over the years. And a nice turn by Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small role as the maitre d' at a snooty French restaurant is priceless.The other thing to love about the movie is the special effects. Marko's transformation into Sandman is really eye popping. The CGI for that character is extremely consistent and very appealing throughout the film. Raimi's direction through the action sequences is good, but it would be nice to start things off a little slow and build up to the quick cutting flights through the cityscape, rather than hitting us with that right out of the box. The first views of Venom left me wanting more, but the real problem is that there was no emotion in the villain's face, so anytime they wanted the creature to have a real conversation, they were forced peel back the costume and let Topher do the talking.There are a lot of holes in this film with which I had problems. Like where did the Spidey Sense disappear? If Harry's lone obsession is destroying Parker, then why is he going to a play? How does Brock know about Marko's power? And the biggest problem I have with just about every comic book movie  if these characters went 30, 40, even 50 years in print without anyone knowing their secret identities, why are there multiple people in every film that figure it out? But despite all those holes and inconsistencies, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. If you can grind your way through the long lapses in action, you will really enjoy it when you arrive. And for comic fans that have emotional attachments to these characters, some of the moments will have you cheering, and even squirming. Spider-Man 3 pales in comparison to its predecessors, but I still recommend you see it, rating it a 6.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A mixed bag and disappointing, but I still liked it for what it was","Everybody hates this movie for too many things going on, and Peter's little night at the Roxbury dance scenes. I completely agree that Spider-Man is a superhero and superheroes don't dance. It is completely unnecessary and is a big zero to the film even though it was sort of hilarious. However if they did not have him dance in the movie, I think it could have been a lot better and I think people could have like it better as well. This is a very mixed bag to say the least. However, I don't think having too many things is a bad thing because when you have more stuff going on it makes it more watchable. In Spider-Man 2, barely anything was going on and it was so boring to watch. In this one a lot of things are going and that is why I still liked Spider-Man 3 for what it was. The special effects are still outstanding as ever. I like the theme forgiveness in this movie and it anchors the film. I thought the cast is great. Kirsten Dunst is still good as Mary Jane. Thomas Haden Church is great as Sandman and I liked the subplot with that character. The CGI Sandman and the fight scenes between him and Spider-Man are awesome. I thought James Franco and Topher Grace stole the show. The conflict between Peter and Harry still works in the film. Franco helps anchor the film. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock fit perfectly as opposite Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and did a good job. A lot of people were disappointed with Venom and I was too but I also thought that it was awesome when Venom appeared in the movie but was not the real Venom I was expecting. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy but was completely underused here. Tobey Maguire has some great moments and tries very hard. I enjoy watching him sometimes and liked his evil Peter Parker moments, but he is just annoying and was ridiculous with his punk hair. I also thought he was too nerdy and took spider man as a celebrity way too far. The climax of the movie: They did a great job of setting up the climax and it was awesome seeing venom fight spider-man for the first time as well as fighting Sandman at the same time as well. It became exciting as it went on. I love the set up: Spider-Man and New Goblin vs. Sandman and Venom; perfect. But it started looking like a cartoon and was disappointing. Venom did not look like Venom anymore and they should have came up with something better with the Spider-Man and Sandman ending. But it was still overall satisfying. Also, J.K. Simmons is still perfect and hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson.The fight scenes, action sequences and special effects are even better than the previous films but it still looked like a cartoon. The cast makes it happen and I like that there was more plot lines and characters. But the dance scenes ruined the movie and Venom had barely any screen time. Maguire has great moments but is annoying and does too much.This is a mixed bag. Spider-Man 3 is good but it is disappointing that it is just good because good is not good enough for a huge event movie like this. Has great moments but also has sluggish moments as well.I still liked it for what it was. It just could have been great.Overall: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ambition killed its potential,"Spider-Man 3...the most awaited sequel of the year.By now, you should know the plot overview. Instead of a lone antagonist, the movie has opted to feature three villains. Yes, three villains! As if properly weaving three villains into the storyline was not already a lofty goal, the movie decides to dip its entire arm into the cookie jar by centralizing Peter Parker's rocky relationship with Mary-Jane Watson. In between the confrontations and fights, you will be treated to moments of tension between Peter and Mary-Jane as well as moments of lunacy on Peter's end.The movie's main problem is that it's overly ambitious. It seems that the production team wanted to cram as much as possible in 140 minutes. In doing so, a few of the characters were left largely undeveloped, the transitions from scene to scene were, at times, rough and absolutely lacking in style, and the plot eventually crumbles as it progresses.Do not get me wrong, though, the movie is entertaining. If anything, the movie's truly spectacular moments comes in the form of its action scenes. Believe me, the fight scenes are much better when compared to the movie's predecessors. The action choreography and the visual effects have been refined to near-perfection. Every hard hit and slow-motion event serves well in drawing you into the experience.The acting was all right. Rosemary Harris shined as Aunt Mae. On the lower end of the scale, however, Tobey Maguire stunk. Most of his 'sad' scenes had the whole audience in my theater laughing, what with his contorted facial expressions and all.Lastly, I have to comment on the movie's message. The theme here is revenge and evil. The movie brilliantly extends its theme to cover not only Peter, but the villains as well. However, any potential for a poignant perspective on revenge or hatred is shattered at the movie's childish treatment of such a deep subject. To summarize, the movie basically has this to say about revenge: ""LOL, like, revenge makes U da evil!""Despite being a good film, I have to nominate this as the worst Spider-Man in the series as of so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's not bad. There's too much going on, but it's still entertaining","After two wildly success movies, Sony's ""Spider-Man"" franchise led by director Sam Raimi seemed as if it could do no wrong. My, how spoiled we were by ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider- Man 2"" that we could be so naive.""Spider-Man 3"" isn't bad, just ambitious and convoluted. Like its predecessors, the story and screenplay's primary focus remains on Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), the man trying to balance being a student, a boyfriend and New York's No. 1 crime-fighter, and how his new journey will change his perspective on playing all those parts. It's the smallest juggling act of all, however, compared to the plot of this movie.""Spider-Man 3"" features three villains and four romances between five people. The numbers pretty much say it all there as far as the notion of ""too much going on"" is concerned. There's no reason a similar core story couldn't be told with half as many subplots, and as such the resulting story reeks of studio interference.The first big-screen appearance of Venom is certainly the big selling point, but if the core of the story is the sun, the story of Venom and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Saturn. The symbiote arrives via meteor shower early on, but doesn't latch on to Peter until an hour into the film (nearly halfway). Venom doesn't rear his sinister head until the 100-minute mark (that's all the time most films get). So ... did anyone really want to include Venom in this film?You don't get the sense that Raimi did. Sure, he and fellow writers Ivan Raimi (his brother) and Alvin Sargent find a way to genuinely connect the symbiote subplot to Peter's journey in the film and make it seem as if Venom's appearance is essential to this story, but it has no weight or power — just a lot of great visual effects work.The character of Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) comes off more like a Raimi kind of character. Like Dr. Octopus, and even in a sense Green Goblin before him, Sandman is a sympathetic villain as his motivation is to find the money to make his ill young daughter well again. But as with the film's many parts that show promise, the juggling act stunts it almost completely. Church's character and performance comes across as one- dimensional, especially after he disappears for the entire middle act.The other reason he would've been a fine choice as a solo villain is the way he's linked into the murder of Uncle Ben. To Raimi, Peter has never been able to get over the guilt of incidentally bringing about his uncle's death, and Marko's role in it complicates things for Peter emotionally. This story line provides the one true sense of continuity between the three films and could have potentially put a rounded punctuation mark and emotional note on Raimi's trilogy, but rather than have two characters who badly misunderstand each other duking it out, Venom has to join the party.Oh, have I not mentioned the third villain yet? As suggested in the second film's conclusion, Harry Osborn (James Franco) takes on the mantle of the New Goblin to avenge his father's death and kill Spider-Man, who he knows is Peter. Rather than talk it out with his best friend, he finds him on the street and tries to kill him. This whole subplot — despite being a thrilling action sequence — feels like unfinished business from the second film rather than an integral part of the third. In fact, it results in Harry suffering amnesia, at least as long as it takes to focus on developing the other subplots in the film before vengeful Harry becomes necessary again.Pause from the criticism to praise how high the action and visual effects bar is raised between ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man 3."" The CGI looks excellent and the early action scenes showcase Spider-Man doing aerial stunts like we'd never imagined.The other crowning achievement of the franchise has been the romance. We knew the fact that Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) finally came together at the second film's end wouldn't be so happily ever after, but now suddenly they are out of touch with each other's feelings and afraid to tell each other the truth despite MJ knowing Peter's biggest secret.After getting fired from her new show, MJ devolves into a needy and jealous character and Peter has let the fame of being Spider-Man get to his head. These qualities didn't exist before in these characters, but suddenly they do. To complicate matters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes between them as well. The story of the symbiote is meant to exacerbate their relationship problems, just as it does all the other subplots of the film. Actually, that is about as connected as it all ever gets. The symbiote suit is Peter's choice, and it has consequences throughout each element of the movie.This is Emo Peter's cue. The symbiote naturally has a negative influence on Peter, but rather than simply amplifying aggression or other emotions, it makes him cocky. Raimi gives Maguire this emo look and films him walking down the street handing out catcalls land doing a dance routine in the jazz club where MJ works to make her jealous. Raimi has never shied away from humor, but these scenes are tonally light years away from the rest of the film not to mention the franchise, and they sour nearly the whole movie experience.It's easy to deconstruct the problems of ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, and harder to admit that it's an engaging film with good intentions. Minus the emo sequences, it's just a disappointment, though it didn't have to be. If only there weren't an impossible amount going on, or at least someone told any of the film's creative minds that obvious fact beforehand.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Emo Spidey,"The writing sucked. C'mon Sam Raimi, give the damned screenplay and writing to someone else. You are an excellent director, but your writing sucks. Where was venom? WHY DIDN'T HE TALK LIKE VENOM? Venom had a bit part, when in the comic he was central. I guess cramming 2 and a half villains (""New"" Goblin doesn't count as a whole villain of course) in a feature-length film would require a bit of choppiness to the flow, which was what happened. A sad event to a character here, anger there.And what was with spidey in the symbiote suit? He looked like an emo kid. Ahh... isn't darkness and anger metal's realm? I may be nit-piking but emo kids usually spend a lot of the time tear-dropping, and not kicking all sorts of ass and being belligerent. Am I really that out of touch with kids these days? *sigh*By the way, Tobey McGuire did a fantastic job of acting out the anger and in-your-face attitude that comes with Evil Spidey. Well played, indeed. Whoever painted his face up and combed his hair and picked out his clothes should be shot. Repeatedly.I guess I'm just disappointed that the movie doesn't capture that same feeling of the human condition the first one did, and to a lesser extent, the second. I remember having feelings like parker did all the time when I was younger, dealing with all this crap at once.Now it appears that on top of all that he has an alien suit and a sandman to deal with. And, of course, what would a Spider-Man Movie be without a bunch of Mary Jane drama. What a load.The effects were pretty decent, I had the pleasure of not watching it in the theater (this strips movies of their ""shock"" value of the effects). Without 200 decibel, bass-heavy sounds you can really pay attention to the overall feel of the effects. Hooray for higher poly counts. Great. Whatever. The sand looks like sand. And, in many places, moves a lot like it. Whoopity-doo. Venom's spaztic and evil movements were pretty neat in my opinion, I'd like to attribute that to art directors and story board artists, and Todd McFarlane of course.Overall, comic book movies are reverting to the bland, cheesy, boring, cardboard crap the 80s vomited forth. Where's Dolph Lundgren? I can't wait for Transformers from Michael Bay, it might just be the knife in the coffin that sends the comic book movies back into hibernation just as the punishers and supermans did in the 80s.Christopher Nolan, we need you now!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Huge Disappointment,"spoilers maybeThis movie was probably the most highly anticipated movie I have ever seen. Maybe this is why it was such a disappointment when the movie was terrible. The plot of the movie is that Spiderman is know liked by most of the city because of his triumph over Doc Ock in the last film. In this new film, there are 3, basically four new villains. They are the sandman, the new goblin, venom, and the black-suited Spiderman himself. The sandman escapes from jail and is now lose in the city trying to steal money to help his sick daughter or something like that. Peter learns that the true murderer of his uncle Ben was the sandman. The new goblin (Harry Osbourne) now knows the true identity of Spiderman and seeks revenge on him for his fathers death. A meteor or something falls from the sky and in it is a black goo that takes over Peter Parkers' body while he is wearing the suit, which turns his suit black and turns his personality evil i guess. During all of this going on, Peter also struggles to maintain his relationship with Mary Jane and deal with a new photographer (Topher Grace) at work. Eventually the black goo leaves Spiderman and goes onto Eddie Brock (Grace)turn him into venom. I know it sounds like a lot to handle and that is the major reason why this movie turned out so bad.Bad because:There were too many things going on throughout the movie that it was like trying to followed 5 or 6 different stories all at one time. The movie focused too much of the relationship between Mary Jane and Peter that the was not much of Spiderman The ending was just plain retarded. Harry should not have died. Venom was only in the movie at the end for like 15 minutes when the whole movie should have just focused on his character and not the other villains. The main villain in my opinion was the sandman which i thought was the most boring character. Bryce Dallas Howards' role as Gwen Stacy was definitely not needed in the movie -the voice of venom sounded like a little girl. Spiderman jumping in front of an American flag. Characters that were in the movie at the beginning were not there again until the end. The sandman being able to fly through the air as a bunch of sand was corny. It was way too easy for Spiderman to defeat venom, all he had to do was make a loud noise. Tobey Mcquire dancingGood Because- The acting of James Franco, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, and Bruce Campbell The alley scence of Spiderman and the new goblin. Venom looked cool. Funny.

Too much in one movie,"There was too much in one movie. For the amount of material they had to write with it seemed long, dragged out, and rushed at the same time. They had the Sandman, Green Goblin Jr, and Venom all packed into one movie. They dragged out the not so important parts and hardly gave enough time for the important ones. For example Venoms entrance was weak. I won't say how it happened but it lasted all of 2 seconds. I think the movie was decent but could/SHOULD have been a lot better. I won't be watching this movie in the theater again, I don't even know if i'll watch it when it comes out on DVD. Basically there was more action in the previous Spiderman's than this one.

Venom just kind of gets shoe-horned in there but Sandman has a really good story and just kills it. Also Black Suit Spiderman is really dope. The entire train fight sequence is so cool and I don't think any other Spiderman movie can ever replicate that kind of badass stuff. The action as a whole is better.

OK but could have been better,"Spider-Man 3Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, J.K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard and Dylan BakerGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13It was 3 years after they released Spider-Man 2 and now there's Spider-Man 3. The first 2 Spider-Man movies were good and there were high expectations for this movie. So in this movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally managed to balance his relationship with Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) and his responsibility as Spider-Man while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is out for his revenge (with a new green goblin suit) on Peter for killing his father while Spider-Man is trying to take down Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) for killing his uncle. Peter Parker loses all hope until his suit turns black and becomes stronger and faster but effects his behavior with a darker attitude. Also we finally get to see Venom (Topher Grace) on the big screen after long awaited! This movie is alright but not the best out of the whole series. I really think that putting Sandman in this movie wasn't necessary, I thought Venom should have had more screen time and I thought this movie had too many sub- plots to it. Plus I didn't like it how they made Peter Parker so emo to the point where he acted like a little whiny bitch. Other than those nit picks, I thought the movie was alright but if they're going to go for a fourth movie then they need to not make so many sub-plots and stick to the main story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
To many in one film = Not enough.,"I had previously just watched the 1 and 2 movies just before and I was quite excited to see the conclusion of Sam Raimi's Spider-man trilogy.The movie tries to fit too much at once. Too many villains not settling on one main one like in the previous films.One of the things I extremely liked was how attached I was to the character, as I was constantly worried about his health. So clearly the movie didn't lack any heart whatsoever.The humor felt on. Not perfect but enough to make you laugh once in a while.Verdict: Spider man 3 suffers from too much. Too many high stakes, and too many villans. The movie is good but it doesn't meet the last two expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Do not take this film as seriously as the first two,This film was rather obviously toeing the line between comedy and serious action yet somehow manages to do so in a rather fantastic way. The film juggles a few plot lines and admittedly the Venom plot line could've been cut but the film really isn't afraid to have an unlikeable protagonist for a good portion. This is a really bold move that paid off tremendously and the scene displaying the birth of Sandman makes me wish I could give this film 11/10 stars.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Whether or not to watch Spiderman 3,"SPIDERMAN 3Undoubtedly, this year's most over hyped and anticipated movie was Spiderman 3. Over the last few years movies that have been over hyped have failed to live up to audience expectations. So does Spiderman 3 live up to the hype?The purpose of trailers is to draw audiences to watch the movie by showing captivating scenes from the movie. In action movies it's the most action packed scenes that we see. However, the thing about trailers is that they can't help judge how good the storyline and plot of the movie is. Producers and marketing executive have banked on this philosophy for the past few years. We all agree that the Spiderman 3 trailers got us fired up for the movie but how good is the story?Let's start with the good thingsThe action sequences were superb The action sequences were the best of all the Spiderman movies and probably the best to grace the movie screens. The fights were awesomeThey tried to incorporate comedy in the movie that works They tried to incorporate more light comedy into the movie than all the other Spiderman movies that actually works.The element of surprise Some scenes literary jolted me off my seat. I liked that.Sorry, that was all that was good about the movieI have to admit that when I heard that there were going to be three bad guys in the movie that got me fired up. Being the ultimate Spiderman fan, I swore that I was going to see it as soon as it hit the cinema. But it's because of these three bad guys in one movie that the storyline and plot are patheticIt doesn't fully pick up where it left off In Spiderman 2, Peter was struggling to balance school, a job, being Spiderman and love. He was failing miserably and this was made him unsure of his powers and ultimately was the reason he was losing them. In Spiderman 3, he's able to quite easily without an explanation of how.Plot and Storyline are messed up!!! The storyline doesn't flow. It's crowded with too many subplots. It's like a collection of short stories about Spiderman mixed together to form one. It's annoying because one story is barely over before another starts. If you were told to explain what goes on during the movie from start to finish, trust me, you wouldn't be able.There is too much coincidence Movies like this about coincidence, that I know, but the way it occurs in this movie sheds light on the fact that the writers did a bad job. It's like they were patching up things using coincidence so that the story would work.Some aspects of the movie aren't complete but the movie still moves on. Coming back to an earlier point, some things that happen during the movie aren't settled even to the end. I would like to give examples but I don't want to spoil for those who haven't watched.The main problem with the movie is that they tried to do too much in one movie. I understand that this was supposed to be the last one but not in the expense of making a good movie. I would have preferred if Spiderman went out with a bang.The most disappointing thing about the movie is the lack of strong themes and a strong message. If they were there they weren't brought out well.The music could have been better. I believe most producers and directors don't pay much attention to this but it's very important. More could have been done about this.If you want to know whether to watch it on big screen, its simple; that's the only way you'll enjoy the movie. The special effect and action sequences make it worth big screen.However, if you want to watch it on small screen it's not worth it unless you have a home theatre.It was an attempt by producers to buy audience using the expensive special effects rather than a good story, themes and message.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Going against popular opinion with this one.,"It seems like most people liked the first movie, loved the second one, but disliked this third chapter. But I think it is as enjoyable as the second one, albeit for different reasons. I agree that the plot and writing went down a bit as they tried to cram a little too much into it and it feels rushed at times, and a slightly overly complicated as well with too many characters only explored on the surface. On the other hand the actors really found their footing and it shows; Tobey Maguire does a great job at portraying the ""dark arc"" of Peter Parker. And overall the movie does feel a bit more grandiose and epic, as a superhero movie should be. All in all, still highly recommended as a great conclusion to the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A step down from the 2nd,"Revenge is like a poison....it can turn you into something ugly.The final installment in the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. Now Spider-Man, being famous and all, had to face new dangerous enemies while reconciling with people close to him.For a movie with multiple villains, I was pretty disappointed in terms of storyline. There's too many central characters to make each of them compelling. Also because of this there's less time dedicated to Peter Parker as a character. I don't think the movie went deep into Peter's character as much as it should like in the second one.For the positives, the action was definitely better. The fight between Spider-Man and Venom and Harry Osborn were entertaining, although they could be disorienting at times. Of course, Toby was just rocking it as Peter Parker, who became more edgy and cool. That iconic dancing in the street scene was so funny. That's another good thing: there were more comedic moments that worked well.Overall, I still enjoyed it, although I wanted more. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't know why it gets so much hate!!!,I think this movie is much better than the first spiderman and obviously has better villains than the both 1st and 2nd installments of the trilogy.

Shallow comic book story,"What can one say about a movie that is entirely devoid of intellectual content? Such a movie defies review because there is nothing substantive to review. All the talent, all the time, all the money and all the other creative resources that were expended to make this movie are ultimately wasted, all for nothing. Spiderman and his enemies are comic-book characters and no amount of special effects can change that fact. The characters are insipidly shallow, but what else is to be expected from a comic book story brought to the screen? That does not mean that movie can't be a moneymaker because it is a commercial product, but even compared to Superman or Batman, the movie does not contain enough intellectual content to sustain any drama. But if this is the kind of escapist fare that sells, then more power to the market place.There is one exception to the above comments. In this movie Thomas Haden Church once again proves that he is a great actor.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why Sam? Why?,"I would give this movie less than a one if it was possible. This is hands down one of the biggest disappointments.I came in with the highest of expectations and it managed to fall so short of these that I actually am amazed.The movie seemed hastily thrown together, with more characters than they knew what to do with. They would introduce one, then through terribly written plot, they would place them on the back burner while they introduced another superfluous character. I could not believe that this was the same director as the first two.Aside from the horrendous character selection they also managed to make the movie as corny as they possibly could. (Spoiler Alert) Franco and Maguire must have cried about seven to eight times between them.SPOILER ALERT: here is the number one reason why it was terrible: Venom is in it for 15 minutes and mostly sports the head of TV's Eric Foreman (Topher Grace). They managed to make one of the most bad ass villains in comic history the biggest pu$$y of all. It seemed as if they threw venom in last minute and decided to just film him getting his a$$ kicked most of the time.All in all I beg you not to see this movie in theaters, I can not believe what a waste of time and money it is.

"Spider-Man 3 suffers from poor writing, underdeveloped characters, and recycled plot elements.","My daughter and I recently watched Spider-Man 3 (2007) on Netflix. The storyline picks up with an alien substance arriving on Earth, attaching itself to Spider-Man, and amplifying his darkest instincts. Meanwhile, Mary Jane struggles with her own ambitions, and a new villain emerges. As Spider-Man grapples with this strange ooze, he loses sight of what's truly important, jeopardizing his relationship with Mary Jane. Can he salvage their relationship while also dealing with the alien influence and a new criminal threat?Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead), this film stars Tobey Maguire (Brothers), Kirsten Dunst (Melancholia), Topher Grace (That '70s Show), Thomas Haden Church (Wings), James Franco (Spring Breakers), and Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help).What should have been a monumental chapter in the Spider-Man series turned out to be a huge disappointment. While Sandman was a well-crafted villain with perfect casting, the introduction of Venom, which should have been the highlight of the series, felt rushed and underdeveloped. The film spends far too much time rehashing the love triangle between Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry-a subplot that didn't need a third installment. The portrayal of ""cool"" Peter was awkward and cheesy, particularly in the infamous club scene, which fell flat. The CGI, at times, was excessive, and the final battles, despite featuring formidable villains, were ultimately underwhelming.In conclusion, Spider-Man 3 suffers from poor writing, underdeveloped characters, and recycled plot elements. The entire project feels rushed. I would score it a 5.5-6/10 and only recommend it to diehard Spider-Man fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as Good as the First Two but Fun Nevertheless,"This film isn't as good as the first two, the plot is a bit messy with 3 separate villains all fighting for screen time, the visual effects look clunky, especially those of venom, and there are some scenes that are down right laughable, still that isn't always a bad thing. The first two films are good movies, this film is a good superhero movie, there are lines of dialogue so corny they wouldn't feel out of place in the 60s Batman show and that dancing, oh that dancing. I like the cast, I think Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco all do well and I liked the portrayal of Sandman by Thomas Church, the problem I think was Topher Grace, I don't necessarily think it was his performance that let down the film but after he gets the symbiote I feel the film goes down hill. As always Danny Elfman is delivering a great score and I like the direction by Sam Raimi. This isn't a great film but it's silly and light-hearted and definitely not a waste of time to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing Thomas Church in the new Spider-Man film and wouldn't be completely against seeing Topher Grace as well although preferably not too much of him.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie Sucked plain and simple!!,"Let me start by stating that I am a comic book fan and purist. Given that, I enjoyed the first two movies even with the deviations from the original story. Also I am a HUGE Sam Raimi fan I'm talking from the days of Evil Dead. But sometimes he makes crap movies (example ""The Gift"" ""Hard Target"" ""The Quick and the Dead""...Should I go on?). Spiderman 3 is one film that can be added to that list of crap. Don't believe these people that say ""Spiderman 3 was Amazing"" or Awesome or any other positive adjective describing this film! Well I won't go into movie details but here are my reasons why this movie Sucked!!!Problems with the movie: 1. Too many plot lines to develop anyone into a good story 2. Horrible dialogue along with acting (surprisingly James Franco actually did a good job) 3. Appears like Tobey Maguire just honestly did not care about this role or he is an over-rated actor. (I'm leaning toward the latter) 4. Tried to be too funny and wasn't!I hope I was able to convince you to save your money and time on this over hyped and under achieving movie.

Doesn't compare at all to the first 2 films in the series,"OK, perhaps 1 is a bit harsh, but I felt that there's some demographic out there that's not accurately reflecting the awfulness of this film.

Aside from CG effects (some of which look fake anyway), the film is quite empty. There are too many villains, first of all. B/c of the number, they end up being half-developed and lacking character. There's inconsistency as to why there's even a meltdown in MJ's and Peter's relationship.

Too many coincidences, too many pointless scenes which were dragged on for way to long.

A hodge-podge of intense emotion and action sequences,"Spiderman 3 would be a better movie if there hadn't been so many things happening at once. Sandman, Green Goblin, Venom and Spiderman's dark sidehow many things? In my opinion, they should have toned it down and put some stuff in spiderman-4. My sister ( was disappointed that Venom (arch nemesis) was killed so easily. BUTAlthough all of these conflicts seemed overwhelming at times, I felt that this movie was taken in the best way with all of those conflicts. Anyways, Richard Corliss (Time Magazine) accurately commented on how the male characters in this movie were more ahem* sensitive than usual. I daresay that Spiderman cried much more than all the women put together in the movie and at the end his sobbing became so intense that my cousins started laughing. Maybe I am weird, but Peter Parker seemed so emotional and boyish to me that I was happy when he turned into the tough and insensitive guy for a change. Sandman also shed many tears, sinking this movie to an unusual depth. Although I found this male crying thing different, I'm not sure whether it aroused tears or snickers. I guess it's different for everybody and you'll have to decide for yourself",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""None of that matters now, you're my friend""","After the brilliance that was Spider- Man 2, this movie was a big step down in terms of quality. The main problem being that there is just too much going in in the script, that it all comes out as rushed, half baked, and often cheesy and contrived.All the main cast are back again. Tobey Maguire does get to deliver some good scenes, like his anger over the Sandman/Ben connection, and his conflict with Harry Osborn. But he also delivers some cringe worthy stuff, notably the dancing stuff.Kirsten Dunst is absolutely dire as MJ. She irritates, moans, criticizes, and cries her way through the movie. She is truly unlikable in this movie. She commits so many offenses in this movie. From her hypocritical behavior over the Spidey/Gwen publicity kiss, to giving into Harry's empty threat to break Peter's heart, to her constant whining about her fading career.James Franco is probably the best actor of the movie. Although his character falls short in some areas. For starters he is not a Goblin. He is a guy in a black jumpsuit on a hoverboard. His grand revenge plan is nothing more than a silly break up of Peter and MJ, which made no sense. He spends a lot of the movie as a nice guy with amnesia, too. That said, he does deliver some great stuff. Notably his gloating to Peter about breaking him and MJ up. And that mansion fight was superb. His death scene was also emotionally great.Then we have Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church, an actor who is utterly wasted in this movie. Sandman seems like an out of place element. He is a poor thief, who just wants to steal some money to help his sick daughter. But he's got a backstory. Turns out he's the guy who actually shot Uncle Ben. The other guy from Spider-Man 1 was just an accomplice. A horrible and needless contrived connection of Sandman to Peter. Sandman's is a visually pleasing villain (his birth scene is incredible), except in the scenes where he grows to giant proportions, and comes across as a retarded version of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Church is a fine actor, but he is just a cog in a CGI machine. He has so little dialogue.Topher Grace plays the third baddie in the movie's trio of villains. He is Eddie Brock, a cocky and sleazy photographer competing with Peter for a permanent staff job at the Daily Bugle, who eventually becomes the symbiotic villain, Venom. He is even less used than Church. The script leaves him very little room to even become an important element until the climax.Bryce Dallas Howard plays iconic Spidey girl, Gwen Stacy. She's sweet, charming, pretty....and pointless. She is an object of Eddie Brock's affections, but this is only mentioned in ONE brief scene between them. She is simply a plot device to make MJ needlessly jealous. A darn shame, because Howard was ten times more likable than Dunst's MJ.The supporting cast like Aunt May and Jonah Jameson unsurprisingly have less screen time, but are still solid in what they are given to work with. Especially Aunt May, when she lectures Peter over the evils of revenge.The whole symbiote storyline was also excess baggage. Just look at how the symbiote is introduced. It falls from the sky, and randomly decides to hitch a ride on Peter's scooter. Why?The movie was supposed to be the darkest of the trilogy as it dealt with the whole theme of revenge. But it actually has more cheesy jokes, campiness, and off color jokes than the other two movies.But a lot of this was down to Sony, as they saddled Sam Raimi with characters that he didn't want to use: The symbiote storyline, Eddie Brock, and Gwen Stacy. I give him points for doing the best he could in a difficult situation.The movie has it's faults, but the good out weighs the bad whether it be the conclusion to Peter and Harry's arcs or the fight scenes. Spiderman 3 is a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Following Batman's decline apparently,"I have to tell you I am a sci-fi geek and a comic book geek. Its pretty hard to ruin one of these movies, and yet this one was ridiculously gluttonous and completely left the Spiderman formula, that was working, behind.Let me start with the positive. The special effects were top rate. When you compare the special effects from Spidey 3 to Spidey 1 there is quite a leap. Sandman was just incredible to watch when he was on screen, though note to directors, lets chill on the Thomas Haden Church close ups, I wanted to hand him some lip balm and face moisturizer! Venom was a little more cartoony, where Sandman was just visually cool. So the special effects team, top marks.As for the movie itself, look its 140 minutes I will never have back. Peter Parker sings and dances in a jazz club for crying out loud. We have to endure Kirsten Dunst singing. We have to endure the introduction and set up of Flint Marko (Sandman, Eddie Brock (Venom), and Gwen Stacy. The only one I felt was handled appropriately was Gwen Stacy, and thats only because she was a lesser character therefore she didn't really require as much. And and the vengeful Harry Osborne (New Green Goblin?)into the mix and you have a movie that is very reminiscent of the god awful ""Batman and Robin"" with all those cast of characters they seemed to try to ram down your throat. ENOUGH.As a result of this decision to inundate us with new characters, and still try to intertwine the troubled love story between Peter and MJ (I just don't care about by the way), the movie over reached. It couldn't pull it all together. What is needed is to go back to the one villain format with the angst of life on this. We attach ourselves to the problems of Peter's personal life. But you can't properly take care of that aspect with an interesting angle on his personal life AND properly take care of the real thing everyone came to see.

Most underappreciated movie sequel,"After 14 years and watching it for 15+ times, I think, this is the most underappreciated sequel. I liked it when I watched it the first time especially, the evil Peter Parker (he was the best interpretation how the symbiote will affect that version of Peter Parker). Then, the death of Harry was inevitable and necessary. Three villains were the best thing that happened to the movie. One redeemed and sacrificed himself, one was not entirely evil but need made him evil and he sided with the good, the third one was the true villain but even he had layers as Eddie Brock. Had there been a Spider-Man 4, we would have gotten characters that could have been leaps and bound richer, character wise cuz this was the base. One aspect is that this movie was kind of a turning point in Peter Parker's life as he became more mature. Other technical aspects like cinematography, editing, VFX were top notch.This movie is slowly turning into a classic and still being talked about extensively, for good or for worse.

An amazing end to the trilogy.,"When Spider-Man 3 begins, everything is going great for Peter Parker. New York finally loves and supports Spider-Man, he's doing great in school, and his relationship with Mary Jane couldn't be better. In fact, he's going to pop the question. Unfortunately, things start happening that get in the way of Peter's plans. Harry Osborn returns as the New Goblin and tries to kill him, he finds out that a new villain called the Sandman is his uncle's actual killer, and a strange alien creature takes the form of a black costume and tries to possess him. The alien begins to make Peter more aggressive as his new found fame goes to his head, making him cocky. Finally, Peter realizes that something is wrong, and he gets rid of the strange substance. Unfortunately, the creature attaches itself to Eddie Brock, a man who has lost everything to Peter Parker, and a new villain is formed. Quite possibly the most evil and deadliest villain Spider-Man has ever faced. Though this movie isn't as good as the first two in the series, it's still amazing and a lot of fun.What I liked about the first two movies was that they had a formula to them that allowed for plenty of personal drama for the characters as well as plenty of action. In this movie, Sam Raimi tries to squeeze in tons of personal drama between Peter and Mary Jane as well as Peter and Harry, and Peter and Eddie Brock, and Sandman and his daughter, and the list goes on, while also having action scenes featuring New Goblin, Sandman, a malfunctioning crane, and eventually Venom. This made certain scenes seem rushed and pointless. I liked that they kept the movie both funny and serious, because the humour in this series has always been a high point for me. The twenty or so minutes where Peter becomes evil were so enjoyable and humorous to me that I just couldn't stop smiling. The plot isn't that bad because it covers all the points that needed to be covered, and by the end of the movie it ties everything up nicely, leaving no need for a 4th film though I'm sure that it will happen. The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The crane sequence was done really well and featured some of the best special effects yet. Also, the ways Spider-Man maneuvered in that scene were amazing. Both of Peter's fights with Harry were incredibly awesome. They were the most violent and intense fights in the whole series, and I loved them. As with the first two films there were a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe. Sam Lee's cameo in this film was his worst cameo to date. Now, what I really didn't like about this film was the characters of Sandman and Venom. The movie needed New Goblin because it was a continuation, but either Sandman or Venom should have been cut out. My reason is that Sandman was pretty much pointless to the rest of the story, and if he was gone, Venom could have had more screen time and development. If Venom was taken out, his character wouldn't have been destroyed the way it was. Venom had so little screen time that it literally annoyed me. And half the time he was on screen, he retracted his mask so it was just Eddie Brock with a black suit on. I really didn't like what Raimi did with the character, though I am happy I saw him in live action at all. I also didn't like that Mary Jane was whining about Peter being Spider-Man through the whole movie, and that by the time the movie ended, Peter still hadn't proposed.The acting in this movie is just as good as the other two. Tobey Maguire did a good job playing both the good and the evil Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst played Mary Jane well once again, though I didn't really like her character in this. James Franco did an amazing job as Harry in this movie, especially when he was insane. He gave his best performance in this movie. Thomas Haden Church was pretty good as Sandman, he looked the part, but he didn't really get to do a whole lot with his talent. Topher Grace was funny as Eddie Brock, and he was surprisingly good when he became Venom. He's no longer Eric Foreman to me.Overall, the first two films are better, but Spider-Man 3 is an amazing ending to this trilogy, and if they decide to make a 4, 5, and 6, I hope they can be as epic and as interesting as these films were.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The (not-so-guilty with time) guilty pleasure.,"Rewatching this again highlights the incredible and barely touched upon story of Flint Marko, who is very underrated and under-utilised.Unfortunately, this film's flaws are what it is most known for. The jazz club dance scenes, the entirety of Emo-Parker, the unnecessary and hindering subplot of Venom which undermines the completion of Harry's (still weak) arc, and fleshing out Marko's new yet connected arc. However, most of these aspects have become so iconically bad that you can still enjoy the rest of the film, which truly shows Raimi's ability to continue to tell a compelling Peter Parker story despite studio interference.MJ continues to simultaneously have one of the most interesting and complex love interest characterisations in any comic book film, and still always ends up as the damsel-in-distress in the third act of every film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Takes time to fully appreciate,"When people think of this film they have negative thoughts because of:1. The villains (mostly venom)2. Bully MaguireThe Sandman doesn't have a reason to be against Spider-Man. He doesn't want to hurt Spider-Man. He just wants to steal money and be on his way. For example, Green Goblin WANTED Spider-Man dead, causing HIM to chase spidey. I Eddie Brock is the only one who wants Spider-Man dead, but that is a smaller plot line that we all can agree is pretty weak. Now, Spider-Man is also not worried about chasing the Sandman. He has found the venom symbiote and has transitioned in ""Bully Maguire"" he is driven by his own ego and his ultimate goal is to make Mary Jane miserable. Peter Parker is a villain. The resolution to the movie is Peter realizing that he needs to forgive others and do what is right. The theme of this movie is forgiveness. Harry Osborn forgives Peter for killing his father, and Peter forgives the Sandman for killing uncle Ben. In the end, this is more than just some superhero movie. Its an emotional tale of redemption.

"Perfect, if you hate films, scripts and acting","I rather liked the first two films, and I understand that this is a big, colourful blockbuster sort of a movie, but when exactly did Sam Raimi just stop caring?

No, now it's a song-and-dance extravaganza!), combined with Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst and Topher Grace all competing to out-suck one another all adds up to a film that is both poorly executed and - bizarrely, given the subject matter - deathly dull.

Maybe if they left out Venom and Gwen Stacy, this could have been a better movie. The ending death scene made me tear up and I cannot watch that part anymore without feeling a sense of sadness.

The rumors are true - Spidey 3 is the best of the lot!,"By now you've all probably heard the rumors about the quality of Sam Raimi's latest addition to the pantheon of big-screen adaptations for comic book classics (aka Spider-Man 3). If not, let me give it to you straight and simple: they are all true.Spider-Man 3 is the best film of the Spider-Man trilogy to date. In fact, it's bigger and better than its predecessors on so many levels; I don't even know where to begin. It's in this third installment of the series that the director allows the now matured and established characters to fully realize themselves. By doing so, Spider-Man 3 becomes a plot-driven piece of film, alongside being your lovable big-budget summer uber-buster as well. It is this cinematic achievement that'll make future audiences admire this film long after its initial box-office impact will worn off. And trust me; this will be an enormous hit from a mile if I've ever seen one (note that this review is typed on Thursday, April 26th, 8 days before Spider-Man 3's US premier, after I had the pleasure of attending a special press screening in Ramat-Gan, Israel).The thing is, I've never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man. The second one was much better, in my opinion, but only after seeing it I realized how much the original was required in order to establish the three main characters - Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mare Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco). This time around, this impossible love triangle finally dukes it out, as other character building devices, such as Osborn's oath to avenge his father's death, Parker's long yearning for MJ and his deterrence in finding anyone linked to his Uncle's death in part 1 - all reach a staggering crescendo, with some extremely dramatic consequences. On top of this all, Parker also has two brand new enemies to fight off - one of them being the alien form commonly referred to as Venom (Topher Grace in a nice change of style from his usual shenanigans) and the other being a small time escape con who by chance enters a scientific facility and is transformed into the Sandman (the always wonderful Thomas Hayden Church).At the end, it all comes down to a battle between good and evil, with messages of redemption and remorse playing a crucial role in the way the plot unfolds. The digital effects are at the top of their game as well, and entertain at the purest level of awesomeness (sorry, couldn't find a more subtle word). At some point, I remember telling my girlfriend what a great time I'm having - something I don't remember saying at the theater for some time now. Also, I am very glad the writers tried to close as much arcs as they could, making the trilogy as a whole smarter and more satisfying.As expected, Spidey 3 is not without its flaws, with many dialogs being somewhat cheesy and mostly clichéd (although it is a comic book adaptation, so don't expect Shakespeare), and a lot of the religious/patriotic themes were a little too much to bear. However, this all doesn't really matter that much when you're watching a film like Spider-Man 3. The main idea here is to sit back and enjoy, and hope Summer 2007 can maintain this level of quality throughout its upcoming blockbusters.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Arrogance Of Fame,"Also known as the worst one or the crap one but its actually not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure it was really messy, has pacing issues and tried to fit too many things but it was a good movie. Certainly not as good as the other 2 and has aged the worst in terms of visuals but it works and is perfectly watchable.If Spider-Man 2 was the burden of the mask then Spider-Man 3 is the arrogance that comes with fame, which has mixed result. The Emo Parker scene is almost universally hated but its my absolute favorite part of the movie and one of my favorite moments in any Spider-Man media be it movies, games, cartoon, animated or even comics. I will always love that part of the movie and maybe thats why I'm more fond of this movie than most other.Obvious problem was Venom which was just bad, it was absolutely unwatchable and its such a shame too since so far Sam Raimi has nailed the essence of every Spider-Man villain up until now. Compared to Tom Hardy Venom this is the equivalent of Facepaint Deadpool from the Wolverine movie.But everything else was fine. And its not as bad as people remember it to be. But it has to be said that it feels lacking when it comes to being a trilogy ender. Could've used another movie to properly wrap up the Sam Raimi run.RATING: 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Painful,"I never expected this movie to be Oscar worthy but i did expect it to be watchable but i was so wrong, it was actually painful to watch! I have always been a fan of Dunst but her acting in this was simply shocking she had the emotion of a dead dog and her and Maguire had absolutely no chemistry whats so ever although Maguire's acting was stand able the movie itself was weak had no really plot it could not keep to a single storyline and the ending was predictable, if i could change time and not watch this movie i would do it in a second it was not worth the cinema fee, i would never recommend this film it isn't worth getting out of the chair for.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Decent action flick, but the weakest of the trilogy.  Wait for video.","First let me say that I'm a big fan of the review written by this guy: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur15235922/comments I agree with every word he wrote. In fact, I liked his review better than I liked the movie.I really *wanted* to enjoy this movie. You have to truly *want* to enjoy in order to like it at all. I left the theater feeling slightly entertained, but only because I strongly yearned for it.The movie is weak from beginning to end. It has all the parts needed for a great action flick, but with no continuity. All the separate scenes felt disjointed and slopped together. The characters go through changes almost at random, every 5 minutes. Peter Parker's comic change in the middle of the movie was over the top, but it worked for me. It was meant to be comical and it was. The rest of his emotions were almost ridiculous. Every time he cried the opening-night audience around me laughed hysterically.I won't ruin the ending. I don't need to. Just think, ""cliche"" and you already know the ending. The movie was drowning in sappy emotion towards the end. I can just imagine the writers of this script sitting around saying to each other, ""Everyone does movies with non-stop action til the end. Let's deliver a real message."" I choked on that message as it was crammed down my throat.And in the end, they finished off with even more sappy emotion which left me totally unsatisfied. No uplifting joy at the end of this movie. Even as the credits rolled, it was a soft, slow, almost depressing music that played.All around, just BLAH. Wait for the DVD rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Could've been great, but doesn't quite make it.","Spider-Man 3 seems to follow the same basic blueprint of Spider-Man 2. Peter and MJ start to have relationship troubles, he begins to consider what Spider-Man means to him and how it's changed his life, all while a new villain is created and hatches a plot to get spidey.But where it was done so wonderfully in Spider-Man 2, it suffers in this film. This is due mainly to two things. Firstly, we've already seen it before so it doesn't feel fresh as it did in #2. Secondly, Spider-Man 2 had only one villain so the story focused completely on Doc Ock and as a result he became a very multidimensional and compelling character. In this installment, the villain duties are shared between Venom and Sandman, and neither character is developed anywhere near the level Doc Ock was. Venom in particular is presented almost as an afterthought, though Topher Grace does do a good job as Eddie Brock.There's a sequence in the film where Peter, possessed by the symbiote (the thing that gives him his black suit) starts doing some crazy things behaviour-wise. Although it's meant to be serious, they seem to go way over the top with it and it comes off seeming like little more than comedy relief. This particular sequence doesn't really seem to fit in the film very well.The Harry Osborn story gets mixed up here too as he takes not one, not two, but THREE character turns in the course of the movie and the subplot involving him seems underdeveloped and rushed.On the plus side, the special and visual effects are spectacular, save for one particularly cheesy scene where Spidey just happens to jump right in front of an American flag. The main actors do a passable job, Kirsten Dunst likely gives the strongest performance as MJ, also Rosemary Harris delivers another sweet yet strong performance as Aunt Mae.The other bright spots acting wise were J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and the incomparable Bruce Campbell as an extremely funny french maitre'd in one particularly memorable scene.In conclusion, the film is a bit of a letdown, but the disappointment is compounded by the fact that all the pieces were here for a great story, but it just didn't pull together like it could've. Definitely worth the price of admission though, even an average Spiderman movie is a pretty darned good superhero flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Long-time fans of Spidey or fans of competent storytelling should avoid this one!,"It appears painfully obvious that Sam Raimi is not as good a writer as he is a director. The writing for this film is beyond mediocre and insults my intelligence as a film and comic book aficionado. All of the characters in Spider-man 3 do not interact as normal human beings would in real life. This hurts the emotional connection you're supposed to make with Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. This stems from someone who does not understand how to write real characters into a script. These are not the same characters who I loved watching in the first two films, these are imposters. It seems even the actors know they are in a bad film because they give a boring and dishonest performance. One of the reasons people go to see a Spider-man film is because of the creative villains. In Spider-man 3 both the Sandman and Venom get cheated out of screen time to serve the purpose of continuing the badly written love triangle between the main characters. The only time I smiled and was mildly interested was when Aunt May gave Peter advice or when J.J. was doing his comedic part. Sadly they get very little screen time as well.I think Spider-man 3 was ironically the end of Spider-man for all the die-hard fans that turned up for the superior Spider-man 1 and 2.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Movie,"This was, by far, the best Spider-Man movie of the three. It had the greatest story of all three, which is very complex so some people might confuse it with being 'all over the place'. The acting was great, and Tobey's change in character, from good to evil, was interesting. The one thing I was disappointed in was the change in music conductors. It had a StarWars feel to it at some points. Other than that, the many characters had a real reason for their actions that made sense, the acting was great, some dialogue was very close to the comic's, and it had great action scenes with romance and touching moments. It is a must for any fan of Spider-man or someone looking for a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Exploration on What Makes a Film Bad or Good. No Seriously.,"I remember back in May 2007 walking out of the theatre after watching Spider-Man 3, one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, and thinking to myself, ""that was pretty good."" I was about 16 at the time, and like any 16 year old, parting with $10 just to admit the thing I paid for *wasn't good* was impossible. Yet, I remember going to my friend's house after and his sister asking me, ""how was it?"" And my answer?""Pretty gooooood."" I stressed the good because I knew, deep down, Spider-Man 3 wasn't good. It was a pretty bad movie, actually. Yet, years (and memes) later, a whopping 8 Spider-Man movies later, three Spider-Men (yes, I'm including Miles, fight me), and I think we can safely say, Spider-Man 3 wasn't *as bad* as most of us originally thought. Perhaps because we have so many filmic depictions of the character to choose from nowadays, this film doesn't come off as nearly as bad. I also think it's because we've seen far worse films (i.e. The Amazing Spider-Man series).The Good:1. It's funny. Like REALLY funny. Spider-Man 3 is a perfect example of ""so bad it's good."" There are so many unintentional (and perhaps, secretly intentional) moments that will have anyone cracking up like crazy. James Franco plays the funniest and dopiest version of Harry Osborn you could imagine. Topher Grace's Eddie Brock literally PRAYS in a church for God to ""kill Peter Parker"" with complete sincerity. There are so many weird and awkward side characters spouting hilarious one-liners, you can't help by have tears in your eyes by the end of this. Who can forget Emo Peter and his goofy sequence? Who could forget the jazz club scene? The pie scene with Harry?I suspect that Raimi, clearly not being a fan of including Venom in this film, just botched it on purpose. He made Venom a joke and Peter's turn to the dark side hilariously bad. I see it as a big middle finger to Sony, which I can completely get behind.2. The final action sequence + ending. As goofy and stupid as this movie is, I think the ending is genuinely awesome. It's emotional, it's touching, and it's satisfying. I really don't know what else to say. That it's accompanied by one of the best action sequences a Spider-Man film has shown us makes it even better. Sandman, despite being a no show for most of the movie, is a really terrifying villain and actually seems like someone Spider-Man COULDN'T easily defeat. The tandem of Spidey and Harry's Goblin was fun and creative. And while Venom was botched completely here, I can't deny some cool visuals came out of it.3. Raimi's style. At the end of the day, I'd still rather re-watch this movie than most of the live action films that came after it. A big part of this is the heart, personality, and style Raimi brings to the table. Yes this movie can be cringey and awkward at times. But it's par for the course with these movies. He's also easily the best director to take on this character, and it shows.The Bad:The plot. This movie is completely overstuffed and doesn't know what to do with itself. You have so many things going on that a literal AMNESIA plot has to be added to get Harry out of it for long stretches. Characters come and go in a New York that feels way smaller than it should be (like seriously, how are these characters always running into each other?) And, there are so many plot holes and inconveniences patched up with a single line of dialog. It's a messy, chaotic, dumb movie and I kind of love it.Characters. Obviously, having three villains was an objectively bad idea. (Hell, Peter himself becomes something of a villain, so is it actually 4?) The script doesn't know what to do with most of them.The retcons. Oh man, does this movie retcon some seriously important Spider-Man lore in a way that's extremely frustrating and unnecessary, just to shove Sandman into the plot and give him significance. There's really no reason to do this.The CG. While there are some visually interesting moments, overall this movie looks A LOT worse than Spider-Man 2, mainly because it overuses CG models for grand action sequences, which gives these characters a weird rubbery, rag doll characteristic.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Made Me Feel Like A Kid Again,"Just saw it. Was awesome man. Not walked out of movie since I was kid with my mate just grinning and swapping our ""favourite bits"". It was a wicked film. I don't think anyone should take it seriously. It's essentially the best b-movie ever. I think the people making it have a really good sense of fun for the none too serious viewers and those with a sense of irony to bask in. Best action sequences ever, absolutely unbelievable. Never seen anything like it.I think the films work so much better than a lot of other superhero films because Sam Raimi has made the films appear as though the true story behind the myths of the comic books and has packed the films full of themes which hold it altogether. Also the direction is spot on and all the shots just seem like images from the comic books. The CGI team must be the best in the world too because it really is visual entertainment of the highest degree. See it, switch off your mind and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very disappointed,"I really don't know if i should review this movie. So i will make it quick. Allow me to start with, I liked the first Spiderman. I DID NOT like the second one. The CGI was horrible. I do agree that the original Green Goblin looked like something from the POwer Rangers, but the first one was good. So tonight I went to the 12:01 a.m. showing with a friend who really wanted to see it.We are returned to spidey(Toby Maguire) and his girl MJ (Kirsten Dunst, ick) and how wonderfully in love they are. Harry is still not happy with spidey/peter for killing his dad. MJ is performing on Broadway in a musical (with a not so good voice) and Spidey has become the savior of the city. It seems as though nothing could go wrong, but.... OUt of the blue, Harry decides he needs to seek revenge on spidey for the death of his father and becomes the New Green Goblin guy. A fight ensues, Spidey wins, knocks Harry unconscious, BAM he has forgotten the fact that Spidey stole his girlfriend (that he was too afraid to talk to in the first one, so I'm so on Harry's side here) and that he thinks spidey killed his father. All is well. The three are BFF. Enter Sandman/Flint Marko. Marko is an escaped felon with a sick daughter. The police inform spidey and aunt may that flint is the one who murdered uncle ben. This angers Spidey. Between all of this enter Gwen Stacy (played by a wonderful Bryce Dalas Howard) who is the daughter of the police chief and whom spidey saves and kisses (MJ gets mad). Throughout this some strange black goo hits earth from the sky, climbs to spidey and overcomes him. Flint Marko becomes sandman by some freak accident involving, guess this.....sand. Spidey becomes his own enemy and turns bad for a while, MJ and Spidey have some problems and topher grace is the only reason worht going to see this film as Eddie Brock.Cenom who is in love with Gwen. There are more corny lines in this movie than in all the national lampoon movies and American pie movies combined. The audience is supposed to be on spidermans side, especially when harry tries to steal MJ back, but really, what kind of friend steals his best friends girlfriend and keeps his identity a secret. I""m on Harry's side and i understand where topher grace's character is coming from. He gets called a fraud, but wtf is spidey, how does peter get pictures? I found this film ridiculous, in all honesty. THere are really stupid dance scenes. Corny one liners, the plot has too many villains and do not develop any of them enough for you to not want the to win. I know this will be the top grossing film of the year, which makes me sad. Because this film seems to have had no thought go into it, and some pretty rough acting by maguire and dunst. A movie for the kids, maybe.Rated PG 13 for violence. 140 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man is Back... Kind Of.,"I loved the first two Spider-Man movies. They were thrilling, fun, action-packed and the CGI was candy for the eyes... but the reason I loved them was they had solid stories with characters who weren't perfect, but you couldn't help but root for them anyway. That is what is lacking in Spider-Man 3 - the central story is extremely weak. It's like director Sam Raimi was throwing ideas at the wall and, if something stuck, he'd use it whether it helped move the narrative along or not.Don't get me wrong, there were plot lines that had a lot of potential. I think The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) could have been a great tragic anti-hero, along the lines of The Green Goblin and Doc Ock, if he had been given the proper treatment. He had an intriguing back-story, unfortunately that was abandoned early in the film to make way for snazzy effects. Granted, the scene where he is resurrected as a creature of sand is heartfelt, moving and the effects are breath-taking. The rest of the time he's in his sand form he's flying around New York City looking like a second cousin to the smoke monster on Lost. Ultimately, The Sandman is very one-dimensional because there isn't time to develop his character.I admit I was not a fan of Spider-Man before the movies. I've never read the comic book and most of my Spidey knowledge was obtained through wikipedia.com. But from what I understand, Venom is like The Joker in the Spider-Man universe. With that said, I'm surprised how one-note the writers, director Raimi and his brother Ivan, made the character. While The Sandman had a little bit of complexity and heart, Vemon was nasty just for the sake of being nasty. He had no redeeming qualities. Topher Grace was clearly having a great time shedding his ""good boy"" image, which made the character far more interesting than he deserved to be. In the hands of a less capable actor Venom would have fallen completely flat.As for the main characters in the film, I felt like I was watching the same actors playing totally different people. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was rude, vain and arrogant. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was solemn, mopey and secretive. In the first two movies I could see the mutual attraction they had for each other. I felt the spark. At the end of the Spider-Man 2, when Mary Jane tells Peter to, ""go get 'em, tiger""... it was all the proof I needed that these two were meant for each other. In Spider-Man 3 it seemed they didn't even like each other. Peter deliberately hurt Mary Jane by upside-down kissing newcomer Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) in front of hundreds of supporters (including MJ), and Mary Jane opened her heart to Harry Osbourne (brilliantly played by James Franco) without even considering Peter. I could see flashes of their original personalities towards the end of the film, but by then it was almost too late. Other characters (Aunt May - played by Rosemary Harris - and the previously mentioned Gwen Stacey) served little to no point in the movie and should have been left on the cutting room floor.The main plot was intriguing and would have been fantastic if it had been executed correctly. It wasn't. According to press releases and commercials we were going to see Peter's ""dark side"" after he comes into contact with a black, gooey substance from outer space that brings out a person's more aggressive qualities. I'm not sure we saw Peter's dark side as much as we saw his emo side. I was expecting Angelus (from season 2 of Buffy) and what I got was a skinny nerd with really bad hair strutting down the street, pointing at pretty girls, and dancing in a jazz club. I could tell Maguire was having a lot of fun, but Peter certainly didn't come off as mean or menacing. Again, I blame that on having too many pots on the stove. The climax of the movie (which puts Mary Jane in danger... again) was so ridiculous I felt like I was watching a big-screen version of that old video game, Rampage. And a deus ex machina near the end of the film was so contrived I'm amazed the characters didn't just speak directly to the audience. Toss in about 10 interesting but abandoned sub-plots (and a soap opera twist!) and you have a general idea of what to expect.Spider-Man 3 is basically two movies being smashed into one final product. And since it was just announced that there will be at least 3 more installments to the franchise I don't understand why Raimi felt the need to pack so much into 2 hours and 19 minutes. He should have held off on the dark Peter/Venom storyline and saved it for a later movie. He still had more than enough material for the third movie and he could have made it a character study worthy of it's predecessors.This isn't to say I had a horrible time or that the movie is a total disappointment. The special effects were dazzling, I laughed out loud more than once (courtsey of the hilarious J. K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jameson), there was plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" action and a few sequences were beautiful (especially at the end). Still, Spider-Man 3 could have been so much more than it was. But even with this small hiccup I hope the creative team (Raimi, Maguire and Dunst) return for the next three movies or the franchise will truly fall into ""Batman: The Schumacher Era"" territory. And that would be a shame. I draw the line at spider nipples!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spidey Review from premiere.,"Ill be honest I'm not the biggest spidey fan in the world, never read the comics and the first two movies didn't blow me away but this...well this is something different entirely.I was fortunate enough (as I'm management in a big cinema) to see this at its Irish premiere on the 18th and i must say i was finally blown away by a spiderman movie. Firstly it looks spectacular the previous movie looked brilliant as well but no 3 is so so superior. Secondly the acting for the most part was top notch, especially from the ensemble cast not so much Tobey(hes good just not an amazing performance). thirdly and most importantly this movie is Original, it seemed to drop a lot of clichés that re-emerged in the sequel which is brilliant.So when may 4 rolls around everyone should go see this movie, it is by far the best spidey movie, you'll laugh a lot(This movie was absolutely hilarious in parts, ie Bruce Campbell. i was almost crying with laughter at times), you'll cry(if you're that way inclined) there's just everything in this movie, i was shocked at how much better this sequel was, you will be too.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Was I watching spider-man or peter parker?,"I felt that this was less a spider-man movie and more of a Peter Parker movie. Many people who go to see spider-man swing around and capture the bad guys will be disappointed. Of the 140 minutes the movie takes up, he's in costume maybe 50 tops. The villains seem like they aren't really thought out, and even harry's turn seemed a bit rushed and tied up just for the sake of doing so.While the action sequences are great, they are still too far and few in between. Even with the wonderful planning of each one they all seem to have something a little off. Wither certain parts aren't really finished(the crane scene) or the civilians don't react at all the way they should for a giant sand monster and a vicious black monster without a name (the final battle).While the actual spider-man sequences were pretty well done, the peter parker scenes (more than 70% of the movie) seemed too drawn out and boring. While trying to be funny they seemed to have tried to hard and missed their mark (it was funner to make fun OF them)m when trying to be serious, it sometimes seemed over the top (and ended up being funnier than the comic relief). In the end the movie just seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be: A good character piece or a great action movie. You are left with a sort of awkward feeling where you don't know when to laugh, when to be serious, when it's OK to call Peter stupid, or why it took the butler so long to open his mouth.overall nothing is really changed from the end of 2 except there are a few less people around to cause peter trouble, and it doesn't seem like MJ and Pete have made any progress.this movie suffers from over exposure, and trying to take on too much. If you don't buy into the hype you may be able to enjoy this, but if you've already taken it all in, you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider Bites.,"Third and by far the weakest in the famed ""Spider-Man"" trilogy falls way short due to characters that have apparently run their depth course, hully-gully direction by co-writer Sam Raimi, and a running time that goes way beyond the outer limits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to have everything going his way. His girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst) now knows he truly is the titled character and they are about to be wed. Plus her aspirations as a serious stage actress seem to be becoming reality while his college career continues to take flight. However, there are evil forces that loom in seemingly every direction. James Franco is back and still seeking revenge on his father's death which occurred at the conclusion of the original. An escaped convict (Thomas Haden Church), who might have had something to do with Maguire's uncle's death, has become some strange sort of super-villain after a strange accident that gives the character human/sand-like powers. Then we have an upstart cameraman (Topher Grace) who wants to steal Maguire's spotlight at work, and finally a strange cosmic black substance that attaches itself to entities of rage. Still with me? ""Spider-Man 3"" comes with too much baggage. The first two were heavy enough as they were, but this one is way too cute and smart for its own good. Too many side-stories, too many black and white characteristics of the major players and too many special effects-laden sequences that dull rather than excite cause this movie to be a gigantic bore of near epic proportions. It is saying a lot when B-movie ham Bruce Campbell, with his typical cameo, ends up being the most interesting and intriguing part of the whole flimsy production. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"As superhero movies go, Spidey 3 is in a league of its own","As the titles start and that theme begins, we know we are possibly on the final Spidey ride of our lives - and what a ride! This is a comic book superhero, Juggernaut of a movie and its not difficult to see where the money went. I have little doubt that we will ever see such a huge scale of nearly faultless CGI, fast-paced action, angles, details, colors and scenarios in any superhero movie ever again.It is an emotional roller-coaster and obviously made with such spirit and care. The characters we know, love and trust and even the new characters such as Venom and Sandman who really are not given much time to make an impact, do! Its a testament to fantastic writing, direction, scoring and acting that this movie delivers as the ultimate comic-book loving, popcorn scoffing, cola gulping entertainment that make going to the movies so much fun.In terms of a 4th - what would really be the point?

"Compared to 2, this sequel was weak","Yeah I know. Some people are going to say that this is the best Spiderman yet. I know for certain it will beat out the first two films at the box office, but that still doesn't make it as good as Spiderman 2, and it's not quite on the same par as the first film either.The problem this time around is that there are entirely too many sub-plots and villains. The last two films dealt with only one villain, and that made it possible for character development. Doc Ock was still the best villain, but with this film we have three separate villains, and in a movie that was 2 and a half hours long, that still wasn't enough time to make them interesting.The main stars suffer a little bit here as well. The performance by Tobey Maquire wasn't as strong, and both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were simply one note. I could tell that their performances were strained, and that only proves that the rumors may be true about the main stars not returning for part 4 if there is one.However, I must give kudos to the special effects. They were by far some of the best yet, and with a budget at over 250 million dollars, I can see why. But special effects alone do not make good movies. Character development and interesting story lines will always beat them out, and that is the part of the movie that rings a little hollow.There were also some nice action scenes, but even then there was nothing that really jumped out at you. Some of the scenes in Spiderman 3 were reminiscent of part 1 and 2. There was nothing original, and there were no wow scenes like the way Spiderman stopped the speeding train in part 2, or how he seemed to almost fly down the street on his web lines trying to catch the man who was thought to have killed his uncle in part 1.Sadly, Spidermen 3 doesn't quite make the grade, but I have no doubt it will still break box office records once its theater run is over.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Visually stunning, stylized, underrated superhero movie","There is probably going to be lots of disagreement here, but I think this is the best Spider-Man movie out of Sam Raimi's trilogy.Spider-Man 3 picks off where Spider-man 2 ended: with Peter Parker and MJ dating, growth of popularity as Spiderman, but of course, there are some problems. A strange black sludge starts to posses Spiderman, a new villain named Sandman appears and Peter's best friend, Harry gets the Green Goblin's gadgets and becomes the New Goblin in order to avenge his father.This is probably something where we will agree: visually, it is the best. The stunning birth of Sandman, the intense mid-air fight between Spiderman and the New Goblin, the creepy black sludge and the spectacular ending fight scene are all amazing and would have deserved an Visual-effects Oscar more then Spiderman 2.But not just in technicals, I think this movie is better then Spiderman and Spiderman 2. The storyline is well great, even tough there are basically three villains, it is still well put together to go with the relationship between MJ and Peter and the murder of Peter's uncle. The actors all do just as good, (and that is very good) job like in the first two movies and this is probably the funniest movie out of the three as well.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spidermediocre,"With the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, director Sam Raimi took on the thankless job of transferring one of the most popular comic book superheroes of all time to the big screen and managed the trick with grace, energy and aplomb.As depicted in those films, young newspaper photographer Peter Parker was a lovable nerd, his alter-ego Spider-Man was a saucy and valiant altruist, his sweetheart Mary Jane Watson was a sweet but somewhat broken flower, his best buddy Harry Osborn was a happy dope crippled with Oedipal neuroses, and his nemeses -- the diabolically warped scientists Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin -- were suitably juicy, fiendish and larger than life.The two ""Spider-Man"" movies were rivaled only by Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films in bringing the paneled page to the big screen -- and they constituted a second fine series from Raimi, who made his name with the ""Evil Dead"" movies.But somewhere there exists a well where filmmakers go to dredge up the creative magic required for films like these. The producers of the ""Batman"" movies found that well dry after Burton was replaced by Joel Schumacher, who made two awful films.Now Raimi's latest effort, ""Spider-Man 3,"" is here, and while it's nowhere near as catastrophic as, say, ""Batman & Robin,"" it's long, wan and tired in the vein of ""Superman Returns."" There's still a lightness of touch -- Raimi can reliably punctuate a film of this scale with skewed humor -- but the verve, the thrill, the razzle and the dazzle are all but gone. And I suspect people who love Spider-Man from the comic books will be more disappointed with it than people whose chief connection to him is through the movies.Raimi has all his stars back: Tobey Maguire in the title role, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. They're joined by two new faces: Thomas Haden Church as career criminal Flint Marko who transforms into the Sandman, and Topher Grace, as Parker's career rival, Eddie Brock, who becomes the anti-Spider-Man known as Venom.They're all perfectly suited to their tasks: the strengths of Maguire, Dunst, Franco and Harris have been steady throughout the series; Church and Grace fit their roles nicely; and such stalwarts as J. K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks and, especially, Bruce Campbell provide swell comic moments.But the comedy is surrounded by a lot of melodramatic storytelling, little of which truly compels: In addition to a romantic crisis with Mary Jane and a protracted effort to reconcile with Harry, Parker's host to an alien parasite that changes his personality, he learns that Marko is the real killer of his Uncle Ben, and he accidentally creates -- and then must vanquish -- Venom. And the action scenes, so impressive in the previous films, bring nothing new or especially memorable.""Spider-Man 3"" is a likable film -- Maguire's personality, or Raimi's channeled through him, is genuinely charming. But the tenor of the film is too often too muted, melancholy and enervated for something of its size. When Parker first figured out how to swoop through the city on his webs in the first film, it imparted a rush. But nothing here quite ever catches so big a breeze; far too often, it feels grounded, dutiful, dull. At the end, Parker is ambivalent about both his romance and his crime-fighting career. And I suspect that audiences might feel similarly uncertain about further Spider-Man adventures.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so amazing Spiderman,"Spiderman 3 has possibly been one of the most over hyped, over PR'd movie in cinema history. In fact by the time I was sitting comfortably in my seat about to watch the movie I felt I had seen way too much of the movie already, and was actually pretty sick of seeing numerous Spiderman posters dotted around all over the place. However, despite ignoring my slight hesitations, despite realising it was never going to live up to hype over the movie, the ultimate disappointment of this movie is the fact it left me feeling empty. For a two and a half movie boasting three villains, two romances, numerous fight sequences and lots of crying its quite an achievement. In fact the movie seems to be lacking a lot of things. It never seems ambitious, in fact at times it feels like its running in circles rather than movie the story forward. And the only time the story seems to movie forward it eventually goes backwards yet again. I suppose where the movies goes wrong is the fact is decides to introduce three villains, all three interesting enough, but then the director has decided to use them barely at all and just make them add to an already over packed movie. I will give the movie its due, it isn't bad. In fact had this not have been the big summer opening this might have scored a 7/10. However despite its cool action sequences, half decent performances and a final hour that does really work, it never feels as good as it could have been. Spiderman 1 was flawed but was still a well though out movie, Spiderman 2 was absolutely spectacular, but Spiderman 3 is a jumbled mess with moments of brilliance. In terms of sequels this seems to go firmly alongside X3, too much goes on in both of those movies.Well lets first talk about the performances. First has to be Tobey Maguire as I am about to say something I never thought possible. I have finally excepted him as Spiderman. In the past two movies I found him annoying, here, despite when he decides to go emo on us (excruciatingly awful scenes there), he does a brilliant job. He seems to be well thought out here, his character conveying vast ranges of emotions. My only problem with him were in the ""evil-Spidey"" sequences, that were very bad in my eyes. Kirsten Dunst here seems sidelined, well not her character, but her performance. She has little to work with here, she seems more prop placement than a character in her own right. Topher Grace is pretty good as Venom and his alter-ego, but his character has far too little screen time so we never really get to see his purpose in the movie. As I've said many times Venom deserves a movie all to himself, not ten minutes of screen time! Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church perhaps frustrated me the most. Church is a superb actor, yet here he seems pointless. Sandman as a character is never explored, an unnecessary sub-plot about his daughter just adds layers to a story that is way too over packed. My view is that either Sandman or Venom had to be dropped for this movie to ever reach its full potential. Now James Franco does well, he's easily the best thing in the movie. His character is the most complicated and remains the most interesting. Gwen Stacey on the other hand, well lets not even go there. A waste of an opportunity if you ask me.The action sequences of Spiderman 3 I suppose are its highlights, a shame there are huge gaps between the fights, and not a single one comes even slightly close to the greatness of the train scrap between Doc Ock and Spiderman in the first sequel. The fights here looks amazing, the CGI is very impressive, especially the stuff with Venom and Sandman. And the final fight sequence is something behold. Yet all the fights get a bit repetitive after a while, the stuff with Sandman is instantly forgettable. In fact its only the Goblin and Spiderman sequences that really stick firmly in memory, they're brilliantly edited and they have a power the other fight sequences really seem to lack. As I've said there's not too much action, the movie is padded out to 2 and half hours with annoying romance sequences and lots of crying. The romance goes nowhere once again and seems to be doing another lap of what we've seen before. It now just seems boring and I wish Raimi would get a backbone and give them something daring to deal with.Overall Spiderman 3 comes out as passable entertainment. But for a movie hyped up to be the best film of the year it just manages to scrape above average. A plodding run time, too much going on and lots of other faults make it a forgettable experience. The action sequences and good performances make the movie do well, and if you're a Spiderman fan you're still likely to enjoy the movie. But don't expect anything amazing, as Spiderman 3 is anything but.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I Want Spiderman 4!!,"Just saw a sneak preview. This film is without a doubt the best film of the trilogy, as well as the best film of the year. Many fans will complain about the climax, and its deviation from the comics, but I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I could care less about any deviation from the comics. Raimi has fun with this film and treats it as his masterpiece of the three. That being said, I'm not sure they're going to do a fourth one. The great thing is, there are loose ends that are subtly left untied, unlike X3. There could very well be a fourth one, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Lizard was one of the villains, since Dr. Connors has been in the last two films. There were two things that impressed me most about this film. One was that they could tie all the plot lines together cohesively, as well as have enough room for sufficient character development. The second was the acting. James Franco, as well as Topher Grace embrace their villainy. Thomas Hayden Church is great as the tragic Sandman. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful from the opening scene. Tobey Maguire proves he can act. He's absolutely off the wall. I enjoyed this so much that I wanna go again tomorrow night! This is w/o doubt a must-see and will leave you wanting more!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man 2 is still the greatest super hero movie ever made... but Spidey 3 is not far behind!!!,"NO SPOILERS HERE!!! Spider-Man 3... More villains, plots and action than any super hero movie EVER made! It plunges into one plot, and with the blink of an eye... shifts to another. But here's the thing... if Spidey-3 stuck to one main plot... and less action... it would be an out cry about not enough action! In my view... Spidey-3 delivers all that you could dream in 2 hours and 20 mins. You want action, than you got it!!! Spidey-3 without a doubt has the best special effects to date... some of the most intense fight scenes your going to ever see... the fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission. The scenes with the crane going out of control... I dare someone say that was not the best action scene EVER created!!! And the most realistic looking one...I understand people being mad at all of the plots... but you got to realize while in production... they thought it was the last one... so they wanted to wrap everything up! And when Peters Parker is ""BAD"" I mean, come on... he's already a geek... so you should expect him to be a geeky bad guy... I love the way he is betrayed, fits his character.I agree certain things should of ended differently... but o well... at least it didn't screw everything up like Superman Returns did... Spidey-3 is very loyal to the comic...And last thing... Spider-Man without Tobey will suck major balls... He might not be the idea Spider-Man... but he's the BEST fit for Peter Parker... and that's what separates Spider-Man from the rest of the Super Hero movies... cause Spider-Man, despite the name... is about Peter Parker... Superman is about super-man, Batman about Batman... and so fourth. You connect with Peter Parker... not Spider-Man. Other movie you connect with the Super Hero. This is why Spider-Man trilogy is the best. Look at it as a whole... VERY GOOD indeed...Spider-Man 2 is still the greatest super hero movie ever made... but Spidey-3 is not far behind.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I almost walked out,"Yes, I will admit it. There was a point after an hour and a half that I was ready to call it quits. I'm glad I stayed, but it was a struggle.To start off, the Title was stunning. I really felt that was one of the very best I've seen. Too bad I can't identify who did the opening.Not to take away from Tobey Maguire, but Kirsten Dunst is critical to my enjoyment of the movie. I thought the idea of having her sing was terrible. She is just above Celine Dion, who rates just above a screeching blackboard to me. No more singing, Kirsten. Please.Who is Topher Grace? Get him out of here! Thomas Haden Church was good. Two demons is good. New Goblin and Sandman - OK. Venom was too much.Needless to say the visual effects and sound and music were exceptional. Fight sequences were way too long.Bryce Dallas Howard and Elizabeth Banks - Hot! I liked seeing more of Mageina Tovah. She has a quaint cuteness about her and matches perfectly with Peter parker.It sure seemed longer than the listed 140 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cheesy, But Good","Spiderman 3 doesn't out-do the original but its still a worthy enjoyable action flick. We see more then one villain in this installment, the Green Goblin returns, The Sandman makes his debut and the Venom enters the mysterious world of Spiderman. But, the movie has its down-falls, one of them its utterly failing cheesy effects. It was those scenes that made me give this movie a mediocre rating, it wasn't funny nor enjoyable to watch, it was totally inappropriate and not needed and tends to get plenty of negative attention. But, the rest is good; nice action, a good in-depth plot, and some very suspenseful scenes.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't listen to the critics!!!!!!!,"From the words of a true fan....Spider-Man 3 is a great movie! It has action,drama,romance,humor,great special effects and really good villains.I don't get why fans and critics are complaining on this film,if you liked the first two you just have to like this.Some say that it's biggest problems is that it tries too much and has too many villains,but I think that it works great and nothing seems rushed or unreasonable.The cast is once again great and Tobey Maguire is yet again fantastic in the leading role,I especially like scenes when he turns ""bad"" and explores his dark side.Thomas Haden Church is very good as sand man and his character is far more interesting than Topher Grace's Eddie Brock.although Grace also does a good job.But my favorite character is James Franco's Harry Osborn,it's really interesting to see how his and Peter's relationship develops throughout the film and and how Harry really grows.You just got to love him!Kirsten Dunst unfortunately doesn't have a lot to do but to look sad and getting kidnapped,but she does an OK job and the chemistry between her and Maguire is good.And Bruce Campbell does his best cameo yet. The ending is good,although a bit sad and I won't be surprised if a 4th movie will come along. To sum up Spider-Man 3 is a great sequel that fans just have to love,it's not quite as good as S-M 2 but it's better than the first one and is simply a must see!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the best spider-man yet, but not bad...not bad.","My top ranking: Spider-Man 1, Spider-Man 3, and then Spider-Man 2.I do want to commend the movie on navigating through some tough spots. First of all, tackling three major villains in one movie is a lot, but somehow the movie keeps it all under control. Second, some of the humor is the best in the series. Third, great action scenes (although arguably no better than Spider-Man 2's). Fourth (and this seems to be my unique opinion), I think the acting (as a whole) is the best in this movie.But, there are a few things I just can't ignore. One, WHY did they have to try to do so much in one movie? While they definitely pull it off, Venom, Green Goblin, and even Sandman could carry an entire movie alone. There's definitely a lack of a ""main"" villain in this movie. It actually hurts a little to see Venom treated as a tacked-on villain.Two, how do I describe it...a lack of satiety. For a 2 and a half hour movie, I still felt that there were some pieces missing. The movie was entertaining, but is THIS going to be the last one in the series? If so, all I can say is I'm not satisfied...I want more. Pardon me for sounding pretentious, but I feel like spider-man has not completed the emotional journey he starts in this movie. It's like the movie built up to a climax that doesn't quite happen.Still, taken on its own the movie is definitely worth watching, entertaining, and funny. If nothing else, this movie does two things very well: Spider-Man's decent into darkness, and sympathizing for the Sandman.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thrill Ride,"Spiderman 3 was a triumph of the cinema. I thought the movie was a thrill ride from start to finish. Something was always going on Green Goblin, Sandman, and Venom all figuring into the mix. The relationship between Peter and Harry was torturous to watch kind of like a car wreck. The ending was a testament to friendship and the trials of life. The casting was exceptional. Adding Bryce Dallas Howard, Thomas Church, and Topher Grace created an all star atmosphere. Every scene was a delight to see truly talented professional actors/actresses at their best. I would implore anyone who likes action movies to not miss this one..",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining but doesn't live up to prior titles,"I got to say the movie itself was entertaining. There were times when I laughed, times when I awwed, and times when I sat back and said am I viewing a Spiderman movie or Mad TV? Spiderman 3 I felt didn't live up to its prior titles or roles. the characters are an interesting pick for villains but the development just wasn't fully there. It seemed as if the developers and screen writers tried to fit way to much into a 2.5 hour movie.Topher Grace wasn't the best pick of the role of Eddie Brock. In my past experience in comic books Eddie Brock has always been this big tall body building guy that was strong in stature, Topher Grace didn't meet any of those requirements. Sitting there watching him you didn't know if this guy really is supposed to be Venom or some annoying Jimmy the photographer.Despite the fact it did have a very strong opener, making it the leading movie opening of all times, one could predict this movie won't do as well as the first titles did. Special effects were very strong, The Sandman which everybody thought would have been weak was a very well done character.From reading other posts you can pretty much make the same judgement, your either A. going to see spiderman with the expectations of this movie being as well as the first 2 or B.

My stomach feels uneasy.,"I'm going to be frank with you. I usually give movies a big benefit of the doubt just for the fact it takes a lot of work, time, effort and cost to make a movie....But it also takes a lot of work to make ME not like a movie, and this one did a pretty good job at that. The 'dramatic' emotional scenes were terrible. I mean, the acting was so terribly poor at certain scenes that it actually seemed like they tried it in one take. OR that the CONSTANT scenes with attempts at being humorous made the actors too laid-back to pull off a serious scene.We also have FAR too many convenience issues in the film. I can understand one or two, it's a movie after all, but this one had one too many.If you are a Spidey fan, odds are this film will leave you asking 'Why?' and telling yourself that if a sequel doesn't happen, JUST so they can take a shot at redeeming themselves, you are going to be upset with the so-called 'wrap up' to this trilogy.If you haven't seen it, it's still definitely worth seeing it...

A weak effort by all involved,"The first two Spiderman films, the second especially encapsulated everything that a superhero film should. Drama, excitement, incredible action scenes, good triumphing over adversity and so on. The third failed on all of these levels. Firstly it took ages to get going and was overly sentimental, secondly it had too many villains and as a result failed to develop any of them fully, thirdly the action scenes were poorly choreographed and confusing, fourthly...you get the picture.It seems as though Raimi wanted to include as much as possible in as short amount of time as possible which resulted in glaring inconsistencies, weak character development and many unexplained occurrences.

Spidey still amazing...albeit a bit somber this go around.,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot and rank it right there with part two in how much I enjoyed this movie. Granted, a lot of people do not share this opinion, but then we all have differing tastes do we not. For me I was extremely surprised at how well the movie was made and how the story progressed...from all the reviews I was expecting a bit of a jumbled mess instead of a story that may had a lot of plot points, but for me they all came together quite nicely in the end. There is quite a lot of drama in this one, I will not deny that either as this was the complaint of a couple of people I know. I say a movie needs heart to keep your emotions going, and it was not like there was no action in this one, this one had more action than the previous two installments. When I read about this movie from critics and such I was not expecting what I got, I had a rather negative review ready to go on how this movie should have only been the black suit without Venom and how he should be introduced in the next movie, in the end Venom was not quite in the movie as much as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed the scenes he was in as Topher Grace was surprisingly effective as the character. And speaking of effective Thomas Haden Church was also excellent as the hulking yet sad Sandman. The plot, everything is going alright with Spidey at the beginning, the city of New York has embraced Peter Parker's alter ego, this however kind of blinds Peter from the fact MJ's career is not going quite so good and he does a few things that he should not. If this were not enough Harry attacks him as the New Goblin and another super villain appears as the Sandman, a powerful foe seemingly unstoppable. Add to this the fact that Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, may have actually been the one to kill his uncle and the pressure is really on Parker as now the old stirrings of revenge have surfaced. Fortunately, thanks to an accident Harry seems to be his old self again, not so fortunate some sort of alien material has now attached itself to Spider man and now Spidey and Peter are exhibiting a darker edge. So that is how it plays out, throw in an annoying new photographer named Eddie Brock causing Peter and Spidey headaches and you have a wild ride as there are fights in the skies of New York, on the streets, in the subways, and finally the biggest fight in any of the Spidey movies at a building under construction, an all out battle with two villains and even two heroes. However, this movie will not be for everyone as there are stretches where the movie is really dramatic between the action scenes, and even though I loved it, it still left me depressed too. Still if it ends on this it will be okay, however I do believe there is an opening for a sequel and if there is one I do believe the focus will be on that one particular character that some complain was not in this one enough. Though one thing was kind of lame, was Peter walking through the streets doing his little shuffle, I do think they could have come up with a better way to portray his dark side than that as I would have at least included a scene of him in the black suit taking out some criminals with a bit more force than necessary.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The curse of the 3rd installment!!!!,"I have always thought that the 3red part of any movie trilogy come off as a near miss or a complete failure. There are many examples of this. Alien 3, Lethal Weapon 3, even Return of the Jedi is for me the weakest film in the 1st Star Wars trilogy. Spider-Man 3 is no exception. It is in no way a complete failure, but is the weakest of the Spider-Man films. It has been reported that it is the most expensive film of all time, and there lies the problem. I think that Sam Raimi and company had so much money and pressure to deliver a home run on this film that they packed the movie with way to much stuff. There are three villains this time, Sandman, Venom, and The Green Goblin. That is one too many, the movie lacks the focus of the first two. It's all over the place. There is the inner conflicts that Peter Parker deals with, his relationship with Mary Jane, it all was dealt with much better in the other 2 films. The disadvantage with here is that the audience is already so familiar with these characters that there isn't anything really new, so the conflicts between them are not as compelling.Yes, the FX are impressive, but they are nothing that we haven't seen before. The action is well done, but without the strong story it just doesn't involve me more because the CGI cost so much. Sam Raimi balanced all the elements of a big budget summer movie to near perfection in Spider-man 2, the FX and action were there, but the story is what made it a great movie. Here he was given as many toys as he wanted and it almost got completely away from him.It is entertaining, but I heard almost every person that was walking out the theater say that Spider-Man 2 was much better.Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost as bad as The Hulk,"Great special effects but bad story! I didn't care about anyone in this movie, not the guy not the girl. I didn't care if the guy got the girl. Well I did care about one person and largely because he's a very good actor and his character had the most depth, guess who? Harry. He was the only likable character of the main trio. Who else did I like? Gwen & Venom - also more depth. I really liked Venom. It's funny in a movie where you are supposed to be rooting for the heroes I was rooting for Venom and Harry. How odd. If they were to do this movie again, they should get a better story, one where you actually care about the characters. What's with the marriage plot? They are like 25. Average age to get married in this society 30. It was like a plot from 1910 or trying to marry people off at 18. In a movie, movies about marriage don't really cut it unless they are for 12 year olds, epics or romantic comedies with lots of crude fart jokes. I hate when they do this. They did it to superman: lois and clark. That was such a great show but then they tried to make superman a daddy. The action was great in this film but in the final action scene, I found myself saying 'is it over?' why because I didn't care. And also it didn't make sense. I mean Harry lives through being smashed against a brick wall, falling 50 feet, and a killer explosion with only second degree burns. Like come on. Spiderman saved him in the beginning in two seconds by rushing him to a hospital, like he couldn't manage that again in the 10 minutes of sap. He certainly had enough time.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Your story has grown tiresome,"As Dieter of Saturday Night Live would say, ""Your story has grown tiresome"". That is how I feel about the Spider-Man series. How many times do we have to see the damsel in distress (Kirsten Dunst)? And as for Ms. Dunst, she has the unique ability to annoy both on and off the screen. On screen, I have never found her that attractive and there is just some thing about her that rubs me the wrong way. When her character was in danger of plummeting to a painful death, I kept hoping that she would. No such luck. Many other folks feel the same way. As for off screen, when she was interviewed about the potential for a Spider-Man 4, she said, ""well, no one will come to see another one with out me and Tobey"". Guess again, Kirsten, 76% of those polled could care less if you reappeared! Now, as to the movie itself, about 20-30 minutes would have been better left on the cutting room floor. No one cares about Kirsten's performance in some stupid musical (in fact, I kept trying to find the ""fast forward"" button on my seat). And Tobey's performance as ""the bad"" Spider-Man was torturous and unfunny (Tom Welling makes a much better ""bad"" super hero when he is affected by red Kryptonite).As for the plot, it meanders around a lot before getting to some impressive special effects. I particularly liked the Sandman, despite the obvious logical problems (such as why is the sand solid one minute and then porous the nextbut hey, it is based on a comic book!). The Green Goblin II was pretty cool too. The other villain is somewhat of a surprise so I won't spoil it by revealing the identity of the last villain. My only problem with the villains is the writer's insistence on making them have a tragic back story that makes some of their villainy forgivable (they already did the same with Green Goblin I and Doc Ock). How about making the villain just be evil for evil's sake?

rushed,"first of all ; it was a good movie.more than two hours of entertaining action and emotion.a great way to pass a Sunday afternoon.but anything more than that? or will it actually make comic-fans happy?Nope,sadly..the problem of spider man 3 is born right into the greatest advantage of it ; great,entertaining super characters.the film has many of them and it is really never boring;but it is just too much to draw together in any clever ways;so the plot is extremely rushed and FULL of holes. everything in the last 30 minutes is just too fast;the action doesn't let you question anything like ""why are the odds that Eddie went to the same church with spider man"" or ""so if this sandman person is a good family guy how does he OK to killing an innocent woman and if this venom is so strong and full of hate why does he runs to sandman for help before even trying to face spider man himself? and more;is spider-man really a jerk that he left that kind of black monster out and didn't even look down to see what happened to it? all of those questions linger in your mind as you run towards the final action scene;which was long anticipated before the rumors of the movie started to come out;and it could have been a really good,classic battle.At least that was what i was expecting when i looked at the rest of the movie (i actually ""woaa""ed at the scene spider man saved Gwen Stacy;it was breathtaking)but instead you see characters flying all over;and possibly the most fearsome character of the series;venom; coming and leaving without even a decent fight.so i left the theater unsatisfied.it is not a all emotion movie like superman returns but it definitely has something burdening it;maybe the goblin shouldn't be in there;so they could save time for spider-man vs venom.it was more entertaining ;even in the animated series!! great action ; great humor (the jj.Jameson office table scene!!) and great drama ; with a rushed plot with holes too big to ignore and an unsatisfying boss fight.overall ; i can say it was a great movie but it was a disappointment for anyone who has been waiting to see some kind of venom for all these years.this was not what i wanted.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as interesting,"I liked the first Spidey movie, the second one wasn't as good probably because of my higher expectations..... This one I had some expectations but not as high as those for the second installment.I went in pretty eager to be entertained... Boy, was I bored!! What irritated me the most was Tobey Maguire's attempt at weeping.... so sad.... so very very sad. Mr Maguire, no offense, but that wasn't the least bit convincing.I would have love to see the alien thing creep up and form the suit, rather than become the suit. Also, too much emphasis on Sandman and not sufficient time for Venom. Venom would have been the better villain.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Other than the Visual Effects ... Spidy 3 totally sucked,"The movie definitely deserves a 10/10 on doing the stupidest job possible on a spiderman movie The direction sucked The scenario sucked even more The acting was pathetic I almost felt I was watching an Indian movie with all tears and overly lengthed time [ Lots of people got out before the movie finished ]I would however give it 10/10 on the visual effects, those guys, which I really felt sorry for, did an outstanding job which was unmatched by all other aspects of the movie !!!!When watching most of the dramatic acting scene, I felt they chose the worst take of the scene. and when spidy and harry teamed up, I felt I was watching power rangers.Spider 3 --> a real disappointment :( Again, thumbs up only for the visual effect guys, oh and the black suit too .. was totally COOL.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"You cannot compare the Spider-Man films, they are all equally great","I can't understand why people are ranking the films in best to worst order. They are all as great as each other. Just because the second film was so groundbreaking people complain about the 3rd because it couldn't surpass it. My advice; just watch the film for what it is.I was amazed, just as I was by the other films. It was not overcrowded, and it dealt with the plot lines very well and kept me interested all the time. Yeah fair enough some scenes could've been shortened, but you don't care when you see the next scene because they are so incredible.I can't wait for a fourth. I hope they bring Lizard or Carnage. Would be amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Both the best and worst of the trilogy,"In terms of action, music, sheer scope, and complexity of story, Spider-Man 3 just about blows it's predecessors out of the water. This film finally delivers some of the dark feel that moves the comic-book genre away from children. With these pros in mind, the cons really detracted from the film. We saw a departure from good script writing for broad story (as in X3, only not nearly as bad). Some of the scenes just got flat out ridiculous, but never really hurt the whole feel of the film, it just kinda shocked you out of engrossment. This movie is not as likely to please as the last two, which made the superhero genre a good measure better. I have a feeling that the studio pressured Sam Raimi into making the film as big in scope as it was, but Raimi still pulled all the loose ends together masterfully. Bravo. The only people who should be angry about this film are comic-book junkies (Some films change superhero story lines for the better, guys) and people who are fed up with the super-hero glut of films (the world would be a better place without the likes of Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four). Overall, it was very enjoyable and still stands as one of the better examples of what a superhero film should be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant,"Just got back from one of the first mass release screenings in the UK (I actually booked the day off of work - how sad is that?).First, I have to agree with a lot of what people are saying which is that there is a lot packed into this film, but in my opinion, it is all the better for it. I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled by a film and for nearly 3 hours and 45 Mons, that isn't bad going.I thought the first two were great but this Spider-man 3 has it all; action, character, drama, romance, humour and a lot of violence. Just the way I like my comic book movies.Sam Raimi did a great job but I really do hope that this is the last so that the team and the franchise can finish on a high. I don't think they have anywhere else to go in terms of quality, other than down. (definitely if Sam will no longer be directing and the cast is different - Tobey Maguire will be in his late 30's, and still at high school?!) I'm going to go and see it again as soon as I get a chance. I recommend you go see it. Especially if they do a fourth, and even more especially if they give the directors job to that idiot Mark Steven Johnson.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oh what a tangled Web We Weave,"I came in with very high expectations for this film. I thought the character development in the first two films were brilliant and enjoyed the second movie over the first one.My thoughts on the third film was that this tried too hard to be so many different kinds of films. I will try not to put any spoilers into it. The film was formulaic and was full of many predictable plot points and chock full of hokey clichés. This like the Schumacher Batman sequels tried to implement too many character onto screen and could have been trimmed significantly. The visual effects were brilliant, and the acting was on par with the rest of the series, it just didn't hold the same emotional impact on me as the other did. There were also some plot holes. Perhaps I will enjoy it more on a second viewing when it comes to DVD. As of now the hype and expectations from the previous films have cast too big a shadow on this film for me. Spider-Man 3 isn't necessarily a bad movie, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. The plot could have been made into two movies if this was re-cut it could have helped it by making it Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 4. It was just too much for one movie. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A movie with so much potential...,"I have to say i am probably one of the biggest fans of the spider-man series and comic books, i loved the first two movies thought they were well put together. Unfortuantly i didn't find this one at all pleasing, their was far to much going on at the same time, and they have destroyed venom. It basically has turned in the movie Batman and Robin, but it wont be a major flop because all they kids will still go see it, however i am a film studies teacher and compared to the first two, it has nothing on them.I found the acting extremely unrealistic and you just couldn't get in to the movie.I went with the other film studies teacher from the college and every time venom showed up, it was just non-stop laughter Really if you have any sense at all take my advise and don't see it, its a waste of money, i enjoyed the nacho's more than the film!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Spider-Man Movie ever!!,"Once again the critics are too harsh on a fun, action packed movie! This is BY FAR the best Spider-Man Movie Out Of all 6 Of them! It has tons of eye-popping action with great story telling by Sam Rami. The critics often call out the ""emo Peter"" scenes for being to silly for a superhero movie, and I agree with them in that regard, but other than that this movie is fantastic. Venom, sandman and the new goblin are some of the BEST villains to ever be put to screen. If you have not seen this movie, now is your chance! DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Soooo disappointed,"Well, where do I start, I guess I'll outline some of the good and the bad. The special effects team did a great job especially with the final action sequence although I thought some of the venom sequences were a little poor, such as when venom was talking the mouth movements looked quite bad and Eddie Brock's teeth changing to fangs permanently looked pretty stupid. Kirsten Dunst looked great, I thought she looked awful in Spiderman 2. Great to see the return of certain characters such as J Jameson, the Russian landlord, his daughter and the thug from number 1, not to mention Harry Osbourne who gave the best performance in the movie, he really gives a good show of conflicting emotions. The negatives are based primarily on a lot of cheesy acting. I know they were trying to show extremes between good and evil but dancing stupidly down the street? terrible child actors proclaiming ""wicked, cool!"",the annoying news reporter on scene for the final showdown, not to mention that Spider-man's heroic entry at the final battle shows the American flag flying behind him, disgusted flashback to Super-man (1978) anyone? The film never really explores Sandman's story properly, we learn his daughter is dying but not why, we learn Flint was trying to get money to pay for treatment but not what kind of treatment. He says he's not a bad guy but a guy who had bad luck, we know Flint killed Uncle Ben and his ""justifying story"" really has no justification and we're supposed to have sympathy for this guy? Besides all this information we know from the previews and trailers, no more information is given in the movie which is kinda annoying. The origin of Venom isn't explored properly, Harry Osbourne isn't really given enough screen time to give his character justice, consider that they've been teasing it for two movies and he gets half a dozen short scenes to wrap it all up!, all in all, having three opponents for spidey is all well and good if you can explore them properly, this is never really done but they did make for some great action sequences. I would also say it's a very soppy movie in that it features A lot of singing, dancing and extravagant dresses, it was mostly a chick flick with undertones of comic action. All in all, a chick flick crossed with an action movie. If you're a fan of the comics then this won't satisfy you as it doesn't explore the characters properly, although it is cool to see such infamous villains brought to life. If you're an action movie fan the action scenes are great but you will probably get bored by the chick flick scenes and vice versa, chick flick fans might get bored of the action scenes, but these tend to be over reasonably fast. I loved Spider-man and I liked Spider-man 2 a lot but I was so disappointed by Spider-man 3 that I have had to write my views immediately. Franco rocked as Harry and Simmons was great as Jonah, apart from that I cringed in my seat as opposed to sitting on the edge with excitement, wait for the rental, cheaper and you can pause it occasionally to recover from the awful cheesy moments for which Sam Raimi can not be forgiven.

What is wrong with these people who voted 1?,"No movie is worthy of a 1 and makes me wonder what these people are up to.. don't let them fool you. Spiderman3 wil go down as one of the all time best movies. If ou can see it at the IMAX then so much the better.The Plot: Peter Parker (Maguire), a.k.a. Spider-Man, faces a series of new challenges and threats as he embraces public adulation for the first time. His new-found self confidence causes him to take his relationships for granted -- namely his union with M.J. (Dunst), which is tested by the presence of the doting Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Self-assuredness also comes into play as he faces not one, but two powerful villains: Sandman (Church), an escaped convict made powerful by a nuclear explosion, and Venom (Grace), a parasitic life form from our hero's past. User Rating: THE BUZZ: Production on S-M 3 started quietly (and much less dramatically than its predecessor) in November, 2005. There were no chubby Tobey stories in the trades, no rumors of Jake Gyl replacing him ... just reports that our hero will face down not one, but two of his fiercest opponents. The formula rebooted the Batman franchise, and it's all but a guarantee to help make the third film in the series the most successful yet. Poor Topher Grace is facing the same fanboy scrutiny that Maguire himself weathered back when he was originally cast. In our minds, the actors are wonderfully paired. Though what's with the emphasis on the blondish boys and the minimal appearances of Mary Jane and new rival Gwen?",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Little short of a masterpiece,"Spider-Man 3 is the Lawrence Of Arabia of the superhero movies world. It is epic, sprawling, magnificent, meaningful, beautiful. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie must be a pretty spoilt brat or a cynical old misery. For near on three hours it envelops you in its world and makes you CARE about the characters. How's that for a special effects laden blockbuster, a movie with characters that matter? The comedy works, the emotion works, the action works. Everything Raimi tries comes off. The set pieces are particularly astounding, ranging from an out of control crane to Spidey's numerous battles with the meaty villains on show. Like others, I think this is by far the best of the three (though I loved the first two as well). It's a modern-day classic, an enrapturing fantasy that exhibits all that's best in modern movie making. An experience not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Maybe three is too many,"I saw Spider-Man 3 just a couple hours ago. And I was disappointed, most definitely. While I love the character the two proceeding movies, this one suffered from the great third syndrome.Two things: Firstly, this movie splayed out at one end a romantic melodrama, on the other end, a serious metaphorical discussion of free will and good and evil, and yet on another a raucous slapstick comedy. And a runtime of 140 minutes, or 2 hours and 20 minutes is far too long for this movie. The scenes with the aunt, in my thinking, could have been all cut. She provided absolutely nothing to the movie, except cliché after idiotic cliché. It was half tedium to see her on the screen and half unintentional humor. When I was ten years old I bought the first six Venom Comics ""guest-starring Spider-Man"" and I thoroughly enjoyed that little series (Feb 1992  Jul 1992).The second thing: the special effects will most likely get an Oscar nomination (even though it is very far from that time). The Sandman special effects were awesome, some of the best shots in the movie. However, to me, I thought most of these special effects while most likely supremely expensive and meticulously crafted were too video-game like. Almost everything looked slightly animated, just ever-so-slightly but enough that any average viewer would notice this. My favorite comic book superhero of all time is Superman, and always has been. If anyone has the DVD to the first two movies in 1978 & 1980 with Christopher Reeve (shot as one continuous movie), you can see what great special effects are like. This was before digital photography, and all of these special effects in the first two Superman movies were done optically with so much planning, designing and practicing. It proposed they could make you believe a man could fly and they did do that. The effects in Superman & Superman II have not dulled with time. Effects of this magnitude cannot really be seen these days, and it is probably mostly a budgetary and time issue. Superman paved the way for creating an Oscar category for special visual effects, because in its time it didn't exist. The Superman special effects artists were awarded with a special achievement Oscar instead. Now this is a serious category every year at the Academy Award ceremony.Now I didn't hate Spider-Man 3, but it was nowhere near as great as Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. It suffered kind of like Superman III suffered. In Superman III there was a mix of comedy and ""serious issues"", which reviewers didn't like. And Superman turned evil for a little while as well. Batman Begins was not afraid to take a beloved superhero and explore his dark side with a fictionalized version Bob Kane's origin story of the Bat-Man. That is one of best superhero movies made in a long while.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dumb, dumb, dumb","Spiderman III is one of the dumbest films I have ever slept through. Its pasteboard characters, its sub-literate moral prattle, its cornball special effects - will appeal only to little children.It might at least pass for harmless entertainment - except that it goes far out of its way to teach a harmful message - which is, that you must ""turn the other cheek"", or risk becoming as bad as a person who injures you. Of course, this ""moral"" is unworkable and therefore cannot be consistently applied. Spiderman will continue to go after the bad guys, whatever syrupy lessons May Parker may try to foist on him. Still, it is demoralizing to be told that going after evil is itself evil - and such pap should not find its way into films that are shown to impressionable children.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'd give my life for themSpider-Man 3,"So here it is, the final piece to the Raimi/Maguire trilogy of superheroes and love conquering all. The first two installments in the franchise helped rejuvenate the comic book movie, making them be taken seriously and showing that a little imagination surrounded by the real world could create suspense, action, and heart. Spider-Man 3 had a lot of expectations to live up to, and not just to be cohesive and complete with three villains and a couple new faces on the side. I know I myself went into the film to see whether Sam Raimi and company could round the story out and keep true to what had come before. By the end, while not completely satisfied and somewhat letdown at times, I found that I could still come out with a smile. The arcs of our principal characters come to a close and the presentation is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, with all the spectacle, money, and talent going into it, I just wished it would have stayed truer in tone and brought a little more to the table.First off, the acting is fantastic as usual; if nothing else, the trio of films showed that comic book films didn't need to be campy. Tobey Maguire proves again why he was, and is, the only choice to play the titular role. If Sony backs up their statements that a fourth go is in store with or without him, I may join the masses in boycotting it and taking a stand for artistic credibility rather than financial gain. Even when Maguire needed to ham it up (more on this later), he is the perfect mixture of geek and cool to pull it off perfectly. Kirsten Dunst does well again, showing some emotion in what is more simply a damsel-in-distress role than the previous films and James Franco is good also. Franco needs to show some huge range going from villain to amnesiac happy-go-lucky kid, and while he goes a tad overboard on the giddiness, the part works. As for the newcomers, Raimi shows once again that he has some clout and Hollywood cred, assembling one of the biggest casts with people doing very little. Bryce Dallas Howard is little more than a pawn at the expense of the plot and James Cromwell is a blink and you'll miss him blip on the screen. Even our new villains are given much less screen time than anticipated, however, they step it up and really steal the show.Thomas Haden Church truly inhabits the inner conflicted soul of Sandman. Everything he does is for love and while he may not want to do some things, he has no problem doing them if it may bring him closer to his daughter. Church gives a layered and nuanced performance, never falling into the one-dimensional villain trap a character like this usually does. As for the long awaited arrival of Venom, Topher Grace shows why he deserves the big budget roles to go along with his more accomplished indie porfolio. The malice and manic hysteria that comes out of him is both fun and frightening and he becomes an enjoyable foe to our hero. Along with the superb acting, we are given some spectacular visual effects. While some set pieces and background animation at many times looks cartoony and unpolished, you cannot fault the sandwork or the alien symbiote creature. The amount of detail taken on these two villains definitely shows where the enormous budget went, and it is good to see it was used to great effect.Where the film ultimately falls apart, in my opinion, is with the story itself. This is the first of the trilogy not to have a comic book mythology veteran behind the script. With most coming from Raimi himself and his brother, it shows a bit of a lack of stakes that the previous two had. Instead we are given a complete tonal change and a ton of slapstick and comedic moments. Some sequences, like that of Maguire dancing through the streets, confidence oozing from him due to the symbiote, really slow the film down to a crawl. The movie tries at too many times to be cute and while this might work to offset the dark and suspenseful moments in other films, Spider-Man 3 doesn't really have many rough spots to counteract. Sure the fight scenes are spectacular, but they just lack the sense of urgency from the past installments, always keeping the viewer removed from what is happening, just waiting for the heroes to be victorious. What started as a dark tale of heroism and the battle of one's own demons, with the first two chapters, concludes in a very heavy-handed and sentimental way.By no means am I not recommending this film thoughI enjoyed it throughout and only in a few instances did I feel its length. It is just that with the second part upping the ante like it did from its already great predecessor, I was disappointed that this final chapter ended up being the least successful of the three. Maybe it was because so much was happening and it all had to be resolved in one film, maybe it was that this is possibly the last Spider-Man from Raimi and he needed to end it all on his terms, I don't know. What I do know, though, is that the writing is not as intelligent as it was and sappiness, along with unintentional laughs, sometimes made me cringe. However, when the fighting started and emotions ran high, you can't not be caught up in it allat least until the dust settles.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Entertaining, action-packed movie with few flaws","Spider-Man 3 director Sam Raimi had a pretty high bar set for him after directing his masterpiece comic book movie, Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man 2 is said to be the best superhero movie ever made, and topping it is nearly impossible. For the third film, Raimi tried to make a bigger movie instead of a better one. He succeeded. Spider-Man 3 has more of everything. More villains, more love story, more fight scenes. It's bigger, but it's not necessarily better.One of Spiderman's biggest flaws is too much in too little of time. Too many villains and too many characters seemed to drag the film down a bit. But no matter, Raimi seems to catch your attention, right before you drown into all the nonsense, with his breathtaking action sequences. Unfortunately, there was simply not enough time to make a flawless movie with all the characters, villains and plots they throw at you in spider-man 3. However, you will be entertained. I guarantee you that; with the genius action sequences and the comedy, it seems to me that spider-man 3 just has a double dose of everything, some good, and some bad.Luckily unlike those other failed third superhero movies, Spider-Man 3 is the first of its kind to keep the same cast and crew together through three films. That's enough to keep it swinging. Still there's no denying that trying to squeeze so many different villains into a single movie hurts it.Yes, there were some cheesy parts of the movie, but what is a superhero movie without them! It's a comic book movie for goodness sakes! Howevever, if you go into the movie, leaving behind your realistic thinking; hence black goo coming from outer space with no explanation on how, you'll be able to sit back and enjoy one of the most entertaining superhero movies around.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Darker and More Extravagant,"This is, Arguably, the Highlight of the Series. Many uppity Film-Critics and jaded Fanboys have Weighed in on the Weight of the Thing, but that's the Thing. This End to the Trilogy is a Darkly Heavy Conclusion and it is a Spectacular Spider-Man to say the Least.Director Sam Raimi and the State of the Art SFX Team, and the Returning Cast are in Full Throttle for this Last Entry in Their Series.

Goblin, Venom, and Sandman have Battle Scenes that are so Fantastic that they Literally Set the Bar for this Type of Thing.The Movie Exudes Excellence from the Get-Go. It's a Non-Stop array of Births, Transformations, and shifting Personas and Allegiances that are Bizarre, Befitting its Comic-Book Roots. This one is more Gritty than the Previous Films, with some Horrific Undertones. But also Included is some Black Comedy that Lightens the Mood, but Not for Long.Other returning Characters are here for Continuity. Of Course there's Mary Jane who provides a Love Triangle with Tragic Consequences and a Twist, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and this jam Packed Extravaganza also Introduces Gwen Stacey.There's as much here and More than anyone Could Expect and this Extraordinary Movie is Bursting with Bravado, and Sentimentality.

A 'good' movie. Not a 'good' spidey,"--Possible Spoilers--Let me begin by saying that I am a spiderman fan. Even since I was a young boy about twenty years ago, I've always kept in touch with Spiderman and its various comic adaptations. More or less its had its own variations but some things remained the same, and in my honest opinion, gave our hero its unique taste as compared to other super beings. Making Spiderman more 'mortal', more 'human' in comparison to other famous heroes like Superman and Batman. Villains, were always very important to Spidey's life. Most importantly, Harry's GG and Venom were always his arch-rivals in the comics. Both due to power clashing, but also due to psychological reasons.The reason for this small intro, is to better explain to me why this movie would be fan to watch as a 'standalone' adaptation, had we not seen the previous two spideys. I think it suffered from the same thing X3 suffered. Too much to tell, too little time, too propagandistic at times that does not befit a hero like spidey (too many messages, too many notations, too much patriotism). Worse of all, it took Spiderman life's most important characters, like MJ, Harry, and Venom and minored them to sidekick level. the movie builds, and builds, and builds up quite efficiently but then it runs out of time. And hurriedly throws everything together. Not explaining a thing about venom neutralizing spider's sense. Not a thing about the depth of Harry's confused state for Peter(never in my knowledge did such an ending come on Harry. Instead, the two always mind-twisted one another using each one's past traumatic experiences)Spidey's adaptation of his darker self was a bliss though, and Jona was amazing as always. Pity they didn't' give him more time.Overall, a 6/10. Too cliché, and too shallow at certain points, but still a spiderman. And at certain moments, performances save the day.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The storyline is very weak , when i first saw the posters of the movie i thought that it was about that black material that came from the sky to fall just next to spider-man !!! i also thought that it gonna be sad or dramatic or something like that , when u see the movie u feel that they tried to make a combination of stories that are not connected to each other so the movie appeared very far away from being a one unit . these are my notes :1) that black material why it fall exactly next to spider-man ? and why it waited until half the movie to move and attack him although it was under his bed all the time ?!!!!2) Harry isn't a bad guy , he just wanted to revenge for his father death , he loved M.J , then you find him suddenly attacks her just to break spider's heart ?!! and that stupid old man in harry's apartment waited until the end of the movie to tell harry that his father killed himself !! then harry suddenly turned into a good guy again to help spider ?!!!!!3) the Sandman was a bad guy or a good guy !? well we will never know , after stealing banks and destroying buildings spider forgave him and let him go !! yes u are a good guy , go steal some banks to help Ur sick daughter !! then why didn't he ask spider-man for help from the beginning ?4) the worst part of the movie was when that black thing controlled spider-man , it was supposed to turn him into an evil spider , but he kept saving people , and instead of stealing banks or attacking cops , he just walked around the road dancing and looking at girls !!5) the strangest thing in this movie was that camera man , faking pictures doesn't mean that he is a monster !! but after that black material controlled him he became more than a monster !! the thing that me laugh is why he jumped at the bomb when spider-man was killing the black material ? the answer is simple someone must die at the end of the movie !! , by the way every movie based on a comic book for some reason must end with the kidnapping of the girl and the super-hero tries to save her !!6) i didn't know that there are celebrations for super-heroes where they come and show in front of the crowds !! i thought that they come and help people then disappear !!finally , spider man 3 could have been done very better than this , the movie is too long that i'll never see it again , i'm a spider-man fan , but i'm very disappointed , i think we shall wait for the 4th part hopping that it gonna be better !!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"BRILLIANT, yet annoying.","Yes, for the critics it must have been a hard decision, rating this film...2 or 3 stars, well take in to consideration the action and amazing special effects with a funny but serious script.But then again you also have to include the annoying ranting by Kirsten Dunst. Yes i agree with the critics, 3 stars suits the features of the film. It was a excellent, awesome, and hilarious film but some parts i LOVED, and others i didn't care for. Many things were packed into this film, and my favorite was the Spider-Man and Venom conflict, by far. Even though the film did a great job on the special effects, i mean a fabulous job, Venom should have been bigger and more muscular. My two favorite characters were the Anti-Spidey and Venom, the two funny characters in the film: Ant-spidey, funny and selfish, Venom/Eddie Brock, selfish with self centered funny comments. Go see this film, but get to the theater 1 hour and 20 minutes early, for parking, waiting in line for tickets, getting a satisfactory seat, going to the bathroom and getting you concession stand food and drink. Once the movie starts, enjoy the action, drama, and selfish humor that makes the spidey franchise what it is, i mean you always have to have at least one funny villain. To put it simply: Have a great time watching this great film!",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should have waited for the DVD release,"I am a big fan of the Spiderman comics and I really loved the first two movies. The third movie did not live up to the promise and hype. Waited way too long for the symbiont to latch onto Peter and then not enough of Peter as the black Spiderman. The fight scenes were good (what little there were). Bottom line is too much romance and not enough action. Let's face facts, Spiderman is an action superhero not a soap opera star. The first two movies kept me on the edge of my seat, but I actually found myself starting to nod off a few times in this movie. Especially during the tragic dance scene in the bar. In the comic book the symbiont would ""cloth"" Peter when he needed to turn into Spiderman. It is then that the symbiont started taking over Peter's mind, not when he was walking around as Peter Parker. I am surprised Stan Lee didn't step up during the filming and say STOP!, this is all wrong!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
fans of spiderman 1 and 2 will be disappointed!,"i am a huge spiderman 1 and 2 fan ,in my opinion number 2.1 is the best of the three movies ,number 3 being the worst. the movie starts off fine enough and the first hour or so is great.,......after that you would be forgiven for thinking that maybe it wasn't raimi who directed the second half of the movie.this is sadly a poorly written and directed movie with too many things going on at once to really focus on one defining plot....which it doesn't really have.there are great scenes (the jazz club) some OK action (poor cgi is obvious at times ,and after sandmans initial appearance his effects get tiresome) and some real menace (venom ..when he finally shows up) but all in all its a lot of happy coincidence to get us from one scene to the other.some scenes even had the audience laughing while two main characters are sobbing their hearts out ,and the final battle is unfortunately an anti climax of epic proportions!!it begs the question ,if your going to move that far away from the comics then why make a comic movie? the stories are all there ,the characters are there and the history is there ,i think the first 2 movies stuck true to the comics (albeit loosley) ,this one is very far removed and it suffers because of it!maybe a new cast and director can breathe life back into the franchise ,because this installment just sufficated it",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very sad day for Spiderman fans,"My roommate and I went and saw this movie in the theater. I have never really liked the casting of Toby Maguire in the first place, but the casting choices in this third installment were atrocious all around. Bryce Howard as a romantic rival to Kirsten Dunst seemed an incredibly ridiculous notion, not because she doesn't have the looks, but Kirsten Dunst is what you'd call a teen female ""heartthrob"" and Bryce Howard isn't. She looks so out of place it's distracting. Topher Grace as Venom is ridiculous. Period. I've liked him in other things but it was almost like he was trying to be worse than he had to be. I realize Sam Raimi makes horribly cheesy films but Topher wasn't even good cheesy. Just ridiculous cheesy. It's possible that Thomas Hayden Church, while not really suited to be a super-villain, did the best acting and character work in the entire show. I was disappointed with just about everything else in the movie with the exception of J.K. Simmons who has been consistently dynamite since the first installation. Pretty depressing turn of events for Spider-man fans if you ask me.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-man is not trying to climb further!,"I meant by that a comparison with the previous spider-man movies. The plot is not as deep as spider-man 2, in which- among other things- spider-man had to deal with his inner conflicts between his love and his responsibilities. Such a plot depth is replaced in spider-man 3 with more characters and more villains, which leads us to the point of the movie not having enough character development. Too many characters+ too many villains lead to that you don't get to see enough of each villain, for me that was the case with venom and sandman, i really wanted to see more of these two with more fight scenes with spider-man.The special effects are very good, and the acting is excellent.Overall it is an entertaining and enjoyable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste of time and money,"Spiderman 1 and 2 what can be said they were great films worthy and true to the comics. However Spiderman 3 is one of the worst films i have ever seen to be honest it is terrible. The film struggles to make clear partition between action, comedy and musical, with Kursten Dunst having two singing numbers in the film one wonders is she trying to launch a singing career.The comedy was the worst with the audience bursting into laughter but at the end of the film no one could remember why.Acting, well what can be said besides what acting , at best it was wooden with Toby McGuire's illusive fake wide eyes looking like he was high through out the film and Kursten Dunst's fake crying where all you can see is her second chin wobble below her jaw.The action when it arrives is good, very stylised but it lacks continuity. The fight scenes are over to fast except for the last one which just keeps on going as all the audience are on the edge of their seats to leave the cinema because they have been bored all the way through.Listening to the audience leave the cinema, showed how terrible this film is. All were complaining that it was too long, there are two many bad guys non with particularly great motives.In conclusion all i can say is save your money, this film shows me why people download movies because they save money on ridiculously expensive tickets and they don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of an emo peter parker! Well Done Sam Raimi you ruined the trilogy!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man 3 is Peak Cinema!,"Spider-Man 3 was so ahead of time, people in 2007 simply weren't ready for Bully Maguire. I'm glad that times have changed and most people finally understand genius of this film. Literally no director or top actor would be brave enough to dance like that in a movie. No way. Everything has to be so serious now. Where's the fun? This movie was fun and that's what matters.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Technical proficiency will amend a disjointed plot,"Continuing this franchise like clockwork, Sam Raimi again starts off just like the others with Tobey Maguire beginning his introduction monologue. Fulfilling it's obligatory requirements in spades, Spider-Man 3 continues to provide enough action, romance, drama, and comedy to justify another family outing. This time around though, mostly in place of a steady narrative lies the littered extracts of multiple threads tied together. In place of one encompassing conflict, the compacted screenplay attempts to mold no less then three of Spider-Man's enemies into this action extravaganza. For better or worse this will make or break the film for fans. Different concentration on Spidey's multiple adversaries lends well to keeping a diverse set of cutting edge fight sequences on hand, probably outshining any of the visceral memories from the last two films. But in fragmenting his attention amongst the different villains, Raimi (who this time was actually involved in writing the script) never really brings a worthwhile conflict to the fore, instead indulging crowds with an assortment of spectacular though mostly insignificant brawls. The technology behind capturing these heated battles has obviously never been better, as always there are plenty of moments that beg to be witnessed on a theater screen, but the overall impression is a bunch of fabulous, adrenaline pumping scenes that do not add up to cohesive whole.Still, it may be for that very indulgence that the film is as successful as it will most likely be. Whereas in the past I felt perhaps too much time was spent on completely clichéd wisdom, taking Parker's struggles to an unnecessary pulpit of sorts, this time around the heavy-handed dialog seemed toned down a bit, more in touch with web-slinging roots that dominate the visuals. Yes, there is another trial Parker must face within himself as he continues to identify the real person he thinks he is, but this time psychological undertones do not drown out Spider-Man's intended purpose, which would be to dazzle.And dazzle it does, cutting through much of the generic repetition with some of the finest CGI technical work to date. Exemplifying the quality design this team has become known for, right from the start it is apparent the action will definitely be trying to one-up some tough predecessors. From the film's first breakneck action sequence, Raimi shows his phenomenal talent for directing at high speeds, and puts forth some truly exciting chases. Along with Maguire's newfound pleasure in taking this little walk to the dark side, lies the heart and soul of another box office smash. Raimi is just able to ink out another worthwhile story from these mostly reused elements between spectacular confrontations, fittingly ending this trilogy on an appropriate, if obvious note. One does wonder what he will have left to say, if rumors hold true and Spider-Man is given a second trio of films; most characters just feel used up from this point out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
3rd time unlucky.,"From seeing the trailer so many weeks ago, this was the movie from the list of summer blockbuster movies (mainly sequels) I was looking forward to seeing.Spider-man 2 was without doubt the best comic book genre film ever, it had everything. So with Spider-man 3 out and the trailers looking fantastic I pre-booked my ticket and went to see it.Everything that was good in the second film was bad in the third. It was basically a re-run, going over the same story lines from the first two films.But my main problem with this film was the special effects. Apart from one or two scenes they were terrible. Where in the second film the CGI effects had depth and felt and looked right in the third film they stand away from the background and neither the foreground or background matched in light and shadow.Another issue I had with the film was how the film flowed. It was just a collection of scenes sellotaped together, and not very well. Perphaps if it was 30 to 40 minutes shorter, had one bad guy less it would of been a much better film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rushed and half-baked,"This is what happens when you want to cram a bit too much of a plot in too little time.Spiderman 3 tries to get it all. A love triangle, a family drama, a dark alter-ego story and not one, not two, but THREE major villains. And all that in just over two hours.Does it work? Well, yes and no. More no then yes, actually.For me the whole movie seems rushed. Everything happens as quickly as possible to make room for some more things to happen. Relationships between characters change and re-change every five minutes, good guys go bad, bad guys go good... it's basically all a big mess. The action scenes are good, but I must say that by this time I am a bit dumbed down to spectacular CGI action sequences. Gone are the days when one minute of T-Rex roaring into camera made my day - now I want a good story to go with my jumping, exploding, punching and swinging stuff.Peter Parker got it worst this time around. One minute he's happy, then depressed, then a bit too full of himself, angry, then cocky, then back to sad again... it's all bit irritating, really. Mary Jane is stripped down to a clichéd ""girlfriend who feels neglected"" character. The Green goblin story basically repeats itself. Sandman is neither here or there - this guy needs psychoteraphy, not superhero clashes. (Note to Sandman: make up your mind already!) And Venom is just tacked on - the black suit story should really have carried on to the next installment instead of getting a ham-fisted treatment.Is the movie bad? Well, not entirely, you still get your proverbially entertaining Spidey action sequences, and some of the effects are really good. But it all seems.. lacking somehow. One of the true reasons Spiderman was so well accepted as a character was his human side, but the characters in this movie are not human in any aspect, and I'm not really talking about their superhero mutations. They are victims of a relentless plot, which throws them, twists them and turns and leaves them gasping for air. It's hard to sympathize with protagonists who aren't really sure themselves if they are heroes, villains or just plain confused.And that's it. Just my 2 cents.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Terrible, unfinished movie","This is what happens when a terrible director gets unlimited control on a big budget film. It becomes bloated, with a plot that's only a tiny bit more interesting than watching grass grow. After watching this movie, I have to wonder...why was it even made? Have we gotten to the point where a movie can be created with the same mentality as a TV show created to round out a season? Did they create this one just so they could release some sort of Spiderman title for '07? Yes. This movie was recycled from the previous 2 movies with worse acting, musical composition, editing...everything. All in a longer package. Great. Save your money, buy the DVD if you must, and fast forward through the boring filler. In fact, just skip to the end, and don't watch how the Sandman story resolves itself. Simply terrible. On the plus side, I suppose the air conditioning didn't die during the agonizing 140 minutes. Great.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extremely Entertaining,"Spider - Man 3 has many strong points, which include: Good acting, Interesting plot, Incredible CGI, and a hilarious cameo by Bruce Campbell (Or Ash, from the Evil Dead Series)The plot is about Peter Parker (Spider - Man) who is living the good life. He's happy with all his Spider - Man fans, he's back to getting the highest grades in his class and he's planning to propose to Mary Jane. But then a strange black entity from another world crashes on earth in the form of a meteor. It bonds with Peter Parker and causes him to become arrogant and unpleasant, as he battles new villains (Including the Sandman, the best villain of the series in my opinion) and begins to seek revenge.As I stated before the acting is very good when compared to the prequels, every cast member gives a credible performance. The CGI is amazing, all though there are a few times when it becomes just a little too obvious. A few problems with the film is that it begins to drag towards the end, as it is 140 minutes long and 15 minutes longer than its prequels. The love story between Mary Jane and Peter went a little too deep in my opinion, and some of it seemed unnecessary. There are some incredibly corny lines, but what would you expect from this kind of film? Also, the strange black goo-like substance that attach's itself to Peter and makes him ""evil"" seemed a little forced. He wouldn't notice or even hear a meteor crashing down thirty meters away from him? And the fact it went after him out of all the millions of people living in New York seemed just a little too coincidental.Although in the end these problems are only small, as the positives heavily out weigh the negatives, as Spider - Man 3 is a great popcorn movie to lose yourself in for a few hours on a Friday/Saturday night. I feel that it does not deserve all the negative reviews. 8/10 - A must see for all Spidey fans, this film does not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spiderman 1 with updated special effects,"This movie is loaded with state-of-the-art CGI special effects. The action sequences are ingenious and even better than their comic-book counterparts. Even with painstaking detail given to the characters' background stories, the overall impact is less than that of Spiderman 2. Expectations just went too high. With all 3 movies being directed by Sam Raimi, I had thought there would be a steady improvement. Maybe giving the Director story-writing control was not such a good idea. Here in my country, supermalls with 12 theaters are all simultaneously showing Spiderman 3. Comic-book fans will also not be impressed by the simplified translations. I prefer the comic book versions of Venom and Harry Osborne. Sandman may have been improved but not to the extent of Dr. Octopus in the second installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The best part about the movie was Bruce Campbell and j.k Simmons they were so funny thats what real comic relief should be like. the movie didn't really have that cheesiness that I'm used to from a Sam raimi picture (just looks at evil dead) the way he directs is a cool way to, like the transitions he uses like the wipes and fade outs and stuff and the close up of a hand with a chainsaw like in the second one, the third movie really didn't have eny of that stuff and i was kinda disappointed but u should still go see the move couse it really is good",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
plot overcrowded,"""Spiderman 3"" manages to entertain the viewers for the lengthy runtime but finally fails to achieve a real depth. There is plenty of action and special effects as well are terrific (and of course, considering the budget) but the attempt to handle subjects like power, forgiveness, betrayals and so on made the result oversentimental and too mawkish, so that a fourth installment would be unnecessary in my opinion, producing a kind of idiosyncrasy against actors and director too.. Tobey Maguire is still suitable for the characters and gets to inject the dose of noise that Parker needed after the first two outings. Nevertheless I think that these plot detours along with the excessive dramatization of love and trust have finally resulted in something a bit tiresome",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thanks for the warnings... I'm not gonna watch this movie,"Dear fellow Spidey-loversAfter having carefully read dozens of your ""avoid at all costs!"" comments, my bro and I, who are Spidey fans and even have collections of Spidey-stuff, are not gonna watch this movie - not even on DVD.I for one am not gonna be knowingly ripped off. Just because a movie is called ""Spiderman"" doesn't give its makers license to indulge themselves at my - and it seems thousands of other - Spidey fans' expense. It seems that Raimi & Co (couldn't he afford a professional screenwriter?) should be charged with Culture Treason - for taking a treasured national icon and destroying it for personal gain.This picture reminds me of Titanic. There, the makers also knew that no matter how badly they wrote the story, people would pay money just to watch the spectacle of that great ship going down.Raimi & Sony are, of course, cackling with laughter all the way to the bank, while our beloved Spiderman lies dying in the gutter, coughing Spidey-blood. If they happened to see him there as they walked past, they might even kick him in the mouth and larf, just for fun.What a travesty.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty Good.(well just good really!),"I saw Spiderman3 the day before yesterday, and was really excited about seeing it. And yet again my anticipation was quickly deflated. It seems like every Spiderman movie catches me out like that. Anyway, the film is good. I know I started on a negative note, but it really is a solid film. The Sandman looks very good, and venom steals the show. It's a bit too long(as usual). There's a fantastic cameo from Bruce Campbell, which really nailed the Spiderman sense of humour, and it was good to see him again. The things that disappoint me are unfortunately rather important for a movie in that they are the two leading actors, Tobey Maguire fit the original part perfectly, but he has not matured, he remains the gormless, lost teenage geek. Kirsten Dunst turns out a very run of the mill performance, and has two rather unnecessary songs.Overall, I wasn't massively downhearted as it really only is Saturday afternoon entertainment, and Spiderman has never been the kind of film you would look forward to watching again.

"Wow, this is a great movie, The effects are brilliant.","I must say(this is my first comment ever) that Spider-man 3 is the best Spider-man movie.

Spider-man 3 is containing them all. Then I must say that the effects in this movie is... yeah they are so good. But then this movie is the most expensive through the history. 9 of 10 is my rate, it's not the best movie in history, great film thoe.

With trilogies comes great responsibility.,"Peter Parker is very happy, he's in love with the sensual Mary Jane Watson, his studies are going great, and America loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. But his world is quickly turned upside down as he comes under attack from Sandman, Goblin Jr and an alien substance that transforms Peter into something far darker than his super hero better self.There is a school of thought that says that sequels are always the tricky films for directors to take on, that may be so in most genres, but for comic book adaptations, all films are tricky. By the time of director Sam Raimi releasing Spider-Man 3, he had not only shown the world that he clearly loved the Spider-Man characters, he showed that he also knew how to better the franchise with the second instalment. So really, if we are all honest here, it was going to take a monumental effort to not just only better parts one and two, but to merely make a film to sit alongside those finely crafted pictures as well! That he managed neither is no great surprise when watching it now after the dust has settled a few years later. In his over eagerness to entertain us the fans, and with studio interference that Raimi to date refuses to over elaborate on (Venom-AKA Eddie Brock-it was-ahem-requested he find room for), Raimi lost sight of the less is more policy that made the first two Spidey movies great.When I first came out of the cinema after my original viewing, my head was chocked full of villains, not only that, but also Peter's love life struggles, it is in short, way too much for one movie. I had enjoyed myself for sure, hell! Raimi knows how to give his fans a good time, but when you break it own there are so many missed opportunities it grates substantially on the discerning movie watching fan. Thomas Haden Church is a fine actor, but as Marko he has little to do, so come the excellent transformation into Sandman, Church is a forgotten prop. Then there is the almost unforgivable act of losing James Franco {Goblin Jr} in amongst the collage of goings on, his Harry Osborn has a neat complexity to him and more attention to detail with this character arc would have provided great rewards I'm sure. Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane but appears to be regressing in acting ability, is she bored I wonder? Or is she just not that very good an actress? The less said about Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom the better, tho in fairness Raimi never wanted the character in the film, so it's hardly surprising that the best thing about the character is the entertaining effects as Venom snarls and snaps. Bryce Dallas Howard is sparky as Gwen Stacy, and J.K. Simmons as usual owns every scene he is in.Yet in spite of my grievances, after my HD revisit to the film I find myself warming to the Raimi franchise misfire. Clever themes such as power and its devilish off shoots are fleshed out, while the humour here is possibly the best of the three films thus far. The romantic angle between MJ and Peter is given serious thought and dare I say it, an adult make over. Whilst Tobey Maguire really has improved as an actor with each subsequent film, not withstanding an ill advised Saturday Night Fever sequence, Parker's venture to the dark side is excellently realised by Maguire. But ultimately it's with the action sequences that many younger viewers judge a Spider-Man film by, and part three is not found wanting, with a double team ultimate smack down raising the bar in gloriously over the top enjoyment. 7/10At the time of writing the above Raimi had agreed to do Spider-Man 4, I feel sure that lessons would have been learned, as it is now, both Raimi and Maguire have left the franchise.

This Movie was exactly what the third installment should have been,"This movie is definitely a departure from the first two but thats good. The first installment was how peter parker becomes spiderman and deals with his arch enemy. The second is actually just a love story with a villain barely tied into it. This one is what i would expect from a COMIC BOOK. We have spiderman just bombarded with problems and trying to resolve all the subplots while staying loyal to his hero status. Hes SPIDERMAN. Hes supposed to be dealing with all kinds of villains and difficulties....this movie covered all areas of the character. Sure there wasn't such a deep emotional content with this one but we've seen that already. If this movie was an hour longer just to tie up all the emotions, it would be a waste of time.

Not sure,"I went to a late showiing the day prior to its official release.I was so excited.Then I watched and bit by bit I felt robbed.Not to say that it was a bad movie.It felt rushed for lack of a better word.The entire movie was moving to fast.They were introducing new characters left and right.At the same time though they didn't explain any of them except for a few brief moments.The sand man wow could have been there best villain yet.Cause unlike the other main enemeies in the first two films,Marko wasn't crazy.He had a hard choice to make.He needed money to help his daughter get better.He became a criminal for good reasons.Yet they never really played on that.Even though the actor did a great job of making you feel for him.Then there was the venom arc in the movie.I really love the Venom story.However in this it just felt forced.It wasn't needed.I feel it was only used to appease the fans.Maybe if three was only about the sand man and peters declining relationships it would have been great.Then there wouldn't of been so much speed to the film like everything had to crammed into one movie.Then bring four out and leave the entire film to spidey vs venom.It was good but nowhere near what it could of been.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wanted so badly to like this movie....,"I loved Spiderman and Spiderman 2, and I was anticipating the release of Spiderman 3 for months. When the mixed review came in, I couldn't help but be disappointed, but just assumed the critics didn't like it but I would. Then I heard from friends attending the midnight preview that it was a horrid waste of time. I didn't care. I wanted so badly to love Spiderman 3 and walked into the theater with very high hopes.To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. First off, there was way too much going on, and every character in the film was underused. Bryce Dallas Howard is a wonderful actress, but hardly had time to shine. There were too many bad guys. Each bad guy had a fascinating story, however, and I wish that they were put in separate films so the audience could see more of them. The first two films had a great balance of action and romance, the third one too much romance.

How did this cost 250+ million?!,"i loved the first two spidey movies and rated them 8/10 and 9/10 respectively.unfortunately spider-man 3 is an unholy mess.while the first two movies had a great balance between character development and action coupled with great plots, this one is about 120 minutes of poorly written romance-drama and 20 minutes of mediocre action scenes. the dialogue is so weak it rivals star wars 2 - attack of the clones in its lameness. combine this with a plot that is about as interesting as an episode of some teenage-drama on television and you get quite angry during the movie's excessive running time.it is hard to believe the same people who made 1+2 were involved in this failure.save your money and if you *have* to see it, wait until the DVD hits the bargain bins which should be about 1 month after it's released.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/Sandman was aaccurate to the comics and I like how he turns into the well known villain.3.the action looks cool (even though it's fake)4.the Black Suit Spider-Man looks really good and the fight scenes with him has some of the aggression from the comics.5.funny memorable linesok, now lets talk about the nagatives.1. Peter Parker was slowly becoming unlikable because of him not listening to Mary Jane's problems.2.the effects look cool but they clearly look fake3. Harry Osborn having amnesia was unnecessary4. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock was ok but his performance I found laughable5. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy was also unnecessary to add in because she doesn't do that much except for more drama for Peter and MJ.6. having Sandman as the real killer of Uncle Benand finally Emo Peter Parker. I hate that they wasted the Black Suit storyline from the comics, he was laughably stupid but entertaining.And the scene before he tears off the Symbiote in the bell tower, we finally see some of the aggression from the symbiote effecting Peter but its a small quick scene.Overall it's a mess with lots of storylines squished together with the 3 villains with really laughably bad scenes but it's really entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Incredible!,"I can tell you, the first two are pretty good - but the third just absolutely blew me away! I have never, and I mean never, been so enthralled by a film of this genre (superhero/action) before. The special effects work really has to be praised here - it was like nothing I have ever experienced - at times I felt as though I were swinging around New York City! It really takes you away. From falling debris to the fighting sequences - the special effects are superb.I felt the inclusion of three villains here is what really makes the film. Three villains with their own fantastic backgrounds and relationship with Parker. I have got to say I really love the cast - a top job was done here also. And, very surprisingly, there was some good comedy in here also! Spidey 3 really has everything you could ever hope for in a film. I'll keep quiet about the storyline details, but it was very well done. It was intense, funny, and sometimes sad, but just a great movie overall.

An Honest Review,"It is too much, far too much, that is where the movie failed. It assumed that there needed to be more, more villains, more action, higher stakes, and at the end the film suffered for it.The Green Goblin, Venom, the Sandman, there were three major villains and three villain stories to tell and as a result the film lost focus.Not that it didn't have it's charms.Topher Grace isn't exactly the buff Eddie Brock we know from the comic books, but he works splendidly in a Raimi vision of Spider Man. He is the perfect foil for Tobey Maguire's character.Thomas Haden Church doesn't exactly fall to the bottom either. He adds a depth to a character that is allowed only so little screen time in a jumbled film.The problem isn't with the cast, the cast was great. And as usual Raini does an excellent job at directing.It's not as horrible as people say.The problem comes in with the plot itself, the script, there was too much.The tags the trailers, everything hinted towards Venom and Venom should have been the driving force behind the film. Had they stayed with a singular villain and not cut the movie into three little plot lines, it would have been a nicely streamlined success.Instead, however, they tried to throw too many at the audience at once, just like they did with the Batman movies, and just like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, Spider Man 3 became a disjointed mess of a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spiderman 3...The mighty have fallen!!,"When I saw the first Spiderman movie, I was amazed. It's true that in my opinion, it lacked action, especially the final battle, but still, an iconic literary figure was brought to life on the big screen with respect, and creativity. The second one I really enjoyed. The action was insanely good, the personal story was touching, and I walked out of the theatre feeling quite good about what I just saw (as Dashboard Confessional played ""Vindicated"" during the credits).Now Spidey 3 comes out and I'm totally disappointed again. For starters, There was WAY too much crammed in one movie, so it lacked sufficient depth with most of the sub-plots. As a matter of fact the only character I was remotely pleased with was in fact Harry, who had a great story, and was portrayed really well by James Franco. However, you have the Sandman who just happens upon a scientific experiment that turns him into Sand/Human Hybrid. I'll let that one go. Next you have Topher Grace cast in the role of Eddie Brock/Venom. In the comics he was a body builder, intimidating in his own right, terrifying when fused with the symboite. As much as I like Grace, he did not fit the bill. And there was SO much more that could have been done with Venom. So much. Fans wanted him, not Mud Man!! To make matters worse, Gwen Stacy was in it and served no purpose, neither did her father. The fights were over the top, but were poorly balanced against bad stories in the background (like Peter and MJ fighting over nonsense and him being to dumb to just say ""yes dear"").The worst parts of the movie were: 1)Cool Guy Peter 2)The instant wrap-up of the Eddie Brock, not Venom, it was way too hasty. 3)The Butlers sudden wisdom 4)The terribly crappy fight in the end 5)The fact that Venom had like, zero screen timeI dunno what it is about Marvel Movies that they cant pull of good trilogies (Xmen and Blade both dropped the ball on number three). You'd think this would be a slam dunk, but it wasn't. It was bad. It reminded me of Hulk and Superman Returns, both potential to be classics but they failed because the directors tried to improve upon what was already good. You let me down Mr. Rami. You let me down.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A good movie in a ongoing good series,"The Spider-Man franchise has done well. Both previous movies were good and stayed true to the comic story line. Most people didn't like this third installment out of the many to come (possibly 8 total), but I'll tell you why it was good.This movie took the storyline elements of the Spider-Man comics to the fullest here and introduced very important characters, like the Stacy family and Eddie Brock, and continues the life and times of Peter Parker in a short but well done way. The love interests Peter has in both Betty Ross and Gwen Stacy are portrayed well and get the point across, though not exactly like the comics.Forgiveness as the theme and moral of the story is put across directly and powerfully. Character conflict with Mary Jane and Peter is especially good and dramatic. Acting is successful and real like in the previous films and the action is fantastic, as always.Unfortunately, the film was too busy. Too much was going on with two villains and the drama. The excess of content lead to less character development, which left the villains not being as omnipotent and invigorating to the story as the other films. From a fan stand-point, Venom not being emphasized while attached to Parker or Brock was the most disappointing thing.All-in-all, this Spidey film is a good addition to its predecessors and is worth the watch despite its short comings.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric","Spiderman 3 reviewed by Samuel OsbornMy endless fascination with midnight screenings brought me to the theatre at Union Square here in Manhattan last night, standing in line with every other fanboy garbed in a Spidey costume bought from the Kmart down the street and crushing into a third row/far left seating arrangement that cricked my neck up to the gargantuan screen above. The film rolled up to speed and the requisite clapping and whoops ensued. 140 minutes and a polite applause later we filed out. All of us shook our heads, some shaking in confusion while others shook in unguarded disappointment. This, after all, was not the Spiderman 3 we had anticipated. It was something broader, something simpler, something light. But to call this third entry into the mega-franchise a complete blunder is a gross overreaction. It's more that the big gust of air Spiderman 2 inhaled in preparation for the big trilogy finish is not the same air exhaled in Spiderman 3. The film is still the same gosh-wow cinematic event it was three years agoonly this time around, things have gone a bit goofy.Things are as they were when we left Spiderman swinging through the steel and concrete canyons of the Manhattan skyline in 2004. He's still with the budding Broadway starlet Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and still at odds with his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who now seeks revenge for his father's death. Peter's lost in romance and fame, anticipating a city festival in Spiderman's honor and spinning webs for him and MJ to lie upon beneath the shooting stars. He's pitching the idea of a marriage proposal to his widowed Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and excelling in school with his lab partner/supermodel Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Yep, things are good in Spidey-land; and especially good when Harry awakes from a harsh concussive coma to have forgotten Peter's involvement in his father's death. But leave a particle physics experiment and an alien meteorite alone long enough and you're bound to face a stray supervillain. So inevitably, it isn't long until Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) and Venom are on the loose, robbing banks and infecting enterprising photographers (Topher Grace) like supervillains tend to do.What's changed most here is the text behind the production. The original Spiderman was penned by David Koepp, screen writing veteran of Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible and War of the Worlds. Spiderman 2 brought on board Alvin Sargent, a quieter writer known for Robert Redford's Ordinary People and the adultery riff, Unfaithful. This time around, Sam Raimi and his older brother Ivan penned the script with the help of Mr. Sargent. Sam Raimi's writing credentials include The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness. Though all three films are giddily remembered in all the majestic cheeseball glory, none of them would be considered the right material for the third entry into this multi-billion dollar franchise. And who trusted Sam's older brother Ivan to help put this story into theatres? Ivan's a doctor, not a writer. Anyway, this family pairing gave Spiderman 3 the wily gift of Camp humor. And Camp is something like the ugly lovechild of Satire and Parody: mischievous and unwieldy. When it works, it works (e.g. Evil Dead). When it doesn't work, the backlash from the audience can be fierce. And in Spiderman 3, the backlash will be vociferous.The sequence most in question finds Peter Parker under the control of Venom, the alien parasite that, when infected, transforms its host into the manifestation of its worst character traits. We expect the grimmer, haunting side of Spiderman to rear its head here. Instead, Raimi gives Peter the emo hair-flip and pencils in black eye-liner. He dances in the street and gives the eye to girls walking past. He goes to a jazz club and showcases his surprise piano talents, dancing on top of the piano and picking a fight with the bartender while jutting his crotch out towards the ladies. And if that weren't an awkward enough addition to the Spiderman legend, Raimi poses all of this as a quasi musical dance number. So if nothing else, it is a fascinating and hideous thing watching the colossal Spiderman franchise nearly cannibalize itself in a matter of two short scenes.Luckily, the action sequences are nothing if not spectacles, as usual. The feats of CGI workmanship are as we've come to expect from the Spiderman franchise, the perspective whirling about as if through the eyes of a highly enraged bumble-bee. If you aren't nauseated, you'll be amazed. The villains are the best they've yet been, with Sandman showcasing the state of artistic digital animation and the creepy, parasitic Venom living up to its insatiable hype by the film's end. It's all structured so as to make the action into fresh and sugary prizes for enduring the lesser story bits forced in between.Spiderman has always pretended to be story-driven. And in the first two films the script was convincing enough so that we shrugged our shoulders and played along. But the Raimi brothers have indulged maybe too sloppily into comic book traditions this time and have let their story stray into something of an unintended joke. But for a franchise that relies on the tent-poles of event summer cinema, Spiderman 3 is still a blissful two and a half hour block of escapist fun. Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric.Samuel Osborn",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider Pig would have been a better choice,"Spider-Man 3 might be best subtitled, ""Peter Parker Grows a Pair."" That would seem like an endearing quality if this was a coming-of-age movie about the sand-in-the-face nerd finally overcoming bullies and low self-esteem to win the girl of his dreams, but it's not so wonderful or interesting in a superhero movie.Sure, Spidey DOES have low self-esteem, and sure, Peter Parker IS a nerdy little twit, but he's no weakling - that ship has long since sailed. Now, Spider-Man is the hero of children across the city, so there's less reason to empathize with him, to identify our own uncoolness within Parker.The problems with this movie are manifold. To begin with, the webslinger has far too many bad guys to face. First, there's the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict who fell into a particle accelerator and now has the properties of, well, sand. Then there's an alien parasite, conveniently falling from the sky so it can latch onto Peter and bring out the worst in his repressed personality. Then there's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a supremely vicious rival photographer. Oh, and Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of the Green Goblin; he thinks Spidey killed his pop (he didn't), and he knows Peter is Spidey (oops). So you can imagine what's on Harry's mind.With all of these villains, you'd think there'd be plenty of conflict. Clearly, however, the writers felt something else was needed, so they invented a highly contrived plot thread in which Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) relationship disintegrates. It should be no surprise to you whatsoever that somehow this relationship gets resuscitated by movie's end. They're together! They're apart! They hate each other! They love each other! You'll hate them both! And what bugs me more than the obviousness, the sheer craptastic predictability of the relationship angle, is that both MJ and Peter act like completely selfish, rotten jerks to each other - and we're supposed to eat that up. Apparently, we're supposed to think, ""Hey, yeah, that's exactly how it is!"" Supporters of the movie might point to the fact that Peter's under Venom's control when he's treating MJ like garbage, but that's not true - he's a creep to her well before Venom shows up. He's smug, self-centered, clearly soaking up the adoration of the city like he was Donald Trump handing out low-income housing in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that smug, but still. Peter Parker, in this movie, behaves exactly opposite from what makes Peter Parker interesting to the rest of us in the first place - that he is an insecure dweeb who happens to have superpowers. A crass, smarmy punk is not appealing.There's one telling scene - it was in the trailer, too - that shows Peter strutting down the street, wearing the Venom costume under his normal clothes, and every girl stops to stare at this supposed virile paragon of masculinity. Yeah, Peter Parker. The problem is that Tobey Maguire isn't much of an actor, and when he has to stray from the golly-gee innocent-lamb of Peter Parker, his inabilities are completely exposed. In short, he sucks ass. He can't carry a scene without putting on a mask and looking like he's swinging on some web-like substance. The casting of Maguire made sense originally, because he looks exactly like the kind of doofus nitwit you'd expect Peter Parker to be, but in this movie, when he has to be more than just that doofus, Maguire can't hack it.Speaking of looking like he's swinging .... isn't the whole purpose of CGI to make awesome things look real? Remember back in the day when actors would be in a car, appearing to drive through a city, when it was obvious they were on a set with the city scene playing in the background? I mean, on the cheaper films, it was pretty clear what was going on. The CGI in this movie is a lot like that. When Spider-Man is swinging between buildings, it looks like they took Maguire jumping around and plopped it onto a city background. It looks terrible, and it's distracting.So, let's recap. Too many villains (they should have stuck with Sandman and Harry), a shallow, ridiculous relationship, poor special effects, and bad acting, at least on Maguire's part. But hey, I can't blame him entirely - Sam Raimi's script turns Spider-Man into Emo Spidey - complete with stereotypical Goth haircut and dull monotone! And who knew that simply wearing the Venom costume could make one an accomplished jazz pianist and dancer? With all of these obvious inadequacies, you'd think that the door would finally be closed on this series, but since the movie did well, you can bet a S-M 4 will pollute the theaters sooner rather than later.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Peter, it's time to grow up !","The promises made by Sam Raimi and the producers of Spider-Man 3 were huge : beside a gigantic spectacle with unseen special effects that everyone expect from this king of epic blockbuster, they seems to assure the audience and the readers of the comic-book that this part will be more mature (Peter Parker, after his adolescence in the first part and his student life in the second, has now to face some adults decisions) and darker (the enemy, Venom, is for the first time a villain from the 80's, a darker period for our friendly neighbor)than the prequels. Helas, the movie fails to archive its pretensions on one level, that's certainly the most important : if the special effects are beautiful (the birth of Sandman is indeed a wonderful humanistic use of informatics), the lack of coherence of the movie is so obvious, that it ruins the pleasure you take to the pyrothechique spectacle.The first two adaptations of the comics were frozen in a bi-polar structure, that divides the movie in a first enjoyable part that shows Peter Parker's daily life and problems, and a more conventional second part, were Spider-Man fights a villain (Green Goblin or Octopus). The first good surprise of this third part is that this boring structure explodes right away, villains comes out of nowhere every five minutes, sentimental and heroically life are stuck together, the situations always change : you really have the impression read a gigantic trade paperback of the Spider-Man adventures. But the bad news is that, after a few time, it really gives a incoherence feeling, and the impression that the plot goes in every direction at the same time becomes more and more important. The situations look illogical, as well as the character's choices. And the density and the variety of the plot rapidly becomes complication and exaggeration. You soon loose the feeling to read a TPB, but a digest of all the Spider-Man stories in years.And the incoherences doesn't only concern the narrative structure of the movie, its tone, as well as Sam Raimi's adaptation choices suffer from this lack of coherence. If the naive and lighten atmosphere particularly fits to the teenage tone of the first movies, the naivety of the characters and of the situations, when it comes to an adult life, to marriage and to work questions, is rather ridiculous ! And the same critic goes for the narrative and visual style of the movie. Since the beginning of the saga, Sam Raimi chooses to adapt the comic-books of the 70's, with its ridiculous villains and its lighten tone. But when it comes to the symbiot arc, and particularly to Venom, the style has to become darker and graver. And the least we can say is that the all thing unfortunately stays as unreal, incredible and immature as in the rest, even if it's now impossible to hide the incoherences of the movie behind the argument of a 70's style adaptation.When the first movie made me dreamed of a dramatic crescendo, the third only offers a well done pop corn movie, and is in the end as disappointing as the last stand of the X-men.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It is what it is, the story of Spider-Man AND Peter Parker","Unfortunately the internet makes it far too easy to voice an opinion, but in regards to Spider-Man 3, it seems the only opinions being voiced are those that did not like this film.Having said that, I think I have figured out who these people are. Simply put, the negative reviews for this film are from people who know very little, or nothing, about Spider-Man.This film follows quite closely to a couple of story lines in the Spider-Man Universe and certainly helps develop the character of Peter Parker. Essentially, the first two films were not the end of Peter's growth as a hero and as a man, and this can easily turn some people off. The turnoff is honestly for those who want instant gratification, they don't want dialog, they want a fight. Spider-Man 3, in my opinion, does a fantastic job bringing BOTH to the table.It's very difficult to teach the entire backdrop of the Spider-Man stories to those who are not familiar with the comics because it took 40+ years to produce them (and would take a very long time to summarize for those who have not read them). Is this movie perfect? No, but no movies are, every movie is with flaws and we are not long to point them out.If everyone knew, however, the complete history of Spider-Man, they would be quite happy with this film. Without giving spoilers, I can honestly tell you that this movie is very much worth your time and money. The acting was very good, the dialog was emotional when it needed to be, serious when it needed to be and sometimes, just funny. Bring your family and enjoy, this movie is ANYTHING but a let down.

"A cluttered disjointed mess that crams way too much into way too little, but Sam Raimi and most of the cast keep it engaging.","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) having revealed his identity as Spider-Man to now girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) now contemplates the next step in their relationship intending to propose marriage. Peter is also drawing attention from his lab partner Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) which in combination with Mary Jane's problems with her acting career and Peter's Spider-Man persona becoming an intrusive presence are putting a strain on their relationship. Meanwhile Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco) angered from the revelation that Peter is Spider-Man and believing Spider-Man killed his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe), becomes the New Goblin and sets to kill Peter only to be rendered an amnesiac during their fight with no memory that Peter is Spider-Man. Peter also deals with a cocky arrogant rival photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who's after his position taking pictures of Spider-Man and is met with the revelation that Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was the actual killer of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Peter is shaken by these events which only get worse when an alien symbiote bonds with Peter giving him a black version of his Spider-Man suit that elevates his strength and abilities but also his darker impulses and aggression.Following the continued success of the Spider-Man series with Spider-Man 2 development began on a third film in the series. Raimi had initially intended the film to feature Harry Osborn as the New Goblin and Sandman as the villains, but received pressure from producer Avi Arad to add a third villain to the line-up. While Raimi suggested Vulture as played by Ben Kingsley, producers felt that Raimi was being guided by his love for the Silver Age stories and villains and neglecting more current fans and heavily pushed Venom for the film. From the previous films, it's always been clear that Raimi tried to adhere pretty closely to the mood, tone, and plots of the original Stan Lee and Steve Ditko stories and when those are contrasted against the Black Suit Spider-Man/ Venom issues that are considerably darker in their almost ""body horror"" themes and with Venom are emblematic of the ""Dark Age"" of comics where the line between heroes and villains was blurred with more morally ambiguous characters and anti-heroes including venom. Sony, unbeknownst to Raimi had intended to capitalize on the popularity of the Venom character by launching a spin-off character from the main Spider-Man series hence why they pushed for Venom's inclusion. With so many new elements to add in to not only account for Venom, but also additionally characters related to venom, the symbiote, and the black suit the writers found themselves struggling to fit all these elements in that it was briefly considered splitting the story into two movies until the writers couldn't find an appropriate break in the middle act to allow such an approach. Spider-Man 3 is film that still has moments of greatness in it, but they're often overshadowed by ridiculous scenes that don't mesh with the dark source material the film tries to adapt.The action sequences and effects are still on point with the fights between Sandman and Spider-Man particularly great. The effects used to convey Sandman's powers especially a two minute long scene where Flint is trying to reassemble himself and get used to his powers is a really strong moment of visual storytelling and an impressive effects showcase. The movie also features some really good scenes between Rosemary Harris returning once again to play Aunt May and Peter Parker with the two having a really sweet dynamic that sells them as family.Unfortunately outside of the action and effects, the writing and characters suffer from a lack of breathing room as plot threads become as tangled and stretched as Spider-Man's webbing with a lot of contrivances happening in artificial manners feel hollow, manipulated, and stupid. Not only does the Alien Symbiote just randomly crash near Peter Parker, but Harry gets amnesia, the police withheld the identity of Uncle Ben's suspected killer for no real reason, and the interpersonal drama between Mary Jane and Peter becomes really petty with Peter's inflated ego and Mary Jane's passive aggressiveness of disguising her frustrations rather than confronting them makes their scenes rather grating. And then we have Eddie Brock aka Venom. Most of the problems in this film can be traced to the fact that Eddie Brock was crowbarred into the movie. Both Harry Osborn and Eddie Brock have grudges against Spider-Man/Peter Parker and with both of them now in the movie and not enough focus dedicated to one or the other, it botches what should be the pay off for Harry for a three film arc, and rushes through Eddie Brock's development in what feels like maybe forty minutes in what should have taken at minimum 2 movies to get to because Sony was foaming at the mouth for its Venom spin-off, not that any one would want one because Topher Grace is egregiously miscast. This isn't Topher Grace's fault, even if a more appropriate actor had been chosen they still would've dealt with a script that didn't understand the Venom character. Not only does the character speak in identifiers ""I"" instead of ""We"", but the portrayal doesn't have Venom's twisted morality of ""guilty"" and ""innocent"" that makes him feel justified in his actions, not only that but Venom refers to himself as ""The Bad Guy"" in the climax.Spider-Man3 does have individual scenes or performances that reach the level of the first two films, but thanks to being overstuffed with excess bloat the movie has too many plot threads and characters competing for attention and ends up underserving all of them. Not a complete misfire, but falls well short of the standards set in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wait till its out on video, and then only when its a weekly.","I think its best in any review to try and be balanced, to weight up the pros and cons, to be constructive with any criticism, and to praise where appropriate. So, in that context, I would just like to say that Spiderman 3 was a total dog's breakfast, and advise you to see something else.Its a rare cinema experience to see so many keen and eager people at the beginning of a film, with their chatting, fidgeting, laughing and excited expectations; and then to have these same people at the end of a film realising that, despite their best intentions, they have been completely let down, and so they simply quietly disperse.It fails because one senses the producers are more concerned about the survival of the franchise and the drive-thru burger license than the credibility of the story. You realise early on its all going to be so safely, completely and nicely resolved that any plot development is really only a distraction, and you start to wish the audience could have a show of hands to fast-forward thru the dull convoluted middle bits for the obvious showdown at the end.Its such a bland soulless CGI affair that you serious start thinking that even a cameo appearance by Jar Jar Binks would improve it (""Me's a tinking me Jar Jar senses are tinkling""). At least Jar Jar would be able to hand over the award for most stupid CGI creation, with ""The Monster from the Bag of Liquorice"" now being clearly the most ludicrous creation of all time.Forgetting all the logical inconsistencies and incredibly remote coincidences in the story (and thankfully, 15 minutes after you leave the cinema, you find that you do), the biggest sadness with this film is that the three characters, who you invested some emotional commitment to in the first two films, fail to develop or grow in any meaningful way. They just have a series of set pieces seemingly designed by a committee that is only missing someone in the background holding up a sign saying ""They are Now Sad"", ""They are Now Happy"", ""They are Now Angry"", or ""They are Now Trying to Be Funny"".It you do intend to watch this film, watch the first two first; because after seeing Spiderman 3, you will find the first two forever tainted, as you know now where its all going to head.

Spider-man 3 (x's) villains..............!,"Went to see this last night, initial thought exiting the theatre was- That was an exciting, entertaining and impressive 2 hour cinematic experience.Yes, there were flaws, some of which are slightly annoying, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was a fitting 3rd movie to end the Trilogy(?)The Negatives-1/ The movie was FAR too busy, too many villains to deal with (especially since we are getting the bad guy's back story's). Along with the villains we have the ""dark"" side of Spider-man and the MJ, Gwen, Harry and Peter love triangle/square and the rise and fall of Brock all to deal with.2/ Far too many coincidences for my liking, the meteor falling that close to MJ and Peter, Sandman falling into some particle accelerator, Gwen's floor being demolished by the crane etc etc.........(its a comic-book movie though I suppose)3/ Too many fight scenes.4/ The Gwen character, not a required element that the movie needed.5/ Sandman turning out to be Uncle Ben's killer, another story strand that was not required and just made the movie even harder to come together.The Positives-1/ The effects are OUT-STANDING.2/ The fight scenes are spectacular. (too many though).3/ Acting, considering this is a comic-book/event movie the acting was top-drawer, especially from Tobey.4/ The fun factor, Bruce Campbell and J. K. Simmons are FANTASTICALLY funny. As is the ""dark"" Peter Parker.5/ The MJ/Peter love story, I genuinely felt sorry for the both of them and willed them to sort everything out. Kirsten performance was subdued but still impressive.6/ The Excitement factor, from the starting credits to the end credits this was none stop,yes the film was far too busy, but at least thanks to that the movie is extremely exciting throughout.7/ The ""dark"" Spider-man and Peter Parker. I believe the Sam (Raimi) could have dropped the whole Sandman character from this episode and introduced the black entity/""tormented"" Spider-man earlier which in turn would have given Venon/Brock some much needed extra screen time. But the ""dark"" suited Spider-man was an impressive part of the movie.Overall the movie was excellent, yes as I stated the film was far from immune to serious flaws, but I can genuinely say that I came out the theatre satisfied I had seen a GREAT Spider-man movie! 9/10- A great effort, and a high quality event/comic-book movie. Fingers crossed we get a 4th movie with the same cast involved, unlikely(?). Time will soon tell. This is very much worth the entry cost, just for the spectacle of it all!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Super...Superb!,"Spider-Man 3 was better than expected, and I'm saying that because the trailers didn't impress me. The beauty of the film lies in its action, with its superb visual effects. Although I didn't feel he was required, Flint Marko's transformation into Sandman is truly mind-blowing. Tobey Maguire is really awesome as the new ""changed"" Peter Parker and does some really good acting. James Franco's role as Harry Osborne is lovable, and, at the end of the movie, I felt he was the real hero, not Spider-Man. And story-wise, maybe Spider-Man 2 had a better storyline.Venom was given way too less screen time (4 minutes). Venom deserves an entire movie to himself, he's Spider-Man's toughest enemy! The music is very good, the music that is played in the opening credits are really good. But sometimes the film loses it's pace. J.K. Simmon's role as J.J. Jameson is very comical, specially his first seen, where he is seen ""trying"" to control his anger. Topher Grace fitted very well in Eddie Brock's role, plus he got some of the best dialogues as well! The film is just superb!I enjoyed the movie... I'm looking forward to Spidey 4... and I can't wait for the DVD!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun Ride...Most of the Time...,"So. There are a few things in this movie that don't end up adding up, but in the end, its alright.Its what you come to the movies expecting- and I got exactly what I came for, a fun ride, with some intrigue along the way. I enjoyed watching this movie similar to riding a roller coaster, you are not sorry you did it, but you are not sure you would do it more then once.Now, let me add that as a girl who happens to action films, the fight scenes were amazing. The only parts that got to be a bit tedious were some of the interactions between the characters. Some of these scenes were necessary, some were not.The acting was pretty top notch, the special effects were fabulous.For me the worse part was the senseless way to end it- If you have seen it you know what I am talking about. I saw strong potential for a storyline that could have gone somewhere...But never mind. Watch the movie, just come to the theater expecting what you'll get- a bit of sappy romance, a bit of corny lines, some great action fight scenes...and you wont be sorry",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Best ""Evil Dead"" Movie Yet!","This movie differs very much from the previous two films. In Spider-man 3, Sam Raimi is given complete control of the film, and he produces one of the greatest works of art in the entirety of human history. The horrid dialogue and sub-par acting only help to enhance the best comedy of the year. The 2 and a half hour long epic was mostly worthless and boring, but the stretch of comedy where Peter Parker becomes a failed emo womanizer is worth every second of it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has the slightest bit of a humor hidden somewhere in their body. Any Evil Dead fan will feel right at home with the jovial jokes spread throughout. If you are a real fan of Spider-man, stay clear. If you're drunk and want to enjoy an evening laughing at bad actors, go see this movie this very instant. That is all.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice realization of spiderman... poor storyline...,"I didn't mean to make this comment as a representation to the whole Spiderman series (from 1 to 3), but first, i need to let you know that from the first movie, i don't feel like to buried my self in the story, because the storyline is not what I, as spidey loyal fans, expected. Although if I didn't know the comic book storyline, I would think the story is well produced...The third story even worse, by entering Gwen Stacy character which supposed to be Peter Parker's high school sweetheart, and uncovering uncle Ben's murder mystery like that... Agreed with scott's review, that the movie has too many villains to deal with and the problem Spidey facing is just too much... although as Mary Jane told Peter, ""Even Spiderman needs help sometime..."", but the help he receive in this movie in my opinion is only for dramatical reason...Great visualization of Venom, although for Spidey black suit, i prefer the suit to stand on its own instead of blending in with the original suit. The suit should be just plain black without the web outline, it will make spidey meaner... And the point of having the suit blend in with Peter's attitude, is to make him more rough and violent, not make him looks stupid...Many people complaint about Peter Parker crying too much in this movie, but I think that's OK, since Spiderman is human after all...Over all, good work for the whole cast and crew, even the writer, but hopefully in the next movie, we can get a clearer picture of what happening, not just scattered picture on how great Spidey is...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Doesn't touch its immediate predecessor, but nice try anyway.","""Spider-Man 2"" eclipsed my expectations of what to expect from the mega-popular superhero franchise. Not only did it ramp up the quality of the action set pieces and visual effects considerably from its predecessor (the entirety of what most action blockbuster sequels encompass) but it also tracked and maintained the natural progression of all the characters involved, based on what was left after the first film. It wasn't afraid to further explore the emotional weight that comes with been a teenage superhero, nor to flesh out a villain that was sympathetic and not entirely malevolent. This, along with the perfect interplay of comedy and dazzling action made SM2 in my opinion the perfect comic-book movie. No surprise then that I had high hopes for this second sequel (as if no one else did!). From what had already passed and with a considerably bigger budget ($250 million +, the trailers prove that alone), Sam Raimi and co. were looking to once again up the stakes in all areas. But surely no one can beat the ""perfect"" comic-book movie?All is rosy and right with our friendly neighbourhood Spiderman at the outset of his latest adventure. In stark contrast to what began the first sequel, the man sized creepy crawly is the toast of the city, now balanced perfectly with alter ego Peter Parker's straight A student life and blooming Broadway beau Mary Jane Watson, who is now aware of Peter's secret. However, not all is serene under the screen. Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn, is still seeking revenge for his father's death and now that he knows who's behind the mask of his adversary, he can finally squish the bug from the source by continuing is father's legacy as the New Goblin.Enough for the latest episode you say? Well barely half an hour in, at least three more plots surface; during a night under the stars for Peter and MJ, a meteor strikes covertly close by, subsequently releasing a writhing, crawling black ooze that manages to hitch hike home with Peter that same night; a rival photographer in the form of Eddy Brock (Topher Grace) is slithering his way into the Daily Bugle as Spiderman's new photographer, much to Pete's disdain; Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church) is a runaway criminal and allegedly the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben (a major plot motivation) who ends up accidentally trapped in an elaborate experimentation chamber that turns him into a disintegrating sand monster, aka the Sandman.So after two paragraphs I've basically described almost the entire setup act. This is nothing we haven't seen in the trailers and even more is yet to come. There's the case of Spidey's black suit, Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) as the rival love interest, Venom and not to mention how all this affects Peter and MJ's relationship. People who are familiar with the comics or have seen the trailers will be aware of most of these plot points so I'm not going to elaborate, and for those who aren't aware, well, I don't have the space.Yes, Spider-Man 3 is stuffed when it comes to content. The filmmakers have clearly seen this as possibly the capper on the trilogy so they decided to add in as many popular characters, villains and stories as possible while settling a number of plot lines started in the first two films. What results is at times an immensely entertaining film with action set pieces and special effects that out do its predecessors, trademark moments of zany and self aware comedy (Spidey empties his boots of sand after a long bout with the Sandman, asking himself ""Where do these guys come from?"") and our favourite characters portrayed perfectly by skilled actors. But by the end there's a distinct sense that everything else that the other films nailed could have gone smoother had they reduced the content.This movie has enough to span at least two and to be honest that's probably what should have happened. While the black suited Spiderman is partly the result of the Sandman's existence, due to Peter's thirst for revenge for his uncle's true killer (feeding the black clinging symbiote), it could have been left for another film, leaving Peter to deal with the Sandman, Harry and MJ here. That's more than enough to engage for 2 hours. As much as I loved Peter's new attitude with the black suit and all the comedy that ensued, the development needed more time to illicit the sense of struggle in the character (Black Spidey is hardly seen in action nor are the symbiote's origins thoroughly explained).Venom is another example. Probably the most infamous villain in the comic books, he's given nothing more than 20 minutes of screen time here, making him seem like a complete after thought, just shoehorned in for popularity's sake. He looks cool and his eventual appearance sticks to the source, but it's too little of too much too late. Along with the black suit, Venom should have been reserved for another film. New villains, especially of this ilk, need that time to develop. Venom and Sandman each deserved a full length feature at least.Despite these annoying flaws, there's no denying Spider-Man 3 is still a very entertaining comic-book film due its incredible action (New Goblin vs Peter can take the prize for that), gorgeous special effects (Sandman's first appearance is a short film in and of itself due to its beauty alone) and show stopping comedy (Bruce Campbell once again has a hilarious cameo). It's never boring despite the length and the pacing is fairly consistent. It's also the most fun you'll have at the movies thus far this year, so I recommend it for that alone. But as an entry in the superior Spider-Man saga, it falls behind number 2's stunning all round quality and even number 1's tight plotting. In the end, they really couldn't improve on the perfect comic-book movie. Go figure!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Timepass movie..,"I have not seen any of the previous Spidey's..And was very eager to see Spiderman-3 and the CGI art work..Yeah.. CGI is the only scorer in my view.There was plot and director failed to make it a script..While making any movie based on a comic, one should take just the points not the entire story line.. Director has entirely failed in this- I will give 2/10 for this effort.Acting was OK.. So 6/10 CGI effects were good but I expected lot more than that.. So 7/10 And I don't think of mentioning any other thing..You can opt to not watch it..",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable, but nothing special","~Plot/Writing/Direction~ Under this heading comes our first, and biggest problem: There are too many story lines going on at once. I mean, you've got 3 villains, plus each of their backgrounds, MJ's troubles, Harry's numerous changes of heart, 2 different Spidermans, competition between Parker and Eddie Brock at the newspaper, Gwen Stacy, and more. What was great about Spiderman 2, was that the plot was much more visible and focused; all you had to deal with was Parker's inner struggle, and his relationship with MJ, and his fight against the villain, Doc Ock. Additionally, I thought the writing was a tad flat and uninspired; perhaps a surprise considering it was written by veteran, Alvin Sargent (although he wrote Spiderman 2 alone, but co-wrote 3 with Sam and Ivan Raimi - so maybe that had something to do with it).~Cast~ Really, no stand-out performances among the main cast. The character of MJ is a bit of a useless brat in this film, and I never much liked Kirsten Dunst, who doesn't make any of her feelings in the film look genuine. Tobey Maguire was competent, but was painful to watch during Peter Parker's eye-liner-clad bad boy scenes (yeah, what was that all about anyway? Talk about losing the plot!). Franco was annoying as he was in the previous two; but that's mainly due to the kind of character he had to work with. Still, he didn't make a convincing villain, and the same can be said for Topher Grace, who was irritating before he became the vastly under-written Venom. Much better were Thomas Haden Church, who succeeded in bringing us a villain for whom we had an ounce of sympathy. Bryce Dallas Howard played her part well, as did J.K Simmons (yet again). The highlight of the film, however, had to be Bruce Campbell as the Maître d'. Hilarious.~Music~ Bit of a mish-mash score here. Danny Elfman was hired, as he was for the previous two, but had a falling out with Sam Raimi and left the project. Christopher Young was brought in to score the film, but film chiefs thought he did a poor job and replaced some of his work with snippets of music recycled from previous Spiderman/Danny Elfman films. Still, the sentimental moments worked, and Christopher Young did a decent enough job. Even so, I think Elfman's scores, while they do the trick, have never been phenomenal in any respect.~Other~ For a film with a $260 million dollar budget, the effects didn't blow me away as I had much expected them to. The visuals in both the first two films weren't overly impressive either, so it didn't bother me all that much. The best parts (with regard to visual effects) were undoubtedly the Sandman's scenes.~Summary~ Well it kept me entertained for its lengthy running time. Solid cast, a plot that was overcrowded but enjoyable enough, and a lot of polish, owed to it's huge-ass budget. Should certainly appeal to the masses, and is likely to go on to be one of the most financially successful films of all-time. But after the great Spiderman 2, I can't help but think Raimi has let the side down a little.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
To a Marvel fan this was bad,"I'll try to be short. Spiderman 2 was the only acceptable movie of the trilogy, it had a lot of JJJ, least of Tobey playing his dumb scenes of Peter Parker (instead of just being a shy, rational guy), and a good villain (in fact villains were the overall positive things of the trilogy), Spider2 just lacked on action, it just should have had more, it made the movie a little boring. Now some things about spider 3. 1st, Peter Parker, that wasn't Parker, was the usually dumb Tobey. Damn, even the characters of SandMan and Venom were better than I expected, but this actor, Tobey was at his worst, more than ever. He stands behind the crowd without the mask =| He fights without the mask, he does that donkey face and starts to dance...he made me sick with just 2minutes of the movie start. His spider sense was OFF, and he gets more beat than superman and still stays OK, I don't get it. I think MJ was really OK, it's hard to do better when we're not physically similar to the BD MJ. JJJ is GOLD but was deeply underrated on the this movie. Harry...well Harry is bad, at least cut your hair man! To be a bit similar to the real harry, at least physically. Topher Grace (Brock/Venom) and Thomas Church (Sandman/FlintMarko) were OK, I really think sandman was more than OK, he succeed in to pass that feeling about family he has at BD. I'll not bother you more, just mention some things like: Venom should appeared more and be bigger than spider, that would make bigger impact, Goblin's pumpkin makes a scar to harry but kills venom, wow; And that's it, sorry my bad English, I'm Portuguese. As a Marvel fan from so long I couldn't enjoy this movie. Give a 3h movie to X-Men and that would rock the house.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Comic Book to film adaptation ever made,"The critics of this film are failing in their views miserably because they are solely looking at this film from the perspective of ""a film"" and not "" a film adapted from a comic book series"".Myself, I am not a Spidey fan boy, but growing up, I enjoyed the occasional Spiderman comic strip. This what this film, more so than the first 2 capture. Examples of this would be in comic books, we are taken from scene to scene, a picture board if you will (which is what a comic action hero is)that are segments, fragments of plot.At first they seem like bits and pieces, but then those bits and pieces come together and form the particular comic book series number of that month. This what this film is and it is spot on a perfect adaptation of that style. It is an adaption I have never seen done more perfectly than this film achieves.Spiderman 1 had some of these elements. The second film went away from that and was more like a glorified soap opera.This one by far gets it, and gets it dead on right.Some people are complaining about all the simultaneous plot line occurring in this film, that "" they are too much for such a short span of time"". << EXACTLY!! For those people who say that, how often did you read action cartoon comic books?THAT IS EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE!! This is a brilliantly done film, it delivers to those who truly want a true comic book adaptation.It is not meant to be totally cohesive and brilliant in the sense of a real life film.IT IS A COMIC BOOK ACTION HERO ADAPTION, and the best I have ever seen.Go into the Movie with that in mind and you will see most people are not GETTING IT!!I did and I really loved it!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"The third installment in the spectacular Spider Man franchise has Peter Parker coming to grips with his own ego and his dark side. All the while New York faces two new villains - the Sandman and Venom. And Harry Osbourne has yet to settle his score with Spider Man.The first two films were terrific hero stories with a feel good comic book twist. In addition to their spectacular action sequences. The trailer for this film looks like a continuation of just that, but sadly the film proves to be something different.There are many story lines and none of them receives the attention they merit. Prime example being the Sandman character who was a simple crook stealing money for his family before being mutated. There is a scene where he visits his family, but that is all we see of them and from then on he is merely an on-screen menace. The other villain, Venom, appears so late in the movie that he is barely developed as a villain and ends up being another merely another menace for Spider Man. If that isn't enough, then the remaining storyline - between Harry, Peter, and Mary Jane - receives such ridiculous melodramatic treatment that is is practically and insult to the last two films. It is not wholly bad and plays as a cheesy comic book story, but given the fact it follows the previous two films' much stronger and effective stories it is just above sheer disappointment.On the bright side, the action sequences and effects are some of the best around with Spider Man performing some spectacular heroic rescues. The Sandman is also an impressive creation and has a stunning creation scene. And Bruce Campbell gives what may be one of the best cameo appearances ever. However, a few good action/special effects scenes have never earned a movie big points. --- 6/10Rated PG-13 for violence",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shockingly good.,"You don't expect to go to a Spider-Man film and walk out with a life lesson, but I did. The message about the desire for revenge, and what it can do to you and turn you into is something I know to be completely true. Recently I had my ex girlfriend cheat on me and I was trying to lure her back just so I could destroy her new relationship for revenge and then kick her to the curb like a piece of trash.I woke up every day feeling the blackness that they portray in this movie, and even though it did help me seriously boost my career and get into the best shape of my life it was wearing away my soul. Peter goes through something similar and it really spoke to me. I felt like I was watching my own thoughts up on the screen, and that was definitely an experience I won't forget.Go see this movie! Don't listen to some of the critics...it is the best one of the series by far.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sam , please don't make a new Evil Dead , let it be. If Sam kills his best work , i wont see another one of his movies again. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Incredible Experience & a GREAT film!,"What I said about Spider-Man 2 holds true for this movie. In fact, it took everything good about the second and added more action and excitement.Spider-Man 3 is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period. Rarely have I gone through such a range of emotions during a film (not since SM2 anyway). Absolutely an incredible experience that everybody should be a part of and everybody should rush to see.The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts. I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with the film critic who said it's the best of the three movies due to the added complexities in its storytelling and the evolution and growth of the characters as a whole since the first movie. I was stunned that SM3 is actually an improvement on what was essentially a classic. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through. There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments. There is romance and there is humor. I can't imagine anyone at any age not enjoying some aspect of this film.Director Sam Raimi, the cast, the crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow. The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this movie is how can they possibly top it now? Then again, I said that after Spider-Man 2 so who knows? Bring on Spider-Man 4!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
