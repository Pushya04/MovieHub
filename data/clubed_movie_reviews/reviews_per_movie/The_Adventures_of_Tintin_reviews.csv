"""I will find that ship. With or without your help!""","And Steven Spielberg has found that ship and that ship has sailed him to a brand new technology for filmmaking. Yes, I'm talking about motion capture or as Spielberg calls it ""perfomance"" capture. This technology is a like a new toy for Steven. You can feel the joy for filmmaking from every shot, every detail. He plays with the camera in a way he never could while making a live-action film. For example in probably the best scene of the film the main character, Tintin is gliding on a wire and the camera is following him throughout the whole scene in a continuous shot. But you can still say, you still see that this is a Spielberg movie. You know this is a Spielberg movie since the opening title credits that will remind you a lot of the opening credits in Catch Me If You Can. Even the music is very similar.The main character is Tintin, who is a journalist who we never see doing any journalism though, but that doesn't matter because he is the textbook example of a heroic boy with boy scout qualities. The voice of Jamie Bell fits perfectly for the character. Andy Serkis gives here an incredible performance as Captain Haddock, the drunken sailor who to me was often reminiscent of a grumpy Harrison Ford. The story did seem as too much centered on Captain Haddock though, you could even say this should have been called ""The Adventures of Captain Haddock"" instead of Tintin. Daniel Craig is unrecognizable as the main villain Sacharine. Although his voice did jump to his normal voice in one line but otherwise you didn't know it was him. Of course I can't forget to mention the lovable dog, Snowy. He steals almost every scene that he is in. He is very realistic, he acts like a real dog and even gets his own chase scene. I'm telling you will adore this dog.The animation is magnificent, the motion capture has gone a long way since The Polar Express. It looks very realistic, especially all the features on Captain Haddock's face. The beard, the wrinkles and the eyes, they all looked amazing. Especially the eyes, they aren't so dead-eyed anymore as in The Polar Express.The action scenes are brilliantly written and directed, the angles of the camera, the drive of the action scenes, timing of all the jokes(physical or visual) is genius. Because Spielberg is a genius. He is the master of adventure movies and there never will be another genius in adventure movies like him.Overall Spielberg has created an old-fashioned style adventure movie for the whole family to enjoy,where the important things are just the hunt for the treasure, the friendship two people can make and the most important thing of all that it is an entertaining ride. Spielberg never disappoints, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of Tintin or not, you will enjoy this film nonetheless",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great film for all ages,"I went to see this film in a free screening and took my nephew and niece with me, seeing as it was a family film to try and get different reactions to the film.Let me start off with my view of the film, I've been a fan of Tintin since I first saw the cartoon back in the early 90's, though never read the comics. When I saw the credits of who wrote, produced and directed the film, you think to yourself this film is going to be awesome, there is no way with all that talent they can't possible f**k this up (and they didn't). You have Spielberg directing, Peter Jackson as a producer. Also the writing team great with Steven Moffat, known for Sherlock, Dr who, Coupling and another of my child hood favs, Press Gang. Finally you have Edgar Wright, who wrote and directed Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.The version of the film i saw was 3d, as it was a preview and i didn't have a choice. Normally i watch all my showing in 2d as i think its personally a fad and a rip off and the films i have seen excluding Avatar, i didn't think the 3d aspect improved the film going enjoyment one bit. This again is my option while the 3d is nice, and the shots going through glass and water was really good, there was nothing else that would have me pulling out another £2 a ticket. I would have been happy with a basic 2d version.On to the film story, TinTin (voice by Billy Elliott's Jamie Bell) buys a handmade ship in market. As soon as he buys it he gets a number of offers of people willing to buy it from him, which TinTtn rejects. When he gets home Snowy, Tintin dog, breaks the ship and a hidden clue rolls out, which begins Tintin trying to work out what it means. Tintin then gets kidnapped by the evil Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig), who is after the clue. This where Tintin mets up with Captain Haddock as they set of trying to work out the meaning of Tintin clue.The film is a really mixture of action and adventure. We see the heroes on board ships, rowing boats, fly airplanes, riding camels, having car\bike chases and crane fights. The time flew past for me and not once did i feel bored, this was probably down to the amount going with the film, the quick pace of the action and the different locations of the characters were always in. It reminded me of the Indiana Jones films a lot, where he is on the hunt for treasure, and he only has half of the clues, and the bad guys have the others half and both sides are trying to get the other half for the themselves. He then needs to go around the globe via different transportation to get the info he needs to find the treasure.There is also a large amount of humour in the film, seeing as Moffat, who wrote coupling helped write it, this is no big surprise. While i got the jokes neither my nephew (3) nor niece (8) did. So I am assuming that these were aim at the adults watching.The characters the film makers can't chance much from the original Hergé comics, but Tintin I did find too goody goody, the captain is great character, who is drunk loser, but has a kind heart and wants to do the right thing. The bad guy, Sakharine, is perfect, scary enough to make you believe that he is ruthless killer who is a greedy and after revenge, but on the other had not going over board to make the kids feel scared or afraid of him when he was on screen. There is also the two comic relief characters of inspector Thomson, who are on screen just enough to make you smile at the pratfalls and their stupidness, but not too long for the jokes to wear thin so you're sick of seeing them.My rating of the film would be 4 out of 5.On to the kids view of the film. 1st my nephew who is 3 years old (4 in November). He told me he liked the film a lot especially the pirate bits, but he didn't understand why the pirates were bad. He also said he liked the motorcycle chase because the bikes were cool. As i was sitting next to him i could tell the film was slightly too long for him as he started to fidgit a bit in the last 15 mins.My niece who is 8 (9 in December), i didn't get a lot of information from her, when i asked if she liked all her answer was yes it was good, and when i asked what her favourite bit was, she told me all of it.As a reference for taking children during the half term break, i would say 4 and under while enjoy the film like my nephew did, but they won't fully understand the plot of the film or why certain things are happening, but for 5 years old and up this film and adults included this is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An intrepid report on The Adventures of Tintin,"First off, this is the first time I ever write a review in here. For once, I felt compelled to do it because... Well... because I'm Belgian and grew up on a steady Tintin diet, like most Belgians my age and older. The comics... not the cartoons. Needless to say I'm a old fan.I also happen to be a fan of Spielberg's, probably since seeing E.T. when I was about 5 years old. The two could be mutually exclusive. I could take the role of the harcore comics fan who despises the adaptation, or the rabid Spielby fan forgiving everything.Thankfully, after having the chance to see it before most people out here in Belgium and everywhere else thanks to a journalist buddy, I found out I can to be none of the above. Spielberg and Jackson and all the team behind the adaptation obviously gave the original material the love and respect it deserved, while making it their own.To clarify the origins of the story itself, you have to know that it isn't the adaptation of one, but three Tintin comics. Its beginning takes root in ""Le Crabe aux Pinces D'or"", while the rest of the movie revolves around the two-albums story of the hunt for Rakham the Red's treasure, ""Le Secret de la Licorne"" and ""Le Trésor de Rakham le Rouge"". While it could seem like a lot of material for a whole movie, the choice of blending those three (two and a half) stories together turns out giving the movie a rather perfect pacing.To kill a double controversy in the making, and like I've already read in a couple critics: Tintin has always been a ""bland"" character in the comics. He has no asperities. He is brave, always gets out of the tangles he gets in, he is a good guy, he doesn't know doubts... Tintin as a character has his limits, dramatically speaking, and even Hergé knew that... It is actually the reason for the appearance of Captain Haddock after a few albums. Haddock is the dark side of Tintin, prone to anger and shouting insults, hard drinker, natural born loser... Far from a being just a comical sidekick, Haddock is the human counterpart to the flawless hero that Tintin is (remember, this is a comic, originally aimed at kids and older kids). The movie has the intelligence of starting off the big screen adventures of Tintin with the two meeting up and becoming friends, a real turning point in the continued adventures of Tintin.The movie also deftly skips what could have been a typically Hollywoodish mistake of giving Tintin exposition. But none of that nonsense here. Tintin is a reporter, that's all you need to know. That's all the comics ever told us about him. None of them ever showed Tintin doing actual reporter work. I don't think he ever used a typewriter, he has no boss, no workplace. Tintin just finds himself where adventure is. Because he's a reporter. Hergé never needed more, kudos for the guys behind this movie for keeping true to that. It will be held against them, but that will be coming from people who don't know the original material.But I somehow had little worries about that, honestly. It was only obvious they wouldn't touch the spirit of what's considered a classic worldwide. Well, not those guys. I had more doubts about the transition from Hergé's ""Ligne Claire"" type of drawing to CGI's and even more so to the use of 3D. And that's where I was truly impressed. Not that I'm adverse to CGIs, mind. In fact it's the cartoons that bred those doubts in me. The varied 2D, celluloid adventures of Tintin always bugged me, because of that transition from the seemingly simple but incredibly dynamic looks of the books, looking so wrong when brought to animated life. Yet the movie did a great job of shutting up the Tintin geek. It simply looks stunning, and your mind easily jumps back and forth between forgetting these are cartoon characters and appreciating their transition to a 3D environment, respectful of the original designs but literally bringing them to life.In short, all these elements drew me to the same conclusion, Spielby and co. managed to deal a great adaptation. One that has true respect for the original material, and the great ambition of adding something to it. Yes, not everything of it. ""Le Crabe aux Pinces D'or"" could have deserved a whole movie. Shortcuts are taken, and as true to their originals as they are, the characters have been redesigned. But in the end you have a movie that can be appreciated both by fans of the comics as well as people who have ""just heard about them"". It is fun, packed with adventure and action, enjoyable at all ages. And most of all, you can go see it without having to worry about seeing another piece of Hollywood-flavoured perversion, a fast-foodified betrayal. If that's what you like, note, there's been that Smurf thing, recently (another childhood favourite). You know, that other Belgian comics adaptation that took the little blue dudes from their tiny corner of European medieval forest to... Modern New York? But if you have more gourmet tastes, better bet your money on Jackson and Spielberg. Trust this true childhood Tintin fan.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually stunning, perfectly done & thoroughly entertaining","I never saw the original Tintin cartoons and before this film new nothing about it.I watched this film this evening, two years after its release .. and i'm left thinking, why did I not watch this film before now?!This was such an enjoyable film, it was much, much better than i thought it was going to be, there are so many great things about this movie:THE VISUALS: Easily one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen, i wish i had watched this at the cinema - especially in 3d. The animation is perfect. it's bright, colourful and scarily lifelike. The characters, scenery and landscapes all look incredible and so creative. Even the opening credits look fantastic! I can't stress how good the visuals are in this film.THE DIRECTION: Spielberg has done an incredible job here, nothing could have been improved in this aspect. The way the movie flows and the way the scenes intertwine and change is beautiful. There are scenes where it switches from past to present and back again in such a way that you just get lost in it.. you will understand what i mean when you see the movie. There are scenes of fights and chases which are so creative and so imaginative, the way he uses angles and the way everything links on is a real joy to watch. Its hard to explain, watch the film and you will know exactly what I mean.However, the film is not just a visual feast like many films are. It has a good solid story with likable, interesting characters - I found the story line kept my attention throughout. A very original adventure/quest film, searching for hidden treasure and defeating the bad guys along the way!I cannot recommend this film enough, i was so surprised by just how good it was. As i said earlier I am sorry I didn't go and see this in the cinema as it really would have been a fantastic experience.Watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Absolute Romp for Tintin Fans!,"I would have given this movie an 8, but that would have been a disservice in general. While those who have read and loved Tintin would immensely enjoy every frame of the movie, those who are being introduced to the Character the first time around are likely to miss a few things here and there.Yes, Tintin is brilliantly swashbuckling, and Haddock amazingly entertaining, but the story seems a trifle hurried while the pacing in some sequences in patchy.What deserves a 10 on 10 however is the way Red Rackham's tale is woven into the story and how it was so evocatively presented, along with reference to a few characters which paved the path for any sequels that would be forthcoming.Top marks to Spielberg an Jackson for sticking to the books even while weaving an original story line! Must Watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a Splendid Re-creation!,"Since 1981, Spielberg has become an avid fan of this gorgeous ""Tintin"" comics and has been longing to create a film about it. Before he and ""Tintin's"" master, Herge could meet, Herge passed away. However, Herge's widow decided to give them the rights and began the adventure to re-create this marvelous wonder of art.Adapted from three of the comics, Spielberg's re-creation of the comics introduces us to Tintin (Jamie Bell), a Belgian reporter who gets caught up in all sorts of adventures. One day, he found a model of a ship, the Unicorn and bought it and brought it home. However, when Tintin was buying the ship, two men came to try to buy the model, Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and Barnaby. Later, Tintin discovers that the model holds an important secret and somehow, the secret is linked to the real ship itself. On the way for answers, he meets the grumpy Haddock and head off to an adventure spanning around the globe with his white fluffy dog Snowy.The animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. Tintin's animated self looks stunning (even though he looks kind of different from his comic-self) in his blue long sleeves. Snowy is fluffier than ever. Captain Haddock is grumpier than ever. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen.I like how they change scenes. While most other movies just shift scenes normally, this film uses a little imagination and is ingenious in shifting scenes. They can change from a scene of shaking hands to a desert scene by using the outline of the two hands into the surface of the desert. This thing is just entertaining and great in its own right and deserves some reward.The movie itself is fun to watch. The story is compelling, the lines are natural-sounding, and the action is plenty of fun to watch. It is great excitement to watch and I was hooked from beginning to end. Great plot + awesome action + breathtaking animation equals up to amazing movie.The 3D is perfectly fine. The depth is seen and the 3D just makes the movie even more fun to watch.I definitely recommend you to watch this film. ""Tintin"" fan or no, this is sheer fun to watch. If this movie is out in your country, watch it immediately. For U.S. citizens, I'm sorry if you still have to wait for a while but I promise you, this is like no other movie. This movie is over the top and is plenty of fun to watch. A full 10 out of 10! Thanks for reading my review on ""The Adventures of Tintin"". I do hope this review is of good use to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Riding and Remembering the shivers of an adventurous childhood,"When about a year ago, at the supermarket, I saw on the Empire magazine's cover the 3D reproduction of one of my childhood's toon-idols my eyes popped out. 'WHO is directing WHAT???' - the question that echoed in my mind: It was a bit of shock finding out that one of my favorite directors was working on a movie from a character I considered buried under the dusts of time. The astonishment was soon replaced by excitement and I made the way back home from the supermarket hopping and smiling.Today I decided to take an adventurous break from my dull academic life and went to the cinema to watch it. No wonder the room was almost full, despite the fact that the movie will be officially released tomorrow. As soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen I felt a shiver of excitement running through my spine as I was visually meeting an old friend from my childhood again; to my pleasure I felt the same sensations I would feel when I was a child. That's one of the VERY good points of this production: the spirit of Herge's Tintin, in Spielberg's movie, remains UNALTERED. There are some cases, though, in which the characters are even better and more deeply characterized than in the comic strips.OK, let's release now all the excitement about this movie. If I had just five short seconds to say how I think this movie is I'd chose 7 words: Mesmerising from the beginning to the end. That's quite true if you consider that even the opening credits are little shining pearls of direction and creativity.The general impression you get from this movie, talking about direction, is that nothing could have been better. Spielberg's direction is, in this case as well, a real warranty of general great quality. Three things I particularly appreciated: -The movie flows perfectly; it is kind of a pleasure for your eyes and for your brain to follow the adventure. -There's literally a STORM of brain-waves (and here comes the Spielberg's touch); especially, in the connection phases between one scene and the other the director totally expresses his genius, turning the open ocean into a pond, making two shaking hands become dunes in the desert and so on (you'll understand what I mean when you'll watch the movie) -The 'camera's movements' literally pull you into the movie and you can't help feeling excited or scared according to the situation.You can tell it's a Spielberg's movie even just looking at these things.Although all the things I have listed until now are enough to candidate the movie as the best movie of the year (in my opinion) there's still something I must remember: The quality of animation. I really could not find a proper term to define my astonishment when my eyes approached the beautiful places and landscapes shown in the movie. They look perfect, shining and bursting with emotions, sensations; they almost look like paintings: For instance, there's a sunset in the movie that I will hardly forget. It's the same with the CGI models: you can see the wrinkles on the character's faces, even their sweat.Furthermore, some words about the actors: Bells and Serkis are maybe the sole two living beings who could have given birth to the cinematographic version of the two main characters. The first succeeds in the hard challenge to provide the audience with a convincing and faithful interpretation of the beloved protagonist (he did A GREAT job indeed), the second is a delightful surprise again, with a funny Scottish accent and a very good interpretation.One last word goes to one of the best composer alive: Sir John Williams. There's nothing to do, every piece of music he creates is able to touch the deepest strings of our hearts. With a soundtrack (already bought at the HMV store) that ranges from the epic tones to the mysterious ones he gives us another example of his limitless genius, because he still remains one of those composers able to make us cry.Finally, Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn, is one of the greatest surprises of the year. Another great adventure in the archive of the most spectacular stories of humanity, told by a MASTER story-teller (Spielberg). A movie you will hardly forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Earnest and Persistent Belgian Detective Takes Himself Very Seriously,"The kiddos weren't necessarily big fans of Tintin as a character, although they liked his hairstyle.

A rollicking good adventure,"What begins as a fun, nimble little mystery in the first act soon kicks into comedy-action-adventure high gear when junior reporter Tintin, with his brave dog Snowy, stumbles upon boozy Captain Haddock (an excellent Andy Serkis), whose family legacy may prove pivotal in a race to uncover the secret of the Unicorn.From that point on, it's more or less non-stop comedy—some fizzles, most of it works—with gags ranging from jaw-dropping blockbuster chase antics to throwaway background humour. Captain Haddock works brilliantly for the most part: he's unpredictable, endearing, and colourful in all the ways Tintin himself isn't. While the youngster is well played by Jamie Bell, he's mostly just there to work out the clues for the audience. Tintin and Haddock make for a good double-act, though: brains and brawn, cunning and in-over-his-head rashness; together they'd make a good Indiana Jones.The plot is a by the numbers mystery/adventure/treasure hunt, complete with bumbling detectives (so-so comic support from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), exciting sea plane action and hidden clues, but it's brought to life in gorgeous visual style. While the script only comes alive in fits and starts, the whole film is bursting with rich detail, and is given added depth by a good, solid use of 3D. The virtual camera-work throughout is stupendous.One extended chase sequence through the flooding streets of a North African city is so dazzling and dizzying it reminded me why no other filmmaker can match Spielberg when he lets his imagination out for a spin. Another action scene, told in flashback, depicts a breathless pirate showdown in a storm, and features some of the most playful transitions I've seen since Ang Lee's Hulk. There's a pretty good villain, too, played by a wily Daniel Craig.Snowy, while definitely smarter than your average cute canine, is also given to chasing cats, digging up fossilised bones from the desert, and gobbling sandwiches at decidedly inopportune moments. In other words, he's an instant audience favourite.All in all, it's a rollicking good adventure, one of Spielberg's most fun movies in a long time, and I'll be buying it on Blu-ray next year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Adventures of Tintin"" is quintessentially the perfect family film: incredibly joyous, thrilling and comically genius adventure.","Before his passing in 1983, Hergé said that if any filmmaker was to adapt his collection of timeless tales following the adventures of a Belgian reporter to the big screen, Steven Spielberg was the only man for the job, and after two decades of trial and error, the cinematic version of Tintin has finally reached our screens with the desired director at its helm. Alongside Spielberg sits Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) maestro Peter Jackson as producer and three of Britain's brightest writers (Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish) who have that almost impossible task of translating the stories from comic strips to 35mm. This 3D motion-capture and CGI extravaganza combines three of Tintin's most beloved outings (The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure) and hits UK multiplexes just before the school half-term.After discovering an elegant model of the ship the 'Unicorn' at a market, Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) and his loyal dog Snowy are intrigued as to why so many desire it, and comment on the secrets it holds. When the model is stolen, more information surfaces and the pair set out to discover the truth, teaming up, after a surprise meeting, with the boisterous drunkard Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis). The group's adventure spans the globe, with each destination bringing more danger and that crucial step closer towards unravelling the mystery.From the moment the picture opens, the film's tone and mood is set: mystery and adventure merged with fun and frolics. The classy, hand-drawn, animated titles use the signature silhouette imagery with style and sophistication, making the wit and wonder evident even before audiences have graced their eyes on the monumental motion capture work.In a rather lacklustre year for animation, with the only true blossom of beauty being Studio Ghibli's impeccable 'Arrietty', Spielberg's latest thankfully ends this dry-run with a picture that explodes with vibrancy, craftsmanship and realism. Unlike Robert Zemeckis' motion-capture entries (The Polar Express [2004] and A Christmas Carol [2009]); The Adventures of Tintin is an entirely different bunch of blistering blue barnacles – every frame enforces impeccable detail and naturalism, and like the best animated pictures, viewers will forget they are watching digitalised representations in no time. Whether the visuals are mind-blowing as in the all-important action sequences – or brilliantly subtle – like the red, sweat-streaked cheeks and brows of Tintin and Haddock as they trek through a desert – this film is a clear example of just how magnificent technology is in this day and age.Without a shadow of a doubt this is the year's finest animated entry – expect an Oscar nomination and a deserved win. As well as its tremendous visual flair, the feature's script is a revelation: beautifully written and whimsical dialogue that is frequently hilarious and manages to merge the three classic tales so seamlessly. Considering Hergé's stories are separate volumes, the typing trio behind this movie are able to make a sensible structure with the texts, making the film flow as gracefully as its perfect imagery. As well as the laughs, the script provides great character development for those new to the world of Tintin without insulting audiences with an hour's lesson. Young children will have no trouble picking up who's who in the early stages, before settling back for the incredible roller coaster ride of the second and climatic act.Action fans will gain greatness from this movie too. Expect high octane chases, pirate swordplay and more bullets than a Sylvester Stallone entry – just a lot less gore and swearing. In fact, although The Adventures of Tintin is action-packed, its PG certificate is justified; I cannot recall anything remotely damaging or frightening for young eyes, so parents have nothing to fear with this one when deciding on their half-term picture.The film also sees the much needed return of composer John Williams who provides yet another dazzling and effective score. The music captures the essence of the film in an instant and compliments it throughout.The voice casting is collectively brilliant with Bell and Serkis being the obvious standouts. Bell's inquisitive tone and frequent high-pitched bursts mirror the speech bubbles Tintin utters in the comic panels. When reading a Hergé story, this is exactly how the character sounds in your head. Serkis steals the show as Captain Haddock and is given splendid dialogue to growl through bitter Scottish chords. Haddock's often stupid remarks and forgetfulness is beautifully represented through the animated character. Daniel Craig is also fantastic as the less-than-trustworthy Ivanovich Sakharine while Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are side-splitting as the lovable policing dunces Thomson and Thompson. Plus Snowy is absolutely wonderful.There is no doubt that Spielberg's adaptation will be top of the box office upon release and hopefully those new to Tintin will be influenced to re-visit the books and television shows of yesteryear and become more involved with one of the century's most beloved and important literary creations.Verdict:  'The Adventures of Tintin' is quintessentially the perfect family film and has plenty to offer audiences of all ages. This is an incredibly joyous, thrilling and comically genius adventure. Hergé was onto a winner with his thoughts towards Spielberg and he can rest easy now knowing his tales have been faithfully and beautifully translated into a cinematic masterwork.

What a total nostalgia trip!,"I had many off the ""Tintin"" books when I was a kid, and fondly remember the Sunday morning cartoon. So was super thrilled that Steven Spielberg off all people was tackling a movie version.First off, the fact that this movie is 3 off the original stories mixed together will probably not please everyone. But I welcomed it as a way off bringing these characters too the big screen, and in a way that is familiar but not exactly the same as I remember. The thing this film had going for it over everything was its nostalgia, and it still had many moments that provided that, even if it was truly trying too fit a little too much into the one movie (I'm pretty sure there's a fourth original story mixed in here somewhere but I'm not entirely sure!)This new ""Tintin"" movie has more than a whiff off ""Raiders of the lost arc"" about it, which will also divide audiences. I however liked that it was as if Spielberg was back on familiar turf, and bringing this character to life in a way he, as well as others would off envisioned it anyway. Indeed, there is so much talent involved in this film, it's hard to imagine anyone not admitting too how well made it is, even if they do disagree with its direction. Spielberg does a terrific job, and the voice actors are all amazing. Yes, even Andy Serkis as a ""Scottish"" captain Haddock. Daniel Craig especially though, is surprisingly ace as the villain off the film.Film is action packed too and is actually funny. I don't quite remember laughing as much at the old cartoons, even though they were at times attempting to be funny. My greatest fear was that the totally irritating Thompson twins would ruin the movie. But someone here has made the right decision off not having them in the movie much, but having them in there a little as it wouldn't be the same without them for many I'm sure. The same can't be said for captain Haddock however, who gets a serious amount off screen time, perhaps even more than Tintin himself. Heck, you could even say this was a ""Captain Haddock"" movie, not a ""Tintin"" one.All off the films cons seem too be outweighed by pro's however. There's even no faulting the ""charmless"" motion capture animation, as the film is often trying too be as amazingly visual as possible, and for the most part - succeeding. I can't help but think that there is perhaps too much action though. The original cartoons were never as far fetched as this adventure un-ashamedly is . There are many ""cartoony"" moments that seem un-fitting, and some off the over the top spectacle has clearly just been thrown in there in an attempt too impress us with ever more tiresome 3D.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dazzling visuals, strong score and great cast, could've been even better","I was much anticipating The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. It looked interesting, the cast on paper are great and I am fond of both John Williams and Steven Spielberg. I am also a fan of the comics and the animated series which I saw over and over in English and French.When I finally saw the film, I admit I was slightly disappointed but actually while there was room for improvement I thought it was good.First of all, the visuals are truly dazzling, so much colour and you can tell in both the settings, character designs and cinematography that a lot of effort had gone into it technically. John Williams' score is not among his very best, but it is strong and memorable with some of Williams' distinctive style.The story is a great idea and while there are some slow spots it is thrillingly told. There are also some masterly touches to Spielberg's direction, particularly the back of a hand morphing into desert dunes, the galleons on the ocean enacting a sea battle and a motorcycle chase taken on one shot.Against all this, part of me felt it could've been more. For me, despite the brilliant voice over from Jamie Bell, not much is done to make Tintin particularly compelling. The script is mostly good, but the comedy could've been timed a little better. This has nothing to knock Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, their delivery is as enthusiastic and as witty as it ever could be, but sometimes the presence of Thomson and Thompson jars with the overall tone of the film.I loved the cast. Bell is brilliant, Pegg and Frost are good as are Daniel Craig and Toby Jones but I thought the standout was Andy Serkis. Not only is he a lot of fun to watch and hear, but for my money Captain Haddock and Snowy were the two most engaging characters.All in all, a good film with several strong things, but I wasn't entirely blown away by it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Recapturing The Excitement,"The Adventures of Tintin is a movie made by the most brilliant filmmakers of Hollywood and there is no doubt that this movie will be good. They got Steven Spielberg directing, Peter Jackson producing, Edgar Wright co-writing, and some great actors. The execution, it's a load of big fun. Steven Spielberg recreates his classic trademark action sequence. The performances were excellent. The animation is uncanny valley but it's done well though. The film may have its dragging moments but throughout it's undeniably enjoyable.Let's begin with the performances. Jamie Bell really brings Tintin to life. Andy Serkis is always great at motion capture and he actually steals the show as Haddock. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are always a good pair. Even without their faces, they are still fun to watch. Daniel Craig gives a brilliantly fascinating performance. The motion capture helped their fancy movements. Even though it looks weird.The film has Spielberg. After all of his alien movies, he returned to action adventures. He keeps it big and exciting. Every action scenes are ridiculously thrilling. The mystery works enough telling it. The weakest parts might be the over introduction of the characters. The opening credits already shows who Tintin is. The beginning of the story just stretched it a bit more longer. Haddock's introduction is also stretched. Maybe to make things clear but it's a little bit dragging. The rest of the film enjoyable.The animation, like I say, is weird for the characters but it makes it easy for its action sequences. Visuals are incredibly spectacular and it obviously makes the whole adventure exciting. The score is fancy. When it comes to the action scenes, it gets adventurous. And the homage of the original Tintin is scattered. The cinematography fits to its animation. The camera is shaky in a different manner.Fans of Spielberg and Hergé's Tintin comics will definitely love this movie for recapturing their classic homage. While the other moviegoers might find it fascinating. Yes, the movie's excitingly thrilling and undeniably enjoyable. Since this is just the beginning of a series, It's a perfect reintroduction of an iconic character. Although, it lingers too much. I hope it gets more bigger in the sequels. Again, it's big, exciting, hilarious and really enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Boy From Brussels,"George Remi, better known under his pen-name Hergé, created ""Tintin in the Land of the Soviets"" in 1929. The story was then serialized weekly in a well-known Belgian newspaper. That was the first time the world got to meet the multitalented reporter and his dog Snowy. But not the last. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" would become the most popular European comics of the 20th century. It came to be translated into 70 different languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.Several attempts were made to transfer Tintin's adventures to the silver screen. About a dozen films were completed, but Hergé was largely dissatisfied with all of them. However, after seeing Steven Spielberg's modern matinee adventure ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Hergé thought he had found a director who could do justice to his plucky hero. Tragically, Hergé died of a sudden heart attack in 1983, just as a meeting with Steven Spielberg was arranged.The director finally optioned the film rights to ""The Adventure of Tintin"" in 2002, but now from Hergé's widow Fanny Remi instead. Spielberg then began working with a combination of voice-acting, motion capture, and traditional computer animation. Just like in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" he had a lone hero at the center of the action. A brave guy caught up in a series of spectacular exploits in exotic locations, involving planes, trains and automobiles. Plus, as was the case in this story, ancient ships in peril on the high seas.But there was a problem. Although Tintin had been hugely popular in Europe since the 1930s, the comic strip had never caught on in America. And regional flavors can be hard to sell to an audience that has yet to develop a taste for that particular product. Fortunately, though, Spielberg accomplished the task with flying colors. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" received positive reviews from critics and was also a commercial success, grossing over $375 million worldwide.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too ADHD Indiana Jones action,"I always thought that Tintin was a bit more serious and thoughtful, but as I was afraid of, Spielberg can ruin even this fine character with his one-note silly childish Indiana Jones style. Oh how I am bored with it.... That wasn't really a Tintin story but just another kids' movie squeezed into that guaranteed money making format which is as exciting as picking up same brand bubblegum over and over never ever considering anything else.Storywise there was no climax in the story, maybe because it was a combination of multiple stories. Silliness and action just ruined every possible moment. And that too obvious cliffhanger at the end was just like a slap in your face: ""Pay more, you fool.""I give 6 just for this being Tintin and the fact that the shoes had nice details. Gloves, on the other hand, looked rubbery.On the plus side, the animation was a bit better than I expected. I hated Milou's fur which looked like polyester mattress, but otherwise everything nice. But nice isn't enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a disappointment...,"When I was a child, my favourite book series was the adventures of tintin and as I grew older, my love for the books also started to grow. So when I heard about the film announcement back in 2009 you could imagine my reaction. However as the release date for the film grew ever closer and new news was being released about it like the mo-cap format, I was slowly becoming more and more disinterested. Until last weekend when I was actually dreading going to my local cinema to watch it. I'd heard mixed reviews about it from friends and family. But never the less I went into the film with an open mind. About 2 hours later I came out with a literal headache, views of the film were spinning round my head, so I thought I'd tell you my review of tintin: the secret of the unicorn.For me this film was hard to watch for a variety of reasons. Reason number 1- Their wasn't 5 minutes in this film that didn't go without action, it was just ridiculous, half the action in the film never even happens in the book. My problem is that with kids films these days, they have way too much action and too many silly scenes, its like the directors of these films think that children are so uneducated that they can't even follow a simple storyline. This is all too true in Tintin, I may be exaggerating a tad , but I would go as far as saying it was quite insulting to the intelligences of kids around the UK. Children CAN follow simple stories and they don't need big explosions every minute to keep them stimulated.Reason 2- Back in 2010 I saw an interview with Steven Spielberg, their he was asked ' is the film true to the books' and he replied yes. It isn't. The whole focus point for Tintin and the thing that makes it great is the sense of adventure in the story. However in the film they hardly stick to the story of the book, so they pretty much devised their own story. This for me just made the film feel like any other cartoon film, because the classic story wasn't their to make it stick all together. For example the secret of the unicorn is part one of two books however at the end of the film they do all of part 1 then just skip the whole of the 2nd book. Although, it wasn't just the story that frustrated me it was also the characters. In the books Tintin is an innocent young reporter who cares about others that's why I was annoyed to find out that in the film he's quite angry and trigger happy! Also his friend captain haddock is made out to be a maniac to literally can't behave properly without alcohol whereas in the books he's civilised and lovable.Reason 3- My 3rd and final reason is that I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this film in 3-D. Yet again the 3-d in this film was completely unnecessary, their wasn't one moment which was made for 3-D. Yet again I found myself enjoying the 3-D adverts more than the 3-D film and yet again found myself watching the majority of the film without the glasses. 3-D is just a gimmick for all these big 'movie' studios to rake in as much money as possible and frankly conning movie goers! Films shouldn't be in 3-D unless they were made for it!As you most likely know Herge said if anyone was to make a film of tintin he wasn't want Spielberg to do it. Frankly for me he didn't do the job. That is why I think that it will be very interesting in a few years when the 2nd film is released with peter Jackson instead directing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good family action,"Even if you've never heard of the Tintin character, let alone read the classic Herge comics, this movie of his adventures is terrific from start to finish, complete with invigorating characters, dazzling effects (special and otherwise), exotic settings, and unabashed, wall-to-wall exhilaration and excitement. I enjoyed it.Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) is a young-lad reporter who, apparently, finds himself in extraordinary situations with some frequency. While shopping in a local market, he purchases a model boat called the Unicorn. Almost immediately, Tintin and his faithful canine friend Snowy are pursued by the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig), ostensibly so that the latter can complete his collection. But of course that's not the real reason, is it? No, he's after more, much more. It all has to do with the Unicorn's real-life namesake and what happened to it (scuttled at sea) and, more importantly, what it carried. Right off, Tintin (okay, Snowy) discovers a scroll hidden in the model's mast that may be a clue to something bigger - but there are two other scrolls.It's an old-fashioned treasure hunt. Tintin runs into a frequently inebriated Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis), who has a strong connection to the original Unicorn and to the scrolls themselves. With Haddock and Snowy at his side, Tintin races across the globe to solve the mystery before Sakharine, a journey that takes him to multiple continents, fighting bad guys with swords, guns, fists, and feet. It's a throwback movie; a movie quite similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, itself a throwback to the serials of the early 20th century. And, of course, the director here is one Steven Spielberg, whom you might recognize as a progenitor of that Raiders universe himself.The movie is animated, both literally and figuratively, and the animation is so exquisitely realistic that it's easy to perceive it as completely lifelike. The action is intense and relentless, but because of the depth of detail in the animation, it's tough to imagine it as anything other than a terrific live-action film. When Tintin leaps from building to building or from a moving car, we actually cringe - can he make it?Here's an added bonus - apparently, the movie is very close to the source material. Tintin has not been updated or modified to mollify new audiences; remember, so many Americans have never heard of the intrepid reporter. And there's no time waste on explaining who Tintin is, or what he is, or how old he's supposed to be. You know why? Because it's irrelevant, that's why. He's just an adventuring dude with a smart dog and a lot of panache.Bell, Serkis, and Craig are all superb in their roles (the latter two have dual roles each). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show up as Interpol agents named Thompson and Thompson and offer excellent comic relief; are they bumbling, or are they just that good? It's the latter.There really is so much to like about this movie, and it's one of those rare films that can be recommended not only to children in general but to girls and boys alike. It's artful, engaging, fascinating, and wonderful to behold.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Did not reach my expectation,I went to see this movie expecting to see the unveiling of Tintin in 3d. The visuals were fantastic. Still a lot of effort is needed to get the attention to explore the world of Tintin.Tintin is a very popular comics. They have also made animation series and few movies. In the 3d era the expectations are always high.The messed up part is the blending of other stories in the singular plot. There were some innovations but messing up with villain character is not wise.The story would have gone well if concentration was given to the basic plot and its corresponding story and made improvisation on the details.That would have been my expectation.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much Better Than Expected,"I'm an American Tintin fan – yes, believe it or not, they do exist – and when I first heard that Steven Spielberg was at the helm of a three-dimensional rendering of Tintin, Haddock, Snowy, and their world, I became somewhat worried. First of all, the creations of Hergé seemed so fitting for traditional animation. Transforming the characters and putting human eyeballs in the circles of Tintin's eyes felt wrong. On top of that, I was afraid (particularly after the trailers came out) that the film would just be a vapid wild ride that failed to do justice to the well-loved comics.But, now that I've seen it, I confess I liked it much more than I thought I would. It isn't perfect, but it's spirited and fun – and mostly in keeping with the original comic books. The opening credits introduce Tintin and Snowy in silhouette and give watchers a taste of the boy reporter's adventures. After that, the film switches to motion capture. I was surprised at how well this worked. It felt for the most part like the same environment evoked by Herge, only morphed seamlessly into three dimensions.The story is a lively and rip-roaring yarn full of charm and humor. It follows Tintin as he teams up with Captain Haddock to discover the lost treasure of the captain's ancestor, while staying one step ahead of the icily devilish Mr. Sakharine. Episodes from ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" are interspersed with the general plot of ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", but everything comes together fairly smoothly. The film is mostly true to the essence of its source material, even if it is not entirely faithful to the letter. I, for one, was overjoyed to see the old sea dog, Haddock, so endearingly drunk. (Andy Serkis stole every scene he was in.) I was glad to see Tintin so adventuresome. The Thompsons were a riot in their slapstick clumsiness. And it was a delight to see various Tintin side characters pop up – like Alan, Nestor, and most especially, the beautifully shrill-voiced Bianca Castafiore.Nonetheless, there *were* certain action sequences that were overly excessive. The chase in Morocco careens this way and that so crazily that it soon becomes inane. Characters tumble and plunge and things wheel and whirl about in a way that strains credulity. By becoming so overblown, it kills suspense. How can the audience be exhilarated in a section of the film where the most madcap occurrences go on – and characters suffer little to no injury? It jars viewers out of the spell worked elsewhere in the movie. If such scenes were toned down and given some semblance of reality along with being exciting, they would have worked better, in my opinion.(Also, the filmmakers add a plot twist involving the ancestry of the antagonist that I find tacky and unnecessary. Plus, in my eyes, it was poorly handled and turned out as a rather awkward revelation. See the film to fully understand my meaning.)All in all, though, I'd recommend Spielberg's ""The Adventures of Tintin"". If you're a fan, you may have a bone to pick here and there, but should still enjoy it. If you are unfamiliar with Tintin, you ought to be pulled in anyway by his entertaining escapades – and I hope your introduction to him encourages you to seek out Hergé's original works.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a movie!!,"A MUST SEE movie!!Saw it in 3D with original English speech. Wow what a movie. Putting ion my professional glasses as a 3D illustrator - the 3D was simply stunning!All details were done to perfection, materials were literally photo-real. All was modeled, - no shortcuts, such as facades added just a texture. The animations - done mostely by motion tracking - were 100% natural, mimics as well, - even tongue movements at closeups were done - and they looked real! Amazing!All characters in the movie are modeled so they are photo-real and at the same time stay true to the Hergé world. So you can say that it is made as cartoon characters with a photo-real look. That fact that they are not completely human-like is actually liberating for your mind, - because you switch of your brains automatic dissecting scanning of how a human look like - which still often start some alerts ""This is not a real human"" (amazing what our brains can do in a split of a second). Thereby you see the characters as figures and your are not disturbed by the many ""no human"" alerts, that often appear when you see other 3D animation movies.I have put the weight in this review on the technical aspects of the movie - because this is what I am best at, - and there are many others that can make a better review of the plot etc. My impression however is, that movie has all elements a movie of that kind needs, - excitement, - humor, - action - and you never know what is waiting around the corner, - even though you have read ""the book"" - the mix of the 2-3 books is done with such caution and artistic ingenuity. And as all good movies it stop just when you have taken the jump from a cliff - and just can't wait to see what will happen then ... To be continuedNeed I say that I can't wait till ""The Adventures of TinTin II"" is out, - and also the DVD is out as well, hopefully full of additionally background of how the movie has been made, - let this be a hint for the production company :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
through the eyes of a longtime fan,"I have been a fan of the Tintin books since the age of seven, and so I definitely had to see Steven Spielberg's performance capture adaptation. And I must say, I am impressed. I will say that some scenes went a little overboard with the action, but otherwise ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a very fun movie. It is of course a combination of ""The Crab with Golden Claws"" and ""The Secret of the Unicorn"". I could tell what they dropped and added, and which character's roles they expanded. Overall, I am very pleased with this adaptation. Jamie Bell plays the titular young journalist/detective, although Andy Serkis is particularly neat as Capt. Haddock.All in all, Hergé would be proud of this movie. I also hope that ""Hergé's Adventures of Tintin"" (the cartoon series that ran from 1959-1962) comes to DVD eventually.Also starring Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg Strikes Again,"When I learned that Steven Spielberg was tackling the beloved TinTin comic strips so as to make a feature film faithful to the source material, I was admittedly indifferent. I didn't read these particular comics as a kid, and I wasn't a fan of the Polar Express gloss that (I imagined) would lend an unwelcome veneer to what could have been a lively action movie a-la Indiana Jones.I suppose I owe the venerable director an apology. The Adventures of Tintin thrives on its comic roots (as opposed to being hindered by them), and the seamless transition viewers are treated to finds our not- so-innocent hero—he is carrying a pistol, after all—globe-trotting between some truly spectacular action sequences that are directly reminiscent of Spielberg's actioners of old.The story we're presented with is a nifty little mixture of what I can only label a Holmes-esque detective story and a whip-crackin' adventure tale that—as many other critics have noted—takes some of its cues directly from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are times where some of the action is a little too slapstick for my liking, but there's no getting around the fact that Spielberg once again showcases his bravado as a creator of ingenious thrill rides (the sort that, in my humble opinion, are often conspicuously absent in recent Hollywood fare).Where the movie stumbles is in its decision to have the rosy-cheeked Tintin dole out lessons on alcoholism to a blissfully out-of-touch sea captain who exists for little more than comic relief. In fact, there's a particularly awkward scene where our protagonist barks at his sidekick at the mention of alcohol, only to never revisit the issue (and, in fact, to completely ignore it until said captain symbolically kicks a bottle of whiskey over the side of a slick pier.This is small potatoes, though, because Tintin soars in almost every other aspect—in fact, one has to wonder if there's much more that Spielberg and company can do to perfect the formula that's made him the blockbuster mogul that he is.If you're looking for a family movie with some teeth, Tintin is just what the doctor ordered. That's a nice contrast to the usually gooey stuff that crops up during most holiday seasons, isn't it?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin out,"As a young teenager I avidly borrowed as many of the Tintin comic books from my library as I possibly could and indeed many years later as an adult, bought them all to have them permanently. I was therefore more than curious to see what Steven Spielberg would do with the character, with this, the first big-time movie feature of the young Belgian reporter and his faithful dog Snowy.I really appreciated the title sequence with the lettering in the original style of the books but must admit that afterwards I found it difficult to completely accept the motion-capture technique employed. I guess it's a similar criticism which was levelled at say ""The Polar Express"", where the characters depicted are more human than cartoon, putting at odds somewhat the toon-town type various stunts and action sequences which occur to almost-human looking characters.I also felt that there just too many of these big set-pieces which gave me battle-fatigue in the end. There's no shortage of ingenuity or spectacle in some of these scenes but coming in rapid succession as they do, they got a bit too commonplace in my view. Characterisation not unnaturally is shallow and distinctly one-dimensional while the story is relentlessly episodic. When Tintin and / or Captain Haddock miraculously escapes death for the umpteenth time, it takes a little of the suspense away for what comes next.Of course it's difficult to comment on the acting given it's all done in the animation and to be honest I barely noticed the big-name voice actors employed. I wasn't impressed by the super-confident reference at the end to a sequel which four years after first release still noticeably hasn't seen the light of day.Don't get me wrong, quite a lot of the movie I did like and there were some spectacular directorial flourishes to enjoy, none more than when a handshake between Tintin and the Captain dissolves into a landscape. Still, I found it on the whole a bit too loud and crash-bang-wallop for my tastes, so that the characters were almost overpowered by the action raging around them.Would Herge have approved? I'm not so sure, this looks a wee bit like one of those vanity projects big-name directors can indulge themselves in without completely taking their audience along with them.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The film doesn't completely work for Tintin loyalists (like me who rates the Tintin Comic Books 11/10),"Billions of blue blistering barnacles, Ten thousand thundering typhoons – for a whole generation these were the epitome of cuss words thanks to Captain Haddock. I am one of those in late 20s who grew up reading ( mugging to be precise as Thomson & Thompson would have said) Tintin and almost worship Herge for the genius intelligent stories created in the black and white times of our grandpas. Being an hardcore Tintin loyalist the excitement to see the boy sleuth of screen was certainly brewing high. But the movie left me wanting more. It left a mixed reaction in me and here I come one by one at different levels.Story Level – Hollywood have adapted many novels for big screen and most of the times it has failed to recreate the finesse of the original work. Spielberg's rendition of Tintin somehow managed a mixed reaction in terms of story. Firstly selecting ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" make sense as that shows the boy sleuth meeting the gold hearted Captain Haddock for the first time and in the first encounter Tintin comes face to face with the perennial drinking habit of Captain. ""The crab with the golden claws"" had enough spice for a full fledged film but may be Spielberg wanted some adventure which prompted him to juggle with ""The secret of the unicorn"" and ""the crab with the golden claws"" thus making a concatenation of two stories. Personally I felt that the two stories have been woven wisely with liberty taken in creating an ancestral fight between Captain Francis Haddock and Pirate Red Rackham. Somehow the cocktail was well crafted with the story oscillating between two original books. But the second half was outright outlandish as Spielberg merges his own imagination in creating a full fledged action film which took away the essence of Tintin. The subtlety, intelligence were missing as the director chose to make a 80s Bollywoodish action climax which had no connection to the original one. Moreover the movie ended in the way the comic book ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" ends yet Spielberg hinted a sequel which is related to Red Rackham's treasure. That shows the sequel will be a total new story by Spielberg (or Peter Jackson) with touches of original. It will be strictly for those who have no idea of what actual Tintin is all about. I mean Spilberg could have named it anything Tom Dick and Harry if not Tintin specially for the second half.Character Level – Spielberg is almost perfect in designing the characters. The look and the way the screen Tintin reacts brings in nostalgia of childhood days when we imagined (and discussed amongst friends) how Tintin would have behaved if made on screen. The attire to expression was all nicely done. Same goes for Snowy, the cute loyal dog of Tintin who can fight with the goons to save his beloved master. In fact children will fall in love with Snowy after watching this film. In one of the scene when Tintin gets kidnapped Snowy follows the car of the goons to the ship were Tintin was deported. The scene indeed brings out the pathos and concern inside Snowy for his master. Coming to Captain Haddock the characterization isn't as perfect as the comic book. The laziness and craziness in the first half were apt but then Captain fighting in the second half is too hard to digest. The detective duo Thompson and Thomson is appropriate and so is famous nightingale singer Bianca Castaphiore. But Spielberg should have included the verbal fights between Castaphiore and Haddock though he hinted Haddock and Snowy's disgust for Castaphiore's opera. Coming to the villains I am not convinced of Sachcharin as the main villain. The original had Bird Brothers as the villain duo which was more convincing than the screen one. In fact if they wanted to include a dreaded notorious villain then Rastapopulous (the evergreen big nosed enemy of Tintin) would have been the right choice. Even malicious Captain Allan has been relegated to side kick of Sachcharin. Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham's characters were true to the original book and it worked well.Technical Level :- Frankly speaking the 3D effects were disappointing though the animation was top notch. The shadows and the structures created the by gone era with utmost precision. The fight sequence between Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham was one of the best sequences in the film. With brilliant camera-work and fine editing the scenes looked captivating on screen. Thought the fight sequences in the climax were loud for Tintin purist but at technical level those are a treat to watch and would be lapped by those who don't have a clue of ""actual"" Tintin. Dialogues were plain pedestrian and thanks to morality lectures by Captain it becomes ridiculous as a Tintin loyalist to sit through in the second half. As a director Spielberg has lost his midas touch long back which is echoed by this film again.As a whole Adventure of Tintin started of brilliantly but lost its true sense with faulty narrative towards later half. Tintin loyalists would feel cheated but then they would still watch it for Nostalgia. Non-Tintin fans would lap it for the action. But believe me the Belgian reporter who resides in the heart of millions deserve a better on-screen representation thus doing justice to original masterpiece created by genius Herge. Whatever may be the fate of Spielberg's Tintin please go and read the original comic series. Each is brilliant in it's own way..On-screen or off-screen Tintin and Snowy rocks!!

"Recommended, especially for big ""Snowy"" fans","Avatar's motion capture techniques showed what was technically possible with the new computer toybox at film directors disposal. Spielberg and Peter Jackson clearly wanted to play in the digital sandbox but needed a film to demonstrate what they could do.Tintin is perhaps a suitable choice, realistically he would not work with real actors and creating the action inside the computer, allows literally anything to be shown on the big screen.Crash landing airplanes in the desert, intricate chases set in a bazaar with impossible stunts, fifty gun galleon's firing broadsides in monstrous seas, Spielberg directs like a kid let loose in a chocolate factory.Jamie Bell fleshes out the eponymous Tintin with bad guy duties falling to Daniel Craig as Sakharine. Captain Haddock, who spends the entire film in pursuit of his next whisky bottle is provided via Andy Serkis, no stranger to these new acting techniques.It is interesting to see echos of the actors through their motion capture work, not just in their voices but in their facial actions, the way they move, walk and act.For the uninitiated, Tintin is a ""cub"" reporter providing newspaper articles on fantastic adventures and scrapes that he often finds himself embroiled in, all set within a largely recognisable 20th century backdrop. The film is based on three of the many books written by Herge', this is classic boys own adventure stuff, lots of derring do in a wholesome family kind of way.The plot revolves around sunken hidden treasure and a model ship, ""The Unicorn"", which is a good excuse to bring pirates, generational revenge and other dastardly plans into the mix. The story wends it's way through a Junior ""Indiana Jones"" sequence of events and is accompanied by a rousing John Williams score to suit the action on screen.Tintin is aided by the ""Thompson Twins"" (Frost and Pegg) who are part of Interpol but are inherently inept and stereotypically British, including obligatory bowler hats and umbrellas. Whilst they are designed as the comic relief, here they do not add to the story and tend to drag the action down whenever they are on the screen, notably the wallet scene which appears childish and out of place.The ""animation"" is beautifully done, clearly pushing the envelope of just what is possible even further ahead. With almost infinite camera angles at his disposal with the new technique, Spielberg has fun mixing up how the audience views the action. Tintin appears real, the audience complaint of ""dead eyes"" and the simulation of realistic sea and water issues, obviously now fixed. The technique pioneer, ""The Polar Express"" is already beginning to look quaintly old fashioned and creaky in comparison.Star of the show must be ""Snowy"", Tintin's ever present canine friend. Animated to perfection, with all the best action, looks and comic touches. Pet shops will need to stock up on Wire Fox Terriers, to keep up with demand.The film is fun and obviously orientated towards a family audience, the Thompson twins do mar the action but the film recovers with some excellent sequences, notably a post plane crash propeller incident, dueling port cranes and an exciting motor-cycle sidecar chase.Interestingly released in the UK and Europe before the US, as the character is perhaps better known on the European side of the Atlantic.Looks good in 3D with some decent depth gags but probably not compulsory to enjoy the film.SummaryProvided the film is not taken to seriously, there is much to enjoy. Superb action with fantastic state of the art motion capture and CGI animation techniques.Kids will love the film and there is sufficient depth to keep most parents interested and the send off certainly indicates there is more of Tintin to come.Recommended, especially for big ""Snowy"" fanshttp://www.julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very fun entertainer,"Those of you old enough might remember the Tintin show that, if I'm correct, used to come on Channel 4 early in the mornings. It was great, really fun to watch. So I had a keen interest in the movie when it was announced, especially after knowing that it was being directed by one Steven Spielberg.The Secret Of The Unicorn is about Tintin (Jamie Bell), the brave young journalist always on the lookout for a story. Purchasing a model of a ship propels him into an epic adventure across the world, assisted by the drunk Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), and thwarted by the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig).Since it released in the cinema, I've seen this movie about four times, and I always enjoy it. Mostly because it has all that charm you expect from a Spielberg charm, but with the added bonus of it being a motion capture animation. The digital effects are absolutely sublime, and need to be seen in HD to be properly appreciated. The highlight has to be the incredible chase sequence involving Snowy the dog and an eagle, with blatant comparisons to Indiana Jones and The Goonies apparent. On the other hand, there are sequences in the movie which are perhaps a bit too far-fetched. Yes, it's an animated film, but we're trained to think of this as 'real life'.Performance-wise, it's a good affair. I think Andy Serkis is the star of the show; Haddock is a great character, and he does it justice. It's fun to see Daniel Craig do something a bit sillier than usual, and Jamie Bell is his usual solid self. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are comic relief, somewhat, but their talents are wasted, I think.Overall, I give this a thumbs-up. Whether you're a fan of the original books, or the TV show like me, you'll enjoy this cinematic version. With a sequel already earmarked (especially considering the end of this movie), this could turn into a very successful franchise. Good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great for kids and fans,"The Adventures of Tintin is a great adventure movie for kids and probably for anyone who read the Tintin comics as a child. I only had maybe two or three of the comic books when I was young, so I was not expecting too much.Technically, the movie is absolutely impressive. The characters, hair, skins and clothes look so realistic it's almost scary. But because the faces are straight from the comics, it never drifts off to uncanny valley.The story itself is supposed to be taken from three of the books and is nice to watch, but not too exciting. It is remarkable, though, how many guns and shooting is displayed in a Spielberg movie.I saw this in IMAX 3D and while the sound was impressive, the 3D effect is not too eye-catching, except for a few specially-for-3D moments. The 2D Blu-ray Disc will surely be a great demo disc.All in all I was glad that I won the tickets to the presentation, especially in consideration of todays 3D ticket prices. The ending was a bit of a letdown and came too soon after the big ""boss fight"" shortly before the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful!,"Very fun movie all around and it has great performances to go with it! What's not to love? I grew up with Tintin and have been reading tales and stories of him ever since i was a child, and although i did recognise the fact that they spliced 3 stories together (even noticed it as a kid when it came out) I am not opposed to the changes, as i believe a completely accurate retelling would've gone against the Tintin legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Oh, so enjoyable!!","Now, who doesn't enjoy Tintin? Or a great action adventure? 'The Adentures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' has it all: action, adventure, humor, drama, fantasy, and solid storytelling.Ok, so this is what I refer to as cheat animation, since it is not entirely animation. Real actors were used, and a lot of the scenes were actually performed by these actors. So its not just an animated film with voice over work. The result, however, is incredible. 'The Adventures of Tintin' is visually stunning and the characters are life-like (needless to say). Interestingly enough, Tintin wasn't my favorite character here. Captain Haddock was. He was the most interesting character with the most fascinating back story. He was humorous and all-round likable.The film cleverly combines fantasy elements in this action adventure. There's a lot of slapstick humor and although I generally don't like slapstick, I didn't mind it much here. Off course, also keeping in mind - being animated - it would be aimed at a young demographic, although off course to be equally enjoyed by adults. The pirate battles were incredibly well done.'The Adventures of Tintin' is an all-round top notch production, with a captivating story, compelling characters, beautiful animation and excellent voice-over work. This is a film to enjoy again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One wouldn't be able to destroy Tintin's spirit better than this...,"I'd never expect a Blockbuster movie to be worth of paying any attention beyond entertainment, but this one was even below my expectations for what one would call ""entertaining"". And of course it was not even close to what Herge had created. With tons of computers, 3D technology and over $100 million, Spielberg failed to achieve what Herge simply did with a pen and paper. As a great Tintin fan, I now feel terribly offended (both for what I just watched and for the fact that Spielberg also calls himself a fan) and as a passionate film goer, I just feel sorry for how art is the last thing that's noticed in mainstream American cinema.I Borrowed Spielberg's (yes, it's not Herge's) Tintin from Netflix (I insisted not to pay for it, because of all bad things I'd heard about it) and watched it out of curiosity (just curiosity - to see why other Tintin fans didn't like it), and found it even below my expectations. Everything is terribly superficial here, as the original story and characters have been destroyed and turned into some lame boring and dull Hollywood crap. In a word, the original work's spirit is completely lost here: Tintin is about mystery, reality (I stress on this: Tintin is one of the few comic book characters that feels real) and humanity, but Spielberg's interpretation is all about some stupid and unreal action and some annoying 3D techniques, plus, a camera that moves and moves and rotates around the characters over and over! I had a feeling that I'm in a thrill ride, and wanted to puke couple of times. It's interesting that Herge's hand-drawn characters look more real than Spielberg's superficial CGI characters. And if those camera moves and actions don't excite you, there's really nothing beyond, as characters, events and story are all superficial and about action. No wonder why in couple of months, no one talks about the movie anymore, while Herge's work is still fresh after decades.Score: 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Brilliant film, even better in 3D...","As you may know Tin Tin is a very old character and there has been books and TV programs made about his great adventures by his inventor Hergé. This new film has been voted the best animated film and once you've seen this film you'll know why. The film is well paced out and there's never a dull moment in this film. The 3D in this film is spectacular and it's well worth seeing this film in 3D if you can. The film is around 1 hour 47 minutes long and in this time Steven Spielberg manages to squash in a good few adventures into one in this film. This makes it much more exciting and you really get to know how Tin Tin and Captain Haddock were in the old days. As a projectionist, I've seen this film about 6 times now and I still don't get bored watching it. Absolutely brilliant film, I really recommend going to see this film as soon as you can. Hope the review helps your thoughts on the film. Thanks for reading, I'll be making more reviews on the films that I see at my cinema so you can get the latest thoughts from me on the films.

Light on plot but heavy on excitement; the animated Indiana Jones,"I'd like to believe that everyone agrees in the following sentiment: the fourth Indiana Jones film is terrible. (Well, everyone except George Lucas.) Even Steven Spielberg seems to understand the train wreck he put on screen in 2008, though he won't come out and say that in order to protect Lucas. That movie stands as one of the worst experiences of my cinematic life, a slap in the face of Phantom Menace proportions. But after having seen The Adventures of Tintin, I feel a little bit better. And I move that we officially strike Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from the record and name Tintin the fourth Indy film. Seconded?Tintin (voice by Jamie Bell) is a young journalist with a knack for breaking major stories. When he comes across a model of a man-o-war ship known as The Unicorn, he senses a story and begins digging around into the history of the ship and its cargo. Soon he finds himself caught up in the midst of a generations-old battle between two seafaring families, the Haddocks and the Rackhams. After joining forces with Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), the last of his line who keeps an important secret buried beneath years of alcoholism, Tintin and his dog Snowy undertake a globetrotting trek to foil the plans of Sakharine (Daniel Craig), who wants to steal the Haddock birthright.There aren't a lot of animated movies that qualify as true adventure flicks but Tintin is one of them. From the dynamic opening credits until the conclusion, the film runs at full sprint, rarely stopping to take a breath. It is the very definition of a thrill ride as Tintin and his pals find themselves in one dangerous situation after another. At times it plays out like a video game, jumping from one level (as it were) to the next but in this case, I think that fits the story well. This is sheer fun and exhilaration and the quick shifts in setting and plot should make it easy for kiddos to follow along while parents dig into the Spielbergian adventure.The characters within Tintin are strong if somewhat limited. Tintin himself is kind of a baby-faced Jack Bauer, a master of all trades from shooting guns to flying planes who always manages to stay one step ahead of his opponents. Haddock provides outstanding comedic relief and a touch of brute force to back Tintin's brains. In fact, I think the film takes off when Haddock shows up. His presence provides a second gear to Tintin and his relative buffoonery allows for fun and outlandish plot points that keep the ball rolling. All of this begs the question: has any actor ever had a better year without actually appearing in person on camera than Andy Serkis has this year? He's THE reason why Rise of the Planet of the Apes worked and he is easily the best part of this film in my book. If Tintin doesn't quite measure up to Indy, Haddock is a better Sallah than John Rhys Davies ever was (heretical statement, I know). And while Sakharine isn't exactly a pre-war Nazi, his power grows throughout the movie and he becomes a suitable villain.The only real complaint I might voice about Tintin is the paper-thin plot. While the video game-like feel works overall, there are times when I might have preferred some exposition. There are a few interconnecting story lines that serve to advance the narrative and that's good because there isn't a whole lot of time devoted to character or plot development. Even still, at times it comes across as if the plot was picked out of a list of creative writing prompts, though the way Spielberg dives into said prompt is often deliciously entertaining. In addition, Tintin is to motion capture animation what Avatar was to 3D: it is the exception not the rule, the example of what the technology is capable of delivering in the right hands. Robert Zemeckis bankrupted a company trying to master the art of motion capture but in my mind, he never came close to achieving what Spielberg does here. Tintin is an absolutely gorgeous film that thrives on beautiful landscapes and exquisite details. Tintin may be light one plot but it is heavy on excitement and the visuals serve to deepen the experience, making this one of the more enjoyable films of the year.Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ultimately impressive effort,"Now, I can understand why both critics and average Tintin fans alike might have felt a little let down by the story. Spielberg and Jackson merged two stories into one, and while others may feel that this was a negative aspect of the film, I maintain that it was the most practical (and effective) thing to do. After all, we need some knowhow as to why Tintin and Haddock meet, otherwise it is just confusing for all those people who haven't read a Tintin comic in their life.I must admit,this is the first time I have experienced Tintin in English (having read all but one in their original French) and it was very impressive how they were translated into English, although I doubt Spielberg even glanced at a French copy, and merely used the English. There have been comments as to the non-heroics of our 'hero' as opposed to 'Snowy', who really steals the show. But in the comics, it IS always Snowy who does the real work, the amount of times he saves Tintin are uncountable! One thing I will say though, is that the motion capture coupled with the CGI made a slightly weird contrast to Spielbergs love of close-ups, and not in a good way. Otherwise, it gave the movie a real comic-book atmosphere. For me, this has been a real privilege to watch, and a joy to see one of my childhood heroes brought to life. It's a bit too like Spielberg's other films to merit a nine (no film is ever worth ten), but ultimately this is a genuinely good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A reasonably satisfying, fast-paced romp for all ages","Since 1929, 'The Adventures of Tintin' by Belgian artist Hergé has been delighting children and adults alike with its bold, unique visuals and engaging stories of adventure, global intrigue and mystery. The exploits of this wide-eyed, globe-trotting reporter and his lovable pooch Snowy, have been translated in over 50 languages and adapted into every conceivable medium. Perhaps the most popular incarnation of the character was the animated series produced in 1991 by Canadian entertainment company Nelvana. For this reviewer, it was a staple of after school television viewing – it closely replicated Hergé's signature style and had some pretty spot-on voice acting and music.When it was announced in May 2007 that master filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson would be collaborating on a 3D animated film based on the beloved comic strip, it quickly became one of the most anticipated films in recent Hollywood history. But when the November 2010 issue of Empire Magazine released the first production stills from Spielberg/Jackson's TINTIN, I was shocked. The characters – Tintin, Snowy and their rarely sober companion Captain Haddock – looked like they had just disembarked from THE POLAR EXPRESS. They were dead-eyed, creepy and uncannily lifelike. Hergé's distinctive texture and style seemed absent altogether. I adore Spielberg and Jackson but this left me wishing that a traditional animator like Sylvian Chomet (THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE, THE ILLUSIONIST) were at the helm of this film. And all those trailers and web documentaries that followed didn't do much to change my opinion that THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN would rank among other fan-boy disappointments such as SPEED RACER and ASTRO BOY.Thankfully, this reviewer was only partially correct.From its fun, Saul Bass-inspired opening credits sequence (think Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) to the very last scene, THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN is a reasonably satisfying, fast- paced romp. It may not be as charming or absorbing as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, but it certainly succeeds in the 'family adventure' sub-genre.The screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish combines elements of 'The Crab and the Golden Claws' (1943), 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' (both published in 1945), and reunites KING KONG costars Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis – as Tintin and Captain Haddock, respectively – for an around-the-world adventure for a lost family treasure. Both actors, especially Serkis, the undisputed 'go-to' guy for motion-capture acting, give pretty okay performances and are accompanied by a colorful supporting cast; including Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who provide welcome comic relief as bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson, and Daniel Craig, who plays against type as our nefarious villain Ivanovitch Sakharine - who I swear is a self-portrait of Spielberg himself! Sadly Toby Jones, Tony Curran and Gad Elmaleh as Tintin favorites Silk, Lieutenant Delacourt and Omar Ben Salaad are given very little to do.While the quasi-human designs of the characters will outrage some Hergé purists, this film is undoubtedly another technical achievement for special effects house Weta Digital, who earlier this year gave us the very compelling chimps in that other Serkis vehicle RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. The animation is detailed and meticulous and certainly improves on what Robert Zemeckis (BEOWULF, A Christmas CAROL) and other pioneers of the format have achieved in the past. Proof of this is the spectacular battle at sea between Haddock and Sakharine's ancestors, Sir Francis Haddock and Red Rackham (also played by Serkis and Craig). This is one of Spielberg's finest action sequences, combining impressive tracking shots and madcap action, with some of the most creative scene transitions ever committed to cinema. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the climactic chase through Morocco. All done in one shot, it is innovative at first, but questionable and tiresome by the end.There are few nice 'for-the-fans' moments, such as a very clever cameo appearance by Hergé at the beginning of the film. Yet some things may prove a little hurting, such as the absence of the eccentric Professor Calculus (who featured prominently in 'Red Rackham's Treasure') or the memorable scene in 'The Crab and the Golden Claws' when a hallucinating Haddock mistakes our hero for a bottle of grog. Hopefully these will find their way into the sequel, which is set to be directed by Jackson.So, was it Hergé's Tintin? No. Was it Spielberg's best film? Definitely not. But it is still worth a look!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Boring Adventures of Tintin,"The movie is based on two stories from the comics, they are: The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn. The movie took some liberties with telling the story, but I don't think that it worked too well.The two main problems with the movie are that it lacked any small character moments and there wasn't enough breathing room between all the fast paced non-stop action. After a while, it gets pretty boring/irritating watching it.Also, I'm mixed on the mo-cap animation. It felt weird and a bit distracting. I wasn't keen on the hyper realistic style mixed with the cartoonishness of the art of the comics.Overall, the show did it better.4.5/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fitting Tribute to Classic Adventure,"Since its creation more than eighty years ago, The Belgian comic Adventures of Tintin has been one of the most successful entries in the 'boy adventure' genre, with millions worldwide following the exploits of the young reporter. Yet the strip has never gained a particularly wide following in the States. But that may be about to change thanks to Steven Spielberg's brilliant film adaptation.Wasting no time on set up, Tintin jumps strait into the action, with the purchase of a model ship leading almost immediately into a rousing, highly improbable series of adventures that will take Tintin across oceans and deserts in search of a fabulous sunken treasure. Along the way, Tintin, his faithful dog snowy, and the perpetually drunk Captain Haddock will face off against mutineers and Arab tribesmen, narrowly escape all manner of sudden death, and receive the dubious aid of the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson.Lacking even a hint of subtlety, Spielberg's Tintin is one of the most ridiculously -and awesomely- over the top adventures since the original Indiana Jones films, with its sheer implausibility never becoming a problem. With this kind of movie, knowing that the hero would be dead a hundred times over in real life is part of the draw. After all, in a world where a baby faced reporter and a small dog can survive plane crashes, shootouts, and a high speed chase with rocket launchers, it's not hard to imagine that you could be a dashing hero as well.Tintin is heavy on the action, with lots of fisticuffs, gunplay, chases, and -via rum-fueled flashback, swashbuckling pirate action strait out of Hollywood's golden age. There are also plenty of laughs, mostly related to Haddock's continual inebriation and the Thompsons' incompetence. Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Haddock finally sobers up. The film is rather weak on character development, but that's forgivable given that this is an action thriller and a kid's movie. I also found some of the big twists to be fairly predictable, but I'm sure that most younger viewers will be suitably surprised.Visually, Tintin is a real treat for the eyes. Utilizing the very latest in CGI, the animators have created a world that is remarkably lifelike and yet at the same time highly evocative of the original comic's art. The soundtrack, by veteran composer John Williams, is excellent as well. Although it may lack the spectacular flourishes of his work on Star Wars and Jurassic Park, Tintin's jazz infused score provides a good counterpoint to the onscreen action.It may not be Spielberg's best movie, or even his best kid's movie, but Tintin is still great family entertainment, fully on par with Pixar's recent offerings. And it's a fitting tribute to the venerable comic, lovingly made by one of its biggest fans. I'm sure that Spielberg had lots of fun making Tintin. And I'm sure you'll have lots of fun watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not even close to Indiana Jones,One of the Spielbergs weakest films. I think that animation was bad and characters were not interesting. There is always some action which I don't like. I liked the story a little and the best part were Pegg and Frost as Thompson and Thomson.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The world reinvented,"Spielberg won't get the credit he deserves for it. That's the way it is with successful directors. If this was by a relatively new presence we would be fawning over them, calling them a genius. (Or genii, as this involves at least two big talents, Spielberg and Peter Jackson). Remember what was said about Monet? ""Just an eye, but what an eye!"" Well, these two men each have a fantastic eye and more than that in spades. It is a good story if not a great story. Young Tintin buys a model boat that is stolen by villains and he is sucked into a mystery involving lost treasure and family vengeance. The cartoon element of the characters does detract from our emotional involvement, as does the peculiarly uncomplicated nature of the hero. But I think everyone should see this movie because of the way it blurs our distinction between the world and its imitation. Those same people who criticized Spiderman's CGI movements might well have occasional words to say here but I'll ignore them too. This is not the comic brought to life or the real world in animation. Not a Toy Story or an Avatar. This is the world reinvented. You can do what you want now, unhindered by bleary eyed actors with agendas of their own. Forget gravity or rainy days – unless they help the story. Jackson's production company has produced a world that sparkles like our own. (Perhaps better if you come from the same place I do). Andy Serkis is the star (for me) and does a fantastic turn as Captain Haddock with a raw Scottish accent that happily rises to a Sean Connery impersonation from time to time. I say 'happily' because the villain is played by another Bond, Daniel Craig who would have done better to showboat a little to keep up. Jamie Bell has a direct, youthful, no-messing part as Tintin – a wise choice as he never sounds whiny. The brilliant pair of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are unnecessary as the overly stupid Thompson Twins. But things other than people crave your attention too because they appear to have been created with such care: the swell of the waves, flaming sails, the glimmer of cobbles, inky clouds around crackling lightening, the glow of skin in sunlight, and on and on It has to be compared to Martin Scorcese's more human Hugo for a variety of reasons but I'll mention only one. Scorcese begins his film in a suitably cinematic and impressive way with an impossible long take in Hitchcock fashion, the camera wending its way like the eye of a God narrator, through windows and buildings and over constrictive machinery. Spielberg waits nearly an hour and a half before giving us a two and a half minute sequence of continuous choreographed adventure. It's a chase for secret documents, the maguffin, down a sparkling hillside in North Africa on a motorbike that will eventually fall apart while buildings are torn asunder and characters woven in and out of frame in a complexity that boggles the brain. The thing to do is forget your qualms and skepticism about CGI and animation. It's a film I wish I could watch as a young boy in 12 B.C. (Before Critics).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The curse of the crimson pirate.,"Since 1947, they have been making movies starring Tintin; the first one was some kind of puppet show based on the ""Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or"", an extract of which was screened some years ago on TV. But the movie itself seemed lost before it reappeared on DVD. Then, in the sixties, there were two movies with actors starring a Tintin lookalike, Jean-Pierre Talbot, but only the first one was entertaining. It was Tintin Et Le Mystère De La Toison D'Or (1961) while Tintin Et Les Oranges Bleues (1964) was a disaster. Then, there were two full feature cartoons: Le Temple Du Soleil (1969) and Tintin Et Le Lac Aux Requins (1972). To be complete, we can mention two series of MTV cartoons, the Belvision ones in the sixties which haven't aged well and the Ellipse ones in the nineties which were faithful to the comic books.Spielberg's work is the movie the ""Tintinophiles"" have always been waiting for. A cross between Le Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or and Le Secret De La Licorne with a dash of Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge thrown in for good measure, plus hints at On A Marché Sur La Lune (bubbles of whiskey) and L'Affaire Tournesol (the Castafiore breaking glass with her voice). The screenplay was carefully worked but begins to falter when Tintin and Captain Haddock are in Morocco. But it regains its strength in the basements of Moulinsart. The opening sequence is a delight: Hergé drawing a sketch of his hero is pure genius. Having replaced Haddock's visions (the bottle of Champagn) by the epics of his ancestor on the Unicorn in the desert is probably the best idea and shows Spielberg's and Jackson's knowledge of psychoanalysis latent in almost all Hergé's work. Turning Sakharine from a harmless collector into the villain was also an asset because it allowed an unexpected connection with the past.Tintin and Haddock are close to perfect but the Dupondts leave a bit to be desired: their sensational comical power is not fully exploited. And if we appreciate the smart introduction of the ""Milanese Nightingale"", we may regret the absence of professor Tournesol. We hope they save him for the second installment.No doubt about it: Spielberg and Jackson pulled it off with gusto. Even Milou isn't insignificant as he was in the sixties works. The scene with the sandwich on the ship belongs to him.""Tintinophile""'s honor: this is superb entertainment. To be precise: this is superb entertainment",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing extraordinary,"I think the problem was my expectations were so much higher than what the movie turned out to be.The story is quite mediocre and the characters are not as fully developed as they should have been for such a big production. I mean, the ""bad guy"" was nothing but plain ordinary and Tintin... quite the disappointment in my opinion. Then there was the problem with the design of the animation. In my opinion, it wasn't well done. I would have preferred it with real actors. It would have done a better job at catching my attention instead of being distracted by the lack of emotion of the characters.

Spielberg has done it again!,"It took both Spielberg and Peter Jackson to put this film together and it shows. Two supreme storytellers who's combined efforts are better than the sum of the parts. How often does that happen? I've read tons of reviews of John Carter that talk about how good it is and how it got bad press from the start. John Carter didn't make 370+ million dollars worldwide! (I wish it did but it didn't.) Tintin did. Why? It gave the fans EXACTLY what they wanted. A magnificent adventure! And who better to give it than the two greatest adventure creators of the 21st Century! John Carter would have been MUCH better done as an animated adventure but they wanted to go live and look what happened. These days you need real buildup not just a ""who's on the list to be John Carter this year?"" kind of attitude. JC didn't have the buildup like Tintin or certainly not like the Avengers and so there was no momentum to carry into seeing the movie. With Tintin everyone was stunned BOTH directors were collaborating and it shows. It's a work of art in every sense of the word. From the magnificent vistas to the hair-raising action sequences this is the state of the art in adventure movies today. Of course, Andy Serkis, Cary Elwes, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Daniel Craig and Toby Jones wouldn't have it otherwise! and let's give credit to Jamie Bell for the most believable Tintin voice yet! Great job all! The only bad part of all this is that there are certainly Tintin characters the fans would have wanted in the movie but aren't present. Chief among them is Professor Calculus. My hope is this is the first of many Tintin adventures and the dowsing doctor will be appearing in the next film coming soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A very good family movie that is fun for everyone. A cartoon like ""Indiana Jones"". I really liked it. I say B+","""How's your thirst for adventure? Unquinchable Tin Tin."" After buying a model ship Tin Tin (Bell) is approached by a stranger who offers to buy it from him. When Tin Tin refuses he is kidnapped and brought aboard a ship. When a mutiny goes bad Tin Tin, his dog Snowy and the captain of the ship begin an adventure that could end up with a large, lost treasure. My main reason for watching this was because it was a Spielberg movie. After about ten minutes I was hooked. This is one of the few family movies that is actually a movie that adults can watch without feeling like its a chore. The best way to describe this is that it is a cartoon version of ""Indiana Jones"". The good ones, before Lucas added aliens. This is a movie that I was looking forward to and was actually better then I expected. I recommend this for family night. Overall, a really good movie that a family can all watch together. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bad film,"I am sorry for my English but I am french.To me the movie is really bad in itself, even without thinking to the original comic.But you can guess it's largely worse if you dare to compare it to the very clever and rich Hergé piece.In fact there are several problem:1- The story is empty, it has no link at all with the comic, they took three episodes, they mixed them and kept only the action scenes. They added other action scenes that are completely absurd and ridiculous.To me the most idiot thing, its the fact they added an highlander touch with the bad guy and haddock which is completely anachronistic and silly. The crane fight reminds the worse of Michael Bay, thats a shame they ruined this way such a subtle and class stuff for a ""rain man"" audience.Also the characters have no way a link with the original ones. Haddock don't fight at all, and don't act like Tarzan, thats absurd.2- The directing and the edit are absolutely awful. We cant breath, all go too fast, the camera is always moving, the transition are supposed to be hype but it has no class at all. Thats shallow and hysterical.3- The visuals are ugly, OK the sets are cool, but the problem is about the character who are really boring and unbearable.4- The music has no personality, its sad to see such a great guy as John Williams doing something so impersonal.Big disappointment made to please American audience, and sacrificing the original spirit of tintin.Even the little Belgium cartoon made on tintin which has not been made with thousands millions of dollars in early 90's is better, cooler, funnier, and more smart:",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Herge's Tintin meets Uncharted.,"There's an effortless simplicity of story and exposition and in the telling that is sometimes the films greatest strength; the pulp classic adventure throwback stylings, but that can also be its greatest weaknesses, causing the thrust, inbetween the inventive action, to be turgid to the point of boredom.Jamie Bell turns in, incredulously, one of his best performances, the visuals, flow of direction, creativity of shots, and use of photorealistic locations and performances with cartoon flourishes and physics is a stroke of genius. Its uniqueness makes it such a wonderful film just to look at.My fondness for this film has grown since I first saw it in th cinema. It's ability to transform and adapt almost verbatim several of the Tintin stories while making it seem a modern classic and infusing it with tremendous performances galvanisedd it for me as a real under appreciated gem.Probably the best looking, best facially mocapped non photorealistic entirely CGI movie ever. The lighting and the directing and, in this case, the 3D are all reference material quality. A properly enjoyable cinematic experience and I wish there were more of these as planned to take me to some of the other worlds in Tintin's stories.I would fully appreciate seeing what a sequel could bring to the table in 20XX.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Review about The Adventures of Tintin (2011),"So this is my first time I write a review. This movie about Tintin is really made beautiful. The animation is really beautiful, at moments I had the idea that is wasn't animated, but real. When I was kid I was a big fan of Tintin, so I knew all the comics, and I had read them a billion times. I knew that they would let Calculus out of the story, this was weird, because he is one of the key characters of that story, but how they solved this was really clever. It was really fun to watch this movie, and I would like to see it again soon, and I don't have that with a lot of movies.this is a movie recommended for real Tintin fans, but also for the people who doesn't know Tintin.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Surprisingly fun adventure, packed with action, comedy and suspense","The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn is based on Herge's famous Belgian comic from 1929-76. It is directed by Steven Spielberg, master of adventure, and produced by Peter Jackson, who brought the technological wonders of The Lord of the Rings. It also stars a host of actors including Jamie Bell as the titular character, as well as Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Toby Jones and of course motion-capture expert Andy Serkis in the co- lead role. Not fully-animated but not live action, this film uses the motion-capture technology of the slightly nausea-inducing Polar Express and Beowulf. However, with Peter Jackson at the technological helm, the motion-capture is superb.The premise involves Tintin, an ambitious and mystery-loving reporter and his dog Snowy who uncover a mystery involving the famous disaster of The Unicorn. This leads them to the drunk Captain Haddock (Serkis), the only one who knows the secret. However, villain Daniel Craig is also after the mystery. This leads to some absurdly fun moments.Every actor is fantastic in their roles, especially Serkis' Haddock and Frost and Pegg's bumbling detectives. The film felt a lot like Indiana Jones, especially with Spielberg and John Williams' amazing score. Writers Joe Cornish, Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright deliver plenty of witty dialogue and the action scenes, most notably the motorbike chase in Morocco, had me buzzing with excitement.The bad points of the film is that it is VERY fast-paced; a lot of things happen for a one hour and forty minute film, so it feels a bit rushed and it can be easy to lose track of the story. Nevertheless, Tintin is a fun, suspenseful and immensely enjoyable film, surprising me for its PG rating. A great Spielberg mystery adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Liked very much, but some of it was ""too much""","It's like nothing I have ever seen before, and that's some of the highest praise that I can give to any piece of art. Most of the time, the characters' faces are almost completely lifelike and yet there's still a hint of their hand-drawn origins. The backgrounds are often entirely believable, but in some scenes they erupt into detail that has simply never been shown on screen before. A fantastic job by the director, the cinematographer, the graphic designers, or whatever all these people's titles are.There is a downside: several times I turned to my companion and said ""That's too much"". I don't want to be a spoiler but often there was just too much action and too much detail, and a couple of scenes just went on way too long. Occasionally, a scene had me wondering whether it actually shot and then digitally manipulated, or created using motion capture, or created entirely in a computer. But the fact that I was thinking such things meant that I had been distracted; there was so much going on that it had overloaded my brain.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

All Over the Place,"This is a scatterbrained nightmare. How disappointing to see such a great idea become spoiled with a plot rushing so quickly and ill character development. When are the great directors and movie makers going to get the fact that the movie scenes need to STOP MOVING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE MAKING ONE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE CAR SICKNESS. YOU KEEP DOING THIS WITH ALL THE FREAKEN FILMS!!The animation is brilliant, but the editing, the development of the story was ruined with the rushed pace and all the action scenes. There was no time to make a connection with the characters. Dear movie makers do you really think we are that short sighted? What happened to the more sophisticated films? How could Spielberg make this kind of film, along with the latest Indiana Jones film?It became unwatchable, like Hugo. Dear movie makers, ""What is wrong with your insight?"" Such a sad indication of where this country is headed. A movie targeted to a different generation who need action films with constant movement in order to feel entertained. There is more to life than that. Whatever happened to peace and quality of the moment in films. There is more to animated films than ONLY FREAKEN ACTION!! Stop wasting time and money and make some GOOD films for a change that are engaging. Even the music by John Williams could not keep us connected to the film!

Adventure into the uncanny valley,"I was in the mood for an adventure movie, and was googling around, and saw this and thought, well, I must have watched this, right? I mean, it's Spielberg.But I hadn't. I'd heard negative things about it somewhere, and since Spielberg was more hit and miss by then, I skipped it. Which is good, because it meant there was a fun adventure movie to watch when I needed one.Tintin is a reporter who I always think of as a kid (from when I read the comics when I was a kid in the dentist office) but who in this seems to be maybe college age? He buys a toy ship, people try to buy it from him, and suddenly there is mystery and danger and excitement and grand adventure.The computer animation has that uncanny valley quality, especially with TinTIn, who is rendered less cartoonishly than the rest of the cast (you'd expect the other characters to call him ""small-nose""). But while that and TinTin's strange Britishy-accent felt a little off, there are some really cool animated transitions, like a ship sailing across the desert, and some phenomenal set pieces, like a chase involving a bird. It's all pleasantly humorous, with an engaging tale and a quick pace.It's not a great or particularly memorable movie (although it did come out the same year as Spielberg's return-to-form War Horse), but it is awfully enjoyable. Watch it and see.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hats Off!!,After missing the special Director's preview this past Thursday i finally got the chance to see it last night with my friend who was not actually willing to go for this flick simply because he is a huge Bollywood movies fan. But as i was planning to see this movie since the teasers started on the you tube & unable to find a ticket for a Bollywood movie which was sold out even for the next morning show i eventually wound up to buy tickets for TINTIN.Now straight to business.. the movie i saw was in 3D so i liked the technical part & special effects. This movie has some very great 3D effects we all have seen since AVATAR. i was clearly hearing the cheers from crowds & a couple sitting right next to me who were every now & then making a wow! sound. i liked the detailed background picture sequences & every things was so realistic that it does justice with its 3D aspect so i am giving 10/10 on the technical parts including sound effects also.Now comes the screenplay. Well it can be a 50:50 argument that many people who had been a loyal fan of TINTIN era might find the accounts of the story or the thriller level not up to the mark..but i beg to differ here. I have seen the old Tintin animations and i did not kinda enjoyed them simply because it was so simple i mean no fancy artwork & story was just relied totally on twists & breakneck speed events...but i gotta tell you i loved this movie not because of the story or the amount of the action but the way it has added the technology to represent the right spirit of a TINTIN ADVENTURE. I always wished that a Tintin series should be modified for the taste of our younger generation so that this Gem in the comics industry can regain the place which rightfully belongs to it. So the Director has nicely kept the pace alive during the whole movie & no one felt dull for a moment in the cinema hall so the credit goes to the director & script writers.Also movie has lots of funny moments which helps the audience to connect with the story in a much positive manner who has not been aware of the TINTIN character especially in Asian subcontinent. While every body coming out of the Cinema hall i remember had a smile on their faces & an expression of satisfaction that they have viewed a fine piece of cinema; so thanks to Steven Spielberg who not only believed in the possibilities of this project but also decided to finance it completely. and his ability to turn simple projects in to a blockbuster can be seen here once again.SO overall i liked this movie very much..i would also tell you that this is my first animation movie which i have seen inside a Cinema hall..simply because i used to believe that an animation cannot be more entertaining then real actor's performance but i think i need to revisit my old belief.i thoroughly enjoyed the movie so my rating is 10/10.Catch it you won't be disappointed..tell your friends & family to see it & don't wait for a pirated copy because some things in life are worth spending money.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Adventure done right,"Rating-7/10The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is an animation adventure film that lives up to what you might expect and matches the skill of the original content expertly. With a story that also contains massive action scenes and a beautifully rich style of design, Tintin comes to the screen with a big crash, but lands very very safely. I felt it was a solidly good movie and here below is why so.The story is very nicely done and paced well too with lovely locations used and characters who although very quirky, also imaginative. I felt the action quota in terms of fighting is not there but chase scenes are abundant and some of them are beautifully choreographed and put together using just immaculate style. It has it's humour too, not overly hilarious but has it's moments of light heartedness even in the moments it seems most unlikely.People such as Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis and Daniel Craig lend their voices to the movie and do an excellent job in the process creating characters you don't just instantly connect with their voice actor. I like Jamie Bell as Tintin but he can seem slightly annoying at times, as if he is constantly in your face. Andy Serkis as Haddock is good and although his voice is rough and Corse, it still turns out well worked.It is directed by Spielberg and written by a trio of writers who use the Herge originals well and also manage to not seem too authentic or too much like the comics. The style used for the animation for me is one of the most beautiful seen and is moved along fantastically. The animation has to be one of the best things because not only is the movement nice but also things such as the sea are defined with glorious colour and depth that really takes your eye to it.My main criticism has to be the slightly fast pace of the movie, now I know Tintin is like that and I understand but sometimes things seem slow then boom Tintin is off and doing stunts impossible to achieve. There isn't too much to say negatively about it but it could be said the movie never quite reaches epic proportions and stays relatively at the same level from start to end.This is truly one films for the kids and it highly enjoyable for a younger audience as I believe it has been made for. Saying that adults will also enjoy I think and unless you hate animation films then you shouldn't have many problems with little Tintin and Snowy on their adventures. If you like Indiana Jones then this is basically along the same lines although it's Tintin and Spielberg obviously brings his past in with him on this one.Overall I give it a 7/10 and felt it a solid one of that, not quite a VERY good film but not far at all and a great effort is put in to make it good. Tintin I feel may make fans of the original adventures slightly nervous or watch with suspicion but I felt it was put in safe hands and executed with a swift touch and not over done or anything that could damage it's credibility as a legendary adventure series.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A splendid attempt to capture the magic of Tintin,"When I was a child, I devoured the Tintin stories, I used to visit the library every week and take out as many as I was allowed - over and over again.So I was worried, despite the names of the Director and Producer, that this wouldn't quite capture the joy of my youth (I'm now 40).However, I had nothing to fear - and despite being an amalgamation of several Tintin stories I think it flows rather well with more than enough set pieces to fill a film.The relationship between Tintin and Snowy and Tintin and Haddock work really well and having read some of the other reviews it annoys me somewhat that the other reviewers say ""voiced by"" - that does a great disservice to the actors involved - in particular Serkis (Gollum, King Kong) as Haddock. ""Performance Capture"" (ala Avatar) really does capture the nuances of the actors performance - Serkis really is Haddock - he fills the character and at times the screen and scene.I think only Thompson and Thomson let this aspect down - I love Pegg and Frost, but were they right to play the bumbling Twins? Possibly not.From a computer-geek point of view - the 3D is good, but I won't miss it when I buy this on standard Blu-Ray when it comes out and there were times when I forgot I was watching a computer generated scene - the level of detail on skin, hair, clothing is truly staggering.Indeed Spielberg makes good use of the technology to create sweeping camera shots that pass through glass and water that would be impossible had this been a live action film.Finally, for me the most telling tribute to this film, is that I took my ten and four year old daughters, who have no history with Tintin at all, to see it and they absolutely loved it - they giggled and whooped and gasped at all the places I think they were supposed to.If you have no history with Tintin then you should enjoy this as a feel-good, family, rip-roaring adventure and if you're a die-hard Tintin lover, I suggest you leave your baggage at the door otherwise you will disappointed, because how could you be anything else?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quite nice...,"Having grown up with the Tintin comic books and the occasional animation, then this 2011 CGI animated version was actually quite nice. And although the visuals in this version is very, very different from the original, it was still an entertaining experience.And since this CGI animated movie shows how Tintin and captain Haddock got to meet and team up, it was a nice addition to the Tintin franchise. I must admit that I have been putting this movie off because of the deviance in art style from the original works.The story in this CGI animated movie was fun, action-packed and had something for the entire family. As such, this is a very wholeheartedly movie which can be watched by everyone.While the visual style was very different from earlier works (comic books and older animated movies), then it was really nicely animated and great to look at. Visually, dare I say, this movie was stunning.

They're the masters for a reason...,"Tintin couldn't have been put into better hands than that of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. Both of them confessed lovers of the boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, they knew exactly what to do with what they had and executed it to perfection.Motion capture is a relatively new creation in the film universe, and here it was used as i hope to see it used further in the future, to bring old favourites back into the limelight and remind everyone why they were loved in the first place. It is the best i've seen yet and is almost photo realistic throughout, the acting too helps this along and works with pretty much perfection. The characters seem believable and while there isn't a load of deeply emotional moments, they still get emotions across clearly and strongly, and you can find you connect with them easily, most importantly they seem real and make you care about them. My one issue is that Daniel Craigs accent seemed to fluctuate a bit and in parts simply not fit the character he is portraying.It doesn't tread too far from the average treasure hunt movie, it is all focused on the adventure and the relationships between the main characters. But it find a way of being a league above the run of the mill adventure movie. The set pieces within it are stunning and make for some extremely memorable sequences.The Moffat, Wright, Cornish writing trio, pulled an excellent job of making the film accessible to all audiences, and not resorting to any cheap comedy to maintain the interest, it is a clever sharp script that entertains with complete ease. Even though in my eyes some of the side plots and a couple of separate parts seem a bit under developed and dwindle off into nothing. For example i would have loved to see some more of Thompson and Thomson, as even through the use of motion capture Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have a seamless chemistry between them.It is a rare moment that i would recommend something to be seen in 3D, but due to the fact this is partly animation in a way, it too works very well, and helps you get immersed into the world you are put in. It only has one cheap use of 3D and i see this as to appeal to the younger audiences seeing it, other than that it is used to layer the environment very well and just makes it seem that step more real.Other than a few niggles, this film just goes to show what the masters of cinema can do with the technology around and something they love. With Jackson already confirming he's directing Tintin 2, and Spielberg most likely producing, i'll be first in line to see it, and i would put money on me being the first if we're lucky enough to be treated to a third installment as the plan is currently. As long as they keep the formula they did with this film, i can't see that changing anytime soon. Roll on 2 and 3.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
They're going on an adventure.,"Though it is undeniably spectacular from a technical and aesthetic standpoint, 'The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn (2011)' is ultimately rather hollow and fades from your mind almost as quickly as it enters it. It's adventure for the sake of adventure and, though its action is often truly spectacular and its heart is certainly in the right place, it doesn't do a great job of making you care about its globe-trotting treasure hunt or, indeed, the hunters partaking in it. This issue is, essentially, two-fold. Firstly, the film doesn't actually convey a compelling reason for its investigative events - or, at least, a motive as to why its heroes should be undertaking them - until far too late into its runtime, one set-piece away from its final act. Because of this, the initial two thirds of the affair almost feel like an extended first act, followed by an incredibly rushed second and a strangely unsatisfying third. It's messy, for sure. Secondly, neither Tintin nor Haddock really have a proper sense of character to fill in their well-known outlines. The former is simply 'an inquisitive young boy/ man with a thirst for adventure' and the latter is 'a drunk, unwieldy sea captain'. To be fair, Haddock's alcoholism is typically treated as flaw to be dealt with within his wider arc (although it's sometimes just used to fuel a joke, a plot point or, even, a plane). Even if it isn't deep, it's something. The titular Tintin, on the other hand, just knows what he needs to know more or less when he needs to know it. There's no real reason for him to continue with the journey, nor to really start it in the first place, and he doesn't actually have all that much to do besides be where he needs to be for the story to continue. It's a little bit difficult to describe, I suppose, but he just isn't an interesting protagonist; he's basically a plot device. The villain isn't compelling, either, and the central treasure hunt doesn't exactly rank among the best of its peers. Having said all that, the flick isn't without its merits. As I mentioned up top, it's legitimately spectacular from both a technical and an aesthetic point of view. It takes exaggerated character designs and renders them as realistically as possible, an odd combination that generally works rather well. With complex clothing dynamics, convincing effects simulation (sand and water), advanced environmental destruction and top-quality cinematography, the piece creates its own nearly wholly unique look that truly is a feast for the eyes. At times, it almost looks real. In fact, it makes you wonder why they even bothered to do this as an animation, especially considering that most of it is achieved with motion capture. The truth is, though, that some of this stuff simply isn't possible in live-action. The most obvious segment that this applies to is also the movie's stand-out scene: a complicated one-take action sequence that sees Tintin and company chase down an evil falcon as they're pursued by bad guys and, for some reason, a tank wearing a hotel as a hat. It's a fantastic bit of filmmaking. Not every moment works as well, though. There are several points at which the picture engages in a tug of war with itself, seemingly undecided as to whether it wants to remain realistic (as its lighting, camerawork and general design would suggest) or indulge in unmistakably cartoon-like slapstick. Though a few do just about work, these moments are generally really jarring, raising eyebrows far more often than eliciting laughter. I know it probably sounds as though I don't like the feature, but I do. It's a good film that's technically astounding but narratively weak. Its action is clearly its highlight; it's exciting, energetic and executed almost to perfection. As a whole, however, the story just falls rather flat. It lacks any real substance, basically, which is why it's actually rather forgettable. Still, it's a more-than-decent effort. It's certainly unique, too. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A real work of art. However, to my regret, the magic did not happen today. I felt this movie was more at the level of Peter Jackson's King Kong ... not convincing in the end. I found the story too disorganized and too distant from the original comics series. The pace of the story also did not work for me. It is too action packed and, for a first movie, the characters are not enough 'constructed' to me. There were some good parts but some really bad ones (the Baghard scene with the Castafiore, the fight at the end ...), and not enough funny parts.

Tintin (Jamie Bell) I found to be too irritatingly whiny and Captain Haddock (Andy Sekis) to be an overly obnoxious Scotsman.Tone: A humorous, rather lighthearted, action adventure in the vain of Indiana Jones (so do expect some mature themes and content).SCRIPT: Loosely based off three of Hergé's Tintin comic books, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure.PROS: Incredible CGI and 3-D visuals. Intriguing and enjoyably fun (for the most part).CONS: Unlikeable voices for the two lead characters. Drags out in scenes. Plot loses itself at times with the stellar CGI and 3-D visuals. A few cheap gags.VERDICT: If you liked this film, than watch the cartoon from the 1990's, I still found this film to be enjoyable but the cartoon is still more pleasant to watch. Spielberg and Jackson should have focused on one story instead of three. They portray Haddock a little over the top as an excessive drinker and I find they used him as a gag one too many times to earn some lousy laughs. They tried too hard with making an action packed adventure that they forgot the simplicity of the comics. Having said that I did find the film to be imaginative and nicely interwoven between stories, even though I did not see as necessary. Definitely preview before buying.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie!,My kids said this movie is like watching the Indiana Jones movie for kids. A lot of action!,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually dazzling, but lacking as a film","I went into Tintin with great expectations, I intentionally ignored any trailers or reviews as I wanted to go into the film without any prejudice, unfortunately the film did not live up to my expectations, worse than that, I found it to be an utter bore.First though, the positives. The film is visually spectacular, it's vibrant, detailed and just a joy to behold. The characters are designed wonderfully, almost like they were ripped out of the series and placed into a 3-dimensional world. The 3D, if you decide or are forced to watch it in the format, is great for the most part. There are some shots that stood out as looking spectacular in 3D, in particular a long corridor shot on the ship really impressed me.The direction is also great, throughout the many set-pieces in the film, Spielberg's hand guides us through these scenes with flair, and you can tell he's taken advantage of the format with some wonderfully creative shots.On to the negative, and in my opinion they outweigh the positive.The film feels jumbled and at times I felt like I was dragged kicking and screaming into the next bombastic and usually unnecessary set-piece. There were so many chases, escapes and battles there was never going to be time for character development, let alone a story that could be told well. Let's not forget that this film will be an introduction to Tintin for many people, and action fans will lap it up. More discerning film- goers with a desire for something a little more substantial will leave disappointed.To me, one of the most important parts of the series is the relationship between Haddock and Tintin, and it is not well developed in the film, a real missed opportunity in my opinion. The film really dragged, which was a huge disappointment for me. I was relieved once it was over, but I hope it makes enough moolah for a superior sequel to be made.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not anywhere near as good as the books, but quite entertaining nonetheless","I love the Tintin comics and have done so since I was in Primary School. I remember that I would scour the shelves in the fiction section of the library looking for books that I have not read, and attempting to get my hands on those that I have not read. To date I believe that the only comic I have not read would be 'Tintin in the Land of the Soviets' though I also believe that I may not have read 'Tintin in the Congo' as the only version I ever remember was one in German, and my research has revealed that both were not translated into English until after Herge's death.Tintin is a Belgium reporter who goes on quite a few wonderful adventures throughout his career. While the first couple of comics involved him simply as a reporter traveling to foreign lands, since the Cigars of the Pharaohs, he evolved into an independent crime fighter, and slowly grew a number of allies around himself. The Thompson Twins (two bumbling detectives labeled the greatest detectives in the world), Captain Haddock, an alcoholic retired sea captain, and Professor Cuthbert Calculus, a rather eccentric scientist who is a little hard of hearing in one ear. The Thompson Twins and Captain Haddock appear in the movie, but the books upon which the movie is based appear before Calculus is introduced into the series, so as is understandable, does not make an appearance. Obviously, there is his loyal Terrier Snowy.This movie is based on two of the books, Secret of the Unicorn and Crab with the Golden Claws. While at first I thought that it was only Secret of the Unicorn, after Tintin was kidnapped and woke up on a ship, it became clear that the plot had moved away from the original book and had incorporated a second one. After the film, I sat down and watched both of them from the cartoon series, and of course my suspicions were confirmed. However, it does not faithfully stick with those two books. In the book Sacarin is a minor character what appears a couple of times, however in the film he turns out not only to be the villain, but is also the descendant of the Haddock family's arch-enemy Red Rackham. This never appears in the book nor is the Haddock family curse.The difficulty with making the film would be trying to find out which would be the best book to turn into the film, considering that there are (I believe) over twenty of them. To somebody new to Tintin, it would be very difficult to make one of the later books into a film since there is a lot of backstory involved, and while my favourite would be Cigars of the Pharoahs, it appears that they wanted to have Haddock make a major appearance in the film, which does not happen in that particular book.I could go on for a while picking it to pieces, but I really do not want to do that because I did enjoy the film. They did capture the adventurous nature of the Tintin books quite well, though I could see a lot of Spielberg's influence in it (which is not surprising because he is the director). While I never consider Spielberg films to be really high on my list (I will never get the six hours back that I spent watching Close Encounters – twice) he does make entertaining adventure films, as the three Indiana Jones movies testify (not counting the fourth, which I suspect not many people do) and The Adventures of Tintin does not disappoint. However, being the purist that I am, I always find myself wanting to go back to the books themselves, as they are so much more entertaining (particularly with Snowy's dry comments).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Didn't Disapoint,"I've watched Tintin throughout my entire childhood, and this movie is the cherry on top. Steven Spielberg was the right man to make this movie as good as this was: entertaining, funny, adventurous; Tintin-like. The graphics and the visuals were spectacular, whilst every character shined the way they supposed to be. Highly recommend to Tintin lovers and even to those who've never heard of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Rollicking Adventure For The Kids (Or The Kid In All Of Us),"Though not a movie I would usually be drawn too (it looked a bit unabashedly ""kiddie"" for my tastes), it came highly recommend from a family member obsessed with Spielberg filmmaking. I gave it a try and, while it won't top any of my ""best-of"" lists, it did provide a great deal of adventure, drama, action, and humor, pleasantly surprising me in the process.For a basic plot summary, ""Adventures of Tintin"" focuses on the young Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell), a kind of Indiana Jones-type adventurer along with trusty sidekick dog Snowy. When young Tintin buys a model ship at an auction one day, he is suddenly thrust into a race for treasure involving a drunken sea captain (voice of Andy Serkis) and his nefarious foe (voice of Daniel Craig).I would say that the long-lasting effects of this film will be two-fold:First, I would still categorize it as very much a children's movie. It could probably best be described as ""Indiana Jones for the elementary set"" in terms of its combination of all genre elements. Had I first viewed this film as a child, I know that I would have watched it again and again! For adults, of course, it also functions as escapism.Also, the somewhat controversial animation (is this middle ground needed between reality and Pixar-like animation?) is truly a sight to behold. I honestly am not any sort of expert on the subject and thus have no predictions for the future of the format, but the visuals are as top- notch as anything you'll see anywhere else. It is just...different.Overall, ""Adventures of Tintin"" just seems like Spielberg's childhood epic. Perhaps the film can be appreciated even more if one has read the comic novel stories it is based on (I didn't even know about this until after the viewing!). On the whole, though, a very entertaining flick that makes for great family viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Non-Stop Fun Makes ""Tin-Tin"" a Winner","I'll first admit that I knew very little about Tin Tin going in, and have never read any of the stories - therefore, I am reviewing this strictly as a standalone film and not as an adaptation.Spielberg's latest (aside from ""War Horse"") is nothing but carefree fun and excitement from start to finish, never waning or dragging its feet - a true roller-coaster ride. The film is basically a series of clues leading to a series of chases and cliffhangers, all perfectly laced with moments of humor and whimsy, making for a concoction that both children and adults can enjoy. The mystery itself is not all that interesting, but it is told with such vigor and spectacle that you don't really notice or care (and if you do, you're watching it for the wrong reasons). The film is simply meant to entertain - as pure as adventure can get, and nobody knows how to film an adventure story quite like Steven Spielberg. His trademark uses of lighting and clever transitions are all present, and the look and feel of the film all has a familiar tone (reminiscent of the Indiana Jones films most obviously).As far as looks are concerned, the film is gorgeous, and probably the best motion-capture rendering to date (in that the entire film is motion-captured; I am not comparing this to ""Avatar""). The colors pop, the 3D is adequate, and the characters and settings are so lifelike they sometimes looked real - I never saw any of the infamous soullessness that the motion-capture method has become stigmatized with. Simply put: a visual feast. The actors do a great job as well, delivering their lines with gusto and an optimistic innocence missing from most films today; the artists did a fantastic job capturing their subtleties and mannerisms.John Williams also delivers a suitable, spirited score (although not particularly original: a blend of ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the Indiana Jones theme).Overall, the film was a blast - a good old fashioned adventure romp with no real consequences or depth, but simple and pure. Some have labeled it as forgettable, which I couldn't disagree more. As I said earlier, the story itself is not particularly gripping, but the style in which it is told paired with the impressive animation and thrilling, roller-coaster-like action set pieces is what makes ""Tin-Tin"" something I could watch over and over again.If I did not address issues other reviewers have highlighted, that is because I do not find fault in them. If you can't have fun at this film then you've lost, as Tin-Tin would say, your thirst for adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A promising start to a potentially great new film-series.,"Personally I never have been a too big fan of the whole Tintin franchise. Neither the comics or television series could ever appeal to me and I was never too big on its premise, characters or visual style. I therefore could also never really understand Spielberg's fascination and passion for the franchise. However having seen this movie I can perhaps understand it. The time period and settings are all perfectly adventurous and the movie offers plenty of entertainment.The way I see it; this movie is a great first introduction of its characters to the world and its showcasing the many possibilities of making Tintin into a long running series of adventurous movies. Potentionaly it really could become a great, quality series, that will offer entertainment to many, for many years to come. As things are looking now, there will be at least two more Tintin movies but why stop after that really? With its motion capture and other computer techniques, the possibilities for the series are literally endless. They could do whatever they want with it and can get as crazy as they want to. Even when the actors will be too old for their roles they could still play them, since the movie and all of its characters come entirely out of the computer.And yes, the animation is way better than I could had ever anticipated. with one movie, Spielberg succeeds at what Robert Zemeckis has tried to do for years; creating a good- but above all, realistic motion capture movie. The movie is incredibly smooth and wonderful looking, especially with its stunning backgrounds. But also the characters themselves are quite flawless. The way they move around, their expressions, it's all like you're watching a real movie!This is also thanks to the professionalism of all of its actors. Andy Serkis is of course the go to guy, when it comes down to motion capture acting but with this movie he is once more showing his incredible range and versatility as an actor, playing Captain Haddock. You might not even know its him, since he's speaking with a fat Scottish accent. There are way more actors in this movie that you might not even recognize. Daniel Craig as the main villain, Jamie Bell as Tintin, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thomson and Thompson. Would you honestly know it where them, when looking at their performances or listen to their voices? They of course also look nothing like themselves, since they play characters based on well known comic book characters, though eventually in the movie they still like more human than cartoons.I actually think it was a great move to go for a realistic approach, as far as regarding the movie its look. I always feared that the movie would be far too cartoon like looking, with exaggerated colors and typical cartoon looking characters. But as it turned out, all of the characters are very human looking, with only some slightly exaggerated big noses, which was distinctive for Hergé's, the creator of Tintin, drawing style of its characters. Perhaps the only real still cartoon like looking character in this movie is Snowy the dog.With its exotic and far off locations, its John Williams musical score, the time period its set in and its many action, this movie does definitely feel like an Indiana Jones movie at times. Especially the action stands out, even though it goes far too over-the-top at times but you could of course 'blame' this on the simple fact that the movie got based on comic books. Spielberg finally even gets to show his love for the good old swashbuckler genre, by throwing a couple of spectacular sequences, involving pirates and some good old fashioned sword fights.Yet I don't really regard this movie as perfect entertainment, since the story still seems to be lacking a bit. I actually had a hard time following the story and things got quite messy at times. There is not always a good flow to it, though the movie also never starts to get truly bad or boring, or anything like that at all. It's just that a better written, or better constructed way of storytelling, could had improved this movie significantly. Seems they were more focused on getting the technology and looks for the movie right, rather than its story. So who knows, maybe for its sequels the movies will feature a slightly better written and more tight story in it, since they already clearly know how to get the visuals right and know what the possibilities with its technology are.So it's not the perfect entertaining movie but still a great and promising start to a series, that potentially could become a wonderful- and long running one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A triumph,"Prior to seeing this movie on DVD at BounceU Child's Entertainment Center in Horsham (may that location now rest in peace) when I was little, I had never heard of Tintin, and had never seen the original cartoons or read the original comics. But I've been rewatching it ever since I got it on Blu-Ray combo pack for Christmas a bunch of years ago, and now that I know my brother and dad had seen it in theaters while my mom and I were down in Baltimore, why hadn't I been taken to see it at some point when it was in theaters?!This is an incredible and delightful movie, and it's one of my favorites for a variety of reasons:Visually, this movie is DAZZLING. The animation is easily some of the best motion-capture animation since The Polar Express (a sublime Christmas classic, and the very first animated movie ever to use this animation style). Because Steven Spielberg implemented the character designs from the original comics (just as Robert Zemeckis did with The Polar Express, since the characters in that movie strikingly matched the illustrations in Chris Van Allsburg's original book), all of the humans, including Tintin himself, are all photorealistic without looking uncanny, and the animals, especially Tintin's dog, Snowy, are really lifelike. The set pieces are extravagant and wonderful to look at, and there's one very special touch on Spielberg's part that adds to it all: the genius, extraordinary shots and editing, with special mention going to the 2-minute-long chase sequence through Baghaar for the scrolls, done in ONE SINGLE TRACKING SHOT!Not to mention, all the characters are excellent, and well-written. Tintin is very resourceful, charming, optimistic and heroic. Snowy is such a smart, loyal dog. However, Captain Haddock is by far my favorite character. He's extremely entertaining, quotable and easily the funniest character in the movie. Sakharrine is an excellent, vile villain, who you're just bound to love to hate. And of course, detectives Thomson and Thompson are very funny and enjoyable, helped along by their utter incompetence, and cluelessness (pun intended).In regards to the acting, everybody is perfectly suited to their role. Jamie Bell does a fantastic job of playing the hero as Tintin. Andy Serkis, donning a hilarious Scottish accent, is fittingly comical as Haddock. Daniel Craig, known for his knack for playing excellent villains, delivers on his area of expertise as Sakharrine.And then, as always, there's the incredible musical score by musical god John Williams, who always delivers a quality score, especially when he's working on a Spielberg movie. Special mention goes to the clever composition for the opening credit sequence, and the heroic main theme for Tintin and especially Haddock.And along with all the thrills that can hold one's attention for a long time, this movie has PERFECT comedic timing, and never fails to make me laugh when it needs to (especially with the ""fire in a boat"" sequence)!10/10: The Adventures of Tintin is a visually magnificent, perfectly done and very enjoyable movie from start to finish, and I highly recommend it. For the first animated movie that he's ever directed, Steven Spielberg outdid himself on this one!(Edited 8/9/23: I take back everything I said in the first paragraph! Actually, we all went to see it in theaters together RIGHT AFTER my mom and I got back from Baltimore, so I DID get to see it in theaters. So, obviously, my memory is a little faulty.)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Steven Spielberg does justice to Herge's creation with The Adventures of Tintin,"When I was a kid during the late '70s, I was familiar with a magazine called ""Children's Digest"". During that time, the publication had inside its monthly pages a serialized comic that featured a boyish hero named Tintin of which the first I had read was the middle part of ""The Secret of the Unicorn"". That story would continue the following year as ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" of which I managed to read all the way through. And so it is about four decades later that having remembered those adventures, I decided to go with my movie theatre-working friend to watch Steven Spielberg's motion capture version of this adaptation of Belgian cartoonist Herge's creation. It had the great sense of humor and entertaining action sequences one would expect from the director of the Indiana Jones spectacles and while the last action set-piece may have been one too many, it wasn't a complete waste of time. And seeing characters like Tintin, his dog Snowy, Captain Haddock, and the comic relief detectives of Thompson and Thomson brought a big smile to my face in the way they were depicted. Also kudos to frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams for providing another entertaining music score (though it's not as memorable as his classic ones for Jaws, the original '77 Star Wars, E.T., and the aforementioned Raiders, that's for sure). Really, Spielberg's done it again! So on that note, The Adventures of Tintin is highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg+Jackson=Epic,"As a fan of Hergé's comic book series, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Andy Serkis, this film was a must see for me. And I wasn't disappointed! It was fun, action packed, enjoyable, well made and had a great score by John Williams.The story's basically a bunch of Tintin comics merged in one epic adventure, but it's mostly based on 'The Secret of the Unicorn' (and possibly the sequel will be 'The Treasure of Red Rackham!) and it has some great little treats for the fan-boys. The motion capture technology really delivered, the characters looked amazing, halfway into the movie I even forgot I was watching animation.Andy Serkis did a really good job, I loved him as Captain Haddock, who was my favorite character in the comics too. The storyline was great, lot of funny scenes and lines, I had a great time at the movies.

Crammed with action sequences,"I entered the cinema hall and the credits started and immediately there was an action sequence in the first five minutes. There is no building of characters or story. At the beginning itself it seems that half the story is over and we are seeing the second part.No story building. The director has no qualms. He plunges straight to the action scenes without telling any story. Coming to the characters, Tintin isn't that striking. The range of face expressions are very limited and get boring from the start of the film. Also they have mixed two to three stories of the comics and even then they can't get the story right. Captain Haddock, such a humorous and inimitable character has been turned into irritable and childish puppet. It's so sad that they messed up. Why are they so hell bent on including so many action scenes one after another. Anyone who read the comics and loves them is in store of a great disappointment.They have missed the dumbness of Thomson and Thompson, the wittiness of captain haddock and the cleverness of Tintin. All they have done is churn out another movie which follows the Hollywood formula. Sad as it is that they have turned a lovable story into one of their escapist movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring and mislead story,"It is flaws and boring movie for me as a big fan of Tintin. Though I know every Tintin's cartoon movies didn't show the exact lines as it is in the book, but this one is completely unbelievable. The most unacceptable thing is the antagonist Sakharine, where suppose to be Murray who's the one that fighting for the treasures. Sakharine known only one of the man who stole Tintin's model, and later his parchment also stolen by Murray. Not even Murray's name mentioned in this movie.Combining three books into one might be interesting for people who doesn't familiar with Tintin. But combination of three books that split far from its originality, could make a mislead.I put 4 out of 10 votes, because the quality of the 3D animations are incredibly great.

True to the comic books,"I was an avid reader of the Tintin comic books as a youngster and I also watched some of the first cartoons of it. After seeing the trailers on TV, I told my wife that we had to see the movie (she has never heard of Tintin). The movie was awesome! It was true to the comics, the CGI graphics were amazing, the 3d effect was cool, lots of excitement with added humor. One thing that I noticed was that Tintin seemed to look like he's in his late teens or early twenties. While in the comics I've always perceived him to be in his mid to early teens. Also, Tintin seemed to have a serious demeanor about him in the movie, whereas in the comics he seemed more jovial. Nevertheless, this is a must watch if you were a Tintin comics reader or not (my wife wasn't and she still enjoyed the film).

"High on heart, low on story","Young and confident investigative journalist Tintin (Jamie Bell) purchases a model boat of the Unicorn, a three-masted sailing ship, from a market, only to be approached by the sinister looking Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who offers him triple the amount he paid for it. He refuses and, along with his trusty dog Snowy, takes the ship home, only to unwittingly coming across a cryptic note that was preserved with the model that mentions a secret involving the mysterious ship and a family line called the Haddocks. Tintin is kidnapped and taken aboard the ship of Sakharine where he finds the drunken Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), locked in a room with only whisky for company. The two must combine their wits and unravel the mystery of the messages which may lead to them to secret treasure.The original comic books by Belgian artist Herge, and eventual cartoon series that came from it, have a huge dedicate and passionate fan base that were both eagerly awaiting and dreading Steven Spielberg's re- imagining. Not being a fan myself, I would imagine the fans would be happy with this effort, as although the look of Tintin is certainly very different, the old-school feel of the original works is certainly there. The film combines three old Tintin stories - The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure. This is possibly the film's biggest floor, as although it certainly looks amazing, and the film has a definite nostalgia-tainted, labour-of-love feel, the story just isn't up to scratch.The performance-capture animation is without doubt the most close-to- life I've ever come across. It captures every facial movement and the subtle expressions that allow the actors performance to come through the CGI. Jamie Bell injects a likability into a hero that might have come across as an annoying know-it-all. But the film really belongs to Serkis. Now a veteran of the whole motion-capture malarkey, his Captain Haddock allows him to show what he can do as an actor. He gets all the best lines and is involved in the more memorable scenes, notably when he's had a drink or two.Thank God for the performances then as the plot has a lot to answer for. Combining the blockbuster minds of Spielberg, Peter Jackson, and long- time Spielberg collaborator Kathleen Kennedy, it's quite shocking that this is the best they can come up with. These are the people responsible for some of the best works in the mega-bucks department - E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Jurassic Park (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - which all combined great storytelling, genuine passion, film-making know-how, and some old fashioned cinematic magic. Where Tintin certainly has the passion, the story just seems wafer-thing and very un-movie like, so to speak.Understandably, they wanted to keep the adaptation close to Herge's original vision, but I just felt like I was watching an extended episode of the cartoon series that happened to have some very expensive animation. There is one notable set-piece, which involves Tintin, Haddock and Snowy fighting Sakharine at high speed for the last clue that may lead them to the Unicorn treasure, that would have been near- impossible if filmed in live-action. This scene, if anything, promotes the use of motion capture to take film-making to new levels, but it also happens to be amazingly choreographed and executed. But apart from that scene, the film never give me the shiver down the spine or got my pulse racing like the aforementioned films certainly did.There is a lot to like about the film, however. The most annoying thing about the original cartoons were the Thompson and Thomson twins (here played by newly-appointed Spielberg bum-chums Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), and here they are given little more than extended cameo roles, and it's clear that they're best enjoyed in small doses. Craig is fun as the villain, although his character is rather one-dimensional and thinly-written. It's also fun to spot the little winks and homages to the originals, that includes a truly brilliant introduction to Tintin. Hopefully when the inevitable sequel comes along, Spielberg can take the passion from this and put it into a better story. But this is satisfying enough for the time being.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Special and Perhaps Magical Animated Comic Story,"1 January 2012. One of the best animated adaptations to the full theatrical screen of a comic strip character and storyline. The technology has arrived at a point along with the strong script that resonates with its original cartoon material. Perhaps almost overly long with an almost forced condensing of an immense amount of material of three of the series stories, the film nevertheless manages to create a magical experience that neither live action films based on human characters in a real world nor the fantasy animation of animated characters can reproduce. In the best of both worlds, Tin Tin can feature amazing physical action that audience are willing to suspect their disbelief and experience almost Disneyland spectacular ride for themselves. At the same time the film effectively captures both the spirit and the personality of the original cartoon strips themselves. The transformation to film is somewhat more dark, at times, and physically intense than the more passive colored flat 2-D images on the page. Whether or not the animated technology will subsume the live actor performances within a decade is another matter.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again,"There was a time where kids found entertainment by reading the daily comics or even buying them at the local bookstore, awaiting the adventures of their favorite superhero. ""Tintin"" was my childhood favorite, and although it wasn't in English when I read it, they were (and still are) extremely exciting and humorous page-turners.I've always awaited the next one, but I was disappointed when I found out that the comics were old and that the author had already died. I wasn't disappointed that they were old, heavens, no - I was disappointed that there were no more adventures of that intrepid reporter, his faithful dog, and his wide variety of friends and enemies that always makes for such an exciting read. Years later the 1991 animated series popped up on Cartoon Network Asia, and it was a fixture for me. The series is brilliant - as loyal as a Belgian animated series could be. I've always thought that if Hollywood decides to make a movie, the only person who could've done it and pulled it off was Steven Spielberg (""Indiana Jones"" took inspiration not only from James Bond but also from Tintin).Flash forward to 2011. Spielberg was directing, and both he and ""Lord of the Rings"" Peter Jackson are producing it. I became hugely excited. Despite knowing that it was going to be filmed in 3D animation, I walked into the (2D) theater with high expectations. And despite its flaws and slight deviations from Herge's comics, I was not disappointed. There was a sigh of relief - a ringing thought that kept saying ""Spielberg has done it.""""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a great film for the family to be on the edge of their seats. The plot is ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" dashed in with bits of ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". The mystery and intrigue are combined with engaging and at times outrageous/hilarious action sequences - one of which is a seamless, spectacular one-take chase scene which exudes a high energy level not sensed since those in the ""Indiana Jones"" films - there's a real high sense of adventure throughout the film. The effects are top notch and apparently show the best of motion-capture technology - it is so good that I forgot that I was watching merely animated characters and that I was watching a comic book unfold on the big screen. Spielberg and Jackson have triumphed with the motion capture here, making Robert Zemeckis' previous runs with the technology look pale in comparison. Crisp and colorful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, fluid editing by Michael Kahn and yet another lively and bombastic score by John Williams make this an even more entertaining watch.As for the good (motion capture) acting, Jamie Bell captures the Tintin character nicely. His look and speech is there - as well as his sense for intrigue. Andy Serkis is wonderful as the grizzled Captain Haddock - his comic timing and gruff voice perfectly embodies the character - although there are moments which makes the character too goofy, even more than his comic counterpoint. I didn't even realize it was Daniel Craig as the voice of the villain Sakharine with a slight dastardly sneer in his voice. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost don't get enough screen time as the dim-witted twin detectives Thomson and Thompson but their silliness matches the comics' counterparts but I feel it is not as humorous as when I first read it. They get the job done, though.Somehow I don't like plots which are cobbled up from lots of different plots into one. They just don't blend together nicely, and this film is no exception - this being its biggest flaw. Right from the start of the movie (after the stylish beginning credits similar to Spielberg's own ""Catch Me If You Can"") the film never really focuses on its characters and goes straight for the mystery and the story. Haddock even takes center stage in many scenes instead of the titular Tintin. The characterization is at the mercy of the action-packed spectacles, and heart-pounding intrigue. It's a shame because the characters are interesting by itself - intelligent and spontaneous (Tintin and Snowy), cantankerous (Haddock), dastardly (Sakharine), silly (Thomson and Thompson), but not insulting to the audience nor stereotyped. If the film had 20 extra minutes devoted to its characters, then we just might have the first CG-animated motion capture classic. It's a bit of a shame, really.Despite it's flaws, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a rollicking good time at the movies, a serial adventure with lots of action, excitement and humor, and perfect for families with its lack of adult content (apart from alcohol content and some intense action sequences). The effects are seamless and easy on the eyes (haven't seen the 3D version yet - though I've heard its very good). This is truly a Spielberg film - his entertainment sense still going strong.For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again, fists clenched during the action sequences. Yet the characterization and their motives do not get their due, but I suspect that this was merely a way to introduce the world of Tintin to today's fast-paced audiences, and predicting that if they loved it, the characterization will be put into the sequels. Something like that. Maybe. Here's hoping.It isn't as brilliant as the comics or the TV show but you could do much worse than ""Tintin"", because at least it doesn't have pointless action, choppy editing or shaky camera to ruin the effects; or cardboard, stereotyped characters to chew the scenery. ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or ""Transformers"" anyone?Overall rating: 80/100",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A crime the sequels haven't been made,"The greatest filmmakers of all time collaborate on the greatest blueball of all time - the first entry in a planned trilogy that, in true Spielberg form, stuck the landing in visuals, plot, character... only to be cruelly forgotten to the sands of time. One can only hope and pray that a worthy sequel will someday rise from the ashes.That being said, taken on its own, this film is a beautiful, exciting, unique gem that wonderfully captures the fantastical allure of the comics. And while it's a shame the sequels were never made, this standalone entry deftly spans so many different locations, plotlines, and important character beats that it remains a perfectly satisfying experience on its own. If you're looking for a clean, exciting, beautiful, classic cinematic romp, this movie will not disappoint!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent,"This movie is really excellent. More like an Indiana Jones movie really it grips the viewer from start to finish and you leave the cinema feeling uplifted and better about humanity. Both Tintin's dog and the people in this movie are better than people in real life and that makes it a splendid story. I'm not sure where Hergé got his storytelling drive from but he sure was an excellent storyteller. In another review a user said that the story has been changed but that seems fairly useless to say because the movie does not claim to be an adaption of one comic-book but rather to be based on the whole series. Moreover, the story is quite good, I think. Naturally, it would be logical to adapt Tintin to this modern-day martial artist Bruce Lee/James Bond type of character but actually this is not the case. In the movie he remains the Tintin we know and love from the great comic-books.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very wonderful Tintin adventure,"A brave young reporter, Tintin, and his loyal dog, Snowy, go on an adventure in search of a ship carrying hidden treasures from Captain Haddock's ancestors.Tintin's adventure story is an interesting and popular children's story. Being made into a movie becomes a must-watch fim. The Adventure of Tintin delivers animated visuals that are so smooth and perfect. Every detail given looks neat and real. Especially with the interesting and cool transition effect. Not only does The Adventure of Tintin provide an exciting adventure story, but the visual effects are also an attraction and a strength of this film. Interesting story plot with a series of adventures full of exciting action. A perfect and fitting mystery story to perform. The comedy presented is also a counterbalance to Tintin's adventure story.Under Steven Spielberg's cold hands, tintin's animated films are second to none. The visual appearance is truly sleek and extraordinary. An adventure story that really comes across as complex. For the voice actors in this film for me it fits perfectly and fits. Andy Serkis' deep voice in playing Captain Haddock was excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Okay,"Okay but is really a kid's movie. I grew up reading the Tintin books and the movie is fairly true to the books. However, as an adult the story is quite one-dimensional and really is just an average adventure.CGI is very good, but the 3D seemed unnecessary. 3D doesn't add anything and is often not even apparent.Worth watching only if you need something to keep the kids busy or if, like me, you enjoyed Tintin as a kid and are curious to see what Spielberg has done to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring and Predictable.,"The animation in Tin Tin is exceptional. Very impressive; however, that does not a movie make. My uncle is a really, really snappy dresser but one of the most boring public speakers that I've ever heard even though he looks good. The same thing applies here. There is very little plot and almost no dialogue. The whole movie is a chase scene. Did you see Casino Royale? It opened with that fantastic chase scene between Bond and the Haitian? It was riveting! They were up and down construction equipment, flying through and over walls, it was breathtaking. Tin Tin is that scene for a whole movie and while that might seem like a compliment, it is not. Twenty minutes into the movie you find yourself saying, ""Enough already...okay...I get it..."" It got very old, very quickly. I found my mind wandering and looking at the animation of the ocean and the boats and other things that were well done. Boring, boring, boring. Kids will probably like it but that doesn't make it a good movie. Go watch a Pixar movie again.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Comments from the Totally Uninitiated,"I guess I went into this with very little background. I know my son owned a collection of Tin Tin comics when he was younger. I know that this is really a significant character to a great many people. Hence, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" the portrayal of these figures is going to bring angry disappointment to a segment of our viewers. Personally, if we were to take away the amazing animation and substitute real people, this story would be like a hundred others I have seen. It is the Saturday Morning serial portrayal of a reluctant hero who finds himself in incredible scrapes. What bothered me is that I never really cared. When I saw Hugo (a contemporary of this film), I was able to identify with the central figure, and though he was an animated character, I still cared about what happens to him. I'm sure people will see my criticisms as unfair because this is more Indiana Jones than a subtle story strong on character development. I just never felt connected.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolute masterpiece!,"Never dull for a moment, this rollercoaster of fun, humorous and thrilling adventurous moments. Stunning mixture of several Tintin stories in one movie.
Can't find any errors or and flaws on this work of art. The picture was made with a revolutionairy, new computer program and carefully executed and built. Packed with tons of exciting scenes and the climax with the Bagghar chase which is something extraordinairy and one-of-kind. Instant classic!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece. I'm not too familiar with the original Tintin comics, but I know everyone involved in this movie had high regards to the original works and to the artis Hergé. The animation is out of this world (2011!!). What craftsmanship! What details! What adventure! A must see! And please, make several more Tintin movies in the same spirit. There are many more books to draw inspiration from. And maybe this isn't Spielberg's most known movie, you clearly see his mastery. No spoilers here folks. The characters is spot on. Great humor, and the flow, the action and rhythm is just ... top notch! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's see what Jackson does with this,"Highly anticipated film especially in the French speaking world. First, visually the film is amazing. The true to life reproduction of Hergé's universe is without reproach. The original story taken from unrelated stories in the series is also very interesting. We were well warned and is easily accepted. We really get the impression of seeing a whole new adventure without knowing what will come next. What comes next, are characters that are underdeveloped. This is particularly true of the two main heroes, Tintin and Haddock. The exception here might be Snowy. We don't find the essence of their personalities so well defined trough the 24 albums of the series. Where are all of Haddock's unique expressions? This original story is full of totally impossible situations that the albums never reached, which unfolds at a frightening pace. Finally, I found the humour sparse and not really that funny. It's obvious that the market aimed for are the young video game playing boys. If this film brings a whole new generation to Hergé's universe, that would be a good thing. The next film of the series is likely to be closer to the essence of Tintin, as Peter Jackson will be the director. He is admittedly a Tintin fan since his childhood. Spielberg came to Tintin in his late thirties, after being told of a vague resemblance to a well-known archaeologist.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The adventures of Tintin,"What begins as a fun, nimble little mystery in the first act soon kicks into comedy-action-adventure high gear when junior reporter Tintin, with his brave dog Snowy, stumbles upon boozy Captain Haddock (an excellent Andy Serkis), whose family legacy may prove pivotal in a race to uncover the secret of the Unicorn.From that point on, it's more or less non-stop comedy-some fizzles, most of it works-with gags ranging from jaw-dropping blockbuster chase antics to throwaway background humour. Captain Haddock works brilliantly for the most part: he's unpredictable, endearing, and colourful in all the ways Tintin himself isn't. While the youngster is well played by Jamie Bell, he's mostly just there to work out the clues for the audience. Tintin and Haddock make for a good double-act, though: brains and brawn, cunning and in-over-his-head rashness; together they'd make a good Indiana Jones.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adventure and discovery is Tintin!,"I remember from the comics (in French) that Tintin was an adventurer and traveller! Watching this film definitely captures the mystery of travel, adventure and discovery!Some fans of the comics may like this movie and some are. I personally decided to watch it in French (since I know the language and The comics were originally in French) and the voices, personalities, strengths and flaws are spot on what I imagined them to be. Every single thing about this movie is excellent; the animation, the fact that they put 3 comics into one story, the action, the humour, the suspense, etcHats off to the creators and directors of this film.

Bad interpretation of the original books,A very boring animation. No real action that engages the viewer. I loved Tintin stories but this is not an interesting interpretation of the original!!!! Big disappointment for us!!!!!!!!!!!! Suggesting Spilsburg stick to his action/ adventure movies and leave the animations to those who know how to make it. My husband and I wanted to even leave the movie theater since I could not keep ourselves awake. A bad movie does that to you. I am not sure how people could give this movie such high rating.

In my opinion, Steven Spielberg has made amazing animation for this movie. This can be seen from the animation of water. The plot for this movie is not bad. Steven Spielberg has shown how clever Tin-tin and his dog, snowy. Like the another movie about detective, The Adventures of Tintin also has given us clues how to solve the puzzle. overall for this movie is good. Captain Haddock also had a important role to help Tintin to solve the problems, although he also make Tintin ""busy"" because of him. this movie had a humors scene, serious scene, and action scene.I think this film is worth to be watched for Tintin Lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Fine Mess,"A kidnapping and a mutiny kick off the start of what becomes a dangerous and profitable journey for that most famous of Belgian boy detectives and his loyal fox terrier, Snowy.What you get in the end is minor Spielberg and minor Tintin. At least its heart is in the right place.As a drink-plagued captain with a bulbous nose tells his young friend: ""You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.""Here's hoping they follow their own advice and come up with a long- awaited sequel!Revisiting the joys of childhood can be a perilous experience, and so it proves here, even if what's good outweighs what's bad. Director Steven Spielberg serves up an enjoyable lark of a cartoon adventure featuring that marvel of European comics, Tintin. If it lacks the cohesion and charm of Hergé's original, it keeps you in your seat till the end.Spielberg's enthusiasm and talent is on bright display. Too bad the film veers more in the direction of his old ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" than Tintin himself. This adventure involves three lost scrolls which together present a key to finding a great treasure. To get them, Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his new friend, Captain Haddock (a note-perfect Andy Serkis) will have to brave the wiles of the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig), a ""sour-faced man with a sugary name.""I'm not a fan of motion-capture animation, even well-done animation such as this, which is presented with a nod to Hergé's ""clear-line"" style. Colors are deliciously bright, with a strong sense of depth and detail in every frame. Yet the adjustment from print to film medium gives the original characters a whiff of the grotesque.After some opening credits that employ the clear-line style as well as a John Williams score and animation that seems a nod in the direction of Spielberg's classic beginning to ""Catch Me If You Can,"" we are dropped quickly into our fast-moving story. Hergé himself pops up to say the first line of dialogue, seemingly blessing the enterprise with his presence, before Tintin finds himself in a case of mast distraction involving a search for a missing piece of a ship model.This opening section is so enjoyable you wish it could continue forever. It does last a while, all the way up to the point where Tintin and Haddock fly a seaplane in the desert wastes of Bagghar. There's a couple of welcome appearances from the Thom(p)sons (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and some harrowing battles that allow the director to recycle old tricks in motion-capture form.Humor, too. Asked if he can fly a plane, Tintin replies: ""I interviewed a pilot once!"" Haddock and Snowy later vie for a drop of the hard stuff in zero-G, a film highlight.After that, Indiana Jones takes over. The result is too crowded and chaotic by half. In a March 2015 review here, jc-osms describes his ""battle fatigue"" with some of the setpiece action scenes, and I heartily concur. As dams burst and derricks clash, Hergé's gentler approach is missed.But ""The Adventures Of Tintin"" did connect with audiences, especially outside Spielberg's native land. That provides motive for a long-promised sequel, hopefully involving second-unit director and co-producer Peter Jackson, who unlike Spielberg grew up reading Tintin and will perhaps invest a film with more of the original spirit, like he did with his Tolkien adaptations.As it is, I don't think the film stands well enough on its own to be remembered. But as a foundation stone, it could yet prove the start of something quite grand and fun for generations of Tintin fans yet unborn.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin delivers an exciting action/mystery flick.,"I enjoyed watching this recreation of Tintin's The Secret of the Unicorn. The voice performances made me care for their trouble and made the mystery engaging to be part of. It also changed my opinion about the motion capture animation style.To begin with, you must know that it doesn't deliver a movie completely true to the comic book, because some characters have been given pretty big roles despite minor roles in the source material. Fans will perhaps feel offended by these changes, but I am forgiving, because what we got was an exciting take on the characters we love.I am still impressed by how Red Rackham's involvement with Captain Haddock is portrayed. It really kept my eyes glued to the screen just like many of the other action scenes. They can be pretty intense.It makes for an action-packed mystery with great voice performances to keep you engaged and entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Incredible adventure,"The Adventures of Tintin finds director Steven Spielberg remixing his Indiana Jones magic to deliver the best Indiana Jones film since the Last Crusade. This pretty much assembles the Avengers of nerd cinema behind the camera and includes a few of their frequent collaborators in front as well and the sense of fun everyone is having is highly infectious. It proves that no one can make these like Steven Spielberg.Jamie Bell has to be the one person playing it straight so everyone else can have fun and he does a fantastic job, especially because he spends a lot of the film with Andy Serkis who is having an absolute ball and has an impressive Scottish accent. Daniel Craig shows that he can play a villain just as effortlessly as his heroic leading man roles and Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are a reliably solid comedic double act who sound identical here.Steven Spielberg's direction finds a strong rhythm straight away and he fully embraces the medium of animation. The transitions and one takes are a constant highlight and the penultimate chase through Bagghar contains an all time great one take. The animation itself is nowhere near as uncanny as a lot of the other animated movies that go for a more realistic look thanks to the softer edges and desire to homage a more classical style.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Its dragging and downright boring compared to the true version that is the book.However if you are new to the Tiitin title you will enjoy this film.In my view this is an abomination.

Its ok.,"For some reason we had to watch this movie in French class in 8th grade.Rating - How the hell is this movie rated PG? I was under the impression that graphic depictions of blood and violence weren't appropriate in children's movies. I'm not saying that kids movies can't have violence and/or stakes to the plot, but this movie gets pretty bloody. There are a lot of scenes in this movie with machine guns as well. There is a scene where an old man gets shot to death, then has to write out his final words in blood. Based on the overall content, this movie probably would've worked better as a life-action adults' film. All you would have to do is make the plot slightly more complex and it would've been better.Plot - The story is a simple, kinda predictable crime story. Its ok. Pretty entertaining, but the runtime is a bit long.Characters - The dog is the most intelligent character in this movie. The human characters are all really dumb.Animation - The animation in this movie is absolutely phenomenal.Scene Transitions - Almost every transition is the same thing - the camera zooms in on an object and it fades to a similar object somewhere else. One example of this is a boat in the ocean fading to a foot stepping in a puddle. I have nothing against this type of transition, but when almost every scene transition is the same thing it gets visually boring. I spent a lot of the movie complaining about this along with some of my classmates.Overall, this movie isn't as entertaining as it could be. It could've been a lot shorter, which would've made it less boring. The animation was great, but most of this movie is really dumb.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as I would have hoped,Now I will start off first by saying that this movie had incredible animation.

The acting was good and it was directed by Spielberg so you have a very well put together movie here I just did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I thought they would have it be kind of funny and it seems like they did but its more of a very dry humor.This movie is about a reporter named TinTin who teams up with Captain Haddock to find a treasure ship that belonged to captain Haddocks ancestors.This movie was not all bad and it was a fun adventure and you could tell they spent a lot of time making it.

It was a collection of meaningless action sequences. There is no depth, suspense or atmosphere.

loved it ...,"When I heard about this project I was skeptical and worried that Hollywood is just going to cash in on it. Since it's a European comic, I expected that they are going to americanize the source material and take out the essence and taint some of my fondest childhood memories. That's why I ignored it when it was in the theater but recently I came around and bought the DVD. And now I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't go to see it in the first place. Spielberg and his writers were obviously fans of the comics and appreciated it for the same reasons I did and the result is phenomenal. Sure there are a few compromises here and there, in the story, in the characters and how it translates from comics to a 3D animated movie, but overall Tintin, Snowy, the Captain and Thompson and Thompson were just like I remembered them - only pity is that the Professor was absent, who was one of my favorites. The story itself is a blend of 3 comic albums and works great for a movie, really good pacing and a good mixture of mystery, adventure and simple fun. And even if you don't know the comics, the movie is a very good introduction to Tintin's adventures around the globe.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good solid CG work,"If you're familiar with the great TinTin comic adventure books, then this grand sweeping adventure story is exactly what you'd expect from this franchise.

The haunted blank face is no longer there. However it's still odd to try to pass a cartoon for real people.There is too much POV camera movements in long sweeping scenes. It's tiring for the eyes. And we've seen it before. There's no need to dwell on it. It's as if Spielberg wants to show off. It adds nothing to the storytelling. As for the story, I did find Captain Haddock annoying when drunk. I think it's supposed to be funny, but it's not funny. I really didn't find any jokes funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't waste your time or your money on this epic failure,"This movie is a complete catastrophe. Steven Spielberg and everyone else involved should be ashamed of themselves. To take such a spectacular masterpiece and turn it into this typical American and Hollywoody piece of crap is a slap in the face on Hergé and on anyone who has ever read his books. It is a shameless slaughtering of The Secret Of The Unicorn and it should never have seen the light of day. When a story of this extraordinary caliber is handed to you on a silver platter and all you have to do is translate it onto the big screen, how is it even possible to fail this tremendously? Why did Spielberg feel the need to confuse everything and ruin the entire story by mixing it up with The Crab With The Golden Claws? Why is a British actor doing Tintin's voice - do all Europeans really sound alike to Americans? And what's with Sackarine's ancestry from Racham the Red? Why does he even have this big a role?

WETA Gold,"There are only three ways to turn on your mind. The third is too dangerous to even sketch.The most common is to allow it to do what it wants, tracing known pathways and presenting known patterns. All imagination comes home to rest.But then there is art, which in my book is able to coax the imagination out of the familiar. Sometimes this immediately extends what you know, making your house bigger. Sometimes it centers on that oldest of organizational keys: space. Sometimes it is cinematic. That's what we have here, sometimes.Oh, there is the story-stuff, inherited from a Belgian comic. That is discardable. And there is the cloying story-boarding of Spielberg who I believe is living with the growing fear that he will die never having made something essential.But behind all that is the WETA parts of this film. Spielberg does his spiel in telling the story. And he gets the lion's share of the money and credit because he owns the property. But he turned all the spatial management over to Peter Jackson and his special effects house, WETA. And we are far better off for it.Elsewhere, I have celebrated what WETA digital fx has done, which is to take the concepts pioneered by Pixar and extend them in deliberate, engineered excess. The Pixar idea was to reinvent the personality of the camera. Since it is a virtual perspective, it can use space and movement beyond what we accept at the range of a physical camera. Much of Pixar's success, I believe, is in how they reframe who the viewer is in the story by reinventing how our eye discovers.The Pixar ideal is to do this in ways that are imperceptible. The WETA philosophy is to always be a bit beyond the comfort level, always overloading our mental abilities to sort things out spatially. This both gives an exhilarating film experience and on each viewing an extension of how the mind sees. It literally expands our ability to perform spatial reasoning — which for most of us is most of our reasoning.We saw this in the Lord of the Rings projects, which despite cumbersome story and distracting heroics were visually aggressive. I believe that 'King Kong' was made solely to perfect some insights, which I presume come from founder Jamie Selkirk.(The weta is a species of insect unique to New Zealand which comes in a broad variety, filling the role that in the rest of the world is taken by mammals. (New Zealand has none.). A common characteristic, the one every kiwi child knows, is the ability to jump aggressively. They have been essentially unchanged for 500 billion times longer than the average film, yet every jump of the bush weta is unique. Without wings, they have the ability to perturb their path. You can see the analogy in the movements of the camera in earlier projects, like 'King Kong.')There are three scenes here where it is obvious that Spielberg turned over complete control. The first is a seabattle between two ships. This is pretty darn masterful, because the Pixar/WETA camera philosophy has been used in an ironic, comic way in the later 'Pirates of the Caribbean' episodes. You can see the anti-irony here where the battle is truly between the inventors and masters of the treasured technique, and the Disney (and now Pixar itself) thieves. I was ecstatic.The second is a chase scene through a Morrocan village which was a pure advance over anything that has come before. Here there is no irony, though movie buffs will find a great many references to other chase scenes as reimagined by better camera perspectives. Two I will tell you to look for are the reference to the Geena Davis stagecoach chase in 'Cutthroat Island' and the little girl parkour chase in the recent 'Columbiana.'See this in 3D.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation

I think I wouldn't have been so disappointed had I not known that one of my favorite writers was involved.The film was a lot of fun but there was one little thing that bothered me enough to knock 4 points off the score. TINTIN!! Boy was he boring!! He had no personality, he was just sort of a talking cardboard cutout!! I didn't care at all about him!! If he'd been randomly killed off, I wouldn't have felt bad at all. As for the other characters, they were okay but Tintin brought it all down. I liked Snowy a lot and that other guy with them, Haddock or something, he was okay. But I just wanted Tintin off the screen. If that's how he was in the comics, no wonder Americans don't know who he is. I've never seen a more lifeless character in my entire life and that's saying a lot considering I've seen some pretty awful movies with horrible actors. But I felt like whoever played Tintin didn't have anything to work with and that's the fault of the writers, which brings me back to my immense disappointment with Steven Moffat. I mean this is the guy who wrote for the 11th Doctor, my favorite Doctor of all time, and he didn't give Tintin any personality.And of course I could go on and on about the over the top, self indulgent ending that screamed ""OF COURSE THIS MOVIE WILL HAVE A SEQUEL, YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!!"" While the movie was good in its own right, I won't be seeing the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
an amazing technical experience,"Having made some of the best and some of the most successful movies in the history of film making, Steven Spielberg has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. He is the complete master of the subjects and themes, genres and styles, and I suspect even of the financing of his films. Thus I am not surprised at all to see him pick Tintin as a hero for this film made in 2011 in which he plays on the ground of movies for children while allowing his own childish self to enjoy the making and the story and experimenting with the almost unlimited possibilities offered by computerized animation.There are two things that I did not like in Spielberg's version of Tintin. One is the de-belgization of the character. Titin as a character has a Belgian flavor and although his appearance and the the one of the surrounding characters created by Herge are respectfully preserved, the rest is all but lost in translation. The second is the fact that there is too much action in this film. Yes, Spielberg is a fantastic action director, but he seems to have become at some point too much absorbed in creating action at the expense of creating emotion. Kids today already have at hand a lot of action movies, TV shows, games. If this is to be a film for kids and if parents take their precious ones to see a film by Spielberg I would expect then to experience emotion and not so much action thrills.Otherwise The Adventures of Tintin is an amazing technical achievement and a superb visual experience. It's almost a masterpiece in hyper-realistic cartoon making if you believe such a combination exist. I must just honor the names of the people in charge with the art – they are Andrew L. Jones and Jeff Wisniewski. I will be excused however that I expected more from the great film-maker named Steven Spielberg.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'll take Motion Capture for the win.,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. AshlandAs if an adventure monster had vomited all over the screen, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a non-stop adventure film adaptation from a beloved European adventurous comic series. But while it holds that Spielberg-ish Indiana Jones archetype and an all-star cast of voices (including the likes of Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Toby Jones) it does get to a point where if you are not invested in the (over-excitable) Tintin character, then you simply won't care about the story itself (visuals aside). Directed and co-produced by the aforementioned Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can) and co-produced by visual genius Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) using the highest caliber stop-motion animation (maybe ever seen), ""The Adventures of Tintin"" exhibits the partnership of two great directors, in conjunction with a quirky, yet (at times) only slightly entertaining interpretation of what European children's mysteries are all about. OK, so maybe the reason why I am so lukewarm about this material isn't because it didn't look nice (because it does) or didn't contain an adventurous story (because it does that too); but speaking as an admitted novice to the beloved tales of Tintin, the adventure and the characters all were such that I really felt no attachment to anything on-screen as the million dollar climax approached. In this reviewer's opinion, ""The Adventures of Tintin"", while visually stunning, may leave many American audiences with a storyline which they may inevitably become bored with.The story follows an all-too-nosy boy named Tintin, who is (from the visual exposition) a part time reporter, part time amateur sleuth and part time ambiguous teenage nuisance. Within the first two seconds of the film he becomes involved in a storyline centering around an obnoxiously alcoholic Sea-Captain, the sinister Mr. Sakharine (the bad guy) and their quest for a model ship, which is thought to lead to three sought after scrolls, which could lead to some sought after treasure. From there Tintin's adventure sends him and the Captain all over the world, as we soon find out that this young boy's thirst for adventure is only rivaled by the Captain's thirst for alcohol. With action sequences of a fairly high caliber and some of the most illustrious, wide scoping CGI generated landscapes, there is no question that Spielberg knows how to direct the hell out of a film; no matter what genre. Where this film falls apart though is with the actual story and its connection, or lack thereof, with audiences. Spielberg and Jackson assume that everyone going to see a movie about Tintin is familiar, if not a huge fan of the comic series; big mistake. The fact is, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" contains almost no back-story and simply hurls the audiences right into a mystery with no real rhyme or reason. And while this may work for the devoted followers of the comic series, for the rest of us, it may feel as if we came into this movie midpoint, thus losing many novice supporters right away. This leads me to the character development. The characters, do tend to get rather annoying, especially because with little set-up it is hard to build connections with any of them. In fact the only character I cared about was the dog, who constantly held a Disney-esque animal lovability throughout. As for Tintin, audiences will either love or hate his personality almost immediately, and the Captain, brilliantly performed by Andy Serkis (or as I like to call him, the future of Hollywood) is a character so dumb and buffoonish that he is, for the most part, unlikable. Long story short, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is not a movie one walks into disinterested in the Tintincharacter and walks out interested in Tintin's plight.Final Thought: ""The Adventures of Tintin"" may not hold the funniest storyline (with tons of Euro humor), but is clearly, on a purely technical level, one of the best animated films of the year (even though some critics will whine about their love for the forgettable ""Rango""). Why this movie was snubbed from an Academy Awards nomination for Best Animated Film, may serve to be the biggest snub of the season. In saying that, on a purely entertainment level, allow me to reiterate that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is just OK. And if me saying that has angered you to the point that you decide to leave me a drawn-out comment on how I am just a stupid American or about how you loved reading the Tintin comics as a child, thus if I would have read them then I would have understood the film better, I will have to stop you there because I am only here to review the content of the film itself, not the comic.Thank you very much!

The Dearest Love Letter film to Hergé,"I have read quite a few of Tintin books when I was a child and enjoyed them quiet a bit. However, after that I never touch them again.When finding out about this film was coming out I was very excited to see it even my dad was excited since he grew up of Tintin. We managed to get my mum to join a long.We loved every second of the film. The capture motion was incredible. This is the only animated film that my mum is willing to watch again. You felt as if the character just walked off the page and into this movie. You can tell how every person involved in this movie really did their best and loved the original source material from Hergé and even understand Hergé.Tintin is Hergé but who he want to be but Captain Haddock is the real Hergé.It sad that Hergé did get to see this movie but it is melts my heart that Hergé is the first person we get to see when the movie starts. Since an incredible tribute to him.If you doubt if the film is a loving tribute to Hergé I would recommend watching The Adventures of Tintin and the Shadows of Giants by Breadsword which really explains the beauty of the film and Hergé in no words that I can write here.This film is a true masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Really ridiculous story, but consistent with the original comics and really well done","This is by no means a masterpiece and, by storyline, one might think it is pretty silly. But if you remember the comics (I know, drawn almost a century ago, pretty hard to remember) they were exactly like this. The focus was on adventure, on the bright reporter Tintin and his faithful dog and the positive, cartoonish way the world is depicted.The film itself is 3D, which doesn't really help it. And I mean that. I can imagine this in a anime style or even that French style of 2D animation and I believe it would have been better. Also, being the original Belgian comic, it would have made more sense in French. I mean the Tintin and Milou names really do sound better in French. But that doesn't mean the film wasn't really well done, because it was.I can still remember how it felt when I was reading the comics and it felt funny and dangerous at the same time. When the iconic beads of sweat jumped from Tintin's head I knew things were serious. The film goes too much in the direction of kid films, with very little tension.I have to conclude, though, that it was a well made film. I didn't enjoy the 3D animation, but it was well done. The story, consistent with the comics, were a bit too childish, but still nice. I wonder what direction they will go in the next series. I really expected less, but I got something outrageously fun. However I do wonder how the new generations will receive it. Will it feel like a weird European Bugs Bunny? Because then they would have completely missed the point. It's all about adventure! The kid version of Indiana Jones.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"A huge disappointment by two genuinely great directors specialized in popular entertainment, like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. The secret of The Unicorn was the first Tintin book I read (my parents give it to me as a present when I was 9 years old, more than thirty years ago). It is also one of my favorite Tintin books. This might be why I felt so disappointed by this. Absent from the movie is all the subtlety in the book. What is present here is a very heavy handed, video-game like approach.In theory, this could have been a match made in heaven, as previous works by Spielberg especially (like the Indiana Jones franchise) have a strong resemblance to Tintin, in terms of plot and in terms of the epoch (the thirties and the forties were the epoch were both Tintin and Indiana have their best outings). In practice, the film doesn't work. Let's try to analyze why.Let's first concede that Tintin is difficult to bring into the screen (previous adaptations, both animated and live-action, have failed). I think one of the reasons is that Tintin lives in a very stylized world, and this becomes quite obvious when one transplants Tintin from a drawing in a paper to a photographic medium (even in the form of computer animation).The charming plot of the book (Tintin finds by accident a manuscript hidden inside a model ship called the Unicorn that might be a clue to a hidden treasure, and soon sees himself chased by other people interested in that treasure), has some minor changes, but those changes are generally for the worst. For instance, the slimy Bird brothers in the book were better villains than Ivan Sakharine in the film, who was not one of the bad guys in the original book. Mixed up with the plot of the Unicorn (and in a not very convincing manner), appear elements of other Tintin books, especially The Crab with the Golden Claws, another favorite of mine.Lastly, the animation is not completely convincing: the problem of the unrealistic eyes (the so called uncanny valley, which many have pointed already in The Polar Express, and which evidently hasn't been solved) makes for a Tintin that is slightly creepy. By the way, the photography is some scenes is too dark and murky, when the Tintin books are famous for the use of bright colors and little contrast (the famous clear line style).",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fake!,"First, a word about Rotoscopy: Rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over live-action film movement, frame by frame, for use in animated films. Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope, although this device has been replaced by computers in recent years. In the visual effects industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.Now! This movie is as real as live. Of course, it would be. It's rotoscoped. If the end result was to appear lively, why animation? Why bother? That apart, it killed the nostalgia, the brand value I have for Tintin. Mercilessly.",,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg brings back his magic,"I've never read a Tintin comic book . I remember watching a cartoon about Tintin when I was younger and that I liked it .

He never did animation before (he was a producer of a few animated movies), so I had my reservations .Thankfully , Spielberg does not disappoint with this one . All the magic and charm you expected in forth Indy movie appears here . I felt like a little kid again . Thank you , Mr. Spielberg . It's not that good as the original trilogy , but definitely more fun that ""IJATKOCS"".The animation is top notch . The pacing is very good – never too slow or too fast . The characters are obviously colorful and interesting . There is also plenty of humor and action . There is no blood , so it's a great movie for whole family. There is one great chase sequence .

"Just as if the characters had jumped right out of the ""Bande dessinée""!","I am a fan of ""The adventures of Tintin"" since I was little; the comics are still great, funny and thrilling, even after all this time.
Steven Spielberg is not the first person who makes a movie about Tintins stories, but he is the first person who lets the characters become so realistic.
Especially the beginnig is so heartwarming and sets the tone perfectly.
There is a little too much action in the end, but that is okay for an adventure film of the 2010ers.
Laid out as a trilogy, it is pretty sad that there probably won´t be a sequel- to see Professor Cuthbert Calculus or Rastapopoulos on screen would be amazing!
But, anyway, thanks to Mr Spielberg and Mr Jackson for creating this movie that is doing the comics and Hergé justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.""","""You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it."" – Captain Haddock.Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-of-tintin.htmlSteven Spielberg's computer animated children's movie, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a fun, thrill ride, which is suitable for older kids and adults all the same. The movie, fashioned from the most popular European comics in the 20th century, is a dazzling rendition of the famous Belgian artist Georges Remi (1907–1983), who published the series of comic albums under the pen name of Hergé.As far as source material is concerned, Spielberg's adaptation of Remi's famous work revolves around the story of meeting, and then collaborating with the drunken, and kidnapped Captain Haddock, who has had his ship taken from him after a mutiny.The classic Tintin character, Captain Haddock, played by Andy Serkis, escapes with Tintin and snowy (his white fox terrier dog) and embark on an adventure together to find Captain Haddock's grandfather's sunken treasure on the Unicorn.The tale is engaging and exciting. It was well-directed and was filled with suspense. The action scenes, while implausible and hearkening back to Spielberg's days directing Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, draw you into the fantasy world unfolding on the screen.The most impactful point of the movie is when it appears like all hope is lost. The bad guys have gotten away with the secret message Haddock left, Tintin and Haddock are stranded, and Haddock gives a rousing speech to encourage Tintin to push through this ""wall"" they face: ""Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it. There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin. You can never let it defeat you.""While the animation is similar to any other animated film, it lacks Hergé's signature ligne claire style, which characterized his comics. Tintin is easily recognizable by his red hair, and the front which sticks up, but Hergé's signature style is largely absent in the animation of Tintin.Tintin and Haddock's ""stick-to-it-ness"" is a highlight of the movie as they endure impossible odds, are faced with countless detours and missteps, yet continue on in their pursuit of the goal.It reminds me a lot of the Christian life. That it is a marathon, not a sprint. That there are ups and downs, there are failures and successes, and to continue to run the race, pursue the goal, that is key. That is and will always be the point: to never give up and to continue on until the end.In Philippians 3, Paul urges his fellow followers of Jesus to press on, like him, even a great apostle who has planted several churches with great results. He tells the Philippians: Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. - Philippians 3:12-14As Christians today, we need to follow Paul's example. We need to exhibit this same type of never give up, never say die attitude that Captain Haddock spurs Tintin on to, even when it looks like all hope is lost.I also liked the team that Haddock, Tintin, and little snowy, formed as Haddock was a lost and drunken soul, desiring adventure and purpose, and snowy was a little dog, but both played a very important role in the trio finding what they sought: treasure.In order for us, as Christians, to go the distance we need each other. We need people to keep us focused on what really matters. We need those around us to encourage us to continue when we are ready to give up. We need someone to tell us that we can do it and we must go on, and not let us settle for failure.Haddock's word ring true for us too in this life: ""There's something you need to know about failure, you can never let it defeat you.""My Score – Overall Rating: 8.25 out of 10 Plot: 9 out of 10 Character Development: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin? So-so...,"As I see it there are two things wrong with this movie. Firstly the lead character: a jauntily quiffed youth in his original bande dessinée in essence has absolutely zero personality, so without his artistic style, there's very little left to root for.Secondly, the visual treatment. Is this an animation or is it reality ? It straddles the middle ground between the two and fails to convince us of either. The strongest elements are when the film accepts it's origins and is overtly cartoony: Snowy and Haddock, playing for laughs work well. The CGI however only really feels justified in action, in particular an exuberant extended chase, here the technology genuinely adds something so kinetic, imaginative and crazy it belongs in a comic. I can't help thinking that if the film had either focused on being a fully live action or a living 3D treatment of Hergés style it might have been more successful. That's not to say I didn't enjoy parts of it, and I'd love to see that shark sub...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Adventures of Tintin,"In the very first scene, Tintin is having a street artist paint a portrait of him. When it is finally unveiled, it looks exactly like the way Tintin looks in the old comics and the animated series. It is a very funny gag, but it is a dangerous one, because to me, it is difficult to outdo the old movies, for nostalgic reasons, if nothing else. The joke might also symbolize that The Adventures of Tintin is deeply rooted in the old adventure tradition, even if it looks new.That being said, the film feels unmistakenly modern, for better or worse. There's really not a boring moment, with frantic, gravity-defying action from start to finish, but sometimes I almost wished that it were more steadily paced and drew from other aspects of Tintin as well.All in all, it is a very fun film. The clumsy Thomson and Thompson are hilarious. The alcoholic Captain Haddock is almost too unlikable, though. Visually speaking, the animation is quite terrific, with stunning images of exotic locations, it has lots of good visual gags, like when a guy falls outside a pet shop and canary birds are circling around his head, and the transitions are innovative, like when Haddock's hand smoothly turns into the North African desert. The ending suggested that there will be a sequel, and if Spielberg et al. are able to refine Tintin's transition into the 2000s, I am very much looking forward to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very enjoyable; retains the charm from the original comics,"After being used to so many of sci-fi and hi-tech films seen in Hollywood, one has to admit that while watching this, there are many 'Why don't they use Google' moments. But it takes a lot to bring these comics to life while retaining the simple charm of those old comics that most of us would have read as kids.Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have planned this as a trilogy and this is the first of the three and based on three original comic books: The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941) and partly Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) and takes you on an adventure from the city to high seas to Saharan deserts.Being a first, it establishes the characters: Tintin (Jamie Bell) as a journalist with a white fox terrier called snowy and how he meets booze loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkins) as they attempt to thwart Ivan Sacharine's (Daniel Craig) evil plans. And, then there are the twin detectives Thomson and Thomson.Comic timing by Captain Haddock is well done. The moment when he uses his alcohol breath to restart a plane is probably the funniest. And his lines 'billions of blue blistering barnacles' are sure to evoke your memories when you read those comics. It would be nice to see a return of these characters in the sequel and the other regulars such as Professor Calculus. Hope a sequel covers Tintin's Indian adventures too.Many of the earlier versions of Tintin in motion picture or television shows haven't been impressive. Although I was skeptical about how this movie would turn out, Spielberg's genius makes it tick. Although the story deviates from the books at certain places, it doesn't affect the end product. There is a flow in the story, although it combines three books, there the thrill of non-stop adventure and a bit of drama.The special effects are its high point. Filmed using motion-capture, i.e., translating actors' real movements in a studio to characters on screen, it seemed a good decision to retain it as a comic rather than enact it live retaining the charm that Herge's comics. Also, the creator believed that only Spielberg could do it that well. Nevertheless, considering that it was an animated film, the 3D could have been much better though.While, I'm not sure whether those who have not been fans of the comics would really find the film interesting, it's still a worthwhile watch, irrespective of your age. This film works well for comic book enthusiasts and also for those with kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With a well-balanced script between adventure and mystery, Spielberg and Jackson will delight old fans and those who have never heard of the series","Tintin is a comic book character created in 1929 by the famous Belgian writer and artist George Remi (1907-1983), who wrote under the nickname of Hergé. The 24 albums published have sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide, and the character is, of course, especially known in Europe. Tintin travels the world on detective adventures accompanied by his white dog Snowy and Captain Haddock, a gruff, bearded sailor who loves a bottle. Written at a time when political correctness was still not very present (if it was present at all), Tintin, despite his tender age, walked around with a revolver in his hand and his parents never appeared. Today, his relationship with Captain Haddock-just friends, let me be clear-would scandalize hypocritical vigilantes of political correctness, especially given the fact that the captain is a much older drunk who only speaks profanity.Through motion-capture technology, ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" (this first chapter directed by Spielberg) has the right and increased dosage of everything that was good about the book series and the character design. Here, the technical device that had its kick in The Polar Express (Robert Zemeckis), shows all its wonderful potential presenting fluid and incredibly real characters. By the way, the difference between these and the ""limited"" dolls in Zemeckis' film is gigantic. In Tintin, the three-dimensional recreates all the aspects that made the series so cult. Thus, the film is filled with the most breathtaking landscapes (especially the aesthetic beauty of the recreation of Morocco) and extremely creative and well-scored gags. But its greatest merit is in its action sequences. If there is anyone who still defends the terrible theory that ""in an animated film, camera movements should not be taken into account"", Spielberg puts an end to it.By squandering creativity in his transitions and shots, the director builds extremely elegant and agile chase scenes, giving the film a dynamic and moderate pace, without causing dizziness and yes, a lot of dazzles. He delights us with impossible camera movements and crazy transitions from one scene to the next. A handshake turns a desert scene. The aerial shot of a small boat in the middle of the sea turns into a puddle of water in the city. The sequences in which a character tells a story and the film alternates between present and flashback flow seamlessly, a pen turning into a knife, the narrator on dry land becoming a pirate on the high seas. The action scenes are also exquisite, especially the one inside a plane under a storm, which even includes zero gravity; the final fight between Captain Haddock and the film's villain; and the long, exquisite sequence of the pursuit of a piece of paper.By the way, Spielberg's magic is clearly present in the magnificent escape scene from Bagghar, in Morocco. In this long scene almost done in a single take, we see the camera wandering around Tintin, Haddock, Snowy, the pursuers and a falcon (important in this part of the film). It's breathtaking. But what makes this scene truly out of this world is the parallel story it tells. Pay attention to the issue of water scarcity forced by the wealthy merchant Omar Ben Salaad (Gad Elmaleh) to maintain control over the people and how Tintin deals with it, albeit without full awareness of what he is doing. This moment is Cinema in its purest state of enchantment, something few directors manage to do. The opening credits sequence is another element that cannot be missed due to its simplicity and efficiency, in addition to already demonstrating the potential of John Williams' soundtrack that works very well throughout the film, without interfering too much in the story as in ""Horse of war"". Incidentally, the sequence following the opening until the arrival of the Dupont and Dupond brothers is filled with easter eggs for fans of the character. There are so many that it's not even possible to count.Even hidden behind Hergé's features, the actors who lent their voices and movements to the characters imprint a lot of personality to the figures. Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) voices and moves Tintin. Bell does a correct job, but the truth is, let's face it, Tintin isn't exactly the most supine character in the world. He's a bit too strait-laced, of indeterminate age, unclear motivations, lack of a more distinctive personality. He thus resembles a Luke Skywalker who pales before the Han Solo who is Captain Haddock. Lived by Andy Serkis (the guy in the virtual skin of Gollum, King Kong and the Caesar of the new Planet of the Apes), Haddock is an inveterate drinker who doesn't shy away from getting drunk even when the only option is surgical alcohol. He steals the show every time he appears. The trio of protagonists is completed with the smart Snowy, who despite being all white and fluffy and furry, shows how smart and brave he is. Other famous names are part of the cast, but they don't do as well as Andy Serkis. 007 Daniel Craig plays Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine, the film's unremarkable villain. The duet Nick Frost and Simon Pegg (from Everybody's Nearly Dead, Big Shot and Paul), who couldn't be more different in real life, make two clumsy detectives practically identical (except for a detail of the mustache), Dupond and Dupont. They star in the film's most obvious attempts at humor, really slapstick, which sometimes work, sometimes don't.The setting of the film is right and respects the fact that Tintin is a young European reporter of the mid-20th century. They kept the plot in the past, the characters use old cameras and cars, Tintin types on a typewriter - great, because seeing the Tintin Googling Clues would be virtually unacceptable. The city where the story begins is an undefined European capital, it could be Paris, it could be Brussels. Since the film is American, the characters speak English, but the main cast is all British and the accent doesn't sound out of place. And those who know the original comics will pick up a lot of references, from the airport sign in the opening credits (which reads ""Congo"", ""Shanghai"" and other locations visited by Tintin in the comics) to the homage to Hergé in the fun opening scene.""The Adventures of Tintin"" mixes action and comedy very well. Speaking of humor scenes, the script knew how to balance action and humor well, which makes the inspired dialogues between Tintin and Captain Haddock, and even the cartoons Dupond and Dupont amuse all generations among the numerous and intense action scenes. What might bother younger generations are Tintin's nostalgic catchphrases, after all, who screams ""blond parrot!"" today, but it was a very good decision to keep them in the film. The intense action scenes, the fun and light moments of humor are strong points in the film. But of course, the best is even in the impressive look. Director Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson managed to present us with a technically perfect work, which even bordering on realism, still maintains the cartoonish tone of Hergé's drawings.Between scenes of explosions, shots and chases, we are introduced to good jokes, usually starring Haddock, who in this version was even more involved with alcohol. This, incidentally, may be one of the criticisms made by those who are fans of the series. Unlike the comics, where Haddock drinks but doesn't go overboard, the movie's character is an undeniable alcoholic. He becomes limited by abstinence. His love for drinking, however, generates excellent moments of relaxation, as well as Snowy's adventures, which should win over the children even more. It is precisely in the development of the characters that the film's only problem lies. The script doesn't invest a lot of time introducing Tintin to the new audience and doesn't develop the character very well throughout the plot. Thus, the protagonist cannot be charismatic enough to win over the public that did not know him before the film.""The Adventures of Tintin"" is that, despite all its visual originality, the story leaves a certain taste of déjà-vu. It is a MacGuffin plot - an expression that designates that object that is essential for the character, but irrelevant for the spectator. Basically, Tintin needs to piece together different parts of a riddle to discover the location of a treasure. How many millions of movies have used the exact same excuse to jumpstart the action? Spielberg's own Raiders of the Lost Ark is the easiest example to remember. MacGuffin's revelation, without the weight of an Ark of the Covenant or a Holy Grail, is also disappointing, as is the final scene, which uses a dark soundtrack and a very suspicious butler, creating an atmosphere of suspense that is only in the promise. In addition to this aspect, the script's desperation to force a continuation makes the final minutes unnecessary and forced, literally hammered into the narrative structure with no greater purpose. After all, why make it so clear that you want a sequel? Did any movie in the Indiana Jones franchise have to resort to that for the continuation to be justified? It's Spielberg letting Hollywood mannerisms infect his work.With a well-balanced script between adventure and mystery, this first chapter of the film trilogy created by Spielberg and Jackson will delight old acquaintances and those who have never heard of the series. The only feeling left at the end of the projection is the desire for more. The initial idea was that a second part would be directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Spielberg (reversing the roles of that film) and a third with the return of Spielberg, thus closing a trilogy. Regrettably, the passionate acting didn't seem to have been able to generate the necessary box office numbers to ensure we'll continue to follow ""The Adventures of Tintin"" on the big screen. There are at least 18 other albums that would make for equally memorable theatrical adventures for Tintin, Haddock and company.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dupond & Dupont, not Thomson & Thompson","Warning - some light spoils - As an early reader, in my young age, of the whole collection ""The Adventures of Tintin"", I took great interest in Peter Jackson & Steven Spielberg's handing on this monument of European & world culture.Needless to say, the graphics deliver here some tremendous effort, the kind of which everybody could bow to...... But, but, but.Tintin was not, and was never to be a real young man that Hergé could meet in a Brussels square and take as a subject for a portrait. Tintin WAS Hergé, an idealized expansion of his will to meet the world and solve any of the problems he meets there, so little or so huge they could be.That's the only way Tintin is : solving, solving, solving everything everywhere to save the day, his life or the world occasionally. Never has he be an antiques seeker with a whip in his hand or in his head. And he just was here BEFORE Indiana Roller-coaster Jones. Here, in Europe, the real Europe, or elsewhere in the world, the real world, the world before, during and after WWII.What is really fascinating about the whole serial albums of Tintin, is the way it deals with great international affairs of its time : as close as possible with the Great Story, as clear as possible to be understood by young readers, and as subtle as possible not to hurt, not to expose them.It began in 1930 with Russian soviet-ism, then animal hunt and colonialism in Africa in 1931, then US gangsterism in 1932, then Egyptology and opium traffic in British colonies of Near East 1933-34, then Chinese-Japanese relations in 1936, then the Chaco War in south America in 1937, then counterfeit money in Scotland in 1938, then political plot in central Europe in 1940, then opium traffic again between western Europe and Morocco in 1941, then a competition between scientific teams seeking for a mysterious island where... giant mushrooms grew in 1942, then a domestic affair involving antique dealers stealing antiques in 1943, then a submarine tool to seek a sunken boat in 1944, then a mysterious curse driving scientists into a mad suffering illness in 1948, then a solitary expedition in the mountains to try and cure the curse in 1949, then some oil war in Arabia, then a secret scientific missile project sent to the moon in 1953-54, then the search of a sonic weapon of mass destruction in eastern Europe in 1956, then some slave traffic in Indian ocean in 1958, then the loss of a Chinese friend in Tibet/China in 1960, then a very tiny domestic mystery in 1963, then some air hijacking in the Pacific Ocean in 1968, then some revolutionary war in South America in 1976, then some traffic about modern art in 1986, alas unachieved.All of these where carrying subtle connections with the harsh world and the pleasure is to find them, and remember them.Does it allow to be puzzled all the way ? I don't think so and it certainly happened.For example, the villain in ""Le Crabe aux Pinces d'Or"" (The Crab with Golden Claws) was lieutenant Allan Thompson, dealing with opium traffic in the Cargo Karaboudjan, but that we hardly see in Spielberg's film ; Allan Thompson was obviously an American trafficker. So, guess, why did Anglo-Saxon translators of Tintin call the Dupondt policemen 'Thompson', and hide Allan, without even mentioning his name, behind some guy named Ivanovitch Sakharine ? hmm ? So with the villains in the Album ""Le Secret de la Licorne"". They where the Loiseau Brothers, stealing antiques, detaining and chasing Tintin in a castle they were being occupying for two years, as were the Nazi Germans occupying castles all around Europe and... stealing art everywhere, kidnapping and detaining people to ask them informations. Loiseau means ""The Bird"", as the German emblem was an eagle. But we don't see the Loiseau Brothers at all (except on a tiny picture in the market place) in Spielberg's movie.So, apart from breathtakingness, can we say this is faithfulness ? No we surely can't. Not only something is gone, but something of the real Tintin is kinda kidnapped.But Tintin, as we know him, has always been able to escape from kidnappers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful Adaptation,"I'm starting off by saying that as a child, I was a huge fan of the Tintin comics. I loved the characters, the plot line, the drawings, and the hilarity. I thought the movie was fabulous. I decided to write this review because I saw other fans saying otherwise.Yes, I will admit that most of the original plot line of ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" was discarded. They also included many characters and scenes from other books. But Jackson and Spielberg made it work. How could a duo like that not pull it off? One of my favorite parts of the movie was noticing the little memento's from other movies that they included.I enjoyed many other aspects as well. The animation was incredible. They managed to capture the faces to perfection. Bell and Serkis also did a fantastic job. I find it incredible that Andy can play Gollum to perfection, and still sound like the Haddock I would have pictured.The movie is filled with high-paced action, which is so similar to the coincidental ""that could never happen in real life"" action so common in the comics.Overall, this film was a triumph.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tin Tin Jones to the Rescue,"This film is recommended.The Adventures of Tintin is based on a series of classic comic books created by Georges Remi under the pen name of Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics around the 1930's and had a resurgence of popularity in the mid-fifties, when producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were avid fans of the series. Their interest resulted in this starry-eyed 3-D adaptation of this fictional hero and his exploits.This animated version of Tintin is an energetic lark. Back then, the stories were humorous adventure tales with a tinge of fantasy that fascinated children with their swashbuckling dare- doings. This film gives the characters a more modern look and realistic edge to the original source with a slight Indiana Jones flavor thrown in for good measure. While the film is not always successful in its trendy mix of state-of-the-art animation with its old-fashion storytelling of yore, it is still a worthwhile experience for children and parents to savor and enjoy.Storywise, the film is a rather routine outing as our hero and his loyal dog, Snowy, go in search of buried treasure. ( The film is based on the first three books from the original series. ) Buying a model of a ship called The Unicorn, Tintin ( Jamie Bell ) encounters Mr. Sakharine ( Daniel Craig ), a baddie who will stop at nothing to find three scrolls that will lead him to wealth and riches. Soon they are all journey bound, along with a drunken Captain Haddock ( Andy Serkis ) and his motley crew, ready for adventure.The screenplay adaptation by Stephen Moffet, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish does a concise if not exciting job with its subject. There is enough fun and thrills provided for the kiddies, although the film's humor is forced and only moderately amusing. In this version as in the original source, Tintin is the serious type. So much of the liveliness comes from the supporting cast, including Inspectors Thompson and Thompson ( Nick Frost and Simon Pegg ). All of the voice-overs provide the needed zest to the animated characters and their dilemmas.Yet, some of the charm has been lost in Spielberg's transition to update Hergé's original illustrations with more photo-realistic qualities, a decision that sometimes detracts rather than enhances the film's endearing characters. The realism of some of the film's characters seems totally artificial and contrived, and the rendering of authentic skin tones becomes considerably overambitious and fussy in its detailing. This results in more attention being given to the impressive technique and craftsmanship and less to the overall appearance of Tintin and his entourage. Many supporting characters are just stylized caricatures with exaggerated profiles and grotesque facial features that are at odds with the film's photo- realism emphasis. There remains an overall plastic vagueness in the film's main character, a blandness that persisted in the human forms of earlier computer generated animated efforts like Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express (2004) and Disney's A Christmas Carol (2009) and here, the character design is only slightly improved. ( Perhaps, the media of animation cannot yet master the realities of live action subjects so easily. )But the film does triumph in its action sequences. The camera's flowing movements and contrasting textures of objects, rather than people, is unparalleled in its artistry. The motion capture technology works more often than not. Shadows and lighting effects produce dramatic results, specifically with reflections found in windows and mirrors. Computer generated vistas of oceans and deserts supply enough local color and their transitions from one scene to the next are seamlessly achieved. The elaborate compositions and unique perspectives make one forget that what is being seen up there on the screen is purely imaginary in its execution. The background details of Hergé's comic book world are quite stunning to behold with certain individual segments generating much wonderment and awe. ( Snowy's car chase, Tintin's motorcycle escape, and the notable pirate sequences are memorable exercises in CGI advancement, skillfully directed by Spielberg and creatively drawn by his talented crew. )The Adventures of Tintin is a delightful homage to Hergé's much loved classic tale. This film should result in an even wider audience of today's younger generation of moviegoers. We can now appreciate and admire the craft of two artists with their own worldly visions, brought together to create a lovely cinematic treat for this holiday season.

My First Review So Bear With Me,"I re watched this after a long gap and all i can say is this; it still stands up to the quality of movies today. The look of the characters is great mix between realistic and cartoony, sakharine particularly took the spotlight. There are alot of different locations that look impressive for 9 years old.I like the story and upon rewatching i put more and more things together i missed at first. Usually im very ''mean"" to movies, im that guy that points out the unrealistic or plot convinient things of a movie (Such as ''Why didn't he just do x, it would be so much easier"" or ""how did he not realise x"" or ""x is gonna happen, isn't it"". Sue me lol) however there were few moments where i outright said it, afterwards i slowly realized there are a FEW moments but still the movie had me so mesmerized i didn't even bother/notice. This is my first review so sorry if its not as long or professional.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well I'll be damned, it's actually a good yarn","I've never been the biggest fan of Tintin. For me his character has always been a bit too bland, while his adventures have been entertaining enough. But out of Franco-Belgian comics I've always preferred Lucky Luke and Asterix before Herge's comics. So with that I went to see Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson co production and Spielberg directed Tintin movie. And what a blast it was.Firts of, as you might know, the movie is done with mo-capped CGI animation. Every previous endeavor at the field have been a mishmash of pretty pictures, but eerily human like and appalling characters. Not this time around. WETA uses all the tricks they've learned in doing movie effects like in Cameron's Avatar. They've pulled out all their cannons and they deliver a visual blast of unmatched animation and scenery. On a very few fleeing moments there's that feeling of unsettling eeriness present on a couple of minor characters, but I do dare to say that all the main characters and the majority of the side characters leave that feeling far behind and in many moments you just forget, that you are watching a CGI creations facial movements, as the emotion is fully present in every expression and the eyes steam of life.The story of the movie revolves around captain Haddocks lost family fortune and villains, who are trying to take his rightful heritage away from him. Tintin stumbles upon this by an accident, when he purchases a miniature of a galley Unicorn. Sure enough, there are some holes in the plot, but Spielberg drives the plot forward with such an enthusiasm, that it is easy to forgive a hole or two, especially when we are treated with great deal of visually splendid action and humour. This all is lazed nicely with a soundtrack of John Williams. Over all the atmosphere is straight from old adventure movies, which dared to be fun instead of foreboding and gloomy.Voice cast does a good overall work as well. Andy Serkis is good as Haddock and Pegg and Frost do a good job as Dupont & Dupond (or Thompson and Thomson, how ever you want it). Bell manages to breath some life in Tintin as well and over all he's a bit more rounded up as a character in the movie than he ever was in the comics. It's perhaps the facial expression, which are a bit more telling in the movie that they ever were in the Herge's images.Also, what was a pleasant surprise, the character traits of Haddock have not been sacrificed in the altar PC culture, as he still is the same cursing drunkard as he is the books. Dupont and Dupond are the same incompetent detectives and Tintin is smart as ever while Milou, Tintins dog, stays as his loyal friend and edgier alter ego.The 3D works nicely on the movie. It's not necessary for the movie, but it's not distracting either, it's merely there to give some depth to the picture so it's not necessarily worth the extra price.All I can say is, that the more I think about it, the more I can recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest comedic action film since Raiders of the Lost Ark,"A fabulous action movie. I am always wary of 3D animated films that try to depict this level of realism, but Tintin pulls it of with aplomb. The human motion, and particularly the facial expressions are absolutely spot on, the sweet spot of exaggerated realism which allows a very engaging performance by the actors ...and animators!As an action film it has flawless pacing, showing that Spielberg has not lost his touch, as long as someone else writes him a good plot! And that's where Tintin comes through where so many action films fail. It's not just the plot, but how it is scripted, drawing you into love of the genuinely likable characters, otherwise, we would not CARE if they get shot by the bad-guys, or got run over by that ship. The salt so often missing from action recipes.And it's funny!Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Snowy Was A Dog-Gone Cool Canine Sidekick,"Even though, for the most part, I did enjoy The Adventures Of TinTin very much, I found that at a running time of 2.5 hours it constantly cried out for some very serious editing.I'd say that about a good half hour's worth of sheer uselessness could've easily been axed from this one's story and no one would've noticed the diff one way or the other.But, of course, at the hands of director Steven Spielberg the viewer was put through a long, drawn-out hell before he came to his senses and got to the story's point.Yeah. Instead of a quick-paced, tightly packed story of, say, 2 hours, here, way too much time was spent re-telling a tale from yesteryear. And having TinTin take an extended adventure over to North Africa, only to find out (to my growing frustration) that what really mattered when it came to solving the whole mystery of the Unicorn was right back in good, old London.I don't know about you, but, for me, all of this needless rigmarole only left me with a sense of disappointment in this film's final product.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Less than the sum of its parts,"I can't view this as anything but a disappointment. It was a reasonably entertaining movie, with some great moments but as someone who knows the Tintin books inside out, it was a rather jarring experience. The movie started off as a modified version of 'Secret of the Unicorn', then jumped into the story for 'Crab with the Golden Claws', then back and forth for the rest of the movie.We got all the familiar Tintin motifs and characters (except for Professor Calculus) but the result is less than the sum of its parts. It was as if it was song made by mixing a Led Zeppelin song, a Pink Floyd Song and a song by Sarah McLachlan... despite all the beauty of the individual songs, the result will be a mess.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underwhelming!,"From the filmmaker who has enriched the world cinema with some of the most adventurous, dazzling & unforgettable films ever made, The Adventures of Tintin marks a couple of firsts for Steven Spielberg. In a massively successful career that spans 4 decades, it's his very first foray into the medium of animation & also marks his first stint with digital filmmaking.Based on the immensely popular comic book series by Hergé, the story of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn follows the fearless journalist Tintin, his pet dog Snowy & the permanently drunk Captain Haddock who together set off on an adventure to unearth the secret of a ship that sank 300 years ago & was once commanded by one of Haddock's ancestors.Co-written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish, produced by Peter Jackson and directed by Steven Spielberg, The Adventures of Tintin opens with a brilliantly composed opening credits sequence that wonderfully pays its homage to its source material but after that, it feels like an inconsistent mash-up of Hergé's Tintin & Spielberg's Indiana Jones that isn't as rewarding as expected.Spielberg's direction is still worthy of mention for he shows a great comfort in what is a new filmmaking experience for him & is never hesitant to try a few experiments with the camera, for animation makes possible a number of sequences that would be too difficult to capture in a live-action scenario. The editing however is a mixed bag for it fails to provide a tighter plot & a brisker pace would've sufficed a lot.The animation is gorgeous for the rendering captures the authentic ambiance of the comics, every frame is richly detailed, characters aren't entirely computer-generated as is the case in most animated features but make use of motion-capture to bring the real performances of the actors behind the voices, and the ever dependable John Williams once again chips in with an adventurous, mesmerising & light-hearted score.The cast consists of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg & others and all of them chip in with fairly good performances. The characters look exactly like their comic book drawings, the voice acting as well as the motion-capture performance by all is commendable, Tintin's beloved dog Snowy is a great comic relief & whether it's humour or entertainment, the film has a few cheering moments for everyone.On an overall scale, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is underwhelming as far as what was expected from it but it still makes up for a good ride, if not a great one. The entire picture feels like the writers were unsure which aspect to favour more: character depth or big-screen spectacle, & they end up half-way on both. Nevertheless, the film promises plenty of fun, entertainment & wonders to its viewers. It's just that it won't be remembered in the years to come.",,Anonymous,Animation
A treat for Tintin fans.,"The first thought that came in my mind after watching the film was that I should not have read the comics before watching the film. Though I had not read the part on which this film was made but I did felt unsatisfied. The reason I suppose was that we have a habit to portray the characters in our own sense and when it doesn't match with what we see, we declare the presentation bad. Because of this philosophy I should not comment much on the film but I did not liked how captain haddock was portrayed. He should have been shown in much more anger rather than a bumbling fool. Although we see him doing foolish things in the comics also but that has style in it. The focus for most of the time was out of tintin. But that didn't bothered that much. Now coming to the story, I would say that it was not so interesting as there are much better present. Overall this was a disappointment for me. For a person who doesn't know much about the comics, this is going to be damn fine film.""A recommended watch for all animation lovers.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Treat For Those Who Grew Up With The Comics,"""I am entirely confident that I shan't see a better film this year."" That is what I said upon seeing J.J. Abrams' 'Super 8' earlier this year. Quite a claim, huh? But I have adequate justification for it: that was a film of genuine excitement, with such originality in its screenplay to give good, fun thrills, devoid of cheap gimmicky clichés, and an impressive debut for the child actors. It was a film I so thoroughly enjoyed that I went to see it twice! I have never, ever done that before with a movie so it was certainly a significant cinematic experience. It was so earth-shatteringly good that I labelled it the cinematic highlight of 2011, primarily due to its levels of excitement and enjoyment. I was so sure nothing would come close until last night. Sitting in my seat of the Apollo Theatre watching the latest offering from director Steven Spielberg, 'The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn', I wasn't so sure if my claim was all that accurate.Adapting the 'Tintin' comics, the sensation created by Belgian artist Hergé, into a film was an excellent idea. The comics, so rich in witty humour, unique characters, and plot lines that unravelled themselves stylishly like movies of the film-noir genre, were universally popular with everyone! It all seems unaffected by age, even now. There is very rarely a dull line of events in these comics because they are almost always accompanied with either the foundations of a new sub-plot shadowed by the story's primary story, or a select snippet of physical humour or some witty line. These comics are a golden opportunity for international attraction; everyone knows of Tintin.The premise of this film (based on the three Tintin adventures 'The Crab With The Golden Claws' (1941), 'The Secret Of The Unicorn' (1943) and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' (1944)) is simple enough: Tintin (played by Jamie Bell), walking around a crowded market, spots a beautiful model of a ship called ""The Unicorn"" and, admiring it, he buys it. An American (who later turns out to be an ill-fated FBI Agent), having failed to buy it off him, warns that he's entering a world of trouble with that ship, just as the film's villain, Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig; a very appropriate choice for his dastardly and malicious, yet very suave, tone of voice) wants the ship, too. Later, Tintin discovers a secretly-hidden scroll inside it and discovers that three identical ships each contain scrolls that unlock the secret of the treasure of Red Rackham. Kidnapped by Sakharine's men and bundled onto the Karaboudjan, he meets the ship's Captain, Archibald Haddock (voiced with a Scottish accent by Andy Serkis).The essence of the characters seems to have remained generally intact in this film. Yet it was somewhat lacking the ordinary amount of foolishness from the bumbling-but-adequate Police Inspectors Thomson and Thompson (with the perfectly-chosen voices of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to voice them). I can't argue that pursuing a master pick-pocket and smashing into a lamp-post is not what can be expected, but these two are known for their (eventually) efficient and cunning police work, underlined constantly with their iconic word rearrangements! They are forever correcting each other incorrectly (such as ""It's insanely perfect,"" one says, only to have to the other say, ""To be precise, it's perfectly insane""). That isn't truly shown in this film. But on the whole, it's all there: Haddock's light-weight alcoholism and characteristically elaborate insults still remain (such as, ""Miserable molecule of mildew!""), Tintin's thirst for adventure is forever unquenchable, Nester remains Haddock's extremely tolerant yet quietly patronising manservant in Marlinspike Hall, Thomson and Thompson still the clever twits of the story. Whether or not Tintin's constant narration of every thought that ran through his head was strictly necessary, or indeed accurate to the original character, is beyond me. It did wear a tad thin, I have to say!Continuing the wonderful working relationship they've shared since 1974's 'The Sugarland Express', John Williams, who has written the music for all but two Spielberg-directed films ('Twilight Zone: The Movie' and 'The Colour Purple'), writes the music here. It is quite a strong element of the adventure, with Williams composing themes so distinguishable that you can guess what character is going to come up next. The Thom(p)sons have their own theme, Haddock has his own ""drinking theme"", arising whenever he craves some of his favourite 'Loch Lomond' whisky, and Tintin has his own ""mystery-solving/ thinking theme"". The body of the score is upbeat trumpets, superbly intricate riffs of the piano, and violin quivers in the more suspenseful moments. It's reflects the Tintin adventures to great approval.I am so pleased to say that whatever childhood memories I had of the Tintin comics were presented rather loyally on this silver screen adaptation. Amongst all this, there is, however, a new memory I will be taking away with me: the CGI wizardry of the film. I found the concept of transferring one of history's greatest comic book characters to a computer-generated format peculiar, but I can say that it was the right decision. Not the most immediate idea, but one that works.According to numerous Spielberg interviews I've read, every frame of the film took five hours to create using the CGI photorealism format. Again, minute features are accounted for: the fibres of a sailor's jacket, the scattered refractions of sunlight on a man's beard, the pores on Tintin's face – all there. As producer Peter Jackson put it, ""They look exactly like real people – but real Herge people!"" This film will doubtlessly be remembered as a digital-animation triumph of the decade, let alone just 2011.'The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn' is more than a kiddies' movie endorsed to make a shedload of money. It is so much more than that. It may well be the new 'Super 8'.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Ships, ...","Greetings again from the darkness. Not that I am hoping for marital strife, but I like it when Steven Spielberg wants to get out of the house. This year he has delivered awards contender ""War Horse"" and this crowd pleasing motion-capture animation film (also) for the whole family. If you are unfamiliar with Tintin, it is a long-running, extremely popular European comic series by Herge', who passed away in 1983.Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is an investigative newspaper reporter who looks 12, but clearly isn't. He lives on his own, travels the world and is treated like an adult by those with whom he crosses paths. There is an early scene where Tintin is sitting for a local artist and the resulting portrait is the exact simple look of the comic series. Tintin has a trusty sidekick ... his genius little dog, Snowy. Together they go on adventures that Indiana Jones can only dream about! This particular story focuses on the hunt for the lost Haddock family treasure. Tintin literally stumbles into the drunken sea Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) who is more concerned with his next swig of whiskey than the the fact that he has been kidnapped by the bad guy Rackham/Sakharine (Daniel Craig). This bad guy has unlocked the mystery location of all the clues to the lost treasure and needs Captain Haddock for the final step. Unfortunately for him, Tintin and Snowy get in the way and try their darndest to stop him.The action sequences are amongst the most exciting and thrill-packed that you will ever see. They look like ""Jonny Quest"" on steroids. The story is quite convoluted and complicated and small kids will be totally lost on exactly WHY the characters do what they do. But it won't much matter, because the visuals of each scene are captivating. There are even a couple of Interpol agents on the trail ... Thompson and Thomson (voiced by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, respectively).Spielberg has always done nice work when he can go after a kid's imagination - even big kids like me. The look of this movie is pretty amazing, especially when compared to the 2004 ""The Polar Express"". If you doubt how far technology has come, look at these two side by side. Herge' creation is given script work here by Steven Moffatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. The great John Williams provides the score.

Well-crafted homage,"Picasso said 'Good artists borrow, great artists steal."" There's a lot of borrowing in this film. When, the opening credits rolled on Tin Tin, I inwardly groaned. John William's score and the title sequence were a rip-off of 'Catch Me If You Can'. Spielberg's own rip-off of 1960's title sequences.Spielberg (and Williams) repeat themselves in this movie, but there is enough that is new and fresh to save the day. If you remind yourself that this movie is intended for an audience that may not have seen all the clichés that are used, it is quite a good movie.First and foremost, the animation is stunning. It manages to cut a line between comic book and realism that is fresh without feeling contrived. Your mind's eye comfortably settles into this world. The effects are subtle and effective. The back of a hand morphs into a desert dune. A desert dune morphs into an ocean wave, all beautifully done.The story incorporates 3 Tin Tin books in rather seamless fashion. The core relationship, that between Tin Tin and Captain Haddock (both beautifully voiced by Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis) rings true.John William's score, while cutting no new ground, serves this adventure as well as the score in Indiana Jones. In fact, there is not a lot to separate them.But if you forgive these gents from repeating themselves and look at the film with new eyes, it's really a very fine and entertaining work.

Blistering Blue Barnacles!,"When Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson team up as director and producer, the outcome is easy to predict: they can't fail. They've unearthed the work of Belgian maestro Georges Prosper Remi, better known as Hergé, and have given it the American kiss of life.The titular adventures are a dextrous amalgam of three Tintin stories: 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', Red Rackham's Treasure' and 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. As far as I can tell the three writers – Steven Moffat (of Dr Who fame), Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish – have remained faithful to the spirit of the comics and animated series.The performance-capture technology used produces a veritable feast for the eyes. It is of such a high calibre that there is little room for improvement. The visual effects trounce those seen in 'Avatar' – and at a fraction of the cost ($130m is chicken feed nowadays). The great thing about the technology is how fluid the camera can be. We see angles and movements that no director, however skilled, can attain in real life. The long kinetic sequences are immeasurably impressive.After buying a model of a ship bearing a unicorn, Tintin is immediately pursued by a nefarious man with the ironic name of Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Tintin slowly learns the reason for why he is being hounded and decides, in the interest of good journalism and adventure, to uncover the secret of the unicorn.Into his quest he befriends Archibald Haddock, a gregarious sea captain who has a cruise ship of a nose and a weakness for whisky. Their perilous mission takes them across Europe via more modes of transport than you'll find in a Bond film.The jokes are funny and varied. The persiflage between Haddock and Tintin is masterfully written. Andy Serkis, as Haddock, again brings a cartoon to life and it's about time the man was recognised for it. Jamie Bell, though not Spielberg's first choice, does well as Tintin. I've not heard him speak anything other than his Northern dialect before, but his refined English would stand up in any Received Pronunciation test. The famous bumbling police officers, Thomson and Thompson (identically sounding Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), are on hand to provide laughs and incompetence.The film is atmospheric, which at times has a semblance of film noir. The only thing I recall about repeats of the Tintin cartoons from the '90s is that I couldn't follow them. That's not a problem here.

"Nothing excellent, but a great homage to the comics I've recent read","To be honest, I didn't exactly read the Tintin comics this movie was going to be based on, but at least I went to see this in theaters in 3D with my sister, her boyfriend, and my brother to see if it would really make us feel excited. After the film progressed and ended, it did and boy were we impressed. While the movie isn't a masterpiece, it's a great homage to the first three Tintin comics I've recently read (I've read them a few months later and thought they were good, too).However, I will admit that it does have two flaws that ruined the film for me. I liked the original concept of the story's usage of the first three comics, but it included too many characters and the comedy, while funny, could've been timed better. At least I do enjoy Thomson and Thompson's hilarious moments especially in the beginning of the film. Aside from it's flaws, it has some redeeming qualities including the brisk pacing, it's spectacular visuals and the CGI faces on Tintin, Haddock, and the others were exactly like the ones from the comics. The characters are well-developed and the relationship between Tintin and Haddock was terrific. The villain is great with some great enthusiastic voice work from Daniel Craig. Other voice actors like Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Simon O'Pegg did great and portrayed the main characters and the comedic sidekicks perfectly.The strongest aspect goes to the fantastic action sequences and the music from John Williams, although not one of his best in a movie so far, is beyond memorable it ranks with his music from the Indiana Jones movies. With a sequel in the works, I would be very excited to see it with much high expectations since this is a great film from Steven Spielberg. Thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Halfway great,"I have loved the Tintin-albums ever since I was little. I remember going to the library, having a few on loan most of the time. They are great stories and also artistically great. There has been some controversy lately about supposedly racist content in the Tintin-albums, but honestly I don't think most people who read the albums see them that way. And also, you have to consider that these are very old cartoons written in another time. Anyway, it was with a mix of fear and anticipation that I went to see this movie.I have to say the resulting movie has given me mixed feelings. It's a very divided experience with the first half feeling more like the albums. It's a puzzle mystery, the slapstick comedy of Thomson and Thompson and in general classic Tintin-fare. The second half contains a lot more action and feels like classic Spielberg-fare more than anything. I have nothing against Spielberg, but I'm not so sure that making Tintin into Indiana Jones is my preferred choice. Since I watched the movie in 3D (the only way to watch the movie with original language here) I found a little extra testing with the many fast and pretty roller-coaster-like action scenes.Considering that the movie is based on more than one album (three if I remember correctly), it can be a bit strange for those of us who know the stories. But in the end I think that the writing was above expectation. Even though the focus on action sequences in the latter half of the movie was a bit overdone, I think that the movie is very watchable. Tintin looks a bit creepy at times with his pale and waxy complexion, but Haddock is very well done and transports the character from the albums superbly. Although I don't remember him as having such a big nose...In the end I would have preferred a more toned-down movie with more emphasis on mystery and less on action. But I guess they have to sell their video games and appeal to kids with ADD as well. Considering that there will probably be a bunch of sequels I can always hope for a more subdued experience next time. I guess mostly I'm just happy they didn't ruin it.I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alright Animated Film From Spielberg And Jackson,This is a fine animated film for all viewers to watch. It could have been better. The quality of the animation was not the best. The crew did not put in all the effort in creating this film. The cast selection was great. They fully committed to the storyline in a strong way. This animated film reveals to viewers that there are multiple different kinds of adventure out there in the world. I am not allowed to go on any kind of adventure during my lifetime. The people who are in my life do everything that they can to restrict from adventure. I am to live my life without any excitement. That has left me depressed. This is an alright animated film for everyone to watch.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"What a fun, what a ride and alas it ended so very quickly.","What a fun, what a ride and alas it ended so very quickly.Mind you, this is a Steven Spielberg film and he worked with Peter Jackson in production design. So this film has to be great or at the worst level good, and it indeed is great for me. No drama, no romance, rather no girl in the whole film actually. It's a straight adventure that is reminiscent of Indiana Jones in many ways.I remember collecting TINTIN pages from the weekly magazine THE WEEK and making it into episodes. Alas, I lost those pages but I found him back again with this movie.Every frame is picture perfect and is very well crafted. Be it the first scene of the look of ship through mirror or last scene of finding the treasure, every frame is top quality. With production budget that this film has and the brains that worked for the film, the minimum expectation is awesomeness in every scene and then it has to rise above the script to be called as a great movie. Now, if the first 15 minutes sounded bore then this film is not for you coz that was just the build up and basis for what lies ahead.Once Haddock enters, he takes the film head on and makes it an adventure worth more than our money and time. Haddock, the captain who has a very typical accent came out in the best form and better than what I ever imagined. Best lines of the movie were by Haddock while the reactions for them by Tintin were mostly innocent and at times hilarious.Though it's a great watch, I still cannot say it's a must watch for all those unaware of existence of tintin and you need to be really patient for great moments on screen to happen.Best aspect was animation and yes, it is the best animated movie I saw all this year and this may well receive the best animated film Oscar. I also loved the way camera moved and the way and the way sets were designed.The best scene in a Bike feat, the way Tintin hung to the wire just on handles, awesome. I loved it a lot and it was a laughter riot in theatre.I would go with 4/5 for Tintin, this movie has to be watched for Haddock more than Tintin.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It would be a sinsin if Tintin was awful, which its not, but despite being visually stunning , its good, not great","Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) and his loyal dog Snowy are sitting for a portrait in Paris. Behind them, clever folks are pickpocketing a good deal of the crowd. After taking delight in his picture, Tintin finds something else to love. It's a model ship and its selling for a song. Strange what happens next. Just as the lad makes the purchase, not one but two gentlemen try to buy the ship from its now owner but Tintin won't do it. He takes it home, finds out its name and goes to the library for research. When Tintin and Snowy return, the ship is gone! This leads to finding the estate of the original ship's owner, another model, and the kidnapping of Tintin and his dog! Soon, they are at sea and the captain is after a part of the model that Tintin didn't know he lost! The lad escapes with a drunken sailor and goes hither and yon, trying to get back to Paris and avoid the nasty men who are after him. Will a boy and his dog have the advantage? They will when they are as smart as these two! There's really nothing so bad about this film, so the director, Spielberg, hasn't committed a sinsin. But, it is complex and not really a younger children's flick at all. That said, it is sensational to look at, with a design that is bright and colorful. Also, the actors voicing the characters, including Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, are first rate, too. The film also starts off quite action packed but loses a bit of steam in the middle before finishing nicely. Especially fine is a scene where an opera singer shatters the glass of everything in sight. So, older kids and folks that are young at heart, especially longtime fans of Tintin, will like it. But, it has to be called good, not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Awesome technically, faithful to the comic books, but horrible soundtrack","Fantastic story telling, quite faithful to the comic books. Technically a milestone in animation/motion capture. The things you will see here is unbelievable ! Unfortunately I am very auditive, and a good soundtrack can turn a bad movie into a good one for me, and a good movie into a bad one.. Unfortunately the last is the case here. I find John Williams' score here all to chaotic, and its not giving any depth to the scenes nor characters. I kind of liked the jazzy part with the intro sequence, but for the action scenes especially it gets really horrible. And a nice catching theme for Tintin would have been really nice.But if you are not so auditive as me, I can only recommend it. And for all technically interested: Go and enjoy the state of the art of animation / motion capture.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Adventures of Tintin: A Visual Masterpiece and a Thrilling Adventure,"Imagine stepping into the world of Tintin, the intrepid reporter and his faithful canine companion Snowy, where every page crackles with adventure and intrigue. Now imagine Steven Spielberg, the master storyteller, breathing life into this captivating world with groundbreaking visual effects that blur the lines between reality and imagination. That's the magic of The Adventures of Tintin, a cinematic masterpiece that transports you on a whirlwind journey through the pages of Hergé's iconic comic books.Join Tintin as he follows a trail of clues that leads him to the hidden treasure of the Unicorn, a legendary pirate ship. Along the way, he'll face off against a cunning archaeologist, dodge deadly traps, and navigate treacherous waters, all while uncovering the secrets of the past.The Adventures of Tintin is a visual feast for the eyes, with stunning landscapes, intricate details, and expressive characters that seamlessly blend live-action elements with computer-generated imagery. It's like watching a dream come to life, a world that feels both familiar and otherworldly.But beyond the stunning visuals, it's the story that truly sets The Adventures of Tintin apart. Spielberg captures the charm and spirit of the original comic books, bringing Tintin's adventures to life with a touch of whimsy and a heaping dose of action.This isn't just a film for kids; it's a film for anyone who loves a good story, a thrilling adventure, and a world where imagination knows no bounds.

Turning a classic in to a Hollywood Junk!,"Being a fan of tin tin from my younger days i was utterly disappointed with this tin tin flick! the story line has been changed in to just action sequences, no character development what so ever and here i said it again the story has been changed in to a piece of garbage!!!! now the cgi is good but if you are a tin tin reader you will hate what they have done with the story!!! i guess part of the fun with tin tin was the characters but here you don't get much connection to them! the last good movie Spielberg did is years ,many years before just like George Lucas they just hang on to their past glories. capitan horlock is gone from the parts of story and he is the coolest character there.

A rollicking 3D Adventure that bests Avatar,"A great leap in 3D animation started with Robert Zemekis' ""Polar Express"". Meanwhile, James Cameron was bringing natural camera-work back to animation. All the trials and tribulations to get textures and movement through the last decade or so has culminated in Tintin. Spielberg has nearly reinvented 3D animation by finding camera movements that help energise the movie, not just a gimmick shot. Like Avatar, your eyes are unsure whether you are seeing something as photo-real or pure animation. Textures of the ground, skin, rusty walls, and so on have an incredible detail to them. Spielberg seems especially keen on the use of reflections in glass as part of his new bag of toys. There is nonstop movement from perspectives and transitions that are no different than a painter who makes optical illusions within his work.I say Spielberg, along with Peter Jackson, have reinvented the genre, because the use of editing along with the camera choreography provides the benefits of editing in normal comics, where each panel acts as an edit. Each shot is essentially a work of art. In fact in this genre, it is less effective to try the action scene done all in one shot. It starts to feel too much like a video game. But what about story? George Lucas made similar advances with the new Star Wars Trilogy, but the story dragged. I am not familiar with the books the movie is based on. But you get a great idea of the tone as the young boy and his dog dodge bullets and find themselves in harm's way, albeit knowing that they can outsmart or basically allow the folly of the bad guys to do themselves in. So yes there is story. The adventures have a great deal of flair to them. One particular scene on a ship involves sneaking into the crews' barracks. The entire room is alive as the motion of the waves rocks the boat, causing the bodies and objects to slide back and forth with slapstick pratfalls that resembled an old Looney Tunes cartoon.The extent of the boy's adventures is no doubt geared for young adults, there is no love interest. But it doesn't matter, when the momentum of the story and epic production cast a spell on the audience, you become a kid again yourself. One may actually experience that ""Indiana Jones Magic"", where you find yourself grinning as you watch the director spin a narrative that is as fun as a Disneyland ride. Part of that magic comes from the John Williams score (which borrows heavily on Indiana Jones). It ceases to amaze me how the man can still churn out intelligent music for so many decades. I didn't care for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, although I liked some of the over-the-top action sequences that had a cartoon like quality. In Tintin, it IS a cartoon, and the action sequences go even more over-the-top. The only complaint you may find is that there is almost too much action. By the end of the third act, your stomach may start to get queasy as you spin around and around as the action unfolds.I give this a 7 out of 10 only because it is entirely possible that the sequel could be even better than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A solid actioner for the whole family.,"This film has been compared to an animated Indiana Jones, and I can see why; it would be a better instalment than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, were it part of that franchise. Still, I rather like the style of this movie, the way that the motion capture transforms the hand-drawn panels into something that avoids falling into the uncanny valley, but only just.Andy Serkis makes a good Captain Haddock, and Jamie Bell a good Tintin, both of whom are a very unlikely pairing -- the former an alcoholic, and the latter an almost goody-two-shoes reporter with no real defining characteristics; that can be forgiven, of course, as that's what he was like in the comics, and it fits the character well enough.My only huge gripe with this movie is, can Paramount, Columbia, et al please make and release the sequel?P.S. I see I'm writing the 500th review here. That should round things up nicely.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A wonderful ""Indiana Jones"" caliber adventure","Animated films, having emerged from the shadows of second-tier theatrical status by the likes of Pixar, still derive their elemental success or failure from the quality of the writing. The Adventures of TinTin, a swashbuckling adventure adapted from the French comic books of the same name, is a delightful example of how great writing can combine with animated artistry to craft a wonderful film.With the measured guidance of Steven Spielberg as its director, Adventures of TinTin sails effortlessly in a captivating but never overwhelming adventure of intrigue, humor, revenge, and harmless peril. TinTin, with his delightfully realized dog Snowy, exhibits a deft balance of action and story development that makes it impossible to look away as its story unfolds.The story's title character, Tintin, embarks unknowingly on his adventure when nefarious characters become darkly fascinated with his purchase of a model ship from a street vendor. Realizing there is more to their interest than the ship itself, Tintin follows his instincts in a rousing worldwide adventure replete with fascinating characters, delightfully dislikeable bad guys, and a rousing conclusion, all wrapped in an unmistakably ""Indiana Jones"" themed and paced story. Combined with an Oscar-nominated score by the legendary John Williams, TinTin earns a hearty recommendation for adults and children alike.The Adventures of TinTin is a hallmark for Spielberg, who provides a 3D version despite the fact it hardly needs it. A great story, converted into a visual medium by a great director, rarely needs such gimmickry, and TinTin surely falls in that class. You won't have to don 3D glasses to enjoy this fine film.If only others borne of the 3D preoccupation would work so hard to create something even half so good, the entire movie-going world would benefit.Bravo, Tintin!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice try,"Being an avid Tintin fan since my childhood and admiring Steven Spielberg's work, I was really eager to discover this movie and I wasn't deceived.Visually, the movie is very enjoyable to see. It's looking like real characters while it's an animation movie. The Unicorn ship is a pure beauty.Concerning the plot, I was disturbed at first because it's not the story I read in the comic books but I have to say that the events are really combining well giving the story some sense. A few characters are missing but I didn't expect them to appear like Professeur Tournesol. Maybe we'll enjoy to see him in the next sequel.The only thing I maybe complain about is the tempo which is a bit low. Some moments are really sleepy and boring. But in overall, it's a nice try and a great tribute to Herge legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stupendous visual work!,"It may be considered as one of the weakest directorial in Spielberg's filmography, and people may have had their differences in opinions about the film's eventual output but I think we can all agree on one point which is, it looks quite astonishing from a visual point of view.Even after twelve long years, amidst the unimaginable heights, we, humans have achieved from a technical standpoint, the animations still, to this day & age, look amazing and astoundingly beautiful. Colors seem to pop out, the vibrance here is palpable, and on top of all, there are minute details in character design-in short, a fine exhibition of visual craftsmanship!However, the narration heavily falters; it couldn't reach the desired highs, nor was it able to utilize the stakes that were an inherent part of the storyline. And such mediocrity from a director like Spielberg surely came off as a surprise.Nevertheless, I still hope someday we get to witness more parts of TinTin, because they sure deserve live-action adaptations!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Film Review: The Adventures of Tintin,"The Adventures of Tintin is beautiful. Its CGI brings this film to life, as it looks exactly like a live-action film. This film has incredibly loud scenes, including the crashing of water or the sirens of a boat, or even a few scenes including shouting. But those aren't worrying. There is no blood in the film, just brilliant acting and animation but there are scenes of alchoholism. There is a captain on a boat who is addicted to whisky. There are several bottles of whisky on the floor, and you can see the liquid round his face. Tintin is an amazing, beautiful, spectacular, brillaint film and it is one of my favourite films of all time. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good film! But not too sure about la Castafiore.,"I already saw Tintin movie three times. My thought about the Tintin movie was good! The faces of Herge's characters were well made(especially Tintin's face).What I thought was really good is the scene where you see the vision of the Unicorn floating on the sand with water coming out! Steven Spielberg had a really good imagination for this wonderful scene! I also liked the scene where Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock were racing on their motor bike to get their last paper-clue from the Unicorn stolen by their enemies. The racing amused me very much(especially when Tintin gets his motor bike hanging on a electricity line(I THINK it was an electricity line, if it was one)! The racing was my favorite part of the film! This good Captain Haddock is always so funny!!! What made me really laugh was when Haddock was pointing a rocket launcher to blow up the vehicle of his enemies. Unlucky, he did not realize that the weapon was pointing at the wrong side and it shot behind him. You will not believe what incredible disaster he caused with his weapon, hahahahaha!!! Many scenes of the movie were very good! The only scene I wanted to ignore was when la Castafiore, an Italian woman was singing(her voice was so strong that she broke many glasses)! Captain Haddock is the funniest character in the film!! There was a LOT of GOOD actions.But the Thompsons and Haddock have a fat nose(that sounded pretty odd for me). At the end a clue was given that made me think that there will be a second part... Anyway I want to thank Steven Spielberg for the AMAZING,WONDERFUL and GOOD film he made!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can't expect anything less from  Jackson and Spielberg,"First and foremost The Adventures of Tintin is a nice movie which will appeal to both Tintin fans and others.This movie has Spielberg written all over it.It may not have fully followed the comics plot-line by Hergé but it has its heart at right place.It pays great homage to the Tintin series.Hardcore Purists of The Adventures of Tintin may not like this movie, But everyone else will surely enjoy the movie.I found the acting good and the action scenes are overwhelming and breathtaking (a Spielberg classic). This movie is also filled with very genuine humor which I think along with action scenes are the movie's biggest strength.Captain Haddock and snowy are very funny and enjoyable to watch.I watched the movie in IMAX 3D, But If you view this in 2D you wont miss much, as there isn't much 3D effect except for some scenes.The motion-capture used for the movie is very photo realistic and you can even see the sweat clearly on the face of Captain Haddock in one particular scene.The animation quality is top notch and all the characters look very convincing and real, even though they are modeled after their comic book counterparts.Now I see why Jackson said that the film will look ""film noirish, very atmospheric"". Spielberg acquired rights for the movie 1983 and in 2011 he has gone all-out to leave no stone unturned.So to ramp it up, Positive points about this movies are Action Scenes, Humor , Great Animation quality (Both the characters and the atmosphere). Only negative point would be the plot-line which Hardcore Purists fans of comics may not like.This is the only thing that may push it back from the great status to good.But for me Its a great film as a Jackson and Spielberg union movie should be and should definitely be watched in the theater.I am looking forward to see the next sequel with Peter Jackson as its co-director.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poorest Storytelling for Audiences,"After I finished watching this movie I still couldn't understand what was the story? Visually I can see it but it was empty its like they spent so much time to make it visually appeasing that they didn't bother putting a story in at all.In this movie everyone is carrying a MP40 as if it was widely available, motorbike with side carriage chase scene was identical to H.Ford and S.Connery and that tank just came out of nowhere, with an arch ontop of it? Captain Haddock became a drunk scott, they used too many puns in one sentence at times, felt like he was a liability instead of a helping hand, wont mention too much about the plane scene 'physics' burp for fuel?, crane wars? what were they thinking. Even the pirate scene didn't help there was more to it than just that. All the characters were better portrayed in the cartoon than the movie they don't have them all like the professor. I remember the twins Thomson and Thompson kept changing their disguises, Haddock had hiccups (*hic*) when he was drinking, snowy was more adorable had thought bubbles on dogbones or what would happen to him or trying to explain to tintin what he was saying. Tintin was not much of a sleuth in this movie everything just happened to fall into his lap, originally I'm sure he sometimes said ""lets search for clues"" and he pulls out a magnifying glass and starts elaborating on his findings etc and each clue would lead to another, which was better told in the comics than the movie.Its so bad you could fall asleep, the only thing good was the introduction with the paintings reminiscent of Tintin and in one scene tintin had just one bullet to take down an airplane that was so funny in a corny way.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bit of a kids version of Indiana Jones and it's good,"Despite the slight hype that went into this movie, I didn't find this movie to be all that great. But it's still a pretty darn good adventure movie that kids and adults can enjoy, in fact it's a good family flick. I could also tell a lot of effort has be put into this movie and the animation is really well done. I never even knew about the comic book that this movie is based and although the comics came out in 1929. It still has that modern feel to it that seemed well fitted into the movie. Maybe Steven Spielberg was a fan of this comic to the point he decided to make a full animated CGI movie of it which is understandable. I would too as well if I was a director and was a fan of a series of something while growing up. Again I didn't find this movie to be amazing or anything but it's a pretty good adventure movie that is worth taking the whole family to see.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A matinée adventure close to Hergé's spirit,"The dynamic duo of Spielberg and Jackson has done a very nice job here, bringing to simulated life the adventures of a young reporter and his always-drunk captain sidekick to find secret plans of treasure in a bottled ship.There is plenty of adventure for young and old unfamiliar with Tintin, and of course a trip to childhood memories for those who know the comic books. There's every reason to hope Jackson will direct a sequel. Hergé took pains to explore very different aspects of comic story-telling in different Tintin books, so every one of these sequels could stand own its own, like the better James Bond movies.Tintin comes off as the same 'Everyman' seen in the books; a character almost anyone can smoothly identify with, and who made the reader feel 'hmmm, maybe I could do that, too.' No superheroes in sight, even though many of the adventures are pretty crazy.The PG rating is spot on, with a few deaths off-screen and some blood, nothing the 8+ crowd cannot handle. As in any good adventure film viewable by children, the heroes Tintin and Haddock never kill anyone (even when it appears so for a moment), although they fight and shoot with abandon. As in any good adventure film viewable by adults, there are some interesting characters and some plot and visual ideas you probably have not seen in any other film before. Snowy (Tintin's trusted dog) in particular gets some of these going. He's his own little 'silent dog movie' built into the greater adventure. If you go to see it twice, just focus on Snowy, and you'll see what I mean.The visuals are extraordinarily well done. Their character matches the comic strip from title sequence to final credits about as well as you could hope to match the inimitable Hergé. Serkis knows motion capture acting. The 3-D was never annoying (well, one gratuitous cane- swing excepted), and I am easily annoyed by 3-D.It gets 'only' a 7/10 because the plot alternates a little too much between almost stalling at times (in the characterization scenes), then taking off too frenetically (in the plentiful and fanciful chase scenes); and because character development could have been a little better (but the comics don't do it in a single book, either...). I left the theater as a very satisfied moviegoer.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fun-filled adventure.,"The long gestating love-child of Steven Spielberg (directing) and Peter Jackson (producing), Tintin is unquestionably the most hyped motion picture released on Boxing Day in Oz this year, partially to its detriment. Utilising performance-capture animation for the first time, Spielberg has given himself the opportunity to craft some visually wonderful sequences – the chase at the beginning of the last act is terrific – but unfortunately can't quite concoct a story that matches. Regardless, Jamie Bell and mo-cap legend Andy Serkis share a pleasant chemistry as Tintin and Captain Haddock respectively, whilst the boy reporter's loyal dog Snowy is an excellent sidekick. The undercooked premise and failing comedic duo Thomson and Thompson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) aside, this is a fun-filled adventure worthy of a trip to the cinema, be it with your mates or with your little nippers.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely terrible. Nearly fell asleep.,"I'm not going to mention too much about this film due to being so disappointed with this film. Like many, I grew up reading the comic books as a child and then later in my teenage years the cartoon. What can you say about this film. Positive points is that the graphics are far superior than ever before. It really looks real life and the expression of each character is brilliant. Straight away you know that it is tin tin, pardon the orange tinge to his hair. I am very sure he was kind of blonde right? Anyway.... we decided to watch the 3D version. Oh yeah. 3D.......Back to it. Positive points only is the fantastic graphical presentation throughout the film. I can not fault it one bit.Now, the bad thing. The whole film. I nearly fell asleep. Roughly at 30 minutes, I had to move around to keep myself awake! Oh no. I had another 1hr 10 minutes of this film to go through. I am not being funny! 1hr 10 minutes. My head was telling me, another 30 minutes the film will pick up. Yes..... actually no.1hr 40 minutes later, I felt I was robbed of my life. I'm not joking. I thought it was the worse film this year. I am not kidding.Now for the 3D. 3D... another gimmick and another big con. I'm sorry but if this film was not considered to be 3d, leave it as it is. Why oh why! The trailer looked 3d but this film surely not so. If I was you and you are desperate to watch the film, stick the digital 2d version.All in all, the one point is for the amazing attempt of the graphical presentation of the film. Pity about the film.

pros/cons from a fan of the comic books,"yes, I did enjoy most of this movie. Considering myself as someone who knows the books, backgrounds, chronology etc. by heart I would like to point out, where this movie fails and where not - just imho of course!pros: - bringing the characters and images to life like this is nothing less but what I would call a great and impressive success! - directing/blending over to the background story works perfectly and is as smooth as it could get! - many references for fans honoring tintin's and Herge'e background. - opening sequence including introduction of Tintin in the beginning works fine! A deep bow for the books and their creator! (though it feels like just another spielberg'esque opening title... don't get me wrong: it worked perfectly! was just nothing new or rare to see...) - references to other books of the series worked just fine withing the situations! - the story preserved and worked on several layers and location together. - The music felt perfect! Original, appropriate and supporting! No annoying pop-songs just to sell soundtracks!cons: - I still don't see any reason to go for 3D but to make piracy harder to film off the silver screen... it barely adds anything to the movie. It makes everything just darker, which I don't appreciate... Furthermore it seems to make filmmakers go crazy about pointy and flying objects... so far it only worked for me in Tron because it added dimension to the story, literally. - Though the books have their origin in the slapstick comedy in the 1920s it is a little overdone here. But that might be a matter of personal preference. - Haddock is a little to vulgar with his alcohol issues... running on fumes... well... those situations are what I would consider as clearly overstepping the boundaries of the originals... - mixing several stories felt a little bumpy and less thought through... more like a collage with more or less hard edges... - Spielberg... to put this the most respectful and diplomatic way: his way of story telling is absolutely nothing for me! I don't like being told what I see, I don't need characters to think aloud about what is going on... to be fair: he did worse in the past... still: if you need to explain what is going on, if you need off voices or repetition: please consider questioning the approach of directing in first place! - The whole story was cut down to pure adventure and treasure hunt, without leaving room for any deeper connotations...I was excited when I learned that Moffat would write the script, honestly: I see his work based of the last two seasons of Doctor Who much more skeptical... I was not happy about Spielbergs involvement, though there might not have been any way around him for this project... after Indy and his long time involvement in the making/holding the rights... At least, and last but not least: I believe we all have to thank Peter Jackson for his impact on this work! Visually great and as faithful to the comic books as possible! Sadly Moffat seems not to care about plausibility nor about continuity and Spielberg did not care to fix this...So it is just like with too many others: watch with your eyes only and skip all other parts of your head. If you are not familiar with Tintin at all: have a great time with a fine piece of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"My Belgian Friend, Tintin!","Last Sunday, sister 28, brother-in-law 32 and me 24; three of us all adults went to watch the latest Spielberg film ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"", we put some extra-large glasses in our eyes; the experience to watch a WETA digital animated motion picture technology in 3D is superb. John Williams' sound composition for the motion picture purpose is awesome.Tintin is a legendary detective and journalist boy character by Herge. I was a kid, only 3, my sister and neighbor sister Lucy, both were 6 and they were good playmates. Lucy was my first love to introduce and love Tintin. Her father has two children, both are beautiful girls and every year they go to Calcutta international Book Fair, they bought TINTINs. It was in 1989; I was first introduced with the Belgian friend, ""The Calculus Affair"" or ""Calculus Er Kando"" – in Bengali is the first face-to-face introduction with all the evergreen characters from the history of creation.In those days I was too little to understand the heavy ideas that Herge put into those large glossy papers. I like Tintin, his looks; Captain Archibald Haddock, ""Billions of blue blistering barnacles!""; Thomson and Thompson, their foolish intelligence and the smartest little ""Snowy"" or ""Kuttus"" is better known to me. I draw several poses and still keep those paintings with care. ""Tintin in Tibet"" was my first self-collection, that I saved from daily tiffin money in the school days to buy one by one in every month, it last only up to 6 of the books. Then a partnership collection with my classmate Arunava Roy, we pay half and half to read the complete series. ""Tintin and the Lake of Sharks"", was the last book we bought together.I always look for the cheapest collection of Tintin and it was ""Anandomela"" – a leading teenage monthly in Bengal. They publish in two or three bunch edition in their magazines. I unpin those pages and set them into one single comic book edition. It was a huge part of my collection too. ‎ Dibyendu Nandi, my neighbor brother, he has the book ""The Castafiore Emerald"" (""Panna Kothai"" – in Bengali) I took it and didn't returned him for several months, finally he asked for the branch. I was intentionally waiting for his forgetfulness to grow up my collections but the trick didn't worked. The last book I read when I was 17, ""In the Land of the Soviets""; it takes time because it was the costliest of the whole series.Recently, it was an exciting conversation with Premjit Nath, on 13 November at 14:38Me: Yesterday I see both ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Immortals"" in 3D and my suggestion, attend them only in 3D the experience, just unforgettable!Premjit Nath: If pocket allows only one; then which one?Me: ‎Premjit da, Tintin TinTin I grow up enjoying this character so much, and Spielberg always fulfills the huge expectations of entertainment. Lots of unforgettable memories and emotions related with our Belgium friend Can't betray ""Tintin""!Premjit Nath: Agreed can't betray our childhood friend.About the film; people around the world read Tintin is well known about The Adventure of the Unicorn. So nothing to say special. And who didn't know Tintin, I am keeping the story in secret to watch and invent the adventures themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Pedestrian adventure film, but at least it has Tintin","Some have described this movie as ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" with Tintin, but to me it doesn't really have the charm of something like the Indiana Jones movies. I don't know precisely what it is, maybe I just need my explosions to be in live action for them to work. The animation techniques used in this film are absolutely excellent, but when your writing is this mediocre the whole motion capture thing seems like nothing more than a gimmick. Speaking of useless gimmicks, what is up with the 3D-effects in this movie? Or rather, where are they? When you're forcing yourself to pay extra and watch an entire movie wearing those glasses nobody likes, you at least demand that there will be some things flying into your face. Forget it, unless you count subtitles. It's not all bad though. The actors for instance are very good, particularly Andy Serkis as Haddock. The movie also manages to strike the exact tone the comic books had, it's pretty faithful to the original and you can tell the makers love the source material. Furthermore, it can also be very witty sometimes, which is something you may not expect. Overall it's pretty entertaining and I had fun, ""Tintin"" is a decent popcorn flick without being anything special.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing animation!,"I thought this was fantastic, the animation was incredible. These characters were so life like it was amazing! I remember watching TinTin growing up and I did love the bumbling Thompson and Thomson so to have them played by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg was the icing on the cake.Meeting Captain Haddock was hilarious as he is drunk and this is when he is the most on the ball. TinTin, well he is TinTin and he is fab! We watched this as a family movie, once a week with snacks, and it was a good choice. Mini-me really enjoyed it, not always getting the jokes but she will do.There was a lot of laughing mainly because Haddock was played so well, he too is a bit bumbly at times. It really did bring back my childhood memories with this one, and the tale of the Unicorn well that is what managed to persuade us to get mini-me to watch it.I really can't get over the animation on this it was truly amazing, but then I expected nothing less from two of my favourite directors! What a duo. We are taken across land, sea, desert and even a bit of the sky! It was amusing and thrilling with a lot of action and I know I am looking forward to the next one!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Drunken master and the Tintin the Kid,"The first motion-capture adventure into the world of blond-haired blue-eyed reporter Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell), Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and fox terrier Snowy throws us into the remarkable secret of the Unicorn. Engulfed by the fantastic imagination of Belgian artist Georges Remi we travel the world by sea, by plane or by foot, traversing through vast waters, deadly deserts or the mysteries of the streets of London. All in search of a treasure map leading to the gold from the Unicorn, the sunken ship of Sir Francis Haddock. Along the way evildoer Sakharine (Daniel Craig) attempts to foil the youngster's plan and claim glory for himself.A spectacular and engaging experience in computer enhanced animation based on tremendous motion capture trumps ""Avatar"" given its vastly superior story and likable characters. Pinned down to perfection every scene is a feast for the eye, unremittingly fast-paced and entertaining. Be it following the exploits of a wrist-happy kleptomaniac in a London market or a duel between 20 metre high cranes Tintin never drops a beat delivering on a promise of high-octane adventure.Steven Spielberg manages to keep Tintin as fresh as cuisine sushi, destined for the household of every movie-lover irrespective of age, race or back-ground. Nonetheless Tintin fails to grasp the animal magnetism of his soul-mate Indiana Jones, while the boyish charm does wear thin with time, albeit this is thankfully counterpointed with the drunkard crass character of Captain Haddock, who ignites immediate engagement. Nonetheless the love affair with perfection does have its downsides, as the story delivers an overdose of action, leaving a sense of fulfilment of expectations about half-way through the movie and a lingering hope for final credits soon after. The story itself is essential fun, but wanton of unexpected thrills given the limited charm of the title character. A clash with destiny on the future of filmmaking is nonetheless an unabashed success, albeit one fraught with the stigma of pure unabated enjoyment bereft of deeper content. Nonetheless Spielberg rides his storm with pizazz delivering us into an ultimately charming world of adventure and fun straight from the drawings of Remi.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"epic fail, I expected anything better","this was the least entertaining film I've seen in a long time. I never read a Tintin book, I don't know the story, I just knew Spielberg knows how to make great films and went blindly in to experience something great. It was horrible. From start to finish, I felt like I was watching TV on Nick Jr., nothing compelling in the story, nothing funny about it even though they throw bad joke after bad joke at you relentlessly.Don't get me wrong, if you are taking a 6-9 year old to this movie, you are in the right boat. And it is a great technical example of what they can do with digital rendering and 3-D. Just don't expect much depth or something that'll last in your head or heart. It's like a teenager wrote this, not a professional artist.It was a total waste of an evening out with my wife who felt exactly the same about the movie. I'm generally open and forgiving, but this was an epic fail.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
just OK,"Knowing that Spielberg and Jackson were involved I expected the animation to be at a level not seen before - and it was. But I feared that the storytelling would be mediocre - and it was. You just wish these guys who can pour unfathomable sums of money into a film could make it a little more engaging. I guess showering a screenwriter with gold coins ain't necessarily gonna pay off the way pouring money into the animation would. Kung Fu Panda is the only animated film I've seen with a good script, wish there were more. But this was OK and I actually wouldn't object to a sequel.

It's so magical.If you have never heard of Tintin before, you'll fall in love with the boy reporter after this. And if you're a fan of the books, your only disappointment would be the short length of the film! Even though I knew the story from the book, I admired the way they've re-told the story. The adding and splicing of certain things made the story more fluid, I think.I gave it a 9/10 because the score wasn't as grand as I'd hoped, and the fact that Snowy didn't have spoken lines, unlike in the book.Highly recommended.

"Incredibly exciting, dull ending","First off, I have never read any Tintin comics, so this is by no means a comparison. On the whole, this movie is tremendous.The CGI is brilliant, the action scenes are gripping, the characters are funny and likable, the story is clever and the animation is flawless.My one complaint for this movie, is the ending. They left the movie open for a sequel, resulting in a somewhat dull anticlimax. The movie was very exciting and thoroughly enjoyable, but I left feeling a bit disappointed, due to the blunt and boring ending. All the action seems to happen, and then we are left with this action-less, dull climax to wrap everything up, and it does the movie as a whole no good.Apart from the ending though, this movie is exciting, funny and an overall quality film. I recommend this to anyone, as the vast majority of this film is superb, but I did leave feeling somewhat disappointed with the ending.But maybe that's just my bad feelings for sequels. If you leave a movie buzzing and excited for the sequel, instead of disappointed by a loose ending, you'll love this film, but personally, a sequel won't be for me.Overall great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An awesome swashbuckling adventure movie for the whole family,"Does it seem to anyone else the days of making high quality CGI movies is over. Everything these days is really cartoony or cell shaded, it feels like it's been awhile since I have seen a ""realistic"" full length cgi movie.You can tell right away that this is high quality by the animation style and the detail. It starts off a little slow as you get introduced to the characters.There is some violence and mature themes like drinking alcohol and if you have a sensitive little like mine the fight scenes might be too much for them. Having said that anyone who likes adventure/mystery movies would probably enjoy this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not perfect, but recommendable to long-time fans and new audiences alike","ANIMATION 8/10
very well done, Haddock and the Thomson's look very well done. Also the villains are well done. They strike a perfect balance between realistic and cartoony. Although for me full on cartoony would have been fine.Bobby or Snowy looks good, it takes a second to get used to him, but yeah that is him.Tintin however misses the mark, he looks to realistic and throughout the movie it never really is something that I expect viewers to get used to. Also the imagination and liberties taken with the main villain are great.VOICE ACTING 10/10
not a lot to add here, it's very well done and the Thompson's really excel. Captain Haddock has a Scottish accent and it really works on himSTORYTELLING 5/10
It's a mixture of one story with heavy element of other two other stories. And it well done. But somehow it feels like an action movie with sometimes the jokes shoved in there. And this might be due to style that is chosen. Like it is all visually very well done. But somehow the film does not suck you in. Tintin needs more wittiness and the story needs more intrigue and even the pace should be slowed down. They could have bored elements for two titles or just one and tell more of the story with more detail. That would probably cost some of the action, but that's probably were this movie goes wrong. Tintin is about the adventure not only action.I don't mind departing from the story, but in a sequel they need to keep it in the Tintin vibe.NOTE: STEVEN SPIELBERG
The adventure vibe is real, some of the scene reminisce of Indiana Jones and even the music behind it gives that feeling of a 80s adventure movie.CONCLUSION 7/10
This film is recommendable for every (European) youth fan of the comic. It's amazing to see it come to the big screen, BUT to make an even bigger impact we need MORE and we need more emotion. Walking away from this film I expect the sentiment to be: we wanna more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth your time. Not so sure about the story line.,"I'm a huge Tintin fan (the books) and have read those books over and over again and I know them like the back of my hands. I've been so excited to watch the movie since it was announced.Whether it's brilliant or not, I have mixed feelings.First of all, Spielberg and Jackson are among my favorites and yes they have done a good job. The film is very entertaining and the animation is remarkable. You can be satisfied with the movie and think it was worth your money. However as a hardcore Tintin fan I didn't like the fact they changed the story and even the characters. I felt that Tintin's and Captain Haddock's personalities were extremely different from the books. They have changed them to bring humor, entertainment and even flow to the changed storyline. I also felt they went overboard with trying to make the movie funny.Beside those issues which I'm sure I'm the only one who has them with this movie as a fan of the books, it did not feel like a waste of time. Many people don't mind watching it again (which is a good sign). Great animation! Spielberg and Jackson did not disappoint me. :) Seven stars because I wasn't happy with the changed story. Thumbs up!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny and action packed,"I thought the movie was good. There is a lot of action/mystery Tintin is like a young Sherlock Holmes, he is not afraid of danger, he can fight with the best of them. He sees clues no one else sees and follows up on them. The character are all animated and very funny one character the main villain Rackham some times looks human. There are some funny parts one I liked where Tintin in a prisoner on a ship and fights the criminals with corks of wine that hit the men like rocks.Steven Spielberg did a good job on this movie.(the bad character Rackham looked like him) The scenes of past with ships on the sea and battles were amazing The voice actor for Tintin played by Jamie Bell was clear and understandable. Snowy the dog was another helper to his master.There is a lot of drinking, from some characters, fighting etc. Better for someone 14 or over. The mouth movement and sound were really good with the animation.Keeps you on edge, I almost didn't make it.",,Anonymous,Animation
An Enjoyable Yet Underwhelming Animation,"While Tintin is a fun, exciting film, I had expected more given the creative team involved in this movie, including Steven Spielberg as director, Edgar Wright as co-writer and Peter Jackson as a producer.The movie begins with a fantastic title sequence, magnificently scored by John Williams, which sets the tone for the film to come. Although I had not read the source material by Hergé, I was certainly aware of it and appreciated the wonderful nod to the original, iconic, two-dimensional artistry of the comic books which took place during Tintin's introduction scene. From here, the movie quickly distinguishes itself from what came before, with the motion capture animation feeling fresh and inventive.This motion capture technology from Weta Digital works very well here. All human characters are easily able to display genuine emotion on their computer-generated faces, never feeling lifeless or distracting. While the human characters are beautifully realised and have a somewhat realistic look to them, the animals feel closer to standard cartoon animation. Moments featuring a cat and a herd of cows stood out from the rest of the films visual look. Even Snowy did not seem to be rendered as well as Tintin or his human counterparts, although his presence is never distracting.The cast is excellent, with Jamie Bell doing a great job of bringing the titular character to life. And while it was nowhere near their best collaborations, it is always great to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on screen together. It was also fun to watch Daniel Craig give an enjoyably villainous performance. It is mo-cap master Andy Serkis, however, as Captain Haddock, who is the heart of the story, getting the only real character arc in the film.While the movie was entertaining and engaging throughout, the ending was slightly anticlimactic. It ends abruptly on a cliff-hanger, without any real resolution. This is incredibly frustrating since we are still waiting on a sequel almost ten years after its release.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it!,"I got to love Tintin when I lived in France. As far as I recall, there were Tintin cartoons on TV in the UK when I was a small child (late 60s?) and I certainly enjoyed them. But the books are truly, truly wonderful (as most reading this will know all too well already!). My French became pretty fluent as I lived in Paris and reading in the original language only added to the pleasure.That said, I feel that those who are missing out on the pleasures of the film by comparing it with the books are, well, missing out! Of course it's almost a cliché, 'the film is a disappointing rendition of the book'. This may often be true, but usually only because people who have read the book obviously come to the movie with expectations: I saw all the Harry Potter films (on DVD), for instance, then (inspired by the experience) read all the books. Then I watched all the films again. The books win hands down (in spite of my admiration for Daniel Radcliffe). But my impressions of the films were influenced the second time around by remembering the books. I liked them better on my first go. But I am stating the obvious here....So, all these comparisons with the 'bandes désinées', whilst understandable, are a bit of a red herring (or do I mean. a 'red haddock'?) IMHO. Yes, the film has some things I didn't get (too much Haddock and not enough Tintin, I agree) But watch the film as an artwork (and it is that, I think) in its own right and how can you not love it?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good in parts...,"It's all very well made with state of the art animation and motion capture to the fore. All the performances were very good with Andy Serkis standing out as Captain Haddock. It did, however, feel like a series of set pieces stitched together by a rather flimsy adventure story. Far too much is left to coincidence for anything to be credible I'm afraid, which is probably why I wasn't really a fan of the Tintin stories in the first place. Over all, it didn't quite work for me; however, I would be interested to see what they do with the next instalment.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)My score: 6.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Does the name no harm,"So as a 17 year old, I grew up after Tintin was big but i was always a fan, but making it now a lot of the audience would not know exactly what Tintin is about. When i heard Spielberg and Jackson were involved i was extremely excited and then the trailers came out it was right up there as one of my most anticipated movies for the holidays.The motion capture animation is absolutely astounding, i saw this in 3-D and even though usually I'm not taken back by the new, high tech fads but it was beautifully done and there were some incredible effects made. It's obvious that Spielberg and Jackson had a huge amount of fun making some awesome transition shots and beyond imaginable action scene which were so out of this world but just purely entertaining.There is a few issues with this film though. At time the dilogue is rather stilted and seemed really unnatural. The big issue though is the pacing of this film, it goes from huge-faced pace scene to slow, wandering shots that just can get rather irritating, but it only becomes really bad with about 15 minutes left in the film.The jokes in this are brilliant, Thompson and Thomson have some incredible humour, while the small, subtle jokes are easily the ones that take the cake. Its definitely got a lot that kids will enjoy, with quite a lot of slapstick, but there is a lot of long speeches that might be a bit confusing for the really young kids, i say maybe only take kids 10 and up to this one.This is the first film i have seen in the cinemas since the first Harry Potter Deathly hallows came out and this was definitely a film that i was proud to see. If you are a fan of the comic books you will definitely agree it does no harm to them, and they have done great to try and bring it to a new generation. This could be a big franchise and i recommend it highly, its not the greatest film ever, but its certainly worth the cash and time. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin at 10:10,"I saw this movie last night at 10:10pm. It was truly a great movie. Yes, it is not photo-realistic like, for example, Avatar, but is it motion-capture heaven! When Spielburg does his trademark ""rush close-up to the eyes, you see the wrinkles and even the translucent fuzz on the face of Tinti. The set designs the art work and the action as well as the drama parts are well done and crafted.Ah, the music. I have to admit that if it were not the masterful music of John Williams ting the scenes together and pushing the plot long the story would have been lost. At times when the plot slows down and it is looking for either a way out or to change in a different direction, John Williams music comes to the rescue.I have grown up on the movie of Spielburg and the music of John Willimas and I have seen all of the movies, I have to say that they have a working symbiotic relationship to film making. When one needs help the other is there to provide assistance. A question comes to mind, can Spielburg make a movie without that symbiotic relationship with John Williams? Can the filmmaker survive with the composer? Oh, yes, the story line. It maybe that the story is based on 2 or even 3 of Tintin adventures, but what a masterfully telling of it all. Some will be against about it, but remember just like Lemmony Snicket where that have to interweave 3 books together to make a movie longer, besides the adventures of Tintin were times interrelated like any good serial are. The writers had to intertwine the stories together to make and sensible whole. If they were to make a movie out of one, like some people will say that it should be done that way, then it will be a ""short movie"" and not a ""feature movie"". Now what fun will that be that you have to come back to the theater to see part two, three, etc. Yes, it will be a great money maker but it will destroy the theme of the movie and the story line.) So even though have not read Tintin, or have not even heard of Tintin, this is an excellent introduction to him and his adventure.Why 8 out of 10 stars? At times (rearely) the story stumbles and if it were not the music of John Williams to the rescue, we would have been lost in the thicket.Long live Snowy!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
not sure what all the fuss was about,"Saw this while spending Christmas stateside with my in-laws.I was asked if Tintin was really big in England. I said no. Most of the fasmily seem to think Britain loves Tintin so I guess this was some marketing ploy for the US. To be honest in the UK my family never goes to the movies for Christmas but when in Rome.Anyhoo I had read some euphoric reviews on here so my expectations were quite high. All I can say is that the reviews were either by fanboys or studio plants because I found Tintin to be a dry experience.Surprisingly given the names involved the cinema was less than a third full. There wasn't much reaction except to one striking scene. Obviously I'm far too old for Tintin but I got the impression that some younger viewers- not from my party- were not into it.Oh well, even if the flick was weak a Xmas visit to the pictures made a welcome change of pace.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" if Indy was young and Belgian","Spielberg digitally exercises his penchant for highly elaborate action sequences in this adaptation of the Belgian serial cartoon. The media allows the director to supersize these set pieces to epic proportions including floods and entwined flying sailing ships. Your reaction to the movie will largely depend on whether you find such rapidly unrolling mayhem exhilarating or tiresome. One suspects the film will split somewhat along gender lines with boys, in particular, finding the flying machines and crashing cars to be a good time. A note to parents that the action here, like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", is served up with a pretty healthy degree of gunfire and alcohol consumption by Captain Haddock and, oddly, Tintin's dog ""Snowy."" If the film has the feel of ""Raiders"", it surreptitiously cribs the entire main action sequence from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" In fact, the use of digit special effects, the presence of pirates and entangled, burning boats make the sequences difficult to tell apart. In short, the film isn't quite the ""event"" that Spielberg envisioned but it is solidly entertaining in that old-fangled cliffhanger serial way.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Adventures of Tintin (2011) - Adventure + Mystery + Spielberg = AWESOME!,"Director Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson has teamed up to make a film adaptation of the classic comic book series of 'Tintin' by Herge'. This movie is like a crossover of Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" movies with Sherlock Holmes. Now, we are left with ""The Adventures of Tintin"", and I'm surprised that this movie did not get nominated for Best Animated Feature Film this year. This is an entertaining and beautiful adaptation of a colorful comic book series. With the use of motion capture animation, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" makes the animation look crystal clear perfect, compared to ""Mars Needs Moms"", when they use this animation in a creepy profession. Jamie Bell plays Tintin, a young journalist, who tries to unlock the mystery of the lost treasure of a lost pirate ship, called 'the Unicorn'. With a scene-stealing puppy named ""Snowy"" on his side, Tintin then teams up with Captain Haddock, portrayed by Andy Serkis, the motion-capture genius that brought us Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"", King Kong in the 2005 remake, and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes (Rise). Haddock is a permanently drunk sea captain, whose the ancestors of his past might be a clue to get to the lost treasure, before his arch-enemy, Rackham, portrayed by Daniel Craig, finds it first. We also get some comic relief from the hilarious Thompson twins, portrayed by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. Watching this movie from start to finish, is quite a wonder. I love those type of adventure stories, crossed over with a crime-mystery tale. The animation is such a wonder, the action scenes are just awesome, and the acting is just superb. Jamie Bell is clever as Tintin, Andy Serkis is awesome as Haddock, and Daniel Craig is good as the evil Rackham. The only thing that bothered me was there were some scenes in this movie that were not quite suitable for family audiences. There are scenes were people actually die, and some scenes include alcoholism and violence. That's not suitable for a child. The rest of this movie is super wonderful. This is a magical and entertaining motion picture that only Steven Spielberg can make. If you're in the mood for a family-fun, action-adventure, and crime- mystery Spielberg movie, then batter up! ""The Adventures of Tintin"", in my review, ""a fun and entertaining adventure-mystery flick"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A film true to the atmosphere of the comic strip,"When Peter Jackson (producer) and Steven Spielberg (producer and director) team up to make a movie, can the result be anything different than great? Maybe not, but they had set themselves a big challenge in adapting a comic strip, a comic strip from a non American (Belgian) culture on top of that.The key decision in adapting a comic strip to film is how realistic the film ought to be. Jackson and Spielberg decided that the background would be very realistic but the characters remain cartoon characters. They were probably right.Danger in adopting a comic strip from a non American culture is that some nuances are lost in translation. This danger is certainly not imaginary by Steven Spielberg, always keen on making movies that are suitable for the whole family. ""The adventures of Tin Tin"" certainly is suitable for the whole family, but (fortunately) not all sharp edges have been polished away. Catptain Haddock still is a raw sea bonk drinking too much.Weak point of the film is that the plot is overcrowded, which is not amazing when one knows that the film combines the stories of three comic albums.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A stunning addition to motion capture feature films.,"Spielberg is not only a film director he is a film GOD! The films this man has created down the years have become instant classics and films which are dear in many peoples hearts.His latest project Tin Tin, is a true Spielberg movie in almost every sense of the word. If you are looking for a fun and exciting adventure story with excellent chase scenes and comical one liners with a tongue in cheek approach to the genre then you are in for a treat.The motion capture is far superior to the likes of Polar Express or Christmas Carol and the characters are much more believable as people.Go and see this for 107 minutes of pure unashamed family fun! Well done Steven, looking forward to War Horse",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
As its title suggests: Adventure!,"As the title suggests, i was prepared to join Tintin in a ride of adventure.Voiced by Jamie Bell as Tintin, he bought a model ship which hid clues that ultimately forced him into a feud between two families (Haddock voiced by Andy S and Sakharine voiced by Daniel C) in search for the hidden treasure. Tintin with his adorable pet Snowy, investigated the mystery surrounding them, deciphering the clues along the way and met Haddock after his kidnap by Sakharine. They escaped and raced against time and Sakharine to retrieve all three pieces of the puzzle. In the start, it felt like an animated Sherlock Holmes with Snowy playing Watson. When they boarded the ship, it felt like Narnia 3: Voyage of the Dawn Treader and when Haddock recalled the story his grandfather told him, the scenes pictured that of Pirates of the Caribbean. Not that it wasn't good or original, but just that the scenes felt familiar.I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic and visual of the movie. The faces of the characters looked so real i had to remind myself that it was an animation. One of my favourite scenes in the movie was when Tintin and his gang were in Morocco and they were running away, at the same time snatching the scrolls, from Sakharine's men and bird. It flowed well with fast-paced action and humour. Another scene that captured my attention was the fight between Haddock and Sakharine using cranes. It was intense yet entertaining to watch.How could an animation movie like this go wrong? It doesn't. It is a progressive story with mystery intertwined that blends well action with adventure, humour with intensity. Good visual and adorable characters. I was dumbfounded that Tintin was not a kid and what i thought to be a childish movie had the characters holding guns. I was wrong, but i was, to say the least, pleased. The adventures of Tintin gets a green light!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great productions values but the story had me irritated more than once,"I have been a tintin fan since I was six years old but this movie destroyed the story elements completely.Steven Spielberg decided to mix and match two different stories into one and for someone who has not seen any Tintin it might work well.But for me who have seen the animated series and read the comics I was furious.So much was changed storywise and I could not understand why and way to much slapstick humor that just hurt to watch, some funny elements but mostly it felt forced.But despite this I have to say the production value was great fantastic animation, that is going to have pixar feeling more than a little shaken.I just wished they stayed true to Herge's story",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visual-Serkism,"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn I am bedazzled! It was a ride alright. Even the Ferari roller coaster ride in Abu Dhabi wouldn't make me this dizzy. Yes...Tintin makes his arrival in a visual extravaganza.Some say 'Looks can be deceiving'. And I say 'I have been deceived!' The visual detail is so engrossing that it gave me goosebumps every other second that the story got lost in the milieu. Then by the time I regained my consciousness I was in the middle of some desert being attacked by Pirates of the Caribbeaniesque(Part 3) hallucinations. Have I gone nuts! Apparently not.Well this is what I have to say. The basic story of the movie is taken from three Tintin comics and it stays loyal (Edgar Wright was part of the Screenplay team \m/). The adventure is something along the lines of Indiana Jones with no Pit-Stops whatsoever. Jump-Run-Hit-Swim-Cut-Copy- Paste goes the format. Since Tintin is an iconic character, there is no much demand for showing the type of character he is. But present it to someone who doesn't have an inkling of who Tintin is...Alas, the characters come across as cardboard cut outs with a shady plot-line that is hard to keep up with.Andy Serkis proves that he can act as a normal human being also and that too with absolute perfection.All in all...it is visual romp with sprinkles of Tintin and Serkism added to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
How could this not be nominated for Best Animated Picture?,"I know it is ""performance capture"" and all, but there are still animators at work here. And they did a terrific job too. Before the Oscar nominations went out, I had one clear winner: This movie as Best Animated Feature. Didn't happen, because it wasn't even nominated. Puss'n'Boots was on the other hand. Really? Nothing against that movie, it's OK, but nominated for best Picture? Really?But back to this. Not only one of the better animated (actually the best I remember seeing in 2011) movies I saw last year, but also one of the best movies in 2011 period. Spielberg did it again. I can't explain how he did it, but the movie works very well. Great comedy and action value, the set pieces work very good. I even remembered some of the comics (characters) from way back when I read some of Tin Tins comics.Of course Tintin and the other characters do have many names in different countries. In Germany he's called Tim (the Dog is called Struppi). The original name of the dog also seems to be Milou and not Snowy (though I have no clue what that would translate to). But no matter what you call them, this movie is awesome",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty fun.,"I'll keep this fairly brief, because I'm about to tackle one of my biggest articles tomorrow: it'll involve ranking every single Steven Spielberg movie, and The Adventures of Tintin was one of the only ones I hadn't yet seen. Thankfully, it was a good deal better than The Terminal and The BFG, which I also watched recently for the purposes of research. It would of course be lovely to get time given to me, by work, to rewatch a few of the older ones, but they're not particularly generous. I take my stuff seriously, and I'm watching them all. But we could have a perfectly Spielberg retrospective if just a little more was thrown my way, and I had a bit more time.I'm ranting about the illogicalities of the job more than the movie. Ah... the movie was good! The adventures of Tintin was much better than both The Terminal and The BFG, and probably better than the also adventurous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, too. Tintin is definitely the best Indiana Jones film of the 21st century so far, that's for sure.The animation took a while to get used to, but it wasn't as creepy as Zemeckis's work in similar departments. I think the commitment to having more cartoonish physics at points helped, as did the brevity and non-stop movement of the story. Even though it's not technically a owner, there's a big action scene near the end of this where the camera follows the action and there no new angle introduced, and the effect was a lot of fun to watch.It's a little funny, it's got some good action, the characters do what they needed to, and it reminded me a little of reading those Tintin comics some 20 years ago now. From the limited amount I can tell, the film captured the spirit and the fun I used to have with those books, so it's a pretty good adaptation and a more than solid adventure film. I was pretty happy with most of this one, so it was nice to get a winner after watching so many less-than-great Spielberg films.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Movie Of The Year,"Steven Spielberg, you have done it again. This is his latest movie (and his first animated one at that) based on the classic Tintin comics created by Herge. Despite the fact that this is his first animated film, Spielberg does not disappoint and actually delivers a fantastic movie. Now, where did the idea for the making of this film start? Mr. Spielberg of course. What's interesting is that he wanted to make it a live action film. So he contacted Peter Jackson of Weta Digital to produce a ""CGI"" Snowy (Tintin's dog). Jackson's reply? That live action wouldn't do it justice. So, the outcome was a motion capture film. Real actors, really acting; covered in a layer of the most realistic animation out there. From Morocco's streets to Captain Haddock's nose hair, the detail is so great that it makes you think: ""Why would they want to make it animated if they bothered with the little things? Why not get real actors?"". Why? Ill tell you why. Because when using animation, you get the real look of the characters without murdering them, without complaints from people that this actor would have been better, or looked more like this character and all that. Now, the movie's plot is taken from three of the original comics. ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", and Red Rackham's Treasure"". The story is fantastic. The cast as well. Now, I'm sure Andy Serkis is going to be in every motion-capture film till the end of his days. Let's see the accomplishment: King Kong- did the real screaming and growling for King Kong; Lord of the Rings-people insisted Serkis be nominated as best actor even though the role was done with motion-capture; Rise of the Planet of the Apes; fantastic job as Caesar; Captain Haddock-full of life, extravagant, one of a kind character. I'm a big fan. Now, people are saying that the movie didn't do the comics justice. I for one, think it did. Sure they weren't ""COMPLETELY"" faithful to the comics in a sense that they merged different comics and all that. But you see, that's the problem with people! They are huge fans of lets say, a comic book. And when they watch the movie, they get angry because they didn't follow every tiny detail. The director and his crew need their artistic freedom! Keeping only the essential and key elements. That's what they did here, and it worked.Directing: Steven Spielberg is great when filming live action. He's much better when it comes to animated films! The way he interpreted the scenes and especially the scene where ******* ******* makes a transition between himself and *** ******* *******. It is fantastic, well played and i cant praise it enough.Effects: Take the most realistic animation you have ever seen while staying just short of the border between animation and reality and multiply that by a million. The result? ""The Adventures of Tintin""Acting: Superb. No exaggeration here. It was great. Especially...wait for it... Andy Serkis.Over-all: This may be a bold statement. To me, this is the movie of the year. Nothing i say can express my feelings for this movie. It's a big ball of freaking' awesomeness, and you need to see it. ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" is the definition of a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It doesn't allow you a second to breathe...,"Recently Steven Spielberg has been one busy man, not only has he been producing numerous television and film properties over the past year or so, but he has also been juggling two directorial properties. While 'War Horse' isn't due to be released for another month, his latest offering, 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn,' is based on the classic, best-selling comic books created by the Belgian artist Georges Remi (who was also known under the pen name Herge). The comics follow a young Belgian reporter named Tintin and his dog Snowy as they go about their days solving mysteries and getting into various misadventures along the way. Directed by Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson and written by the British trio of Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat, it marks a new turn in Spielberg's cinematic journey as he ditches live action for motion capture, and while the film takes full advantage of the technology at hand to create lavish environments, the story itself is too disorientating to hold an adult audiences attention for its one hour and forty minutes running time.Tintin (Jamie Bell) along with his faithful dog Snowy, is enjoying his day meandering around a local market when he finds an intricately designed model ship called the Unicorn available for sale by a somewhat anxious merchant. Once in Tintin's possession, the ship sets off a sequence of events which sees the young reporter come up against the mysterious Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig), befriend the alcohol loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), and help the bumbling Interpol agents Thomson and Thompson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) in their many endeavours, as he attempts to unravel the mystery behind the legend of the Unicorn and the secret cargo stowed away by the ships fabled Captain Sir Francis Haddock. Action, adventure, explosions, and bumbling detectives follow as Tintin races throughout the world to solve the mystery of the Unicorn.It is a phrase which is thrown around a lot when evaluating films within the action-adventure genre, but 'The Adventures of Tintin' is literally a non-stop thrill ride. But, while this phrase would usually be attributed to the praise of a motion picture, in the context of this film, it becomes a part of the criticism. From the beautifully crafted opening titles to the closing scene, there isn't a moment which goes by in which something isn't being blown up, jumped on, ridden or used as a makeshift weapon. It is as if Spielberg doesn't trust the primarily young audience members to actually engage with the film when a lavish action set-piece isn't taking place, and because of this, the audience is presented with a film which becomes disorientating due to its constant fast and frenetic pace. Also, due to the narratives exhilarating pace, the film requires that many of the large set-pieces take place one after the over, thereby once again detracting heavily away from their overall impact on the viewer.Aside from the fast-paced nature of the motion-picture however, the performance capture works well, as the computer generated backgrounds, locations and scenery are a startling indicator of how far technology regarding motion capture and three-dimensional imagery has come in the last decade. When it comes to the characters themselves however, while the motion capture allows for startling facial detail, it cannot replicate the emotional disparity of real human beings. The script written by three of the most promising British filmmakers at the moment contains a multitude of in-jokes, friendly humour and an attempt at characterisation. But again due to the pace of the film, this aspect falls flat due to the central narrative stream taking precedence over everything else on-screen throughout its running time.'The Adventures of Tintin' is a family-friendly, fast-paced, loose, action-adventure film that will no doubt be lauded by children across the land. It is essentially Spielberg doing what Spielberg does best: entertaining the public. But unlike the 'Indiana Jones' series and 'E.T,' among many of his other films, 'Tintin' is unable to cross generational boundaries to become a film for all the ages. While children will appreciate the non-stop, in-your-face action sequences which are constantly loud, bright and full of computer-generated destruction, older cinema-goers will no doubt become tired of the repetitive series of events. With a 'Tintin' sequel and even a trilogy potentially on the cards for the future, it would have been nice if Spielberg had attempted to scale back the action sequences for further plot and character development, rather than throwing every available device at the viewer hoping that something would eventually stick. While this approach may work with young children viewing the picture, it will almost certainly pass most adults by.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun adventure film!,"First, I have never read the Tin Tin comics so I just have the movie to go by. I thought it was great!

It was a good thing too, because the only thing I disliked about this movie was the beginning - it didn't seem to introduce anyone really well and seemed a bit rushed, so I kind of felt lost for a bit.

Colourless,"Herge-Tintin-Snowy-Captain Haddock-The Thompson Twins - these are all much loved icons from the French films I was introduced to in my youth. I then began consuming the comic book versions. Film first, comic book second. I really will be surprised if children that age now, being introduced to Tintin from this modern English speaking version, will quite get the romance and desire to read the comics. I hated this film for its 'flatness'. The John Williams music is particularly dull and rubs the shine off a number of the action scenes. The animation too is not convincing enough - I found the characters' eye direction is quite often wrong giving well drawn figures a wooden feel. It felt like all the speech was in a monotone - the impression maybe got through that appalling music. I really don't want to waste any more time seeing this again to confirm or deny my assertion.

"Loved the books as a child, the movie pays a fitting tribute","I grew up reading various of the Tintin books as I could find them from our school library. Leading up to this movie coming out, I decided to read the books in chronological order. That said, I found this movie was remarkably close to the books, taking such a large amount of material direct from the stories. In many cases, I knew the scenes frame-by-frame before they came on the screen. In modern Hollywood, where many classic comic books have gone way off base (I think of the X-men and Batman movies, for example), I believe this is the most accurate depiction of a comic I have seen yet. Sure, they replaced Herge's basically nameless bad guy (an art collector) with someone who has more vested interest in the story and they added several stunts that were unrelated to the books (the much maligned crane fight). Sure, they also cut most of the exploration for Red Rackham's treasure, but it would have been unnecessary and the end seems to indicate they may still pursue it in a sequel. But, this is still very accurate and very similar to the writing of Herge. The majority of complaints that I have read seem to surround characters not having enough background and the plot not being very clear, but even that is authentic to Herge. Many of the Tintin books start by Tintin being shot at, kidnapped, attacked or something for no apparent reason. The story just jumps from item-to-item as Tintin discovers the plot and explains it to Snowy, Haddock, etc. There's not a lot of background, Tintin sees a sinister plot and he pursues the bad guys. If you downgraded the movie because of that, you did not know enough about this story going in. I would like to see future adaptations have this same level of authenticity.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Seriously ?!,"Was it for real?This ""movie"" is really bad. It is like an animated cartoon, but with hideous graphics/characters (Gollum was a good idea in LOTR but you can't seriously make a movie with full Gollum style...well Tintin made it) and no fun (if you laugh for nothing you might find haddock funny though), so I really wonder what's the point.There isn't nostalgia neither, the Tintin cartoons made in the 90's are far better than this movie, you should watch or even re-watch them instead of this, I don't know if they were ever broadcast on TV in the US (btw I'm French). To be fair, I will conclude by saying children are bound to like this movie (especially the lame captain Haddock), but that's it. I really wish you good luck if your children want you to go to this movie with them. I went with friends and we only had fun by seeing parents who were boring while their children were enjoying the movie.

The poor script writing is what makes this film interminably dull - and we can thank Steven Moffat for that. Anyone who's ever watched Doctor Who will know that Moffat loves his exposition.

"Blistering Blue Barnacles, what a fun movie!","Next to chocolate and waffles, Tintin is one of Belgium's greatest exports, a character beloved by millions all over the world. Now, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have taken on the challenge of bringing the young reporter to motion-captured life.Tintin (Jamie Bell) is a successful and famous journalist who has worked on a number of high-profile stories. He stumbles into a new adventure when he buys a model ship that drops him into a historical mystery involving sunken treasure and a centuries-long feud between two families. Along the way, he has to stop the dastardly Sakharine (Daniel Craig), find the clues to the treasure and work with the alcoholic Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), who must reclaim his ancestor's treasure and lift a curse that has plagued his family.The casting is absolutely pitch-perfect throughout. Bell and Serkis truly are Tintin and Haddock, a chalk-and-cheese relationship with Tintin as the man who has to keep Haddock on the straight and narrow. Tintin possesses more of a deadpan intelligence, whereas Haddock is a reactionary bruiser. Craig too makes a great villain; his voice was almost unrecognisable throughout as he ruthlessly fulfills his ancestors' tradition of thievery. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost continue their great double act as the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson. Snowy the pup will easily challenge Gromit and Milo (from The Mask) for best movie dog.From the getgo, there are plenty of homages and references to other ""Tintin"" stories that will please fans. Spielberg shows respect for the material, for the most part, while still make a movie the whole family can enjoy. It's a historical and modern mystery with a family feud, a treasure hunt, international adventure and bits of action-comedy tossed in.This light romp matches the tone and style of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with plenty of homages to previous Spielberg films. Spielberg kept the period setting and uses a film noir style for the city scenes, fitting for the classic look of old cars, clothes and guns. This movie is a proper, old-fashioned adventure that takes Tintin and Haddock to exotic locations that would have still been a mystery in the 1930s. It was particularly impressive during a sequence when the movie flashes back and forth between the present to a pirate battle in the 17th Century in terms of how it was cut together. The entire production was action-packed, exciting and comic.The comedy of ""Tintin"" was mostly physical, slapstick or revolved around Haddock's alcoholism (because alcoholism is always funny). There are some witty lines and jokes for older audiences, but there are a couple of jokes involving burping when you would expect Spielberg and ""Tintin"" to be above that.We all know that previous full motion capture films have failed to impress. But The Adventures of Tintin delivers with realistic little details such as freckles along cartoonish features. Because of the animated world, Spielberg was not limited by the realities of a practical filmmaker and came up with really impressive action sequences throughout. He certainly knows action and it is impressive that the effects in ""Tintin"" were more realistic than in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A positively delightful masterpiece,"To put it out there, I've always liked Tintin. My dad passed me the first comic, and I've been in love since. Once I heard of Tintin being made into a movie, I had my doubts. Will Hergé's masterpiece be done justice? I had prepared myself for the worst. The trailer came out, and the one thing that caught my attention was the impeccable animation. The life-like yet animated feel of the movie impressed me. Plus, Steven Spielberg, Steven Moffat and Peter Jackson working on the same movie? C'mon.It starts off somewhat dark, with suspicious characters and red herrings being introduced, alongside a mystery for our beloved Tintin to solve. It soon turns into a fun, comedy-filled, whirlwind of an adventure that has viewers at the edge of their seats. Adventures on the high sea, plane chases and a desert trek give the audience a delightful variety of scenes to keep them interested. The presence of comic relief characters, much like in the comics, Thompson & Thompson and Captain Haddock, provide a light-hearted atmosphere to the otherwise serious plot. Throw in amazing animation and CGI and you have a movie worth paying for.I loved every minute of this movie. Every thing was so wonderfully woven together to form this positively delightful masterpiece. It was definitely a nostalgia trip for the adults in the audience, and a light-hearted adventure for the kids. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great adventure film for all the family. To be precise : a great family film for all the adventure...,"Steven Spielberg's ""Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn"" is an entertaining action-packed and mystery-filled adventure film that, beyond all these epithets, respects the spirit of Herge's adventures of Tintin, the classic worldwide famous, comic-book series, and take this from a fan who grew up reading the albums, rereading them in French and English, and watching the animated features. In seven words : Steven Spielberg made a great Tintin movie.Recently, I've been very critical toward Spielberg, but I knew he had a particular fondness on Tintin's stories, and you could tell by watching some of his films, the ""Indiana Jones"" series to say the least, remember Short Round in ""Temple of Doom"" who was inspired from Tintin's best friend Chang. Interestingly, Indy's profession as an archaeologist was as much as a convenient excuse for living exciting adventures as Tintin being a reporter (after all, we've never know for which newspaper he ever worked) but in this film, Tintin mentions his job several times, and his curiosity is less guided by a blind appetite for adventures than a strong and professionally oriented desire to know the secret of the Unicorn. Yes, he's an adventurer but his quest of the truth is what justifies the adventures, not the opposite. And the strength of the film is in its ability to be more a mystery than an adventure film.Now, I'd like to get to the point that would inspire most criticism from the fans, or let's say, the most purist of them. For intellectual honesty's sake, or in the name of this Tintin-esque quest for the truth, I know some aspects will bother the hardcore fans. In fact, as it often happens for movies adapted from comic books, the story is a combination of many plots devices extracted from different albums. The problem is that the ""Secret of the Unicorn"" is only the first opus of a two-part story, the second being ""Red Rachkam Treasure"", which happens to be one of the most exciting and escapist of all Tintin's adventures, one of the funniest, and MY personal favorite. I was so impressed by the film that I wanted it to be followed by a sequel set overseas. But Spielberg chose to combine the story with the ""Golden Crab Claws"", the famous album where Tintin meets Captain Archibald Haddock.The idea per se, isn't a blasphemy as long as it respects the spirit of ""Tintin"" stories, to those who remember the other Tintin films, many of them took shortcuts with the albums, while some of them, were based on original screenplays and not faithful to that unique ambiance exuded from the iconic comic-book series. Spielberg tactfully used the greatest elements of both albums with the redemption of Captain Haddock, turning from a drunken loser in the beginning to the proud, larger than life and ferocious descendant of the Knight François de Hadoque, famous for his epic outbursts of rage, his thundering typhoons and other blistering barnacles. As soon as Haddock makes his entrance, the movie takes a new dimension, with the growing complicity between the two characters as a heart-warming core.Still, I can't help but feel frustrated for the underuse of ""Red Rackam Treasure"", which would have made one hell of a story. Especially for the whole twist that concludes the adventure, Spielberg's ""Secret of the Unicorn"" is less a treasure hunt than a treasure secret hunt so  why not make a sequel with the actual treasure hunt? Well, I try to reassure myself figuring that Spielberg might do another film involving seven crystal balls, Incas, or a red and white rocket flying to the moon, who knows? Or maybe he wanted the story that introduces Haddock, but ""Red Rackham""'s introduces us to Professor Cuthbert Calculus, who'd have been a better comic relief than Snowy or Thompson and Thomson. But let's no be so purist, comic-books have codes that movies don't have and vice versa, a director, and a Tintinologist like Spielberg is allowed to take some distances.So, even, if the movie flirts sometimes with fantasy, or create many dizzying and exhilarating sequences begging for a 3D version, everything would have been pointless without the constant respect toward Herge's legacy. I appreciated that the film was clearly set in the 40's, which provides the perfect mood for such noir and exotic-set adventures, as much as I love the dazzling cinematography, and the inspirational message of the film. At the end, adults were thrilled, the Tintin fans were trying to recognize the subtle hints of other adventures, including a nice cameo-homage of Herge (will you catch him?), the non fans were enjoying a nice film, and children were laughing at the more slapstick parts, and Tintin's adventures had their shares of slapstick too. Not that it was funny every time, but there was the perfect dosage between action, fun, and remembrance of how great Tintin's comics have always been.So, I'd like to thank Spielberg for having finally fulfilled his long-life dream. Now, we can finally say that Spielberg made a Tintin movie, which was the greatest reconciliation between two arts that seem to only unite for super heroic films. Tintin is another kind of hero, many will find him bland or asexual but this have always been Tintin's personality, a sort of idealistic exaltation of youth's adventurous spirit, but whatever ""boring"" you'd fin in that Yin, you have the Yang in Captain Haddock's colorful personality, and both contribute to one of the greatest dynamics that structure the film. The facial expressions are extraordinarily made, conveying Herge's particular 'clear line' style  they were drawn differently, but you could tell it was Tintin, Haddock and Snowy, on a pure technical achievement, the story is a success.But on the field of storytelling, of thrills, and excitement, the film is a triumph that will delight the hearts of all the fans from 7 to 77.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just painful to watch!,"I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. As a fan of the original Tintin comics, I was excited to see a movie adaptation of the beloved series. But after watching the film, I can confidently say that it's just not Tintin.First of all, the CGI effects were absolutely horrible. I found myself struggling to understand what was happening on the screen because everything looked so fake and unnatural. It was like the filmmakers were trying to hide the fact that they couldn't create a convincing live-action Tintin movie, so they just slapped some cheap-looking CGI on top of it.And don't even get me started on the dialogue. The script was so simplistic and devoid of any of the wit and humor that made the comics so enjoyable to read. I found myself cringing at some of the cheesy one-liners and predictable plot points.Overall, I couldn't even finish the movie. It was just too painful to watch. As a fan of Tintin, I feel insulted that the filmmakers would create such a poor adaptation of the source material. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves the comics.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautifully Crafted,","The Adventures Of Tintin is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. It is an extremely engaging story that kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, with a fun, layered adventure that we have not seen in movies in a long time. The concentration on the three main characters is very strong, that being Tintin, Captain Haddock and Tintin's dog Snowy, we get a great sense of their relationship, with a connection formed that is powerful, making the film even more interesting.I feel like the movie let itself down a little by being so short. Only running at roughly 100 minutes, it ended a little abruptly, feeling as if Spielberg and Jackson had a specific run time given and were struggling to keep with it, so they had to rush the overall conclusion to the story. It felt a little underwhelming as a result of this, it did not have the most satisfying finale.The voice cast is phenomenal, delivering intense, dedicated performances. The likes of Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are all given a chance to shine in their respective roles. However, the highlight for me had to be Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock, a very layered performance unlike any other he has done before, he is certainly the most intriguing character.It has an Indiana Jones vibe to it throughout that made me smile. Action packed and beautifully animated, The Adventures of Tintin is a delight for anyone looking for a good family or adventure film.Tintin joins forces with a sailor to stop a treasure map from getting in to the wrong hands.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poor attempt at bringing Tintin to the big screen,"Spielberg - like all his other works - has a tendency to write and /or approve screenplays that either deviate far the original story, or deviate from the real truth. The Adventure of Tintin is the former.So disappointed with this screenplay and the level of direction. The whole movie seems like a really cheap imitation of Georges Remi's original work of art.Stay away from this atrocious rubbish of a ""movie"".

Awesome!!!,"I love it! The animation was top notch, it stuck more or less to the plot, and it wasn't wrecked with childish humor. It brought back the true feel of a Tintin novel, down to the looks and attitude of all all the characters. That's how I imagined each and every one of them. I thought for sure that they would mess up on at least Snowy, but they didn't. Must see adventure movie. Very innovative chase scenes, high quality humor, excellent voice acting, flawless 3d, deep characters, evil bad guys, clanging sword fights, everything that will make a perfect pirate/detective movie.

"Thrills, laughs and excitement.","I took my four grandsons-ages 4,7 9 and 12.This film satisfied all of us (I am 60) in every aspect. I have not seen this type of animation before and found it charming. The story was strong and had all the elements I recall from the cartoons I saw on TV years ago. As ever with Spielberg, though, I found the fight sequences over long and repetitious. It was interesting for me to see the introduction of the Haggardian theme of the inescapability of fate into a light entertainment film. To be honest, though, I didn't hold much hope for the film to begin with, as the opening credits and music held no promise of the thrills to come.

"Tintindiana 4,5 (dad)","It begins and ends like the Tintin comics i used to read long ago before comics: a gentle mystery story, set in Europe and with real cardboard characters: the blank curious reporter, his ingenious dog (the best thing here) and his grumpy friend. But, between, it becomes a non-stop action extravaganza going from boat to desert to opera to port. It is just too much and the final fight with cranes looks like ""Transformers"". It's above all the Spielberg of ""Indy 4"" who focus only speed that commands the camera, in spite of his old self taking a few shots: the duel about the fuse is a bit ""Hook""ish and maybe the best sequence. This CGI picture isn't wonderful: if the actors have indeed been shot live, it would have been better to keep the original shot. Finally, this Tintin gives a distorted view of the comics and the original cartoon is much true to this.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Maybe the most fun i've had all year!,"This review contains no spoilers. I don't normally write reviews for movies but i enjoyed this movie so much and i want to show that a mo-cap movie can be good to all the naysayers. First of all the movie starts with a stylish cartoon opening credit which basically sets up the style of Herge's books and the movie. We are soon brought straight into mystery only 5 minutes into the movie and doesn't stop in to the credits roll. We are introduced to Tintin in a really great way which i won't spoil along with the rest of the movie's great humor which put a smile on my face throughout and will with a lot of kids and adults. Jamie Bell is really great as the the boy journalist setting a real fun and adventure thirsting character like Mr Spielberg's other adventurer. The rest of the cast also shine in their roles with Andy Serkis playing a sublime and brilliant haddock who is a very complex and original character to get adapted to the screen but is pulled off so well by the mo cap master. Even more Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funniest on screen as the Thompson twins who take on their roles with enthusiasm to give a flawless and and great performance. Finally Craig gives a good performance as Rackman with a evil and typical bad guy role though doesn't shine no way as much as the rest of the cast. However in the end it doesn't come down to one of the human cast to steal the show but tintin's partner and pet snowy with his cuteness and Wit that makes him irresistible to anyone. What makes this movie even better is its use of the mo cap tech which includes some astonishing set pieces which couldn't be caught in real life from a motorcycle chase through the streets of morocco to a OTT crane fight which is so over the top you don't care due to the amazement of it all which Indy 4 failed to do. Really i couldn't expect anything less from writers Moffat, Wright and Cornish who have already created remarkable stuff in their lifetime which is applied to the movie to create a remarkable adventure story with a good plot and some amazing design and love. However this movie does come with some flaws including some bad dialogue throughout the movie and some undeveloped characters which i would have loved to have seen more of. Thought this no way spoils the movie which is the most fun i have had in the cinemas this year. This movie is fun and really funny which never stops. It also includes some of the most breathtaking scenes since avatar with the action and adventure of Indiana Jones. Even more john William's score really fits the movie and once again enhances Mr Spielberg's work. A return to form for one of the best directors of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: The Adventures of Tintin,"Regular trips to the bookstore when I was 10 had introduced me to the world Herge created with his jetsetting baby faced reporter Tintin and his faithful canine companion Snowy, and I was hooked enough to slowly but surely, get all the stories ever created, sharing them through the book club with my primary school class on the joys of these adventures. And I probably can gauge how well received those stories were, being read and re-read again countless of times by many, that they were expectedly returned in less than pristine condition. I still have those books and from time to time turn to them for timeless adventures that only Herge knows how to craft, building a world of likable characters and a universe in which they operate in.Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson now translate this for the big screen. There have been other adaptations, animated ones that I've seen before as a kid that took place on Black Island and on the moon even, so to go down that animated route wouldn't be to introduce the stories to a whole new 3D generation. Making it live action would mean to discover a new cast who would demand a lot for the number of potential sequels that can be made in their likeness. So the best alternative is to marry both worlds and have it animated, but voiced and moving as if they would in the real world through motion capture, and what had been delivered is nothing less than a flawless piece of moving art that had leapt out of the pages of a book, and onto the silver screen. A 3D IMAX one at that, and I seriously urge everyone who has the intent to watch this to do so in this format that does justice to the tremendous amount of work and effort to finally kickstart what could be a lucrative franchise.Those who are purists may want to steer clear of this, but I suppose having it adapted by Steven Mofatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish meant an amalgamation of known Tintin adventures, but given that modern day sensibilities in terms of narrative development and action sequences shot, yet having Spielberg's astuteness in keeping things true to the spirit of the books. With recognizable highlights from The Crab with the Golden Claws, Red Rackham's Treasure and of course The Secret of the Unicorn, the scribes have fused together a very fluid action adventure that moves at breakneck speed, never wasting any frame with Spielberg showing he still has what it takes for something family friendly while upping the ante through his works, redeeming himself from his last attempt being the terrible Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that he had unceremoniously diverted blame of its prime weakness to George Lucas. Here, he got that smooth flowing narrative, allowing him to focus on how best to bring across the screen adaptation for a family friendly audience.And Tintin fans will be delighted with Jamie Bell's voicing of Tintin, and Andy Serkis playing the role of Captain Thunering Typhoons Haddock, being essentially what's envisaged of that role of the drunken sailor. Bit characters like Thomson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg, excellent naturally choices I must add) the bumbling Interpol cops, Nestor the butler (Enn Reitel) and the Milanese Nightingale Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel) all make appearances even though some did not feature in the original tale, such as Senorita Castafiore who possesses a quality that worked so well in the diabolical scheme concocted here, with Daniel Craig taking on the role of the scheming Ivanovich Sakharine. Only Professsor Calculus is left, who is primed for the next film if it flows logically as a follow up film, and thank heavens nobody in the right mind decided to follow recent trends in making animals talk, so Snowy behaves very much like a dog, and in my opinion almost always steals everyone's thunder through its antics, providing just cause to peel your eyes away from the main proceedings, and following him anywhere that he roams on screen.From the opening credits to little nuggets of easter eggs scattered for fans to spot, such as the first look at Tintin's home where we see articles from other well known adventures such as The Broken Ear and King Ottokar's Sceptre, one suspects the larger adventures from the books such as Destination Moon may be primed for future film installments should this one prove successful. Peter Jackson takes over the sequel and I'm waiting with bated breaths for that one, before the third movie in which both Spielberg and Jackson will share directing responsibilities, and if they are anything like this one, I'm signing up already. And do head to your local bookstores as well if your interest is keen to pick up those books again, because a whole new generation will be introduced to the film, and one can bet that their interests will be piqued right after this wonderful film treatment. It's always a joy with adaptations done right, and this is clearly something highly recommended!",,Anonymous,Animation

Surprisingly good,"The Adventures of Tintin is an excellent apology for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Spielberg lives up all his serialized, globe trotting, treasure hunting, pirate chasing fantasies he flooded into The Goonies and The Last Crusade. As the property sat on the shelf for so many years, it's pretty easy to see very strong parallels particularly in Last Crusade, but this is a superior work.Animation has come a long ways from Polar Express, but the characters still look as if their heads are too big. It's still not quite right but not too distracting.I'm keeping this one short because you're better off not taking my word for this and just seeing it yourself. The last third lacks the intrigue and adventure of the earlier parts of the story. Either from budget reasons or deadlines, Tintin seems to settle into too many clichés toward the end to put a quick finish on the story rather than actually flesh out something more in line with the careful characterizations of what came before.Minus one point for the big headed Daniel Craig character and minus two points for the flat and cliché finish.7/10Bring on the next one!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

So, this is a first for me; writing of a movie that left me aghast, and from such a posse of exceptional talent, beginning with Spielberg.I am appalled. This movie did not leave me cold; it transformed me into a popsicle. What was that insipid background music from John Williams? I imagine he looked at the initial cuts and longed to come down with a longish illness so that he could get out of the contract, and concluded to just put notes to paper and get the hell out of there.So much acting talent and so little to work with; I can't find fault with anyone who trusted Spielberg to pull it off. After all, this is Spielberg. The man is a genius; surely he must have a vision that eluded those who could not see it in reading the script. Nope, their intuition was correct. This movie was a stinker from start to finish; from concept to credits.I hope that Spielberg bounces back with ferocity and a killer flick.

Tintin comes alive,"Well, I'm not going to tell a lot from the movie itself since I don't want to spoil other people's fun who come to see the movie. However I can say that Spielberg and Jackson did a mighty good job on bringing Belgiums favourite character Tintin to life.Visually the movie was just stunning, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock and the other characters and their surroundings we're just so lifelike, it took me several minutes to become aware of the fact that this is a animationfilm just like Beowulf. With the main difference... Tintin's clearly on the highest sport of the ladder. I don't think it's technically possible to make a character so realistic as Spielberg did. If this technique is expanded, Hollywood shiver and quake, cause real actors won't be necessary anymore. Throughout the entire movie you will keep asking yourself the question whether these characters and environments are real or fake. Personally, this film lands just below Avatar in case of visuals and effects.Now, I do have a remark and I don't want to spoil the Tintin-fans their fun, but after seeing this movie I genually believe that you shouldn't do 3 comics in a movie which lasts for almost 2 hours. There are lot of elements of the original story in it, but I just couldn't help myself saying in mind that this isn't right. This isn't how the original story goes... However, if you're not a Tintin-fan, or you don't have read any of these stories you will find this movie quite entertaining and it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout some very exciting scenes.Overall, a really good movie that is definitely a must see for every movie-fan and I do smell an Oscar in this movie somewehere...

"""You hit a wall, you push through it.""","I've never read the original Tintin comics, but even I can recognize that charming cartoon character with the big round head, the small tuft of blonde hair, and the cute white dog at his side. It has been decades since the character's genesis, but even today, he proves to be just as endearing as ever, thanks to this 2011 computer-animated film.The Adventures of Tintin offers a heck of an adventure, with loads of eye candy for audiences of all ages. Most of the film is comprised of action setpieces that are really inventive and involved; it's almost like a vaudeville act, with characters tumbling, falling, flying, and colliding with each other, resulting in even more crazy damage, more problematic situations, and sometimes inducing some decent laughter. One of the film's most awe-inspiring scenes is a continuous shot, lasting for what must be a full five minutes or so, with the camera tracking Tintin and the Captain riding through a town, chasing animals, with buildings getting wrecked all around them. The timing and choreography of each scene is so precise, it's brilliantly entertaining. The film suffers very little drag in between, and there's always enough elements of danger and peril to keep the stakes high. At the same time, it's never too high or scary for younger audiences. If there's anything to complain about, it's just that it's almost too much. Many scenes strain believability, and can become very absurd.In spite of the relentless action, however, the film's story is left with limited room to breathe. It jumps right into the mystery and adventure, without any introduction to the characters or the world they inhabit. It isn't hard to catch onto things as the film goes along, but there's no real background to Tintin, and it makes him flat and rather less interesting. It's the mystery element that drives this plot, but even then, the mystery is quite predictable and thinly developed. Really, the movie is built on the action, with one scene leading to another; it's serviceable and fun, but nothing terribly deep or compelling.This film has top-notch animation quality. The amount of detail, precision, and movement is phenomenal; there are moments that look so real, it's amazing. This film has decent voice-acting; it can be a bit tiresome to listen to Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock, but Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and everybody else provides quality performances. Writing is not bad, and it generally gets the job done, but some more depth would have been welcome. This production uses some very awesome-looking settings, locations, props, costumes, and character designs. John Williams' music score is not bad.This film definitely entertains with its imaginative adventure sequences, and it comes close to replicating the same kind of energy and tone as a typical Indiana Jones picture. It is a film that audiences of all ages can enjoy, even if the story is a bit lacking. Recommended.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Perfect)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Exhilarating adaptation of the books that excites the eyes,"""The Adventures of Tintin"" is non-stop action and thrills. It's groundbreaking in the way that the 3D motion capture is used to perfectly adapt the stylized illustrations of Hergé and also manages to avoid that uncanny valley look that has plagued so many films made in this style. Fans of the original comic books will be happy to see a faithful adaptation of the books, and fans of Spielberg's Indiana Jones' series will be more than impressed with the action sequences. Some of the humor falls flat and the movie runs slightly too long, but the visual style and chase sequences make it a terrific adventure film. If you want an example of what animation can do that would never work with live actors, look no further than the elaborate chase sequence towards the second third of the movie, which is done in one continuous shot and is truly amazing. The film is worth seeing for that sequence alone. (3D Theatrical version on the big screen, August 2011)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Doesn't Live Up to Potential,"Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson teamed up to produce what was supposed to be the greatest adventure tale since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead they have produced a 130 million dollar albatross that will likely hang around their necks for years to come.Perhaps I'm exaggerating. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to the fact that a childhood hero like Spielberg is capable of churning out such mediocre fare. Perhaps its just sour grapes that talented scribes like Joe Cornish, Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright fumbled on a comic book adaptation that can write itself with the amount of mythology embedded in it. Perhaps I'm overreacting to the fact that the directors of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" produced a bloated spectacle in Zemeckis-vision whose plot can be surmised in four words (those words are 'Tintin searches for treasure' by the way).The story intertwines the lives of a dull protagonist (Jamie Bell), his intelligent dog a drunken sea captain (Andy Serkis) and an evil ne'er-do-well with a 150 year old family grudge (Daniel Craig), all looking for hidden treasure in a paint-by-numbers adventure. The cast then participate in a series of increasingly elaborate and admittedly dazzling action set-pieces to find their elusive macguffin. That's basically it. There's no B-story, moral or point. After a ten minute setup, the film is essentially one big long car chase only with boats, planes, and motorcycles in addition to cars.This is not to say it isn't exciting. If that's all you're looking for in a film ""Tintin"" is a perfect holiday treat. I would even recommend seeing it in 3D since Spielberg technical talents are on full display. But for those of us craving a little more meat on the bone, this film will bring out your inner cynic, right down to last few sequel-baiting minutes.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
the hawk's point of view.,"Animation is taking interesting courses these days. Technology is being conquered by creative thinking, and that is giving us new ways to see. I suppose it's always been like that throughout history.There are several nice things about this film, I was really pleased with it, in what it does well. First, we have Spielberg back. The good one. There is one S. with an uncontrollable will to entertain, and be clever about it. That's great, the guy who gave us Indiana Jones, ET, Minority Report, etc. Than, there's the S. who wants to put his name in the book of serious filmmakers. The guy from Schindler's list, and the disastrous AI. I don't like that director. And than you have the million dollar making producer, who sometimes directs what he was only supposed to produce. That's a business, i'm OK with that one. This film is great in how it revives the 1st Spielberg, the one i've grown up loving. He's here, with no prejudice or failure, brilliant in his visual conception of the grand arch of action. Now, he's together with Peter Jackson, who's been building a world of interesting toys for the creation of cinematic visual worlds, something he began doing in LOTR. These 2 guys do fine here.Than we have Tintin. I'm totally into the books, I know everyone by heart. I don't have the personality to become a geek about anything, but I do know a lot about the books, its contexts, the author, etc. I understand there will be a number of hardcore fans who will dismiss any changes made to the original stories, as well as the blended elements from several albums. I'm fine with that, because mostly I think the changes were made to favour the visual ideas that were to be fulfilled in the minds of the makers. From the first half-hour or so on, this film is conceived as a succession of grand action sequences. These required different sets. So they include the Karaboudjan bits to take us first to the sea, than to the desert, and finally to the Moroccan city. There we have the less believable sequence of the film in terms of actual physical depictions, but also the one where the possibilities of the virtual eye are more pushed forward as far as this film goes: we have an extended chase sequence, using several transportation mediums, crossing several sets. The character being chased is a hawk, who obviously is free in terms of motion. Vertical space, multiple points of view (he is not grounded), that's the stuff that makes this sequence, where the camera and edition choose to change stance and pov multiple times, and where the spatial conception of the place reveals to us. I personally would have like to have had more of the hawk's point of view, but i was pleased. That and the other action sequences are why the film is built as it is.The first half hour of the film actually looks from another film universe. It's a tense, noir sequence, of clues and allusions, shadows and mystery. That's actually much more what Tintin is about, in terms of its dramatic core. He is a character of adventures, but hardly an action figure. I'll keep this first half hour as what the film should have been about, if there wasn't a world of visual opportunities to be got from the animation according to WETA.The need for the 3D, apart from the possible (but arguable) commercial appeal of it, eludes me here. I'd like to review this on a 2D version, just to make sure the 3D brings nothing new to it. And that's a pity.Of course there is also a possible line of argument, on whether the visual flat representation of Tintin's drawings in the comics would be fairly transposed to the screen. I actually think it is, as the dynamics of the drawings are aptly maintained even if using a different visual personality. The old Tintin cartoons that tried the transition to television are far less successful, although they try hard to be like the books.The initial credits are an incredible bit on their own, Pink Panther like.My opinion: 4/5 good news, we have a new director called Spielberg back.",,Anonymous,Animation
Very entertaining film,"Tintin is a young European journalist who also solves crimes. After buying a model ship, he becomes involved in a mystery about a pirate treasure and finds his life is in danger.I loved this movie. The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well-done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular, witty, and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thrilling adventure across the globe,"Based on the legendary comic albums by Hergé, The Adventures of Tintin was an attempt by Steven Spielberg to bring the very European hero to the American audiences. And no better man to do it, since Spielberg himself has self-admittedly drawn a lot of influences from Tintin for Indiana Jones, for example.And what a fantastic film. Based on three of Hergé's albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, it tells about a sunken treasure and clues to its location hidden within old artifacts, one which ends up in the hands of a young reporter, Tintin, pulling him into the plot. Along the way nefarious plots are uncovered, colourful (and occasionally hilariously foul-mouthed) characters are met, exotic locations are explored and all in the name of good fun, excitement and, above all, adventure. Picture perfect plot and the action supports it beautifully. It's exactly the same brand of thrills that made the Indiana Jones trilogy such an iconic adventure classic. Glad to see that Spielberg had at least one of these still left in him.He also gets the characters very well. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is exactly the same kind of pure hero in a fictive cape we've come to known from the comics. Daniel Craig as the villain is a lot of fun and captures the archetype of a cultured baddie beautifully. But my, and probably everyone's, favourite character is without doubt Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), a drunken rot of a sailor, who still shines from within with past glory and a core of iron and timber.My only real gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of the motion-capture style of animation utilized. All the backgrounds look great and allow for some really fantastic action segments, but the characters themselves teeter just on the brink of uncanny valley. Their faces are expressive and their motions have been captured well, allowing for some really good acting moments, but the skin textures are more than a little plasticky. Overall the quality of animation is good, but it could have been better.Nevertheless, The Adventures of Tintin is a great film. I really hope they make a sequel because this is easily a franchise equal to Indiana Jones in terms of potential.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spielberg is back on form!,"The Adventures Of Tintin is an absolute joy to watch. For the first time since 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has Steven Spielberg managed to make an action adventure film on an equally enjoyable level. So trade the fedora hat for a spiky patch of red hair, the snakes for a faithful dog companion, the boulders for tanks and you have The Adventures Of Tintin.The film follows a winding narrative that puts the young Belgian detective on a worldwide hunt for the lost treasure of the unicorn ship. With the Unicorn, Spielberg has found the perfect MacGuffin which is guaranteed to maintain the audiences interest throughout. Jamie Bell possesses an innocence and an ingenuity that makes Tintin a well rounded, likable character but the REAL treat is about a 1/3rd into the film when Andy Serkis appears as Tintin's 'side-kick'(?), Captain Haddock. The different sides to his character provide great moments of levity; the perfect antidote to the mostly straight faced but kind hearted, Tintin. Other notable actors lend their voices to the film; Daniel Craig sinks his teeth into the role of the antagonist (Playing against type has never been so much fun!), and the double team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are well cast but possibly under used as the hapless Thompson twins.Spielberg will impress his audience with the inventive plot and a fantastic cast delivering great performances but does the technology suit the structure of a Tintin story? The answer is a definite YES! Motion capture has moved on since films like 'The Polar Express' and at times during this movie, you will find yourself forgetting you're watching a cartoon. The element of 3D that is offered as opposed to the two-dimensional format (well worth the extra money) compliments the motion capture and has some of the most impressive use of this new format you will ever see. Notice how you can see dust floating in the air and can almost feel the blast of explosions. There are several action scenes that make best use of the 3D involving an edge of your seat, riveting, roller-coaster ride of a chase.(But I don't want to give too much away).The direction of the film is superb with Spielberg masterfully crafting an engrossing 2 hour old school action adventure movie, with heart, for audiences of every age by including enough stunning use of 3D/motion capture, sticking a few self-referential jokes here and there and most important of all, making it a fun, enjoyable film that will bring a smile to anybody watching. It is not an overlong film and ends just as it may begin to outstay it's welcome by leaving the door open for an inevitable sequel. Peter Jackson... Take the director's chair and try to beat this. Spielberg is back!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin-ish,"Turning a Tintin album into a the screen format should be easy, since the story board is already in place. Why rewrite the story as a mix of several albums; the original story is much more compelling?Why turning Captain Haddock into a burdon, a liability; not the force of friendship he is in the original stories?The pace never change, everything is full throttle from the beginning to the end, which makes the movie extremely boring. Also, the bombastic music just nails the pace, without any pauses. The movie, in this way, is just moronic; it does not give the viewer any chance of reflecting on the events on the screen.This movie makes you start wondering what could have happened to Harry Potter, if not the writer had had full control over the implementation. Just because you love the book, does not mean you automatically have the best qualification to handle its screen adaptation. Since Peter Jackson already proved himself with the Lord of the Rings, I have to blame this mess on Mr Spielberg.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Give this movie Oscar for animation!,"I was aware of the comic which this movie was based on, but never read them. So I went to this movie with a neutral expectation. Not too low because Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson at the helm, and not too high because I'm not a big fan of animated movies.The story is good and tight. A bit slow in the beginning when the characters are being introduced, but picks up pace soon after. Its non-stop, swashbuckling, globe-trotting, machine-gun-fire-evading action, a sensory overload!The animation is really really excellent. Sometimes I forgot to listen to the dialog because I was busy paying attention to all the details on the characters, the skin texture, hair movements, shadow and lighting, etc.Score by John Williams never disappoint me. Superb. It provides a sense of thrill, urgency and mystery to the movie. Its like watching animated Indiana Jones!The chase scene in the North African country is the masterpiece for this movie. Now, that's what Spielberg movie is all about. Highly recommended animated movie for everyone. Best animated movie this year. Glory for Oscar next year!",,Anonymous,Animation
Groundbreaking Animation,"Tintin has no business being an animated movie. Most animated movies tackle fantasy concepts or focus on creatures rather than humans. Tintin is an action/adventure movie that just happens to be animated. Replicate it frame by frame in live action, and it would fit in perfectly with today's action/adventure movies. I applaud the creativity in pushing the bounds of what an animated movie can be about and can show. But beyond the creativity, it excels both at being an animated movie and at being a standard action/adventure movie. It has the most realistic animation I've ever seen, so much so that at one point in the movie I thought it was a live action scene. All of the details are incredible, and the artwork is beautiful. But as an adventure story, it really shines. The action sequences are incredible, both the single-take chase sequence and the pirate ship battle. They both look amazing and are perfectly choreographed. It's a thrilling adventure that never drops in intensity. The conflict between the characters is well done, too. The scale of the adventure is fantastic, with plenty of interesting locations and travel methods. The humor is effective, and the acting is really good. The music is great as well. Overall, Tintin is one of the most exciting adventures out there and could completely stand on its own, but the fact that it's entirely animated makes it even more mind-blowing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Positively surprised. Great movie!,"I had my doubts.I was never a fan of tin tin as a kid so I saw this movie without ""any"" tin tin background and after reading a few reviews, that was probably the best, since many users can't really accept this as a ""tin tin"" movie but I don't think it is meant to be linked to the cartoons or comics that much to be honest. I didn't have any problems understanding the story in this one so I'd be so bald to call it completely independent of the cartoons and comic books, so relax. The comics are still there for you tin tin enthusiasts who can't accept this version of tin tin :)I think the script is very good. I enjoyed this movie a lot.I find Cap'n Haddock hilarious. The British humor is boiling out of his ears in this one. I would say Haddock's character in this movie is like Jack Sparrow in the curse of the black pearl mixed with a little monty python and a brilliant accent. A drunken sailor that somehow succeeds in the end.The animation and graphics are surreal. I saw that some reviews said otherwise and that is beyond my understanding. This movie is gorgeous, you can't deny that even if you didn't like the script.I do have to say that I did find the middle part a little bit dull but Haddocks moments really made this movie. Hilarious and I repeated them every five minutes in my head and found myself laughing every time the rest of the day.Great movie for the family i'd say. No blood btw for y'all thinking of showing your kids this.I can't rate this as some users as a tin tin movie since I have little to no experience of the tin tin character but I can rate this a a family comedy, and it really was entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Animated Film Of All Time (A+),"Let me just start this review by saying, my gosh are the animations and visuals so realistic. Spielberg and adventure are like a match made in heaven, John Williams' brilliant score, the hysterical comedic moments, the storm, sand and everything in this film is just epic! It's funny, because if this didn't say a Steven Spielberg film I wouldn't have even thought it was a Spielberg film. Every time that Steven is involved with animated films it is always god tier.

Not PG,"I have to say I am disturbed by this movie, only because it's rated PG. The animation is amazing. Very real. One might ask ""why animate it then""? But that's another topic. My review is only regarding the inappropriate content for a PG movie. There were many scenes with guns and swords. A man getting shot dead right at Tin Tin's door. I was really shocked. Multiple gun fights, swords fights, knives. One of my kids said ""I was really surprised by all of the guns, I wasn't expecting that."" Mind you, he loved it, but it just wasn't appropriate. Also, the alcohol references were very abundant. My son said ""I thought the drunk parts were funny."" That's nice. My 9 year old son thinks being drunk is funny. I think the violence and alcohol were over the top. I'm only reviewing this movie because as parents we depend on the rating system. Ten years ago, there is no way that would have passed as PG. I review all content for PG-13 movies. I shouldn't have to do that for PG movies. The fact that's it's animated may make some believe that you can ""get away"" with cartoon violence, but this movie is so real, you can't even tell it's animated is some parts.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Genre defining,"This is the greatest family adventure film I've seen - truly fantastic!The animation is simply breath-taking and astonishingly lifelike for the most part, the storyline is good (as you would expect from an adaptation of the Herge classic) and it's superbly witty and exciting. I adore this film and have watched it a great many times without tiring (although I will admit the kids sometimes request we watch something different!).The casting is good, Jamie Bell does a great job as the roving reporter, and Andy Serkis plays a mean Captain Haddock. I am sometimes a little less convinced of Daniel Craig's character (Sakharine), but not enough to damped my enthusiasm for the film. Thomson and Thompson are the best characters in the film, a tribute to Pegg and Frosts ever fruitful partnership. Finally, Snowy, wonderfully brought to life by Peter Jackson's studio: managing to instill a considerable degree of character into a subject with neither facial expressions or vocabulary.I can't speak highly enough of this film and cannot wait for the next in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A masterpiece in the history of cinema,"I am not a fan of Tintin, and I wish this movie was made using different characters.The action in this film is very similar to a 007 movie. Only, it has even more action, more stunts, more dynamics, and better settings. The action scenes are even more exaggerated than in a Bond movie which can be a little annoying at times.What is an achievement is the unique graphics. This looks like a landmark because the color rendition and the dynamic of the movements are not only realistic, but have a degree of representation that makes the whole picture look like truly enjoyable. It doesn't look like real life and it doesn't look like animation either. Rather, it looks like something in between, something new that finally makes an animation pleasant to watch, as opposed to all other animation movies to this day.The only downside - and a surprising one for a Spielberg movie - is the soundtrack. It just lets down the movie.On the other side, the action is brilliant, even by Spielberg standards. It simply doesn't stop without being overwhelming. The sets are beautiful and catchy.I hope there will be other animation movies using this animation technique.And while there, it will be nice to see Spielberg directing a James Bond movie",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Awful! Just Plain Awful Hollywood Crap or How To Make Money With Any Story You Get,"This movie should be considered the symbol of Hollywood stupidity, lack of inspiration and greed. Please let me explain why.I have been an avid reader of Tintin since I was a small kid. I have read all of the Tintin comics several times(in french). Enough to know them by heart, actually! My favorite one is ""Tintin au tibet"". My favorite character is Haddock by far! I have even read books and commentaries about Tintin.In my opinion, Spielberg's Tintin resembles Hergé's Tintin on the surface, hence in nothing. This proves that Spielberg is either not telling the truth by saying that he is a big Tintin fan, or that he made this movie for the masses. In either case, it is a bad movie. Here are the facts proving my point:-Hergé's Haddock is a true depiction of human error and weaknesses: alcoholic, selfish, choleric, but in the same time so kind, funny and lovable. In other words, human. On the other hand, Tintin is the perfect hero: always trying to do good, never hesitating, very strong, etc.-Spielberg's Haddock is unfunny, unkind and actually not lovable AT ALL! But the best comes in the end: when Tintin was hesitating and Haddock was so sure about doing the right thing and going for adventure and blabla. No!!!!! You cannot do that, Mr. Spielberg. This single thing proved to me that this director hasn't understood anything about Tintin.It's all about the money honey! That's it and that's why the quality of movies sucks these days! Examples are numerous.I don't want to debate anymore, but I would like to add that the movie is boring. Only the graphics are OK, but personally I don't go to the movies for the quality of the special effects.And what about Haddock and his sheep-lover joke? Is this supposed to be funny?",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Whole Team behind this Movie should return for the Sequel which I hear is being Planned for 2015.Nitpicking aside I would totally recommend Tin Tin to anybody who Loves Action & Adventure with a Good Splash of Comedy thrown in to Keep you Smiling.A Special Nod to Snowy being One of the Main Stars of the Show.Great Snakes!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg delivers a rollicking adventure that never loses sight of its source material,"Prior to watching Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin' adaptation, I decided to read the three Hergé stories upon which it is based, 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. I instantly fell in love them, finding them to be simple and innocent yet rollicking and charming adventures nonetheless. Despite the mixed response to their big screen counterpart, I felt at ease going in; why? Well, a film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, scored by John Williams and written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish couldn't be bad could it? Thankfully, the answer was positive, with the film turning out to be far more enjoyable than expected.'The Adventures of Tintin' follows the eponymous character (Jamie Bell) and his dog and loyal companion Snowy as they stumble across a model of a sailing ship called the 'Unicorn', this attracts the attention of the villainous Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who desperately desires the secrets it holds, which results in a globe-trotting adventure as Tintin encounters the not-exactly-sober Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) whilst attempting to foil Sakharine's plan to stop them as they try to uncover the mystery the 'Unicorn' has to offer...It's been quite a while since Spielberg last delivered a rollicking romp – War of the Worlds was let down Dakota Fanning's never ending screams and a too convenient ending, Munich was rather good but not exactly classic Spielberg and as for 'Crystal Skull', well, let's not go there. So it was time for the Maestro of the Blockbuster to make another adventure that could sit nicely alongside 'ET', 'Jurassic Park', 'Jaws', etc, and with 'Tintin' he has done exactly that. Of all the Spielberg films, 'the Adventures of Tintin's' closest cousin is (unsurprisingly) 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. In fact, no more than two years after Indy's debut on the silver screen did Hergé give the director his blessing as the only man capable of successfully translating his creation to the big screen.Spielberg is a man who knows how to handle the beloved Belgian reporter and it is clear that both he and his key companion, producer Peter Jackson adore the source material. Whether it's Hergé's 'cameo' at the beginning of the film, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it inclusion of 'Le Vingtième Siècle' (the first paper Tintin appeared in) or the similarly fan-pleasing appearance of Bianca Castafiore, it is undeniable that the dynamic duo possess deep reverence for the original comics.However, Spielberg and Jackson understand that Hergé's creation and most of the world outside Central Europe have not enjoyed a lengthy waltz, so this is more than just a film for Tintinologists, presenting newcomers with a fast-paced and deeply enjoyable adventure tale. It has moments of humour that children and adults can enjoy simultaneously and great set- pieces, most notably the breathtaking Baghar-set chase sequence, which is, in my opinion, one of the finest actions sequences Spielberg has ever produced.After Robert Zemeckis' 'The Polar Express' retreated into 'uncanny valley' with a one-way ticket, some doubted the potential of fully mo- capped feature films. Spielberg has learnt from Zemeckis' unfortunate mistakes, utilizing the technology by portraying things quite unfilmmable (an army tank unwillingly carrying a hotel through a busy market anyone?) and performing wonderful camera moves, best seen where Haddock tells the intrepid reporter of his ancestor, Sir Francis and the sea battle he was part of, with the lens seamlessly flowing between his telling of the story and the battle itself, helping to build momentum retain the brisk pace and immerse the viewer in the heart of the action.The film has its flaws though; Daniel Craig's villain is somewhat drippy and bland, the final set piece is a bit anticlimactic and some of the Thomson's gags fall flat, but in the end, these minor problems do little to affect the movie as a whole. Jamie Bell remains the ""blank canvas"" of the comics and is likable all the same, however it is Andy Serkis who stands out in the cast; no surprises there. He is perfectly suited to the role of Haddock, giving the character a Scottish accent, but the film its heart. Overall, this is an enjoyable romp for viewers young and old, both familiar and not with the source material. It's action-packed, visually beautiful, light in tone and great entertainment. When choosing a suitable filmmaker, Hergé couldn't have been more right.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great adventure for the whole family,"I've got to say, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. I don't know how faithful it is to the original comic, but it was a really fun and insanely creative adventure film. All the characters were memorable and likable in some way and the CG animation was stunningly detailed while keeping the cartoonish quality on the animation. All the actors are good (I actually thought that the lead actor was Elijah Wood, but it turns out that it's the guy who played Billy Elliot), but special attention should go to Andy Serkis (who you may know as Gollum) on his performance of the drunken ship captain. It shows that he's got a great comedic delivery and can hold his own as a secondary lead. Hopefully he gets more diverse work because of this rather than just voicing monsters. Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright penned the script with one other person and they give the film a very offbeat quality that I think puts this above a lot of animated adventure films. All in all, a really good experience that I wish I'd caught in theaters. Also, gotta give special props to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who play two very amusing dry comic relief characters. I always love when those two are in a movie together and this is no exception. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Imagine new films starring the likes of Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant and so forth? Mindboggling for sure, but it seems the technology is almost at that point!

"Too many chases, not enough substance.","If you've read Tintin when you were a child, you'll have high standards for an adaptation. Unluckily, even with the best means available, this film disappoints on many levels.First the plot is nonexistent. If you take away the chases on ship, land, in the city and the desert, you'll get a story that can be told in one paragraph. This is an action movie, with no regard to story.Secondly, the images themselves are not at all believable. We understand that nowadays every film has to be 3D or perish, but... I'd have preferred something way simpler, like the ""old fashioned"" Disney films of I guess the 60s, like Tom & Jerry, Donald Duck, to Thundercats, Transformers etc. 20 years later.Tintin is not just a funny hairdo who fights down thugs. He's got a humanistic content that's blatantly absent in this movie. Tintin is intrepid but with the mind, not with his fists.Captain Haddock is way worse. A constant drunkard, this film is basically Tintin's struggle to get him out of this addiction. And rather repetitive at that.D. Craig as Rackham is way better, but he's not as central in the books as in this film, that already is selling us a sequel before it ends. The Thomsons are OK, I didn't like ""Snowy"", thought it was too humanized.""Upcoming"" on IMDb has a great positive review; I'm not glad mine cannot be so positive. ""Ra-gp"" (another user)'s review is right about the technical aspects being fine, like some creative montages. Music by John Williams is of course dutifully fine.Maybe I was so disappointed because I expected a lot. I don't like motion-capture films like Zemeckis', and I'm afraid this film will win many accolades. Its commercial success doesn't relate to the qualities of the comic book, which just wasn't a cartoon in the American sense of the Spider man, Superman and so on. Summarizing, to put it in PC games' terms, I wanted ""Myst"", a game of mental riddles and beauty, and got ""Counter strike"" with a tint of AA/ addiction's recovery.Disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and Very Indiana Jones Like!,"The Adventures of Tintin, based off the European comics by Herge, is a another action-adventure movie that has an Indiana Jones like feel to it. It should because the original Indiana Jones series was actually influenced by this comic and it was directed by the great Steven Spielberg. This film, despite being animated, has brisk action and some cool adventure scenes as the characters travel across the world.Spielberg's film is about a reporter named Tintin and his dog Snowy and they meet up with Captain Haddock and together, they search for a sunken ship that supposedly has treasure.This film features some good voice-acting. I'm really not surprised Andy Serkis was in this film because he has a knack of doing films like this. I was able to recognize the voices of Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig.Overall, this is a fun movie that has the spirit of the Indiana Jones films. It had great action and adventure scenes and apparently people overseas loved this movie more than us Americans. But, it's a fun end-of-the-year movie people should see. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not even a wee bit conventional,"In elementary school, The Adventures of Tintin graphic novels were the only thing I would read. I have read a majority of the books, which came in a large, hardcover format boasting three adventures in one book. That's what they were. They weren't stories, comics, or even vignettes; they were adventures. Involving, consuming, and utterly motivating adventures about a young journalist named Tintin who would go on mysteries and solve cases with his loyal companion, Snowy, an intelligent white dog.Too bad I haven't read a Tintin adventure in a blue moon, so comparing it to the original works by the Belgian author, Hergé is simply out of the question. My memory has faded and time is greatly limited. With that being said, I can say that from the vague details that I remember, the film adaptation of the comics is true to its original, breathtaking source material. The story centers around Tintin (Bell) and his dog Snowy, who are caught up in a whirlwind of trouble after purchasing an antique model ship at a European flea market. It turns out, the ship contains an ancient scroll that, when put together with two others, reveals a message. Tintin teams up with the rum-guzzling Captain Haddock (Serkis), and gets assistance from the simple and dense Thomson and Thompson (Pegg and Frost) to discover the truth about the ships and what powers the scrolls might possess.The film has a very good sense of action, and in today's world, that's one of the highest compliments I can pay to a film. We see beautifully recreated European cities, which is a break from the droning, ordinary cityscapes we are victim to so much today. I am also known to grow weary of special effects and chase scenes, but here, I was simply amused and in awe, especially by one that takes place in a skimmer plane that eventually ends up in the Sahara desert. I dare not spoil it for the viewers-to-be, but I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching an action scene unfold.Some scenes are so tricky and complex, we wonder how Spielberg could've possibly held onto coherency while directing them. But he does. And that's the beauty of the man himself. I recently watched his underrated drama The Terminal, and noticed two things I never saw in Spielberg's work before. One, he has an uncanny sense of detail and an intricate focus on the little things in the background. He also never becomes pictorial, meaning he doesn't rely on background distractions and unnecessary supporting characters to unintentionally muddy the meaning. He's smart, attentive, and very, very crafty. The second thing I noticed is how well he directs films in condensed, claustrophobic spaces. An airport, where The Terminal took place, is not the easiest place to shoot at. Neither is deep in a cave like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Spielberg always does it and does it well. Some shots in Tintin are so complex, multifarious, and alive that we wonder how one man could've directed them without going mad or over-the-top. Just watch the film, then search up clips from an incoherent, maddening visual spectacle like Transformers: Dark of the Moon and you'll get two gleaming examples of art and junk.I mentioned the film is animated. That it is. I've noticed some have mistaken it for live action online. Seeing the poster in the theater, I thought it was live action as well. The film utilizes the motion capture animation I haven't been so fond of recently. After seeing the dreadful Mars Needs Moms, I thought I'd be content if I never saw the tactic used again in my life. For that film, it was absolutely needless. There was no reason to go through the extra time, money, trouble, and agony to fit actors for suits and make them act out the motions of their characters just for a lame, forgettable space cartoon. Here, it's extraordinary. It seems Peter Jackson (producer on the film) and Spielberg have discovered a way to iron out the kinks in the procedure (even though the eyes still look a bit unnatural). Some scenes, like when the three are lost at sea, are absolutely breathtaking and you may even be amazed what you're watching is animation.I fear that too many parents will rob their kids of the joyous experience The Adventures of Tintin will likely bring them. The film is filled with life, action, fun, and colors for the kids, and there's enough wit, interest, and grandiose ideas to share with the adults. It's an experience, whether you're a fan or not. Like many detective stories, it has substance in its story, but the true adventures are with the characters. Spielberg has had one of his most productive and successful years, directing a period epic, finally awarding a graphic novel with a film adaptation, and producing Real Steel, Super 8, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. But the great thing about a film like Tintin is it knows its characters, setting, and plan inside and out, while other action films continue to ""play it by ear"" to see where the next missile will land.Starring: Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost.

I am stunned,"I was raised on Tintin. When I heard there was going to be a movie, and who was involved in making it, I was filled with a mix of excitement and dread. If there were people who COULD do Tintin justice, this was the right group, but could they pull it off? I saw the previews, and remained skeptical. The animation comes uncomfortably close to the dreaded Uncanny Valley. When the credits started, I had hopes. As I watched the film, I was enraptured. They did it RIGHT! The characters are themselves, the action is thrilling, the humor a mix of slapstick and sharp wit. What impressed me most, however, were the movements. Somehow the film translates the still-panel comic with it's exaggerated stances into motion. I think anyone who knows the comic will see what I mean. It was fresh, new and familiar all at once.My best advice for someone new to the world of Tintin is to go in with these expectations: 1. The laws of physics are wobbly in Tintin's world. Ignore them.2. Expect random slapstick and enjoy it.3. Tintin is Tintin. He is glue of the story that holds the colorful characters about him together. Don't let yourself be disappointed by the unfashionable straight-forwardness of his character. He is what he needs to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg now stoops to manipulate the works of the celebrated Herge.,"Tintin the creation of the greatest comic book artist that ever lived. Georges Remi didn't envision this at all.

Then see the difference between what Spielberg in true Hollywood money-making fashion has made to earn some more bucks.This film is clearly created NOT for the fans of TINTIN comic books, but for persons who have never read the original comic books. The whole plot is done Hollywood style with latest C.G.I animations to boot.In my belief, this film should have been made by the French.

This film is a joy to watch!,"I enjoyed every minute of The Adventures of Tin Tin. The story in not only fast moving, it's beautifully designed all the way through including the opening graphics. The carefully drawn Herge comic-strip style book has been translated into film perfectly. Tin Tin books, are not just fun to read, they are imaginatively adventurous and carefully designed and drawn. Translating all this so faithfully into CGi 3D and 2D film format is a brilliant achievement. I didn't want it to end. We watched it in 2D, as we all have slightly imperfect eyesight and find watching an entire feature film in 3D a bit uncomfortable. I suspect anyone with a lazy eye or astigmatism might have difficulty in really enjoying a film in 3D. I found myself smiling all the way through the film. Although it is an exciting adventure, it also has a really entertaining storyline. The pickpocket who catalogued and archived all the wallets he stole, Snowy's stunts when Tin Tin is kidnapped, the timing of the stunts, the bumbling Thomson twins and the brilliantly swashbuckling Captain Haddock. Probably, as with the books, this is a film I would want to watch again and again. The exciting and stylish world of Tin Tin offers such delightful escapism, I think I will want visit it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pioneering New Style of Filmmaking,"Tin Tin is nothing more nor less than the eventual new prototype of motion pictures. Just like Citizen Kane it represents a watershed, a turning point. Let us compare the film to what it will replace in Spielberg's bag of tricks; The Indiana Jones series. Sad fact is Harrison Ford has, like all human beings, grown old. Not so with Tin Tin. He will be forever young, forever a youth at the threshold of all his adult power; forever fresh faced, no grey to sully the bright red cowlick, no wrinkles will ever spoil the pink smooth skin. Like John Henry vs the Steam Hammer mere flesh is bound to lose. Harrison Ford is mere inferior flesh. Tin Tin will never enter rehab. Perhaps his voice actor or his motion capture double will but they are mere company men on salary or contract & easily replaced. No pique, no fits of ego, ALL the weakness & sins of the flesh ended at a stroke. NO PRIOR COMMITMENTS. He will always OK the script and he works cheap. NO 50% of the gross for his services; The whole persona package a mere fraction of a star in his or her prime. As long as a backup of the computer models exists somewhere in any computer, anywhere even a hundred years hence there can be a Tin Tin revival whenever the public is willing to watch & be entertained by one.Back to comparing The assumed retired Indiana Jones epics. Do you realize what the bill would have been to wrangle the cars, ships, planes & other assorted vehicles that added such variety & interest to the movie? ASTRONOMICAL. Many would have to be cheated out of less valuable cars etc & NOWHERE near the realism of the street traffic could be generated at ANY COST. Could any production company afford to crush a classic Rolls Royce Limousine such as the villain's? Crash land a Bellanca in a howling storm? The Indiana Jones movies must have allowed legions of studio carpenters & prop-makers to acquire a tidy retirement. Ditto for the costumers & make up artists.The movie has a vast sweep of period cities & exotic locales. The bill for Security Alone in let's say, Tangier as a close guess for the sultan's palace sequence would cover the CGI for ALL the locales in the movie. Boys & girls the game is over. Movie making is a money making business & when a world class action adventure movie with non stop camera movement & virtually no limits on ANY & ALL production values can be knocked together for a mere $130,000,000 & post an immediate gross of $371,940,071 well then the writing is on the wall. Bear in mind that this film pioneered the new production style. It will be even cheaper once this is routine. The film is way outside the traditional fairy tale or fantasy realm; That is the essential difference. This new sort of photo realistic CGI might not appeal to older film audiences & a few might even reject the look but almost everyone else will be vastly entertained & THAT is the object of the exercise, to entertain. This, due to the business parameters that it shatters is the future of film.As for the film content itself; Vastly amusing & exciting entertainment. A worthy successor to the Indiana Jones series. I thoroughly enjoyed it.As an after thought I feel I should credit Zack Snyder's ""300"" as the forerunner of the new style & technology. The term 'Virtual Back Lot' has been bandied about; seems to me an apt name. However; It takes a Spielberg with his massive administrative talent to truly turn the corner & that would be ""Tintin"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Total value for the money,Its very rare these days to leave a cinema feeling totally satisfied from all the expense but Tintin ticked all the boxes. How anyone can rate it 2 stars of less is beyond me. They obviously have agendas I cant comprehend. Some of the purists have negative comments but then who would want to make it like the original concept which would have been impossible to commercialise. I have seen the Toys stories and the Smurfs and have a reasonable grasp on what deserves a 10 or a 1 star and TinTin definitely a 10 with all the family excited all the way through.

Spielberg's Back!!!!,"TINTIN is the best movie of the year, and Steven Spielberg's best movie in more than a decade. The movie is fun, exciting, hilarious, creative, awesome, and, in the final scene profound.Some people complain about motion capture animation, but I've always found the complaints exaggerated and ignorant. Animation is not supposed to have the same degree of facial expression as a great live-action actor. And, any complaints about the facial expressions in the TINTIN movie are even more ridiculous when considering that the main character in the original comic has pinprick eyes!THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN is an exhilarating, family friendly roller coaster ride. The action is thoroughly exciting. Spielberg introduces the three heroes in a steady, captivating way so that the story's frenetic action doesn't get in the way of one's sympathy for them. The comedy is playful and perfectly pitched. It adds immensely to the fun. Also, the motion capture animation is beautifully detailed.TINTIN is a throwback to Steven Spielberg's earlier work. In fact, his classic movie RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK reportedly was compared in France to the Tintin comic books on which this movie is itself based, and that's the movie this movie most resembles.Best of all, TINTIN has a strong moral, redemptive world view. (SPOILERS FOLLOW) Good conquers evil, an alcoholic sidekick finds sobriety, and the villain goes off to jail instead of being killed. THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN also has positive overt references to the Cross on which Christ suffered and died for our sins. That's actually one of the clues to where the treasure lies. Also, at the climax of the whole story, there's an overt reference to ""St. John the Evangelist,"" the man who wrote the Gospel of John, the Book of Revelation, and three epistles in the New Testament. This content gives the movie a strong Christian allegorical, symbolic, or metaphorical sense where light from the ""sun"" reveals the final clue to the mystery of the hidden treasure. The light from the desert sun also helps sober up Captain Haddock enough so he can tell Tintin the story about how his ancestor's treasure got lost in the first place. Of course, in TINTIN, the treasure is gold and jewels, a family treasure. All this imagery, however, suggests that it's at the foot of the Cross, in the light that Jesus offers to all men (John 1:9), where one's true treasure lies. That's the best message you can send to any audience any time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Tintin"" is not in the top ten-ten of my favorite movies of the year, but I liked it!","Steven Spielberg's first computer-animated movie ""The Adventures of Tintin"" marks another gold cinematic star on this master's legendary directorial resume, and also signifies that there is no genre Steven cannot helm. The protagonist Tintin is voiced by Jamie Bell. Tintin is a young intrepid reporter always looking for an adventurous story. He sails on one when he buys a model ship called the Unicorn that includes a scroll that might be the key to a fortune. The problem is that the villainous Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) is hot on Tintin's tail to devour him of the Unicorn with its scroll. However, Tintin is no tonto; and with his magical dog Snowy there is no adventure Tintin can't handle. I love Tintin's cool, calm, and collective demeanor in facing even the most challenging of situations. Tintin teams up with Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), whose ancestor was the Unicorn's first ship rider, in order to find the other model Unicorns with their treasured scrolls. Spielberg does incorporate the movie with some of his infamous storytelling themes and directorial techniques of his past iconic movies such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", and even ""E.T.""; but in a more fast-paced family entertainment mode. Spielberg's team of screenwriters (Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish) verbally insert the movie with plenty of wit and exhilaration. And how can one not be impressed with the movie's ""true-to-almost-life"" animation. The only knock I have against Tintin , like the movie business itself, is that there was a bit too much piracy in it; at times it seemed like a computer animated version of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At Tintin's End"". Nevertheless, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is tintinlating enough to garner a viewing adventure. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spielberg has spoilt Tintin,"I went into this film expecting the worst but hoping for the best, as an avid Tintin fan as a kid I always kind of felt, and now feel, that he should be left in his original form and not tampered with. Firstly, a lot of people have complained about really basic things like the voices, cinematography or music. None of that stuff really bothered me, I actually thought the voices were pretty good (apart from perhaps Thomson & Thompson) adaptations, people are always going to have had created their own imaginary voices for the characters but I think this was done well and pleased most people. The cinematography was pretty decent, though it felt very inappropriately Indiana Jones-esc in the last quarter, and the music was absolutely fine - I don't think Tintin really needs an Indie like score, it wouldn't really work.Several things, however, really REALLY bugged me. Firstly; the film is supposed to be a combination of three books (The Secret of The Unicorn, The Crab With the Golden Claws and Red Rackham's treasure) but I just didn't see the point in that at all. The bits in the film which are good are the bits which are just direct copies of Herge and I just don't see why Spielberg couldn't have just followed exactly a book, or two books, especially given that any of the books is effectively a storyboard and script in itself. All that happens as a result of this is a wobbly first half of the film, which isn't that bad, and then a really really crappy second half, that utterly misses the original books - the Bird Brothers aren't mentioned once and the main 'baddy' is someone, who in the Secret of The Unicorn, plays a very very minor role. There's two action scenes which are both straight out of Indiana Jones but that, at least, for me is the complete opposite of what Tintin is supposed to be - he's supposed to be a very precise, intelligent, cunning character not a loud Hollywood directed moron who blows everything up. There is also an extremely clichéd ""never give up, never let anyone tell you blah blah blah blah"" type speech from Haddock to Tintin that's just awful; firstly because he could easily have not put it in and more importantly because that, again, is not what Tintin is about and it never happens in any of the books.All of those things, and other minor details, just make the film feel really unpolished, as though it was a real lacklustre effort that went into making it and at its best its completely average. This actually made me really angry, Tintin is a legendary character who deserves the utmost respect and that just wasn't given to him at all. What is more I just don't get why Spielberg felt the need to warp the story in the way that he did because it ruined it completely. Most importantly though, I fear Tintin could really be mutilated for a new generation of readers, I would bet that most kids going to see this film (and Tintin is, as much as I love it, for kids!) haven't read any of the books and they've been given this completely false image of a really amazing, fun character. Go and see it, because you kind of have to, but prepare to be let down really badly.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

MY REVIEW: The Adventure is Out There!!,"Tintin, the name we are familiar with but never know much about him. Legends like Steven Spileberg and Peter Jackson club together and start a new animation franchise The Adventures of Tintin. The first outing is directed by Steven himself. So what is it that makes Tintin movie special? I will say it is the state of the art animation made with the help of motion capture technology, the relentless action drama and detailing which will remind you of Indy movies. Movie never tries to be utterly funny like other animations around; it keeps itself serious about its mission and succeeds by a margin. Although Tintin himself is not a funny guy but his pet Snowy and ally caption Haddok provide enough fun moments. Lack of any female character does not bother. So if you liked Indy movies or Pirate movies then it will sum both of them for you in animation format. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Adventures of Tintin. There is sequel planned and this time Peter Jackson will be taking the command and we all know how much Peter loves adventures.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Film,"Fantastic film, being from Spain, I use to own the entire comic book collection, ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" was one of my favorite ones, I remember perfectly spending hours in front of that piece of art. The movie in my opinion is fantastic, both directors really follow Herge's paths, the storyline is suddle and at the same time doesn't loose paste on the action sequences. I loved the colors really close to the sense of color in Herge's collection. The effects were great, the 3D aspect (not being a big fan of it) was treated very careful, this guys did not go all over the top with it. The music in the other had was a little dull, was not bad but considering that ""master"" Williams composed, I was expecting a little more.

I was expecting something better.,"This digital animated film recreates one of the most famous stories of the comic Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. Directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, with soundtrack of John Williams and a script by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, the film features the voices of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, and other voice actors.I was never an avid reader of Tintin, but the comic strip was, for me, a good company during childhood and adolescence (still is, sometimes). But I never had a good impression of films based on comic-strips, as always end too stylized or unrealistic. In this case, keeping the film as an animation, I was waiting for something like the comic, and many similarities with the magazine. But my expectations were far from being met by this film, which does not seem able to capture the essence of Tintin. The script, despite being good and consistent to the cinema, don't link to the comic where it was based. On the contrary, it almost rejects it by mixing elements of another magazine and invent many other things that don't fit in the Tintin image, issued by magazines. Therefore, characters seem rather forced, and their reactions don't seem true to what might be expected in the magazines.The dubbing work looks very good, I didn't notice delays or errors. Most of voice actors used here are seasoned actors, with an excellent voice modulation capability, knowing well how to put voice to achieve the desired effect. The work of animation and visual effects are excellent, very colorful and striking. Its the wonder of digital animation. The soundtrack is very good but I expected something more intense.Overall, the film is quite interesting and entertaining but becomes boring at certain times and almost can't create a real sense of mystery, suspense and adventure.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much better than I imagined,I am not a fan of Tin Tin and was therefore not particularly looking forward to watching this. Thankfully it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be.The animation is simply stunning and the set pieces are breathtaking. There are plenty of genuinely funny moments throughout the film to go with the numerous action sequences. It is also surprisingly violent for a PG rated film. The plot is pretty far fetched but to be honest when a film looks this good it doesn't really matter.I watched this with my two young sons and they enjoyed it even more than me. A film that can be enjoyed by all ages and another triumph for Steven Spielberg.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Adventure worth watching,"When I was watching this movie, I could not get over how terrific the CGI was in this movie. I have not seen CGI better than this. Though, I was also slightly disappointed with the character creations. Mainly because of the big noises. I know that this is considered a cartoon, and have big noses is usual for a cartoon, but I have yet to see a cartoon type thing, whether CGI or not, that looks totally realistic. The look of TinTin compared to the rest of the cast just did not seem to fit for me. That was my main issue.There were some parts in which I felt the movie dragged a bit. I did think it was entertaining though. I was happy to see Andy Serkis in this. Known for a lot of CGI movies, which seems to be every movie he is in now, he actually has lines in this one. He plays the drunken Captain Haddock, a guy who can not take two steps without having a sip of ye Ole whiskey. Jamie Bell did a great job, fitting the character of the title character. The way his character looked fit with his voice.You might enjoy it or you might not. The Adventures of TinTin is one hell of a ride, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding action,"I saw Tintin with no expectations, having never read a single one of the comics. Suffice to say I had a pretty good time with it.The plot itself is the usual formula for a film like this. While the opening credits were brilliant, I was losing more and more interest with it in it's first act. The reason is because the characters are never developed enough for us to care greatly. I was interested in the least, but I wasn't incredibly intrigued by them. The way the plot was unfolding was becoming way too dull, but then the film did a 180. When? When the action started of course.I don't mean to sound like action was what I come to expect to any film like this, but it greatly improved this film. It's one of the most action-packed films of the year, moreso than I would have thought. There are a countless number of outstanding action sequences, and I mean outstanding! The sweeping cinematography during these action pieces, along with the roaring and impressive sound effects and the perfectly balanced score really bring magic to it in ways you wouldn't expect. Like I said, there are a lot of fantastic action scenes here, not just a few.I really liked this film, but it's only because of what I mentioned. As a whole, the storyline is pretty thin, and the dialogue often dull, if at times funny. This needed a stronger management of the plot and more fully-developed characters. Still, it's hard to really look a the negative side here. Since the film rarely slows down, it's always moving, always very entertaining and always roaring with energy. Did I mention the incredible action sequences? Oh, and forget Uggie from The Artist! Snowy is all around perfect and the best dog of 2011!",,Anonymous,Animation
Well worth seeing,"Went along to see this ( at Peter Jacksons 'Roxy theatre - great location) in 3D with my 9 yr old daughter. I thought it may have been more of a boys movie, however that didn't end up being the case. I knew/enjoyed the comics as a kid - however although the characters were all knew to my daughter, she was also impressed. Plenty of action, and a storyline that was easy enough to follow. I felt it kept both kids and parents interested throughout - some of the action sequences were particularly well done. I wasn't too sure about the format i.e. sort of in-between cartoon and realm characters, but it works well in this instance. In usual Jackson/Speiling/Hollywood tradition the ending is left open for a sequel ... which no doubt will follow. I Wont say its an all time great film, but compared to some of the current kids holiday rubbish around ( i.e. chipwrecked ) I think its well worth the entry fee.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Unapologetic, Shameless Fun!","No Spoilers - just the overview of the film. Whew! saw the 'Secret of the Unicorn' on the first day here in Malaysia. I had written on the release of the first poster last year , that this might be the end of how we had imagined the voice of Tintin and the swears of Haddock in our heads as Spielberg is going to replace it with his vision and imagination for us . But thankfully, he has managed to sync his vision quite well with what I had :) On the Movie - I Was blown away , it is one roller coaster which doesn't even allow you catch your breath right from the first scene. I agree with Spielberg when he says ""it is an unapologetic shameless adventure"". The Secret of the Unicorn was the first Tintin book that i read, back in 5th Standard and have been a big fan of Herge and a Tintinomaniac since then, so i can understand why some of the loyalists seem to be irked on seeing many elements of the original story changed and tweaked in this movie . But as far as I am concerned I think those tweaks only adds and not take anything away from the original unabashed romp and class of Herge. Only Spielberg could have managed such a feat!The movie can never come close to the joy of the book but I don't think it is even meant to. On screen Spielberg and Jackson delivers something which is fantastically as close to what fans would remember of Tintin and also gives a whole new generation of people who haven't savored the magic of Tintin, a reason to dive into Herge's world. So all those who are cribbing, just sit back with a fresh mind and watch Spielberg transport you to your childhood. Cant wait for the second and third in the series! Hopefully it will be the Seven Crystal Balls/ Prisoners of the Sun followed by Destination Moon / Explorers of the Moon. Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun and adventure,"I went into ""Tintin"" knowing virtually nothing about the original Hergé novels other than they were very well-regarded.Anyway, lacking any bias one way another as a Tintin purist coming into the movie I was primarily interested in entertainment value and it's more than fair to say ""The Adventures of Tintin"" packs a whole lot of entertainment into its lean frame. There's only an infinitesimal amount of room for non- action in this wall-to-wall action-adventure. You don't get much slack to breathe in this romp through a plot that carries you around Europe and North Africa.Tintin is the perspicacious reporter always on the prowl for a great story. There's no waiting for him to find one. This one turns around a model of a clipper ship called The Unicorn that he finds randomly in an outdoor market. Immediately multiple people descend on him to either attempt to buy it from him or warn him about it. And so begins the bramble of a plot that brings in the sodden Captain Haddock - wonderfully voiced and acted by Andy Serkis - to companion and accelerate Tintin's adventure. In fact, Haddock becomes a crucial component of his story.There's a lot of fun to be had in ""Tintin,"" a good deal of humor - some great, some not-so-great - and a heap of mind-swerving visual play. It's a bit dizzying at times, but too irresistible to warrant real criticism. From raucous runs through North African towns to flashbacks to a pirate battle that easily rivals any from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.""Tintin"" has more than its share of disbelief suspension but that has a natural tendency to happen in a film that is 100% CGI-driven where sometimes animators do things just because they can. Some visual tricks come completely out of nowhere. Not so much bizarre but just kind of out of place - like multiple buildings that move down the hill of that North African town. I didn't get where they fit into the pretty wild action and what the point was. Maybe when I watch it again I will.That said - the animation is unique and first-rate. Being an homage to Hergé, the character model are quite different and fit what a Tintin purist probably expects; e.g., Captain Haddock's head is unusually large in proportion to his body.I didn't find issues common with motion capture animation to be much in evidence; i.e., primarily the creepy ""dead eye"" (aka ""Uncanny Valley"") that had largely killed motion capture animation for me and pretty much everyone (e.g., ""Polar Express"" and virtually anything done by the Robert Zemeckis'/Disney's now-defunct Imagemovers Digital). Though some have taken umbrage with this and think the glassy-eyes and waxy skins are still there, I was actually struck by the realism of the animation, primarily of Tintin himself - though clearly Haddock and the ""Thomson Twins"" are intentionally cartoonish. Somehow it all works though.Overall ""Tintin"" is tremendously entertaining, a great adventure and plot that keeps your pulse racing. Tintin, his trusty dog Snowy, and Haddock are fun and engaging characters you want to spend time with and lose yourself in their world. Easily worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hergé said only Spielberg could do Tintin justice and he was right.,"As many reviewers here, I'm was a Tintin fan from a very young age. It was always a gift when I got a new graphic novel to read. As said in the title of this review, Hergé said that only Steven Spielberg could do Tintin justice in making a film and he was not mistaken. Spielberg honours the artist is such a magnificent manner, in the beginning of the movie which was a bliss!The basic plot is to find the location of the Red Rackham's treasure. Tintin embarks on an adventure that takes him into a dangerous game in finding the scroll that will reveal its mystery. I don't want to spoilt too much of the plot, so I'm going to keep it very basic. In between I'll also explain where some changes were made and why this was, in my opinion, a necessary sacrifice.The beginning of the first act is basically the same as in the plot. Tintin finds a replica of the Unicorn, which was a ship that held a magnificent cargo as he later discovers. Only minor changes were made such as the removal of Professor Calculus. All characters needed a proper introduction, because they are unknown to public, as graphic novel 'The Secret of the Unicorn' didn't introduce the characters at all. These characters also don''t know each other, which is why a scene such as Haddock meeting Tintin was inserted, so that they are properly introduced as in the graphic novels. So in case. You just knew them from previous albums. My guess is that Calculus will get a proper introduction in the sequel. Spielberg introduced this marvellous characters this in an inventive way, by firstly combining three graphic novels together. This isn't a full adaption of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. Some wouldn't call this faithful to the graphic novel or to Hergé. And I can't completely disagree with them. But is that necessarily a bad thing?A film is a different medium than a graphic novel so from when I heard the news that a film was going to made based on Tintin, I knew immediately that they were going to be changes. In my opinion the combination of three graphic novels was a good move, which allowed Spielberg to use the best work of Hergé, so I wouldn't call that unfaithful. And as long as it is faithful to his work than I am pleased.The second act brings you to a very action-packed scene on a boat that takes them to Morocco. These scenes were based on the graphic novel of The Crab with the Golden Claws. It's in this act that we get introduced to Captain Haddock, which the villain Ivanovitch Sakharine First I have to tell you that Sakharine was no villain in the original graphic novel. But making him the villain was interesting to see, because it bound it to a new story to enjoy. Haddock slowly starts to remember the original story of his ancestor Sir Francis. In the graphic novel he find the story in his journal. In the film he slowly begins to remember it in a truly inventive way and in sequences, rather than just immediately. This made the film more funny and the visuals were spectacular. When we get to Morocco we see scenes of another graphic novel namely the King's sceptre.A scene I really enjoyed is the chase scene. Most of the chase is, as if it was filmed in one very long shot, that doesn't cut. This made it like a roller-coaster ride, which was truly action packed and very enjoyable to watch. The climax of the film is not found in any of the graphic novels, mainly because Sakharine, as I said earlier, he was no villain at all in the original story. The ending is based on Red Rackhams' Treasure and this is where I got confused about the sequels. Because the ending implies that there will be no direct follow-up to the story and I hope that I'm wrong.About the visuals and the 3D, I can only say that I wasn't disappointed. This was a big budget movie, so I didn't expect that Spielberg would use Hergé's actual style to make an animated feature like they already did in the past. I've already seen evidence of past live-action films and the attempt Spielberg made in some early tests that another live-action film would have looked quite silly. Motion capture was a very good choice, to stay faithful to Hergé's drawing style to some point and make this a very colourful and detailed spectacle.As for the 3D, I can only say that it was very subtle. It didn't distract me in any way. Spielberg found a nice balance so that this film can be enjoyed in 2D as well in 3D. It won't let you down. And I'm not a big fan of 3D, but I did enjoy this. The style of the visuals combined with the setting really brought me back to the past setting seen in the graphic novels. And John Williams' music only improved this with his music, which never lets me down. The Soundtrack, in my honest opinion, isn't Williams' greatest work, but it is very good.So was this a faithful film to Hergé's work? I would definitely say it was. But every Tintin fan will have a different opinion on this. There might have been changes in the scenes and of course the general story, but that doesn't make it less faithful to his actual work. And that is, what in the end, what matters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great adventure even for those who have not read Tintin,"A brief background: It seems that Tintin is popular everywhere in the world except the US. Even Indians have heard of him. My wife was dying to see it, and I had read one volume I bought her; entertaining, but I was certainly not a huge fan.Now the movie: very entertaining film. The film tries not to stray away from the depictions of many of the characters of the comic, as well as mannerisms. You certainly won't get the same style of storytelling that you saw in the Herge comics, but the story is as intricate and fun to follow as Spielberg's previous adventure outings. Caat is excellent in all respects, especially Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock. While the action may be more dynamic than what was in the Tintin comics, it is certainly fun and exciting. The CGI is great, especially for translating a comic (a live film would have only detracted from the storytelling). And all this was without watching the 3D version.Overall, even if you have never heard of Tintin, or are vaguely familiar, it will be a fun ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn Review,"After hyping myself up for The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn last night I went into the film with high hopes, as I enjoyed the old cartoon series. I won't say I was disappointed but it didn't meet my expectations.The most disappointing part for me was the soundtrack. Whenever the tempo began to increase, it would then just drop never quite achieving an emotional response from me. When the rest of the film resembles classics like the Indiana Jones trilogy, it is understandable why the audio track let me down.The plot was very similar to the cartoon episodes, The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn, which the film was based on. For obvious reasons these episodes had to be combined so for the film to flow properly. As is any movie based on a TV show, comic or book; there are also many scenes that have been cut and plenty of new scenes and stories added for the plot to make a little more sense. But like I said, a large number of movie adaptations do this and so I won't dwell on the altered plot too long.Soundtrack, and plot, aside this film was still enjoyable to watch; perhaps even more so I you're a child watching for the very first time. The aspect of the film that made it so enjoyable was not the plot, soundtrack or even visuals, which were as fantastic as expected thanks to the technology of motion capture. But the characters themselves are what made this film. Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) was fantastic, we saw him angry, loyal, worried and most importantly drunk. They stuck very close to his character from the cartoons, and comics, as you'd hope Spielberg would. Jamie Bell, or Billy Elliot as may of us know him, gave us the character of Tintin. Unfortunately Tintin was a little emotionless throughout the film and the voice acting wasn't perfect, but even this is easily forgotten when Inspector Thompson (Simon Pegg) and Inspector Thomson (Nick Frost) are on the screen. These two characters are as precise to the comics and cartoons as they could be. When they are on screen the audience cannot help but have a grin on their face and laugh at the simplest of slapstick comedy. But to say that they are the highlight of the film puts Daniel Craig to shame. As Daniel Craig is well known for Bond I, and others, often criticise his acting ability. But when he provides such a slimy villain as Sakharine I am forced but to give him credit for his acting. Absolutely nothing about this character resembles Craig in anyway; be it look, motion or sound. Craig has done an improbable job providing The Adventures of Tintin with a dastardly villain.Finally I have to write a brief note about the look of the film. Now it doesn't look like the Tintin comics or cartoon (i.e. Hand-drawn) but I had never expected it to in this day and age. The characters all look like the cartoon version of themselves but 3D computer models instead. Thompson and Thomson have to be once again referenced as they look as similar to their cartoon counterparts as they possibly could do, whereas Tintin seems a little too lifelike in this world of big nosed, squinty eyed characters. The motion capture animation makes the film very lifelike and is likely to be the future for all forms of animation eventually.To summarise this film, although it doesn't meet all expectations, it is still very much a Tintin movie. We get the enjoyable relationship of the two protagonists (and snowy), as well as the slapstick, comedic breaks of Thompson and Thomson, and the villainous Sakharine. The film feels like a children's Indiana Jones movie, as one would expect and it is only let down by an unfulfilling soundtrack and a slightly predictable plot. All in all The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is well worth a watch, if not just for the nostalgia.http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spielberg's apology for Kingdom of Crystal Skulls,"Tintin is one of my favourite cartoon characters. Hergé's 23 Tintin books all have charm, humour and excitement, and it really did seem like that charm only worked on the printed page. Why? Because pretty much any attempt at a film adaptation has ended in utter disaster. That is, until I found out Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson decided to have a go at it. When I found out they were making a film of my three personal favourite Tintin stories, I was more hyped that I was for the last Harry Potter movie. It's one of the best directors of all time, a great choice of producer, a talented bunch of writers including Doctor Who's Steven Moffat and Hot Fuzz's Edgar Wright, all working on a film of one of my favourite comic book series of all time. How could I not be hyped?But I've got to admit, when I watched the trailer I was slightly let down. It looked like the film would revolve purely around epic action. There was nothing subtle about it, the film didn't look like it would have any of the light humour that the original series was known for. It almost looked like just a money-grubbing blockbuster, similar to the Lost in Space or G.I. Joe films. My expectations hadn't been completely let down; the trailer had good things in it and the poster looked cool, but it just looked like too much. I heard that this was all to ""spice it up a bit for the mainstream audience"", but this was pushing it.So I went to watch it with my brother at my local cinema and we both just cleared our minds of expectations. I knew there was never a chance it'd be completely bad considering all the talent involved.So the movie started. The first 20 minutes were... okay. Nothing awful, but I did feel it was more going through the motions of the book more than anything. The 2D title sequence was great and there was a clever little moment involving Tintin getting a caricature of himself done, with the result actually looking like one of Hergé's original Tintin drawings, but other than that nothing really stood out. It got things started and introduced all the characters I know and love, but I never really felt an air of tension and excitement.Then, almost out of nowhere, things immediately picked up. I'll try not to give anything away, but it's got something to do with a ferry. From then on, the film really starts, and we are given a truly exciting adventure without a single second of boredom. The film plays out like Spielberg's Indiana Jones films. In fact, I'm willing to say that if you replaced Tintin with Indiana Jones, this would have been the real comeback people wanted. It's got that epic feel that I feared from the trailer, but somehow it manages to carry the charm of the original books all the way too. As it turned out it didn't really spice things up at all; the exciting atmosphere came purely from the original books.The story is evenly paced and well put together. Fitting three comic books into a runtime of 100 minutes is no easy task, but the filmmakers do it beautifully, actually mixing the stories together to create one. The voice acting is also pretty good too. Andy Serkis was awesome and seeing Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as the series' comedic double act Thomson and Thompson was a pleasant and clever idea.The animation is amazing. The mix of motion capture and fully computerised animation is used to its full advantage. Robert Zemeckis would be proud. The shot is also never still; the camera always seems to want to move. This can be a bit irritating at times, and a few of the shots are a bit exaggerated, but there are still great moments. In particular, there's an electrifying shot during a chase scene which you can see in the trailer. It's awesome.Overall, Tintin is a great film which manages to capture that exciting Hollywood feel of Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, while also capturing the good humour and charm of Hergé's original stories. It's definitely worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moffat does justice to Remi's original,"The much anticipated ""Adventures of Tintin - Secret of the Unicorn"" has finally hit the screens after some hitches in production and casting, delaying the release by almost a year.Steven Spielberg, winner of Best Director Oscar comes together with Steven Moffat (of the ""Doctor Who"" fame, whom Spielberg is rumored to have had a hard time in making a part of the movie) in this 3D film. Moffat has created a fantastic adaptation of Hergé's timeless classic with the help of co-writers Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish.The plot revolves around the secrets of a famous 17th century ship, The Unicorn, captained by Capt. Haddock's grandfather, Sir Francis Haddock.The movie opens at a market where Tintin (Jamie Bell, winner of BAFTA award for Best Actor for Billy Elliot) stumbles upon and purchases a model of The Unicorn that subsequently gets stolen from his apartment. Thereupon begin the adventures (and misadventures) of Tintin and his adorable and sharp-as-a-tack companion Snowy, as they set upon investigating the cause of the robbery.It is a gripping journey of a treasure hunt that begins in Brussels and swiftly traverses the waters of the Atlantic, taking us to the enchanting Kingdom of Morocco.Andy Serkis (Gollum of The Lord of the Rings), who doubles as the drunken but proud Capt. Haddock and his courageous grandfather Sir Francis Haddock intoxicates us with both roles as he unveils the mysteries of The Unicorn.Daniel Craig is remarkable as Sakharine and his ascendant, the rapacious pirate Red Rackham.Inspectors Thompson & Thomson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) bring some chuckles with their outrageous stupidity!Weta Digital has presented brilliant visual effects authenticated by veteran John Williams' composition (elevated to a high by the magical utterance of the Blistering Barnacles & Ten Thousand Thundering Typhoons!) (There are many instances where you just want to grab hold of & hug the characters hanging in the air!)The stunts are incredibly grand and exciting.The Secret of the Unicorn showcases the collective genius of the best names in the industry, making it an imperative choice not just for Tintin fans', but for anyone who is looking for gratifying entertainment.It is simply wonderful to see a spectacular adaptation of one of Georges Prosper Remi's favorite Classics!A must-watch, to be precise, a must-watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Further Evidence That Spielberg Has Lost Interest,"I tend to have a fairly good method for judging whether or not I think a film is worthy of praise or guilty of some cinematic flaw. I base my method on whether or not I'd watch it again. Films I love, I can watch more than once, sometimes many times. In the case of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, I won't be watching it again.Not that this is necessarily a bad film. The voice-acting is of a decent standard (the strangely under-employed Serkis predictably stealing the show); the animation is technically advanced and at points breath-taking. The story is a hybrid of two or three Tintin books and there are a variety of nods, winks and tips of the hat in the direction of hardcore fans, which I suspect hardcore fans will either love or hate.But there are underlying problems here which seem to be the trademark of modern Spielberg efforts. Long gone are the days of ET and Close Encounters. The shine is gone from Spielberg's talent and while the remaining vestiges of, admittedly, higher than average ability continue to glimmer from time to time, there's a veneer of tarnished weariness about this once epic director. You can't help wondering if Spielberg has lost his love for movie-making and is, at this point in his life, merely going through the motions.Less subtle are the glaring problems with this movie, beginning with what must be one of the longest and most irritating opening credit sequences I've ever had the misfortune to sit through.The animated characters are at best unendearing, at worst outright creepy. From Haddock's piggy little eyes to the oddly life-like yet simultaneously corpse-ish features of the peripheral characters, something clearly went wrong at the effects stage. I'm reminded of the failed attempt to inject realism into the cast of The Polar Express, resulting in a variety of horrible computer generated manikins somewhat akin to, but not quite precisely like Tom Hanks if Tom Hanks were to be returned from the dead without his soul.The heir apparent to Red Rackham is the most disconcerting in terms of inhuman humanisation, being the least cartoonish of the animated cast his obviously unreal features are the most wrenching. His face is beautifully modelled, but only in the same way that a waxwork is beautifully modelled. His expressions never quite come to fruition and it's often hard to tell where his eyes are pointing, giving the impression that this might not be an animation at all but live action featuring bored actors in masks.Where the animation succeeds in boiling over to nuclear proportions is in the action sequences, from the breath-stealing view of a Moroccan coastal town to the eye-popping gorgeousness of The Unicorn surging through mountainous waves. The battle between Red Rackham's ship and The Unicorn, while ludicrously over-dramatic, will satisfy even the most demanding eye-candy addict.Unfortunately the emphasis in Tintin was always on exposition, soliloquy, thoughtful puzzle solving and unlikely gun fights in which nobody gets hurt or bleeds. This all lent itself uncommonly well to Herge's comic book format; neat and precise as the lines of the figures he drew and the frames within which their adventures unfolded. But on the big screen it makes for a long-winded and awkward experience. And rather than embellish the moments of calm, the sudden and explosive action sequences work only to throw the intelligent aspects into stark relief.I wanted to love this movie. But I've suspected for a while now that Spielberg is in some kind of artistic decline and did not, for this very reason, raise my hopes particularly high. So I didn't love it, though it was somewhat entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Steven Spielberg takes you on a wonderful thrill ride for the whole family in a wonderfully entertaining family film!,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a wonderful entry in the Indiana Jones franchise and was wrongfully hated on by fans of the series, with the Adventures of Tintin there was a much stronger fan base that were anticipating great things from the Master of Film and so was I despite the fact I have never read the comics they have been quickly glanced at by me but nothing more than that anyway the trailers griped me and I got really excited having know that the Master of Film was back directing again after another 3 year absence which is common for him at the moment, anyway did the film meet my expectations or did they sink down faster than Haddock's ship?, well I was wonderfully entertained thrilled jaw dropped and just wonderfully relieved although I was not worried about the film at all I knew it would be wonderfully entertaining I was relieved that Steven Spielberg's directing abilities had not declined or slowed down they were the same as always this film has a wonderfully fast pace to the outstanding action sequences and the breathtaking fluidity of the movement of the camera as we're flying around with Tintin and Haddock as the camera literally is flying around the screen like a balletic movement or performance is simply outstanding film making of the highest standard and Steven Spielberg must be commended for that. Martin Scorsese does not make movies like Steven Spielberg! Martin Scorsese makes the same type of movies over and over again with no versatility or change of style it's boring the only film of his I will ever watch again anyway is Hugo that's an outstanding movie really wonderfully cinematic and a stunning tribute to the old days of cinema just an amazing technical achievement and a great example of how films should be made but aren't anymore which is a deep shame, anyway I bring Hugo up in this Tintin review because Tintin shows us the future of motion picture film making with motion capture technology and Hugo takes us to the old fashioned days of motion picture making with images sound and color, Tintin has an outstanding visual language what I am referring to is how the shots look clearer and the characters feel different and look different because of this motion capture technology which enhances humans's emotions and textures, the technology was perfected in the Lord of the Rings film series over a decade ago to great critical acclaim and admiration by the film industry, anyway why do I love Tintin so much apart from the outstanding motion capture technology and the stunning flying balletic movement of the camera? it's because of the story the characters the locations the performances by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and Jamie Bell who I loved in Billy Eliot which I watched recently and adored I love his charming performance in that film really lovely film that one! anyway Snowy's my favourite character in the film he's so lovingly recreated from the drawings I quickly glanced at in the comics an outstanding achievement from WETA Digital the same team who perfected Gollum in the Lord of The Rings and Snowy's emotions are so perfectly recaptured in the film to comic interpretation or at least as I see it!, The Score By John Williams is another masterstroke of film score genius his new themes are perfectly interwoven into the body of the film, it has always interested me that Tintin's theme is not given a full concert arrangement you hear the first few bars of it but that's it it never develops or changes other than the few notes you hear they are always the same notes that you hear every time Tintin is referred too you always hear the same tiny hints of Tintin's theme it's very quick and very sudden like 5 second variants of the same melody or theme there's one melody for Tintin a very quick theme which has always interested me why the main character does not have a fully developed theme in the film and the supporting characters in the film all have fully developed musical identifications Snowy the pirates the villains all have themes outstanding themes all the same which all have concert arrangements I really love Snowy's theme it's really fast like he's running along a garden path or a road that might be one of my favourite themes composed by John Williams it's so perfectly integrated into the character I can't not imagine seeing that character now without hearing his theme that's the outstanding gift of John Williams's music he composes music for the character and so the character becomes ingrained into the musical identity for the film so when we see him on the screen you hear or hum it straight away that's John's gift his skill he is the master of film music and an incredible asset to film scoring! I really love this film because it gives me a wonderful feeling inside of the fact that this is a wonderful family film and an underrated one at that the film was hated and dumped on by the hardcore fans of the comics because they just thought it was another Indiana Jones Film Don't listen to those stupid people they are wrong and stupid and quite pathetic to even suggest that this is just another Indiana Jones film it's not please give this a chance it deserves a chance to be loved and appreciated don't let it go down the same route as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull did when it was forgotten about it does not deserve it, it should not receive such harsh negativity by anybody!",,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Tintin Adventury underrated by the Oscars,"'The Adventures of Tintin' is just the most stylish and visually stunning animation of 2011 – a beautiful effort and unique creation from director Steven Spielberg. It is a pity, however, that it didn't receive a nomination for Best Animated Feature because this film is far away better than the other animations that were nominated.The scenarios were so creatively made – the backgrounds - that sometimes I thought that they were real scenes, not animated and like 'The Polar Express', this film captured real human movements to built the characters on the movie making them appear much more natural and their faces much more expressive.The movie is based on three Tintin stories and for those who have already read them may notice some strangeness. Some radical changes were made – especially in the villain's character – and the situations presented in the tree stories were all mixed to make only one story that could fit in the film's necessities. That is the only thing I have to complain about – and I am not saying that the plot was bad, but just different from the original.Overall, a good film that deserves high remarks on its visual production. Although it is an animation, it is a much more an adult film. There are some gun shots and deaths – nothing shocking, obviously – but uncommon in traditional animations aimed for kids. Also, the vast majority of the audience that was watching this film was adults – actually, I didn't see any kid watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Genuine warm feelings.,"In general, the production of ""Tintin"" alludes to one simple truth: Be in love the fact that he takes over. If you can not - do not pull at all. After these excellent titles appear character. Then, second, third, and others. And together with them in the viewer's head slips inevitable thought that he watches the story where it extends everywhere terribly pleasant, warm feeling of reverent attitude. Spielberg and Jackson seemed to hold in his hands a miniature teddy Tintin, and say, ""my darling you, you are very dear to me, and I will remove your story worthy material."" Absolutely healthy sentimentalism outstanding people.Knowing, like any other spectator, Spielberg never imagined that he could be such a virtuoso. Prohibitive ease, despite the tremendous excess of saturation of the plot, and attention to all of its many parts in any of the episodes. As soon as the protagonist goes further and further into his investigation, Spielberg gradually more and more pressure on the gas pedal. One hundred and seven minutes to rapidly and consistently growing material, which completely faithful to the original source. Active adaptation to the original concept of the comic book is included in the first minutes, without showing any mercy to the audience confidently shooting his own power head.Without even the slightest hint at a weak point. Uniform attention to all stages of production shows itself in all its glory, when the taste and color work appears in every way as devoid of attacks, as well as differences. No one pulls the blanket over himself.Andy Serkis is high time to give that a Oscar, for such an outstanding job on their heroes in the mo-cap. Need more detail feel the subtleties of this technology in order to understand the extent to which the operator is masterpiece Janusz Kaminski as full a picture happy chaos, perhaps, even a child will notice. It's hard not to pay attention to scenes that are removed by a single plan, despite the fact that in one scene the hero of more than ten times the change in location of the local scale, and, incidentally, is not he alone. In other words, each more than five hundred times catch the question, ""well, that my friend, do not ever figure out how we managed to remove it?"" This is primarily Spielberg stormed the adult audience. The all-new level of animation, which is achieved by getting rid of the known problems of motion capture technology of the past. A release is going brilliantly and simply, Spielberg holds the highest bar for directing a massive amount of detail frame. It should be noted that in the past that no one has yet succeeded.Not for nothing is actively publicized the names of the writers that are very well managed approach to adapting the source material. Originality extends to absolutely everything, every time changing its color, presented in the form of humor, in the form of interior parts, or separate dramatic characters, and so on. Perhaps somewhat lost because of his age cult composer John Williams. He manages to keep the bar full, but no more. If earlier it was possible to look over the projects he has worked to close my eyes and still feel full majesty only with your ears, here we can hardly see a similar picture. As a small minus someone may also take into account the lack of female characters, unless you count the fleeting appearance of a opera singer.""The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn"" will amaze children of its history, and adults - an approach to it.

The Adventures of Tintin,"Strangely enough, this film is almost 2 months earlier here in Europe than its North American premier near the Christmas time(I watched it at 29th Oct with friends here), particularly this is a mammoth-budgeted blockbuster animation and not until I had finished it in the IMAX cinema, I become forthrightly certain that the sturdy word-of-mouth will allure even a larger audience into the theater during the Yuletide season and its US territory will be effortlessly seized like here in Europe.In fact, Tintin is just one of the two enthusiastically-hyped films from director Spielberg this year, WAR HORSE (still under its veil) will rush into the Christmas field as well with some more potential Oscar buzz. Now it's rather too early to predict which one is better, but aiming different spectators, I optimistically expect it will be a win-win situation, and basely according to my enraptured experience with Tintin, Spielberg is back at his top form after the universally- disappointing INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL in 2008.From the technique angle, this cutting edge performance-capture animation has surpassed any precedents which endeavor to blur the boundary between animated feature and real-person features. After the tepid responses from a clumsy pioneer FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRIT WITHIN (2001), Robert Zemeckis' misfired THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004) and BEOWULF (2007), Tintin is truly an innovative triumph, all the subtlety and details are represented immaculately with accuracy and verisimilitude. Thanks to this state-of-the-art cutting-edge advancement, seamlessly matches with the Indiana Jones-que adventure structure, being a non-fan of the original cartoon books, I was stupefied to witness the smoothly fabricated world, everything is miraculously tangible (my favorite part is with Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent eagle- chasing bravura) and the narrative doesn't lose its fuel until the very end, which leaves its audience no time for any distraction (as a matter of fact, it is indeed the story of Captain Haddock, Tintin is demoted as a sidekick during the latter part).We all know film is a world of imagination and somehow this film is foreboding that here comes the arch enemy of actors, high-tech could be the kryptonite of this glamorous yet sumptuous occupation, which had been proposed before when the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY first came into being! By the way, I cannot figure out Daniel Craig and Andy Sekis' voices in the film, I was pretty sure Craig could not be the villain, and it turned out to be my mistake!This is no question this is one of the best animation in this century, if the academy acknowledge its admission (accidentally news came out today Tintin is officially on the shortlist of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE category of next years' Oscar race), it will without any doubt be the definite front-runner!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
not satisfied,"If technology and money can make good movie this should have been a good movie. But unfortunately it is not to be. a person who is seeing TINTIN for the first time can enjoy this. the effects are good and the 3-D is not too much distracting. For a generation of fans who were living on a daily diet of TINTIN's adventures the characters in this movie may seem hollow like the wooden Pinochio. Also Captain Haddock is so pitiable ,not like the fiery self in the comics.The element of violence in the movie shows that the director doesn't understand the philosophy of comics like TINTIN or Asterix or animations of Hayao Miyazaki where characters are not divided into good and bad , they are simply human beings with all the failings .",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

The almost perfect adaptation of Tintin,"Puritans will see flaws and see no need to combine the stories of 3 comics. But a book by book adaptation of the original comics would just be boring to people unfamiliar with Tintin. So fanboys aside, this is the must-see picture of the year. Action packed, funny and like a roller-coaster ride that ends too soon. As always Andy Serkis steals the show. Man this actor should be honored for his entire body of work that only seems to get better. Who doesn't remember Gollum from the LOTR (in all the parodies, homages etc. his precious is never overlooked), the very believable chimp Ceasar from Rise of the planets of the Apes, which many of my friends and family thought was a trained ape and now the absolutely stunning show-stopping performance as Captain Haddock.

Spielberg Does It Again!,"When I was a teenager, my favourite comic books were ""Asterix"" and ""The Adventures of Tintin"" by Herge. You can guess my excitement and anticipation when I learnt that titans Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were collaborating to bring Tintin to life on the big screen. However, when I saw the trailers for ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn"", I was a bit apprehensive.Will they capture the spirit of discovery and adventure of the young Belgian reporter? Can they flesh out the many wonderful characters of the comic books? The trailers weren't that impressive. Well, just after 10 minutes into the media screening last Friday, my fears were dashed - and I was transported back to my childhood again! The movie contains elements from three of Tintin's adventures: ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" (published in 1945), with some parts of ""The Crab With the Golden Claws"" (1943), and a bit from ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" (also 1945). It opens with Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) buying a model of an old ship called the Unicorn at an outdoor market in an unnamed European city. As soon as he pays for it, two other guys come along to try and buy the ship too! They are a sinister-looking Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and an American named Barnaby (Joe Starr).Expectedly, Tintin refuses to sell, and he soon discovers that the model ship contains vital clues to hidden treasure involving a Capt. Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis). The ensuing adventure takes Tintin, Haddock and the boy's faithful dog Snowy over the seas to the Sahara and a fictional Moroccan city of Bagghar in search of hidden treasure.For me, the most important part of the movie is its richly detailed retro charm that coloured Herge's comic strips of the early 20th Century (especially the pre-war years). Tintin and Snowy are rendered in the performance-capture shots exactly as they were in the comics and the ageless boy reporter seems to be a tad more mischievous than his comic book persona. Serkis' alcohol-loving Haddock looks so realistic that we mistake him for a live character.Enhanced by 3D, CGI animation affords all sorts of 'impossible' action and stunts and Spielberg exploits this to the full with almost non-stop chases and spectacles. Tintin's chase of a thieving bird through the streets and rooftops of Bagghar is one of the most exhilarating chases I have come across in the cinema. Herge's brand of humour is reflected in the comic relief provided by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as Interpol officers Thomson and Thompson, respectively. The gags are all very PG-type comic relief, and not hilariously funny.Some Herge purists may argue that the movie lacks resonance and an emotional connection to its protagonist. That may be true but personally, I don't remember having much emotional connection to Tintin when I read the comic books. He was a young hero with whom I identified, that's all. Also, watch out for Spielberg's tribute to Herge in the opening scene at the open market. The legendary Belgian author is shown as a street artist who does a sketch of Tintin, looking like one of the original strips. Good for you, Spielberg.

A must see for the entire family !!!!,"Ooooohhhh, what a movie, what an adventure, what a.... I can't... I'm lost for words !! How to describe the experience that is Tintin?? Even the opening credits will have you locked at the screen and it holds you there until the ending.So we have Tintin, a young reporter, that comes across a model of an old ship: The Unicorn. And so the adventure begins. There are a lot of action scenes that are really fast paced, but just when you think: It's getting too much, they slow down and you can rest for a while.If you've read the comic books, it helps of course as you remember a lot of things of your childhood. I advise everyone of you to read these comics and go see the movie, you won't regret. Best 10$ I've spend in ages.Major props to Andy Serkis, who plays Captain Haddock perfectly. Jamie Bell as Tintin is also very good, but I'd have to give it to Steven and Peter for creating this epic, and hopefully successful franchise.PS.: Try to avoid the 3D version... I didn't have any choice and although it was the best 3D experience yet, I still don't like the format. Stupid glasses and you get tired after 45 minutes...Best regards, Raf",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Closes the gap between movie and 'you might as well be there',"For those who read Infinite Jest, the future seems (as Einstein also said) coming to us sooner than we think: with this installment the gap between real and animation has yet again been made smaller. But this movie is not only great in CGI. After all, the core will always remain the story, and atmosphere and this has also been handled with the greatest care. I was familiar with this best story of Tin Tin since the 70s and I never thought I would see it come alive so much as in this masterpiece. It is indeed a cross between Indiana Jones and the cartoon atmosphere of the Herge original; a nice treasure hunt in a romantic setting (detective film noir like city scenes, desert scenes in Marocco, airplaines, pirates, chasing scenes, humor, emotion, it is all there). It watched it in 3D and I must say this is the future too - it all comes so much more to life in comparison to 2D. This is simply a must to see 3D in theatres - go while you can!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing for one reason!,"Since seeing the movie, there has been one thing that has continually nagged at me about Spielberg's treatment of Tintin. I have loved Tintin books for around 40 years so you have to bear in mind this is written from a long loved Tintin Fan's perspective. Interestingly, I have also long loved Spielberg's movies with one of my favourites being his first, the haunting masterpiece, Duel. So what did Spielberg get so wrong with the movie? To answer this you have look at what is the book series appeal. It is 3 things. The story lines/scripts, the Ligne claire artwork and the character design. It is the character design that Spielberg fails at for one reason only. In the books, every character, without exception, has a cuteness about them. Every character from the main cast to the most evil villain has a cuteness about their face. Admittedly this cuteness did decrease with the later books(compare Dr Ridgewell from Broken Ear to the same in Picaros)however they were still cute characters. In the movie, it is like Spielberg has gone out of his way to make a lot of the characters ugly and grotesque. The one's that especially come to mind are Haddock and the Thompsons. Compared to their book counterparts they are ugly and command no compassion or empathy especially when in the books their cuteness offsets their character's short comings. Tintin only just escapes the ugly and grotesque label however compared to the book, he is still a lot harsher. This can also be attributed to the dead eyes that Spielberg did not get right. Additionally the storyline and splitting up of story elements was also disappointing but could have been forgiven if the characters had not been destroyed.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The animation is good- in parts very good- but the script is a mess. There's just running around and utterly stupid set pieces. The humour is just poorly done slapstick. I won't go into the plot further as I don't want to give spoilers but its predictable and lightweight.None of the characters are memorable, Tintin is a bore. To be honest the dog is the only likable one in it.The kid I was with thought it was okay but that's all. His parents and I hated it.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A conflation of materials drawn from three of comic book artist Hergé's iconic ""Tintin"" stories.","""The Adventures of Tintin"" rocked! Though it took some license with the original Hergé stories (at least 3: ""The Crab With the Golden Claws,"" ""The Secret of the Unicorn,"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure,"" with liberal references from others tossed in, along with a ""guest appearance"" from the artist himself)from which its material is drawn, it pretty well captures the spirit of them, with a dash of larger-than-life action tossed in for good measure. Lots of larger-than-life, over-the-top action, not unworthy of the original material. Well worth seeing in 3D. The characterizations took some getting used to, with Tintin being the most recognizable, and Captain Haddock arguably the least so, though not in an off-putting way.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surpassing the Uncanny Valley (?),"I saw ""The Adventures of Tintin"" this weekend and was gladly surprised how well this movie works. As a kid I read almost all Tintin Stories and watched the cartoons. I loved the exciting adventures that brought Tintin and his fellows all over the globe.Now this Spielberg directed flick offers a great interpretation of Hergé's comicbook. It's almost like watching an Indiana Jones Movie. And I have to say that ""Tintin"" contains the elements I missed in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". It has great memorable characters (ex. the constantly drunk Haddock), wonderful humour and a stupendous spectacular motorcycle chase through the city of bagghar. I would love to see Spielberg and Peter Jackson collaborating for an Indy Movie...Now what really stood out was the CGI, made by Weta Digital, which is probably the best company in offering computer animated lifelike characters. ""Tintin"" offers, whitout doubt, the best Character CGI since Camerons Avatar. During the first 5 minutes of the film my jaw almost dropped when I saw how detailed and realistic the characters appeared on screen. You can see every single hair on Tintin's forehead moving in the wind. The eyes don't seem dead (which is a major problem in character animation), they seem very realistic. Some scenes are animated so well, that they almost look like live action footage.""Tintin"" is a fantastic movie, the story is very simple, but it has wit, spectacular action and top notch CGI which is expected to win an Oscar (something would be wrong if it wouldn't).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great Visuals Make the Film,"Adventures of Tintin, The (2011)*** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's first animation movie is also his first in 3-D. Based on the popular comic character, reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) and the drunken Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) try to discover the three missing pieces that will lead them to a treasure. I must admit that I wasn't aware of the comic, the characters or anything dealing with the subject until I realized that Spielberg's name was attached so obviously I'm not the main target that this movie was going for. Obviously many, many people love this character even if the film didn't go over too well here in America. Considering I wasn't familiar with the subject I left the theater rather amused at how much of a good time I had. I will say that I wasn't overly impressed with the 3-D effects and I had wished that I had gone for the regular version and saved a few bucks. I will also admit that I didn't care too much for the story but it certainly wasn't bad enough to keep me from enjoying the film. What I enjoyed most about the movie is the non-stop action and downright amazing visuals. Many people have compared the film to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC, which I think is fair but what this movie does is go all out and deliver the type of action and stunts that not even Indiana Jones could pull off. It seems that our two heroes get into every type of trouble imaginable from a ship battle, to being in the sea alone on a small boat to the most amazing scene, which has them on a small plane flying through a deadly storm. I'd be willing to say that this scene alone was worth the price of admission and the level of entertainment here is so strong that what follows almost feels like a letdown. I thought the two actors did a fine job in their roles as did Daniel Craig in his part. Again, I didn't get totally caught up in the story but this might be due to me not being familiar with the work. Still, the terrific direction by Spielberg and the amazing beauty of the visuals make this one worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Animation
A  superb thrill ride worthy of the comic book,"OK, so here it is at last. Spielberg and Tintin united! How much better can it get? Being 21, I was introduced to Tintin by my father as a child, like any french-speaking kid in this world ought to be. I've loved Tintin for as long as I remember, and got pretty excited when I learned Spielberg and Jackson were behind this pearl of a movie. The question is now: does it live up to the expectations of millions? Absolutely! The Adventures of Tintin begins with a charming nod to Hergé, and quickly builds up speed. As the story unfolds, you will meet a cast of classic Tintin characters like the Dupond/ts, Captain Haddock, the Castafiore, Alan, and so on so forth. They all are very true to the comic, while also feeling uniquely human. Haddock is a highlight. The gruffy captain is never quite doing anything right, which is exactly why you'll like him. Snowy must be the most enticing dog ever caught on film (as to say) and I do believe he will be a standout for most viewers. After 2 hours, the story has this great open ending (when you know what will come next!) and you will swear you were not seated for more than 30 minutes.While the some may be putt off by the photo-realistic animation (The abhorred uncanny valley) I was absolutely delighted by the look and feel of the characters and set pieces. They all look so very real, and at the same time so very cartoony, I couldn't ask for more. The action sequence are as grand as Spielberg and Jackson can be (The morocco chase and the Pirate battle are instant classics) and John Williams delivers as usual (although there is no definitive theme that will be remembered as ""That Tintin Song"").All in all, I was delighted by this movie, and so were my friends.

"A old-school action adventure in the vein of his earlier Indiana Jones movies, Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin' mixes action, humour and mystery into one thoroughly enjoyable ride","Following the somewhat disappointing 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', Steven Spielberg makes a rip-roaring comeback to action adventure territory with his 3D motion-capture adaptation of the legendary comic book series by Belgian artist Herge. The platform couldn't be more befitting- after all, Herge had thought Spielberg to be the only director capable of filming Tintin before his death in 1983. What however took Spielberg so long to realise his vision may not be immediately apparent, but once you see the jaw-dropping action on display, you'll realise that the wait was worth the while.The first in a planned trilogy, the British screen writing trio of Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish have drawn largely from the comic 'The Secret of the Unicorn'- with bits from 'The Crab with the Golden Claws' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' weaved in- to fashion an old-school romp that sees Tintin (Jamie Bell) setting off around the world to uncover some ancient treasure, while staying ahead of his Russian rival Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Except for some 17th century intrigue that explains the origin of the treasure, the straight-forward storytelling saves Spielberg from navigating potential narrative complexities to focus instead on the visual spectacle.And what a spectacle it is, starting from the lovingly rendered photorealistic landscape of what may be 1930s Paris. The re-creation of this olden-day Paris is amazingly detailed- of cobbled streets, outdoor flea markets, men wearing bowler hats, well-coiffed ladies, and even the occasional pickpocket. Spielberg draws from old-school cinema's romanticisms of Paris, and thanks to modern-day CG wizardry from Peter Jackson's Weta Digital, the result is nothing less than an absolute gorgeous feast for the eyes. Younger auds may not appreciate these details, but those who grew up with the comic and the animated series will certainly relish the painstaking effort that has gone into each vivid frame.Our advice is to enjoy these minutiae while you can, because once the whiz-bang action starts, you probably won't have the mental capacity to notice them. Unleashing his inner-child taste for adventure, Spielberg conjures up some of the most thrilling action sequences you'll see this year. The first major setpiece takes place against Tintin's daring escape from a steamer after being abducted by Sakharine. Together with a Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis), whose ancestry can be traced back to the ancient fortune, Tintin pilots a seaplane right into an electric storm- and you can guess how exhilarating it gets when the Captain climbs out of the plane midflight to top up the tank located on the nose of the plane with his own whisky-infused breath.But probably nothing can prepare you for the next elaborate sequence set in Morocco where the last and final clue to locate the treasure is hidden. In pursuit of the nefarious Sekharine, Tintin sets off on a bike chase through the narrow streets, with water with a broken dam gushing down the alleys and passageways. Most awe-inspiring is how Spielberg films the entire ten-minute sequence in just one single shot (the logistics of this alone worth checking out the extras once the DVD is released), and the relentless pace at which this unfolds will keep you on the edge of your seat to say the least. If the climactic sequence between two dock cranes controlled by Haddock and Sakharine comes off slightly less exciting, it is only because topping the earlier breathtaking setpiece would likely be quite an insurmountable feat, but not for a lack of the same visual bravado- the beautifully composed shots weaving in and out and between the cranes just as awesome.These shots are testament to Spielberg's prowess as a visual storyteller, and besides the splendid action, other quieter moments also stand out- in particular, a scene where Haddock while walking through the scorching desert relays his family history that unfolds with a galleon emerging and disappearing from the sand dunes as if sailing up and down the crashing waves of the sea. It's hard to imagine how Spielberg would have been able to accomplish this live-action, and it becomes immediately clear why he had chosen to film this mo-cap style- despite the criticisms that have accompanied the format.In the hands of such a great filmmaker however, the technology liberates rather than constraints- and thanks to the impressive work by the folks at Weta, gone too are the dead-eyes problem that plagued earlier efforts like 'The Polar Express' and 'A Christmas Carol'. Spielberg also gets a leg-up from the great character work of Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig and especially Andy Serkis- quite probably the king of performance-capture work following 'Lord of the Rings', 'King Kong' and this summer's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. There is no doubt this is the best mo-cap work ever done, and a definitive giant leap forward for the medium.Certainly, technology alone doesn't make a great film, but Spielberg has employed it in service of a rollicking old-school Indiana Jones-type action adventure with pulse-pounding action, some generous sprinkling of wit and humour (courtesy of the bumbling detective duo Thompson and Thompson played by hit comedian pair Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and not forgetting a glorious score by John Williams that evokes both noir- mystery and a grand sense of adventure at the right moments. Indeed, Herge didn't get it wrong when he thought Spielberg capable of bringing the sleuthing boy reporter to the big screen- and with a stylish Saul Bass-type animated credit sequence and a nod to the original comic strip of Tintin right at the very beginning, Spielberg undoubtedly has his heart in the right place.",,Anonymous,Animation

Cartoon or Actors please not computer generated silicone human replicas,"This level or Motion programming with hyper-cgi realism I see no purpose beyond animals. This is a video game not an ""animated"" film.It's dizzying because you want the colors etc... and then you have characters like Thompson and Tomson and the freaky real/not real.Within the context of Marvel, Planet of the apes, and Lord Of The Rings, with fantasy creatures and alien realism... e.g. Marvel does a fairly decent non creepy job with The Hulk and Thanos. The integration process is pulled off significantly better than ever could have been imagined without ""Stop Motion"" animation.However I am seeing a movie that's fully animated and dealing with humans.... Trying very hard to make it look as realistic as possible while also creating a new level of ""Animation"" as an adult it was a nightmarish result...Film it with live actors though some of the scenes would not work from a ""comedic"" perspective, and if it was animated like ""The Incredibles"" or ""despicable me"" the PG-13 tone would have to be eliminated that animation can attain adult ratings based on raunchy comedy....not on violence.The way Laika productions have been coming out visually, or if one thinks of Corpse Bride or Frankenweenie...a mix of of some CGI with stop motion would have probably made more sense. But the experience was like a VR computer game. For example it's obvious that despite the heavy detail the ground, the water background etc is animated digitally. So it's desperately trying to look like a Laika Stage but it simply doesn't work.It misses the target audience of 12-21?

The right balance between faithfulness to Hergé and the format of a movie,"I saw Tintin tonight, being very skeptical as someone for whom the Tintin comic strips have been a significant part of my childhood readings. Well, after spending 10 years not going back to the originals, that movie struck me as a faithful yet entertaining take on Hergé's legacy. Kudos to Steven Spielberg for remaining faithful to the original aesthetics and yet succeeding at shining at what he does best: making entertaining rememberable movies. Some Europeans (and especially Belgians) might criticise the process of Hollywood ""stealing"" European culture, but, as an European (and Belgian) who grew up in Hergé's work, I can only disagree and admire this impressive and entertaining, yet faithful adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Tim Jones,"It's a Spielberg movie. It's got Spielberg music and Spielberg sensitivities. It honestly reminded me of a young Indiana Jones movie. Fantastic animation, good voice acting and a nice pace to it. I'm honestly surprised why they didn't make another one of these cause it's ripe for a franchise. Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Everyone has a dream of going back to the childhood, this movie makes it happen.","You don't have to be a die-hard freaky fan of Tintin like me to keep this movie in your wish list. Though, it does help :). So after years of waiting, I finally get to see it before it's release in India. SS & PJ take you on a roller-coaster ride that makes you want for more. First of all, kudos to the duo in selecting the best story to start the Adventure of Tintin Series (technically its not the first, been attempted earlier in human cast and in animation, but you haven't missed much if you don't know about it). Among the many master pieces of Herge, The Secret of the Unicorn + Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls + Prisoners of Inca, The Cigars of the Pharaoh + the Blue Lotus, are actually the best Sequel stories. By making the right choice, the pace of the adventure is well set.In fact, the Tintin theme, with which the movie starts is a well crafted intro which gives the fans of these books a great view of all the well know adventures. Then comes the master stroke, which even Herge would agree has given this movie a brilliant twist. SS & PJ actually mix & mash stories from the Crab with Golden Claws (the book in which Captain Haddock makes his debut) & the Secret of the Unicorn to make a new masala spice. By doing this, they have made sure that the true fans, who otherwise know the story at the back of their palm are also kept engrossed. And then they have added some new story line and sub plots which even Herge had not thought of. So new or old fans, are treated democratically.The comic books till now lacked voice, music & the specific action like the gait & the walk for each character. The duo has managed to score well in all these departments. Thus giving life to ones childhood fantasy. So there's every know element, from Great Snakes to Blistering Barnacles, from the naughty Snowy to the stupid Thom(p)sons, from well mannered Nestor to the ear deafening Bianca Castafiore, from the rogue mate Alan to the guy who taught me the meaning of Kleptomaniac as a kid. But where they win your heart is with the real life feel animation and the brilliant merging of scenes. Look out for the Saharan desert turning into the sea and the Captain's description of the fight with the Pirates. Its like the comic book images being flickered in front of you and you cant stop drooling.By the end of it you would want to live longer just to see the next installment in which Cuthbert Calculus, the absent minded cum hearing impaired professor, makes his debut. But for now go for this adventure armed with your 3D gear with or without popcorn. Ten stars from me.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Brilliant, Charming, Timeless, Witty","Every successful movie needs a singular heroine without flaws, and this has it (as do Spielberg's other teen masterpieces) in Caucasian spades -- especially in the case of South Asia.Steven Spielberg delivers another unborn out-of-wedlock baby yet again, only this time it happens to be a weird red-headed genderless child with a teenage lesbian haircut. Whilst waiting for the relentless picture to end, my partner's response to me was ""He stole your merkin and put on that kid's balding head! And he gave him your culo!"" After looking over myself in the mirror for a few days, I wholeheartedly agreed and concluded that she was right on the money. At least the money I had paid her to conjoin with me at the seedy motel post cinema.Yes, we had a lesbian good time at the midnight show, enjoying the fluent English-speaking pooch, evil eagle, and rollicking with the cast and chain-smoking crew of Cutthroat Island.If we hadn't been kissing and hugging and cavorting so much, I might have missed some critical moments, but as it happened, the movie was too distracting with all the CGI and whatnot.I was shocked that my 3 year old almost-unborn baby had to be witness to all this violence, but then I thought of Sophie's children and understood how it might be that Hollywood Magic could pose a very real traumatic theme for youngsters of any age (much like Nim's Island).I was eternally grateful that the film completely disregarded potentially important socio-cultural-economic issues in favour of petty thievery, Scooby-Doo deep investigative research, hooch swigging ship captains, shrill opera divas and the profitless trade in bootleg bottle art (an unintentional swipe at downloading).And praise god that there were virtually no women in the film (in truth, there were two), although there were a few Ahab-the-Arabs. If real life can't change my gender, at least Steven Spielberg can, temporarily. But I do want my merkin back.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A roller-coaster ride on a theatre seat.,"Spielberg has always been the master of using the locale extensively - a fact subtly demonstrated by the ripples-in-the-water-glass scene in Jurassic Park. In a film by Steven Spielberg, the surroundings are rarely allowed to go wasted; almost everything is put to use in one way or the other, making the movie more vibrant and lifelike - as if the objects in the film have life themselves. Tintin follows this precedent. The Adventures of Tintin too involves the ardoit usage of the environs - may it be the falcon chase sequence or even the battle with the cranes. This trademark move appears succinctly in places, giving it a distinct Spielberg-ian feel and making Tintin another feather in his fedora.Doing justice to the character created by Herge', Tintin (Jamie Bell) remains the bland, ageless adventurer that he originally was. A miniature, antique ship is broken in his apartment. He meets the villain Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig) in a dilapidated bungalow and chances upon another ship of similar make. Tintin's sense of adventure leads him deeper into the mysterious abyss and only when a man is shot at his door do the dangers of the situation dawn upon him. Never being one to shirk from trouble, he delves head-first into the adventure as he, Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and his dog, Snowy, are tossed from the land to the sea to the Sahara, into a farrago of pickpockets, detective lookalikes, an overambitious antagonist, an inebriated captain and Unicorns, all in a quest to find a sunken treasure and resolve vendettas that have returned to haunt from the dead.This beautiful film reiterates why I hold well-made animated films so close to my heart. Animated movies, almost always, are filled with exuberance, joy and life. Rarely do they allow ennui to creep into your heart. With it witty punchlines, affable characters and adrenaline- pounding action-adventure sequences, Tintin the movie brings forth such excitement that is rarely displayed in movies. Through the interplay of bright colours, an overwhelming soundtrack and ebullient demeanour, it takes you to the point of wanting to jump and cheer the protagonist through this arduous journey.Tintin precisely captures what an adventure means. Similar to the Indiana Jones movies, it doesn't tax your grey-cells by keeping the plot very basic instead. But the hardships the protagonists have to undergo to accomplish that goal keep the movie ticking, and make it so appealing. Tintin gets chased by a vicious dog, chases a falcon, flies an airplane, gets shot at - but keeps trudging along. By not delving into various intricacies in an attempt to superficially deepen the plot, the movie keeps the real Tintin alive - light-hearted, simple and pure fun - and it has been a while since we saw such films.The target audience of the film isn't entirely clear, because it works well for everyone. Grey-heads who lived in the Tintin comic-book age will pounce upon the opportunity to revel in the nostalgia, while children, who have no idea of who Tintin is whatsoever, will also be equally delighted by the introduction they are provided with him. Very rare movies are able to accomplish the extraordinary feat of holding a natural appeal to people of all ages, so Tintin does score points here.All the characters have been portrayed in a remarkable manner. Add to this the fact that they have been created by some of the most lifelike animation I have seen in recent years. Tintin is spot on; sharp as a whip, brave in the face of danger and persistent. The innocuous detective twins, Thomson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), are classic comic characters; they unwittingly get involved into things of gigantic proportions without having a clue of what's happening. They are naive to the point of being nincompoops and the acts they commit under the impression of mistakes accounts for plenty of smiles, if not outright laughter. Sakharine is the perfect Tintin nemesis - evil, for difficult to despise - just as the villains of children's' movies are meant to be. Captain Haddock, however, steals the spotlight. This Captain and his alcohol-addled brain make a bold impression, one stronger than Tintin himself, bringing back memories of the original character. A Haddock always remains a Haddock, even if he is brought back to life after years of virtual non-existence.Mr. Spielberg does nothing wrong in the film, yet it doesn't come across as extremely strong. This is the kind of film that you can watch hundreds of times for the very reason because of which it loses out, though slightly - the lack of complexities. It is too simple - a hunt for a treasure being the oldest trick in the book. However, Tintin isn't James Bond. He was always meant to be the soft-spoken, almost effiministic ideator, and that is how the world likes him.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a shame.,"As a big fan of the books I was excited about the film especially with such big canons like Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg involved.

One of the Best 3D Movie in the Market,"First of all, the movie's graphic is awesome.I don't study in this field, but seriously, watching it in the cinema in 3D gives me a brand new kind of experience. This 3D experience is quite different compared with other movies in the market - it's better. According to my uncle who works in this field, he said that the graphical quality of this movie is one of the best he has ever seen in his life! Besides that, the fast- paced story line and the actions also give you a kind of excitement throughout the 1 hour 48 minutes movie. Even though the story line is pretty normal for an adventure film, but the way Steven Spielburg tells the story is awesome - the flow is smooth and you never get bored at any point in the movie. What's more, Steven Spielburg has added some suspense element into the movie too - it blends in very well and makes the whole movie much more exciting. Oh, there are some humor elements in the movie too - which makes the film much more interesting and I did have quite some laughs in the cinema while watching it.The opening credit of the movie is awesome too. I purposely write it in another paragraph because the way it's done is really impressive. During the credits, we can actually see a summary (in video, not words) of the whole story being told there. However, this summary doesn't contain any spoiler in it, but it does imply how ordinary the plot will be as a typical adventure film.The only flaw in the movie is probably the ending part - it kinda ends out of sudden and makes me feel a little bit empty there, because I was expecting something else to happen there. However, from the way it's shown, it's possible that there'll be a sequel to this movie. And I'm really looking forward to it.In short, a movie definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A madcap swashbuckling adventure,"First off, I must say what a pleasure it must been for me personally to see this fantastic film ahead of the United States. Usually the traffic is one way from that direction to the rest of the world.But enough of that.What an adventure! As someone who grew up reading the world of Tintin, I must admit I had serious concerns how anyone can pull this off without alienating the fan-base. How wrong I was! In the capable hands of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, this dynamic duo has managed, against all odds, to bring the spirit, character and that ""X"" factor of Tintin from print to screen so seamlessly.And the 3D, my word, the technology is brilliant. Forget the fear of leaving the cinema with a headache because the visuals were crisp and out of this world. At times, you'll really believe you are watching a real person rather than an imaginary one. The script was well written so it does not matter if you do not follow the series or know the characters because as the film progresses, you will slowly learn of them.Finally, the success or failure of any animation depends on the voices behind the various characters. Amongst this talent pool of voices, the absolute standout performance for me must be Daniel Craig. He delivered the correct level of charm and menace in his vocal delivery as the chief villain. It was as if he studied all the villains from the Bond archive and reproduced it here. An excellent performance indeed.So I am awarding this film full marks.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thank you Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson,"It was totally amazing how Spielberg and Jackson handled this movie. I've been a huge fan of Tintin for 40 years and I think they were completely faithful to Georges Remi and all of Tintin's fans.This was a difficult nut to crack - there are millions of Tintin fans, each with their own concept of how this movie should have been made. I think they developed the characters and plot for both existing fans as well as new ones. Had they just followed the storyline of the books, it would have been too predictable for people like me who have read them over and over.I have been looking forward to this movie for three years (as soon as I heard that Spielberg and Jackson were handling it, my already-high expectations tripled.)Thank you Steven and Peter for another thoroughly entertaining movie that is (hopefully) going to turn into a popular syndicate of many more to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Snakes!  This Tintin Adventure was Awesome!,"Ever since I was a kid, I had been aware of this series of adventure- type cartoon books featuring this pale young boy with his short red hair flipped up in front named Tintin. But unusually though, unlike many in my generation, I have to confess that I have never read even one of them. When I heard that Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson had teamed up to create an animated version of Tintin, I knew this was the perfect time for me (and my family) to finally get to know this famous guy.The story follows intrepid young reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) when a model ship he bought for a pound from a street seller was being relentlessly pursued by a mysterious man named Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Along the way, Tintin crosses paths with the alcoholic Captain Haddock (the versatile Andy Serkis) who was apparently the heir of a huge fortune of gold lost at sea, the very fortune also being sought by Sakharine. This race for the treasure leads Tintin and the Captain in an unexpected adventure of the highest order that spans land, sea and air! This action-packed contest of wills was also laced with most biting and slyly funny Continental humor, mostly care of the bumbling Inspectors Thomson and Thompson.This was simply one of the most visually stunning movies I have EVER seen. The colorful and entertaining title sequence itself already draws you in. The motion capture animation is stepped up 100% from past incarnations as ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol."" This movie is beautiful and exciting at the same time, with just the right hint of nostalgia. The artwork is flawless. The colors were vibrant. The action sequences were exhilarating. The realism of this animated film (Spielberg's first as director) was astounding. You will be impressed by the scenes showing Snowy (Tintin's cute dog), sunsets, the ocean, galleon ships, the airplane, the desert, the falcon, the shattering glass, the battling cranes, all rendered with palpable texture. And we only watched in 2D! Definitely a must-watch for the big screen! 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Didn't secure even a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars!,"'THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) .Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson produced this modern American adaptation of the popular long-running Belgian comic series (of the same name) by Georges Remi (who used the pen name Herge). The comics were about a young Belgian reporter named Tintin who got into many adventures with his dog Snowy and other companions he met along the way. Spielberg directed this first film in a planned trilogy under the agreement that Jackson will direct the second. He's been a fan of the series since 1981 when his classic action film 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' was compared to it by critics. This 'performance capture 3D film' has been seen by many to be very much like another Indiana Jones film for Spielberg (except in animated form). I'd have to agree; if you're a fan of Tintin or Indiana Jones you're almost sure to enjoy this action adventure.The screenplay was written by Edgar Wright (of 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD', 'HOT FUZZ' and'SCOTT PILGRIM' fame), Steven Moffat and Joe Cornish and based on three comic books from 1941 to 1944 ('The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'). The story revolves around a clue to hidden treasure that Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) unwittingly comes into possession of when he buys a model ship, known as 'the Unicorn', at a market stall. He discovers that many want this clue, especially a man known as Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) who will kill to get a hold of it. Tintin soon finds himself kidnapped (as well as his dog Snowy) by Sakharine and his men and aboard a cargo ship sailing to Morocco. On the boat Tintin teams with it's drunken Captain, Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), and together they try to beat Sakharine to the treasure by escaping and finding the other clues.Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Toby Jones also do nice voice work in the film. The movie is a tad slow-paced at times but for the most part it's pretty action packed. The 3D animation looks spectacular and it's easily the best animated film I've seen all year, which makes it surprising that it didn't secure even a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars (especially when films like 'PUSS IN BOOTS' and 'KUNG FU PANDA 2' did!). It did get an Oscar nomination for Original Score though (by Spielberg's usual partner in crime John Williams) and won Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards. It should be seen as an impressive achievement by just about anyone's standards and deserves much more recognition. Hopefully more new fans will discover it over time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strayed too far from the original,"From a fan of the Tintin comics, this film is mediocre. Herge was an amazing story teller, but this film strayed so far from the original comics that it's not worth the time.Captain Haddock wasn't funny in this movie, which was the element that made the books great. This animated version Haddock was just irritating to watch.Tintin was portrayed so flatly, that I didn't feel any attachment to the character.The entire film felt rushed and pieced together randomly, not fully developing any elements.Please do yourself a favour and go read the original comics.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually amazing, otherwise OK","Being a long-time Tintin fan, I had pretty low expectations when I bought this movie – but of course I had to see it. For the first time ever, motion capture and animation work perfectly – the realism is fantastic, down to the tiniest hair. Sometimes you could swear it is live action on film, though it isn't. The animated Milou (I refuse to call him Snowy, what a silly name!) is the best I've seen in that genre; totally believable.The story is OK, a mix of different Tintin plot lines, nothing to complain about. But the dialogue and the voice casting, oh my! Haddock should have been a much more growling, non-Scottish, powerful character – and he swears ten times as often and fifty times more creatively in the comic albums. The Thompson cops aren't nearly enough stupid sounding (thanks to the very overrated Pegg/Frost duo), Castafiore should have been hitting false notes all over the place, and so on. And why is Tintin ginger? He's as blond as blond can get.But these are minor quibbles. All in all, extremely entertaining – and I'm looking forward to the sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tintin - do not miss this movie!,"Spielberg has outdone himself. This movie brought back memories of 2 awesome franchises from my childhood - Indiana Jones and Tintin comics. The action was riveting, the direction superb, but the winner here is the CG used. While watching the movie sometimes I would zone out and start believing the characters are actual people and not created on a computer.The casting is also excellent. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are especially hilarious.

The action was good, the humor was good natured and it was a very simple and compelling story.The past few mo-cap films I've seen (Beowulf and Polar Express) failed to amaze me, but this film gets it right in all degrees, (Not expecting any less from Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson). The characters looked very realistic, despite their unnatural look and the rest of the film was equally as beautiful.This is definitely something I'm looking forward to purchasing on BluRay and seeing a sequel in 2-3 years!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A true adventure of Tintin...(with us),"OK, I admit it.. I really was not knowing about Tintin, unless heard few times in past, but never read any comics, never seen any cartoons. (I know few might be seeing this as shame... but let it be, I was more on Disney Aladin, Donald, Mickey etc side) So, I was very curious about the story & most importantly I didn't read books for that.About movie now...Good thing is that they direct movie in Animation, so that can give exact look for the Tintin, Sometimes it happens with legendary cartoons/comic heroes that in reality they don't look like what we expect (e.g. Richie Rich) - Being animated + 3D they could actually take few scenes so beautiful like the chase of Tintin & others for the three notes in Baggah(Morocco)OK... Now whats good about this movie:1. Really Good Animation, 3D is fine. 2. Directed by Steven S., ... Story is too good, well pictured & screenplay is almost perfect (hardly for few mins after interval you get bored) 3. I wonder and quite surprised, I thought there won't be much action, but there is(with guns... I thought he is a boy & may not have guns etc.)What's bad: Actually there is really nothing you can take out... I won't say it's a perfect movie, but you really don't get bored.

"Good old fashioned fun, in a new form of technology","An old school action adventure story! Spielberg and Jackson manage to bring this boy hero to life on the big screen with amazing technology and with a great cast! There were some amazing action sequences which were pulled off really well, especially for a motion capture flick! This film has a lot of stand out moments which you would normally expect in a live action adventure film. Also a technical point, the editing was so different and unique. The transition cuts from one shot the the next were genius, they blended in to each other so well and with such style and class. For a person who never heard of Tintin before, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone of any age!

Spielberg at his Best,"I went ahead and saw the midnight premiere last night with a few friends of mine, and I was surprised to see only two other small groups there. The theater was basically empty. I guess I should have expected that however, seeing that this is based off of French comics that never really kicked off in the US.Nevertheless, I must say that this movie is now my 8th favorite movie of all time. The animation was absolutely breathtaking and photo-realistic. The animated reflection and refraction of society through magnifying glasses, bubbles, water, etc... was unbelievable! The story line might not have been brand new, but it was executed superbly. Spielberg was sure to strip the story to its bare frame and then add on his own layers of pure ingenious symbols, motifs, and unique conflicts. Every scene was brilliant. The best scene in the entire movie is a chase sequence towards the end. It is by far the greatest chase sequence I have ever seen in my life. Nothing compares to it at all. Although this was Spielberg's first animated film, animation was no difficult field for him to master. If I don't see a sequel to this movie in a couple of years, I'm going to be one unhappy camper. This movie will win at least an Oscar for best animation this coming year, and it's sure to take you to a whole new world and back. See it in theaters. See it in 3D. Don't regret those 16 dollars lost. And watch it again and again. This movie is what storytelling is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A most faithful adaptation of the Hergé comics,  yet engrossing for all.","This film was a very personal pleasure for me, but familiarity with the source material is not a prerequisite to loving it. Don't be put off by its European pedigree. Tintin's dog Snowy is the perfect partner and companion for our protagonist. He is integral to the plot and rendered wonderfully. As a small child my father read me Tintin books. Later I bought and enjoyed the many adventures myself. Snowy was my favorite character as Hergé would sometimes reveal his thoughts in one-word balloons. The film subtly conveyed this with stylized yet detailed articulation.I saw the 3D version and was especially enthralled by its application in this story. The visual composition and scene to scene transitions were most compelling. I may sound like a shill for the film's producers, but I am only a fan and most sincere in my recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could have been great.,"OK, let's start with the positives: The technical side is rather awesome and it's definitely fast pace action all the way. Also i kinda liked Bianca Castafiores' aria. And that's about it. This is Spielberg and Jackson and not Herge. Jackson managed to do Lord of the Rings without doing too much damage to the original script, but that seems to be completely impossible for Spielberg. What happened to the charm? What happened to the humor? Where is Tournesol, and why for 1000 blundering bazookas (i'm sure the Captain would have said), was it necessary to change a great adventure into a disaster like this. The story works well enough in the beginning where it pretty much follows the original, but then all of a sudden it seems like Spielberg feels compelled to outdo Herge. WHY???? There was nothing wrong with the original. As a matter of fact it worked a whole lot better than this. Shame on you, Steven!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

This may be the most realistic animated movie I've ever seen.,"My mom and I decided to see this movie and I would actually forget I was watching something that was not real. The movie is about a boy named Tintin. He does things for the news as a reporter. One day while him and his dog are out he sees something at an outdoor market. He sees a wooden ship. He decides to buy it. It seems that there are others who want this ship. A couple of people offer him money for it, but he refuses. Throughout the movie he discovers just why the ship is so valuable, while having a fund, intense adventure and meeting a new friend.This was such a cool movie. I didn't get bored at any point. I actually forgot I was in a theater. I felt like I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean. That is how intense I was. Now, don't think it is all action. There are parts that get a bit slower. My mom actually fell asleep during one of these parts. But, it has to be that way to tell you the story. You get to hear an interesting story while at the same time watching it unfold before your eyes. My mom and I saw this in standard, not 3D. But wow, in 3D I think this movie would be absolutely amazing. When the ships are going in the water or a fight scene comes on, it would probably blow your mind. I think the movie had a good mix of action, mystery and adventure. I never really felt like I was getting to much or to little of any of them. At the end, it seems like they left it open for another movie. Which is a great thing because this was one of the coolest movies I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Speechless .. Now that's how you do a CGI ..,"Thanks to Spielberg who could so well carry it with his amazing technique of motion capturing rather action capturing where he moves the camera along with the protagonist on the screen. Beautifully manifested Tintin couldn't have received a warmer welcome to the film industry.I am a big fan of Tintin comics and of course the animated series as well, especially the unrelenting Captain Haddock and who could forget the amazing duos Thompson and Thomson with their clumsy behavior who always managed to giggle me every now and then. Tintin and Snowy however used to be my heroes solving mysteries and defying danger at every step. When I found out that there was going to be a movie and none other than Steven Spielberg was gonna direct it, I was more than elated.A perfect 3D fest right from the inception of the movie till the end, the movie has taken CGI to the next level with Spielberg's classic method of action capturing and boy I must say I was amazed as I kept on pointing how beautiful the effects appeared with every scene. Everything seemed so real, right from their countenances to the environment – the beautiful sea, the vast desert and every tiny detail. The story took us to one hell of a ride with Tintin solving the mystery and connecting the dots for us. Captain Haddock had never been portrayed that brilliantly, keeping in mind every tiny details and facial expressions. Snowy appeared ditto as it used to be in the cartoons and equally cute too.Tintin, superbly portrayed by Jamie Bell, finds a Unicorn ship in the market and buys it only to encounter hell himself in the form of Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who is keen to get the ship for there is something in the ship that interests him. Tintin finds himself in trouble as Sakharine is hell-bent on getting the ship from the hands of the lad. Tintin however smells the foul play and since then takes us on a joy ride connecting the pieces together with the assistance of Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis – A perfect choice for the role ..

Tintin is not and never was Indiana Jones,"""The Adventures of Tintin"" starts out strong and quickly loses story, logic and heart in a plethora of over the top action sequences that feel so incredibly close to Indiana Jones that one might start to think Spielberg wanted to make up for the disastrous ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".That first half an hour of ""Tintin"" stays very close to the comic book and that's when the movie is strongest. The CG animation is absolutely gorgeous and the transition of Hergés drawing to the big screen is a success.But as the movie progresses it gains speed and loses almost everything else. And that's not because Spielberg decided to blend different stories to one adventure. If that's the only thing he'd have done, we'd still be left with plenty of Hergé's brilliant stories and witty dialogue. It's because Spielberg cannot help himself and drowns the movie in big setpiece action sequences which are either ludicrous, or feel like they belong in an Indiana Jones movie. (In one case Spielberg actually uses an action sequence that was scrapped from ""Raiders""). John Williams' score does not help at all, because it too borrows heavily from his own compositions for the Indy movies.Spielberg doesn't stop at that. Haddock's memories of his grandfather and Reckham the Red are presented visually and in full detail. And what Haddock remembers has nothing to do with captains, ships and pirates but instead feels like a copy of the overblown sea battle in the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.All in all ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is too loud, fast and grand. It lost the beauty and cleverness of the comics and feels like it was made for an action-hungry ten year old Transformers fan instead of a fan of the comics.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun-ride you'll love for sure,"The adventures of Tintin brings back the memories of childhood tales we use to hear, read and sometimes watch on television as well. The entire effect is very nostalgic. The characters have been well grafted into the movie - something Steven Spielberg is best at. He takes you to an adventurous trip which somehow tickles your funny bone as well after regular intervals. Tintin and his dog snowy are cute and adorable and you feel like watching them more and more.The other characters which grab your attention are Capt Haddock with is ever growing love for liquor. The Thompsons too get their bit of attention. Right from the beginning the story sets up in an action packed super show and carries itself throughout at a great pace - without giving you a moment to blink your eyes.It's definitely a movie kids would love to watch but the younger generation would also connect to it - given the timeless popularity of character Tintin and his super dog snowy. The 3D effects make the movie even more thrilling and exciting. Go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Captain Haddock : ""Excellent!""","Yeah, I didn't really expect much from this film, just next ""animation showcase"" without genius in it..but wait, there is Steve'o touching it, so maybe it's gonna be Something?.. And yeah, it was Something! Cause of my place of work I had a chance to watch it something about 5 times, and believe me - every time I enjoyed it like a little kid. It is not about great story (which is quite obvious), it is about how they cooked it. And they cooked it perfectly. Must see in the cinema, otherwise you can reduce my rating to 7/10.PS.

This is definitely a unique addition to the animated universe and an absolute must see,"The Adventures of Tintin (2011) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Tintin when he buys a cool model ship that turns out to be far more than a common antique. Almost immediately after acquiring it a mysterious man initially tries to buy it off Tintin, and when that doesn't work, he tries to kill him. Tintin and his dog snowy set off on an adventure to thwart his pursuers and discover the mysteries behind the ship.This movie is directed by icon Steven Spielberg (Jaws) and contains the voices of Jamie Bell (Jumper), Andy Serkis (War of the Planet of the Apes), Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz).The animation for this picture is outstanding and the depiction of the era was cool and fun. The characters are very easy to root, especially Snowy, and the dialogue is smart. The plot has mystery around it and reminded me of Indiana Jones in some way. The action scenes and shootouts were excellent and it would be great if they created a sequel.Overall, this is definitely a unique addition to the animated universe and an absolute must see. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
surprised that it got snubbed by Oscars.,"The Adventures of Tintin: The secret of Unicorn - CATCH IT (A-) Steven Spielberg has directed a very fast phased venture which doesn't take a breath even for a one second the moment it starts. The Adventures of Tintin is highly famous book series around the world & making it in real animation with real actors makes it an enjoyable adventure. Voice overs by Jaime Bell, Andy Serkis & Daniel Craig are superb. the talent cast provides perfect physicality for animation like this. The movie has the perfect touch of Steven Spielberg, which doesn't bore you leaves you excited for next venture. I hope the next installment comes soon.

true to its roots,"as a tintin fan since childhood, i was a bit apprehensive about how the latest attempt to bring tintin on to the big screen would turn out as generally book adaptations rarely manage to satisfy the viewers who have read the book first(harry potter films being the prime example). but thank god tintin turned out to be a big exception. right from the credits the film had me totally hooked. true that the storyline was totally different from the comics but it felt like herge had hidden this story from us for all these years, the movie was that good!!. brilliant direction, script,voice acting, outstanding animation, a whirlwind ride throughout.. the only people i heard who didn't like the film much were the ones who hadn't read the comics...oh well...the readers deserve to have a good time as well!! ;) do yourself a favour and watch tintin esp if you've read and enjoyed the comics...no way can you come out of the movie hall disappointed :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Fun,"I haven't seen a movie for a while because Twilight: Breaking Dawn had sucked the life out of me. Since then, I missed out on what probably were some entertaining films but I was drained and needed a break. Now I'm back in seeing Adventures of Tintin and I was very much entertained.The story in a nutshell is that Tintin (which me and some other people thought that was the name of the dog but surprisingly it was the guy) happens to buy some ship from some dealer. Then for some reason, buying that ship meant he had some people who want to kill him. Interesting, because the dealer didn't seem like he had too many problems. Anyway, so the ship gets stolen and Tintin and his dog Snowy embark on some quest to retrieve the ship and some missing notes. It's all for this treasure, which, to my knowledge, doesn't go further than that. No one is trying to take over the world or anything, just some rich guy who looks suspiciously like Spielberg wanting to get richer.I really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. The color and the lighting that they use is fantastic. The animation is top notch, too. I could even go as far as saying this is the best CG animation I have ever seen. Sometimes I literally thought it was live action. The action scenes are thrilling and they are easily some of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. I also loved the dog, Snowy.A good film always has its shortcomings and I would have to say that the Haddock character who comes midway through the movie really bogs the film down, especially for the last half. He's annoying and just plain odd. The film had a really good tone going but some of his scenes make it feel like a totally different film than what it should be (like him belching into the fuel tank of a plane). Also, he has this weird back story which really doesn't make sense. I don't want to give anything away, but the payoff just didn't seem realistic to me.If you liked Indiana Jones, the Uncharted games, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Goonies, then this film puts them in a blender and spits them out. It really is a great adventure film. I'm looking forward to part 2!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Adventures of TintinBelgian journalists must be the most relaxed members of the world media, since nothing noteworthy ever happens in Belgium.Surprisingly, however, the reporter in this animated-adventure has plenty of article fodder outside of new waffle toppings.When a model ship he picked up at a bazaar becomes the object of the pirate descendant Red Rackham's (Daniel Craig) pursuit, the young scribe, Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his dog Snowy, set off on a journey to prevent Rackham from obtaining the other ships.Along the way, Tintin teams with a drunken sea captain, Haddock (Andy Serkis), whose ancestors first battled Rackham's water-rat relatives over now-sunken treasure.Based on the comic book series by Hergé, this Steven Spielberg helmed motion-capture version not only captures the characters perfectly, but also the rip roarin' adventure synonymous with the brand.Hopefully, it spawns other European comic book film adaptations, like, say, Amsterdam's Red Light District Defenders.

Fantastic!,"This is probably Spielberg's best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and he demonstrates how awesome motion capture animated films can be. He takes to the medium like a fish to water, and the whole thing is just an awesome spectacle. It almost seems like the film is populated with human actors wearing cartoon costumes. Its odd, but not at all offputting. The performances are uniformly good, but once again we have a motion capture performance by Andy Serkis (here playing Captain Haddock) which is just outstanding. Not only the physical acting, but the voice acting, which he also performed, are absolutely wonderful. Jamie Bell plays Tintin. The character's an institution in Europe, but pretty unknown in the United States (thankfully I used to watch the British animated series, which aired on HBO in the early '90s - I vividly remember the subplot about the pickpocket that appears here from that show). Perhaps people will catch up to Tintin and be there more for the two sequels (which will be directed by Peter Jackson, who consulted with Spielberg, who has owned the movie rights since the '80s, on this one).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good movie,"I had no intention of actually watching this movie, i was dragged to it. I had the idea of going to sleep but little did i know that was not going to be the case. There was no way that i could fall asleep during this movie. It kept me intrigued during the whole movie to the point i couldn't blink and i thought i would miss something. This is one of the best 3d movies i have seen this year and maybe by far. Although this is an animated movie i don't feel that it was completely a kids atmosphere or movie. Even though i don't think it is an actual kid movie, they would still enjoy it. Tintin has a really good story line that kept me hooked through the whole movie. I think it is one that everyone should enjoy. I never realized it was based on a book until after i watched it and i understood the whole movie completely fine. This is defiantly a must see for 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A mo-cap mess,"This is a horrible film, but then I knew I'd hate it outright as I'm somebody who actively hates motion capture and who believes that CGI is the worst thing to happen to cinema. The only mo-cap film I didn't mind too much was BEOWULF, but that was more for the story than the execution; unfortunately, THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN takes everything a step backwards.Spielberg has made a film for kids and kids alone. The humour is juvenile, the plot and characters simplistic in the extreme, and the acting is so mannered and manufactured that no adult would take it seriously. Jamie Bell's wooden Tintin is a charmless creation, still saddled with those dead eyes and carved wood expression that mo-cap results in. Still, Andy Serkis spares him the embarrassment of being the worst actor in the thing; I never could work out if Captain Haddock was supposed to be Scottish or Scandinavian, because Serkis is all over the place.The story and characters only vaguely resemble the original comic books by Herge (of which I am a big fan) and most of it boils down to the kind of incessant, entirely routine CGI action that nowadays blights many a Hollywood movie. It's like Jackson's THE HOBBIT: THERE AND BACK AGAIN, with endless chase scenes and swooping camera angles; none of it means anything, there's no realism or danger, it's just bland and safe. It's no surprise that Jackson has his fingerprints all over this and, unfortunately, in Spielberg he's met his match as a purveyor of soulless entertainment. I'd love these guys to go back and make real films without relying on CGI all the while but I fear it will never happen.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

The adventures of our boyhood hero,"To do any justice to Herge's Tintin, its cinematic adaptation would have to be animated. But when you have two legendary film-makers who revel in fantastic adventures, a simple animated version would be quite banal by their standards. Enter Peter Jackson's WETA, which excels in performance capture animation, having created several LOTR characters and the Apes that took over our world recently. For Tintin's loyal fans worldwide (barring the non- existent ones in USA), the film had to create magic and capture the essence of Herge's adroitly written mysteries. Anything less would be blasphemy. With Steven Spielberg at the helm, our young journalist-detective is brought to life on the big screen in an inconceivable form that is both revolutionary and awe-inspiring. The lines between reality and animation have seldom been so blurry. Screenwriters Steven Moffat ('Doctor Who', 'Sherlock'), Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, draw inspiration from 3 of Herge's popular books to create a fun- filled adventure.Upon procuring a model of a ship named 'The Unicorn', Tintin (voiced-Jamie Bell) soon discovers its historic legend of a secret cargo and its fateful end under the captaincy of Sir Francis Haddock. As he advances on his quest, guided by a hidden scroll in the model, Tintin ends up on the Karaboujan, where he encounters Captain Haddock (voiced – Andy Serkis), who is rarely sober and always on the edge. Aboard the ship, Sakharine (voiced -Daniel Craig), who had the other scroll, is in command of his gang that aids him in his pursuit of the Unicorn's secret. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy manage to escape, only to crash land into the Moroccan desert, a little ways from their destination, the port of Bagghar. This is where the final piece of the puzzle rests within the Sheikh's well protected model of the Unicorn. Now, it will take Sakharine's beguiling abilities, the acrobatic, relentless and witty efforts of Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock to retrieve this last clue to The Unicorn's Secret. But there is something more that Sakharine wants out of this quest....The film is based on 3 books of Tintin's adventures: The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden claws. Even though the thrill of such an adventurous story could not be as engaging as the books or the TV series, Spielberg and Jackson must be credited for achieving such technological breakthroughs and relating it all to Tintin's spirit of unravelling great mysteries. The essence of Herge's books is still present and that is what Tintin fans worldwide, will certainly acknowledge. Spielberg and the WETA team make Herge's storyboard almost come to life. Screen transitions occur in bubbles and reflections but Snowy, who may not have a thought cloud, is expressive enough to be taken for a real white terrier. Apart from this aide of Tintin's, a testament to the film's technical achievement is notably in two sequences. Captain Haddock relives the story of his ancestor's encounter with the pirate Red Rackham by enacting it all. We are smoothly and unknowingly transitioned through the two periods as Francis Haddock and Red Rackham engage in a stunningly choreographed duel. The other, is an inconceivable sequence in Bagghar's streets when Tintin, Haddock, Snowy and Sakharine's forces chase his falcon to retrieve the scrolls it obtained from the Sheikh's model ship. Sakharine in a car chase, Tintin on a motorbike pursuit, Snowy's acrobatic chase, Haddock's balancing act alongside Tintin and a sliding hotel building, all filmed as a single, breath-taking shot.At the end of it all, after marvelling at Spielberg and Weta's spectacular performance- capture animation technique that brought the boyhood hero Tintin on the big screen, one will be in equal awe of their ability to recreate the magic of Herge's works from familiar characters to iconic scenes and grippy story-telling. Thomson & Thompson are still the good natured imbeciles and there's the opera singer Bianca Castafiore whom Haddock simply cannot stand. Snowy is still the smartest dog around and our young reporter-detective escapes near death while unravelling a mystery, only to lead up to the next one. All of it, just as we read in Herge's books and watched it on the TV series. North America may be oblivious to Tintin's legend but the rest will have a blast at the most adventurous escapade led by Jackson and Captain Spielberg.8.77 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I like how the characters have been rendered: as almost life-like but still comicky.The only minus I have, is the excessive action scenes. The palace-escape scene was too long, and crazy.

Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson combined can do nothing wrong,"Tintin! A classic comic which, I have not seen before. But although I am one generation behind, it is still so well known that I'm sure everyone has heard of it. After knowing that the movie animation is coming out, with two extremely big names as the movie's producer and director (as we know, they are Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson), I know it is one movie I wouldn't miss.And What more can I say, produced by two of the greatest movie makers of our days, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was very well done. The graphic was really good and the story was very original, reminds me of how comic book adventure stories were supposed to be like. It didn't need to be overdone, just a nice animation telling a story the way a comic book story should be told, and suitable for audience of all ages!I would really like to watch the Behind the Scenes too, as I know there was a huge amount of hard work involved. The movie was done by Motion Capture, just like ""King Kong"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". But unlike these two movies, Tintin was a full animation and MoCap was done throughout the movie. Which means the actors have to act through the story as well. Imagine how much precision had to be achieved with the actions to flow along with the story. I have watched parts of it in YouTube and it was impressive! Well done Weta Studio!I have been watching the trailer again and again admiring the animation work. And I know I could easily watch the whole movie again too! And Thanks to Mr Spielberg and Mr Jackson, The Adventures of Tintin books must be selling hot again. I have two books myself now :).

"Visually Impressive, But Lacking the Charm of the Originals","The Adventures of Tintin directed by Steven Spielberg, is an ambitious attempt to bring Hergé's beloved comic book character to the big screen. The film boasts impressive motion-capture animation and a star-studded voice cast, including Jamie Bell as Tintin and Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes, with dynamic action sequences and richly detailed environments.However, despite its technical achievements, the film falls short when compared to the original Tintin stories. The charm and wit of the comics are somewhat lost in the translation to a big-budget Hollywood production. The plot feels more like a standard action-adventure movie than a Tintin story, with less focus on the clever detective work that made the comics so engaging. As a result, the film lacks the heart and soul that fans of the original series might have been hoping for.While The Adventures of Tintin might entertain those new to the character, it's likely to disappoint long-time fans who were expecting something closer to the spirit of the original works. I give it a 5/10 for its visual flair, but it ultimately doesn't capture the essence of what made Tintin great.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Performance Capture Sets Sail in Style,"Based on one of my favorite childhood comic books, comes one of the best ever animation motion pictures of this year. The Adventures of Tintin (2011) does a fine job in keeping the audience entertained while compromising a bit on the original story line.Plot: The Secret of the Unicorn is not the first book in the Adventures of Tintin and neither was the character of Captain Haddock introduced in this book. But I am not complainingThe plot kicks off right from scene one where Tintin unsuspectingly buys a three-masted sailing ship. The floor is immediately set for an adventurous journey. Far too many people seem interested in buying the replica model which sets the young man thinking, that it may hold secrets to something very important.An attempted murder, a car chase and a burglary later he is proved right. Only that the perpetrators of the crimes failed in their desperate attempt to get what they wanted – a piece of parchment hidden in the replica.Meanwhile, we are introduced to the twins from the police force – Thomson and Thompson, who are in search of a notorious pick-pocket. They do manage to lay their hands on their target using an ingenious technique only to let him slip away (as you would expect from these comical characters)!As soon as Tintin gets back home he is kidnapped. The rest of the story revolves around the journalist trying to escape from his captors, the introduction of Captain Haddock, the story behind the Unicorn and the secret treasure that lays at the bottom of the ocean floor. The hunt is on now in earnest.Special Effects: I watched the film in 3D and, to say the least, I was blown away – not by the 3D effects but rather by the Performance Capture technology. It was scintillating to see the visuals. It was hard to believe the world I saw on the big screen was virtual. The audio effects adds up to the amazing graphics and sets the mood for a fantastic adventure ride.Be it the noise of pencil scribbling on paper or the pumped up car chases with everything getting blown away, every sound and frame stand out as perfect. This is definitely one of the best visual treats and, needless to say, was a pleasure to watch!Cast and Performance: Any avid Tintin fan would stand up and applaud the choice for the cast. It was perfect in my opinion. Everything from their voice to their demeanor matched my imagination. It was as if the characters of Hergé had magically come to life! Definitely two thumbs up for the cast.It would be interesting to lookout for the casting in the sequel(s) (hoping there are many more to come). Surely, interests for doing voice overs in this series will spike; its about to get crowded with the best in the business eager to pitch in somewhere.Though being an animated film, I would still go ahead with the performance section of my review. Because you realize, while watching this film, that this is simply NOT cartoons on canvas – anything but that!Jamie Bell as Tintin, Daniel Craig as Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thomson and Thompson all shine through quite easily and have been poignant in the rendition of their fictional characters. The others are not far behind by any means. The characters of lesser importance in the plot of the film, too, walk away with acknowledgment of a job well done.But even out of this great cast, I am inclined to pick Andy Serkis rendering of the character of Haddock as the best. One will end up being mesmerized by the perfection that has gone to recreate THE most animated character in this comic book series.Direction: You have moments of adventure, that of good humor (there are way too many characters to take care of this) and thankfully no drama. The film rolls on without any noticeable flaws. The performance extracted out of the characters, as I already mentioned, only add to the positives.An average Tintin fan would expect nothing short of brilliance in direction. This is a Steven Spielberg film. PERIOD.Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-the-adventures- of-tintin-2011",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sinful trip down nostalgia lane,"Tintin- a trip down nostalgia lane. My first tryst with the Belgian icon was in 1981- when my father first read out The Crab with the Golden Claws in a bid to get me to go to school. I picked up snippets at first, and made him read it to me again and again and again...net result- lifetime fan.Herge considered Spielberg as the only one who could do justice to his comics on the big screen, and with peter Jackson too in the scheme of things, how right he was. The movie mixes two of the best stories- The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn to come up with 120 mins of uninhibited thrill, energy and globe trotting 3D fun.Tintin is the very pinnacle of motion capture with the attention to details being fantastic- the expressions are so so so very real, the look of the characters is spot on as if they just jumped out of the comic book in your drawer, the opening sequence that pays homage to all of Tintin adventures is perhaps the best ever opening sequence, when Tintin and friends give chase to an ultra competitive falcon tearing down a whole city in the sidelines, we get the best ever chase sequence, and when Haddock battles Red Rackham on the open seas, we get the best ever sea battle sequence!I was mesmerized most of the movie, occasionally screaming silly now and then...In short, Barney would say that the overall CGI levels are legen...wait for it....dary! Snowy antics make him the crowd favorite easily, but since we touched upon Haddock- well, he simply rocked. Andy Serkis is a superstar at motion capture (think Gollum, King Kong) and here he steals every scene as the grumpy but endearing, booze crazy Archibald Haddock...hell, so towering is he that they should have called this movie the Adventures of Captain Haddock!The most enjoyable movie of the year so far, will satisfy old fans, and create new ones. Can Spielberg+Jackson please get the next installment out soon? Am game for another watch anytime- 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An instant timeless classic and filled with FUN, LAUGHTER and INTENSE SUSPENSE with the magical touches of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson","With a fabulous coalition of three of the best stories of Herge's original series, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson's 1st animated foray The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn do not thwart the tintin lovers for even a brief instance. An all-encompassing and psychoactive use of humanoid CGI , following the steps of the successful venture The Polar Express, Spielberg imparts us with a spectacular whizz-bang adventure that coheres you to the edges of your seats especially during the action-comedy-adventure packed legendary second half. A smartly crafted screenplay by Steven Moffat (creator of the famous BBC TV series Sherlock), Spielberg's Tintin is one helluva ride that digs into your very favorite childhood hero. An excellent insinuation into the Herge's world with spectacular characterization and drastic dramatic changes into the plot, Spielberg creates yet another masterpiece and an instant timeless classic. Similar to Feluda's Jatayu, Tintin's Haddock creates an immaculate comic timing and magnificently crafted suspense which stays true to the lively spirit and ample humor of Herge's volumes. Pleasurable, idyllic and something that adheres to your mind like that of the taste of chocolate to your mouth, Spielberg caters us with an all-in-all common adventure-comedy whizz like that of the Indiana Jones genre...... Spielberg outdoes himself yet again as he plays on his favorite turf of film making alongside The Lord of the Rings famed Peter Jackson, The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn may very well be a beginning of the all awaited Spielberg- Jackson era of splendid fill making....",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Complicated Take on Simplicity,"It was a pity that the unbelievably realistic animation couldn't salvage a plot so rapid that it was barely digestible. That can be difficult to tolerate at the best of times let alone during a big screen version of an old school comic renowned for its simplicity.With the likes of Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected something a bit more compelling. The whole production felt pretentious, shoving so much in terms of its convoluted story and advanced animation style down the throat in order to seemingly detract from the fact that the plot line was ultimately quite ordinary with a plethora of plot holes. I do feel sorry for younger viewers who wouldn't have a clue what the heck is going on for the majority of the film. Admittedly, I didn't.All the same, the plus point was unquestionably the animation which was a descendant of other decadal animated film landmarks such as Toy Story and Shrek. You would have been forgiven for thinking that this was a live action movie at times such was how realistic the animation was. Certainly kudos to technology, but we do need to draw a line between animation and live action. After all, the pull of a cartoon comes from the animation itself.You always try to derive good, tame fun out of these animated flicks, even if the story didn't quite stack up and the voice acting certainly did that for me. Although there were times I could scarcely understand what Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock was blabbering on about in that strong Scottish burr, that was really the charm of his performance. I would also campaign for a spin-off Thompson and Thompson film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost doing the honours. They vastly entertained as a comic duo (not for the first time) and did so in a kid's setting on this occasion rather than the more mature set up we are used to seeing them. I bet that sort of movie, which would barely need half a decent story, would fare much better than this with all audiences.I definitely wonder, is this the Tintin that Hergé envisaged, even if a 21st century iteration? In all honestly, it does not seem to be. There were so many aspects to be admired, but admired for what reason?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie was fantastic!,"This is the first review I have ever written, and I am writing it purely because I love this film.1) The 3D aspect in this film was brilliant! It was subtle and compelling, without being unrealistic and in-you-face. While I was in the movie, I removed my glasses for a few seconds to check that it was actually in 3D, and I could see the faint blur around characters. What I found fantastic about the 3D aspect of this film was that it was so believable, that you actually forgot that what you were viewing was entirely computer-generated. Some films abuse 3D technology so much that you feel that you're floating in out-of-space, but Tin Tin was done to perfection.2)The storyline was compelling and fun. I've read some ridiculous reviews so far about how Spielberg 'ruined' the storyline by making it boring, and mixing characters and elements from different Tin Tin comics. SO WHAT? Spielberg never said the film was going to be called ""Tin Tin: The Crab With The Golden Claws"". In that case, if he mixed several comics, then people should have a right to be annoyed. But this film was about Tin Tin in general, and it gave people an overall sense of adventures and characters from a whole span of comics. Isn't it better for Spielberg to include references from several Tin Tin comic books, than to just go off on a completely different tangent without no reference to the comics at all? If that were the case, many of the die-hard fans would say that the movie had nothing to do with the soul and character of the original comics. Some people are just so damn fickle... On a more positive note: the storyline is beautiful and engaging, whether you are a age-old Tin Tin fan or just a movie lover.I work in the film and animation industry, and as such I should be predisposed to picking apart any film that arrives in the cinema. However, I can say with utmost confidence, that Tin Tin is the greatest film from 2011.--------9/10--------P.S. To the person who claims to be a Tin Tin 'expert' and says that Spielberg has it all wrong because Tin Tin actually has BLONDE hair - you're an idiot.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Adventure Animation Ever,"The film is inspired by three of Belgian comics writer Hergé's Tintin series: The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). watching this movie is better than read those 3 comics.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable movie!,"This was probably one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I went into it not knowing anything about the story. It was simply (a) animated; and (b) at the ""cheap"" theater and we needed something to do with kids on a Saturday afternoon.I don't buy many DVDs, but this is on my list of movies I will be buying - especially if I can find a Director's edition and hopefully with commentary.The attention to detail that both Jackson and Spielberg play to the characters and story line is incredible.I sincerely hope this is not the last we see if Tintin!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Old Adventures new way...,"I enjoyed every minute of The Adventures of Tin Tin. The story in not only fast moving, it's beautifully designed all the way through including the opening graphics. The carefully drawn Herge comic-strip style book has been translated into film perfectly. Tin Tin books, are not just fun to read, they are imaginatively adventurous and carefully designed and drawn. Translating all this so faithfully into CGi 3D and 2D film format is a brilliant achievement. I didn't want it to end. We watched it in 3D... I found myself smiling all the way through the film. Although it is an exciting adventure, it also has a really entertaining storyline. The pickpocket who catalogued and archived all the wallets he stole, Snowy's stunts when Tin Tin is kidnapped, the timing of the stunts, the bumbling Thomson twins and the brilliantly swashbuckling Captain Haddock. Probably, as with the books, this is a film I would want to watch again and again. The exciting and stylish world of Tin Tin offers such delightful escapism, I think I will want visit it again... Must watch movie I can say !! and finally great Direction by Steven Spielberg.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A decent film!!,"Tintin (Jamie Bell), a young journalist, happens to buy a model ship named Unicorn. Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) tries to buy the model from Tintin, but fails. The model is stolen from Tintin's possession, and he soon discovers that there's more than meets the eye. He goes on about an adventure trying to solve the puzzle, and meets Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis) through his journey. The rest of the story is about how they solve the mystery together, and discover the lost treasure of the Unicorn.Though everything seemed to have worked really well for the movie, I somehow wasn't totally satisfied when it ended. The spark you expect in an animation was missing. The story also seemed a little complicated. It is a adventure film with its share of fun moments. Overall, a pretty decent watch, but not a classic!!For rest of the review, please visit: http://sasikanth.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Young reporter Tintin finds a legendary ship leading to treasure, and must stop criminals from getting it.","This movie was magnificent! The classic comics by Herge was excellent, and so is this movie of it. Stephen Spheilburg did an excellent job making this film. They do not anything inappropriate, super violent, or any cussing. It is appropriate for even a family, of six years and higher. It's funny, exciting, and gripping to the very end. This movie promises one or two sequels along with it. I rate this movie ten on the scale of 1- 10 on the IMDb site, because of these, and the fact that it has everything a person would want to see on there, except for romance and horror. I can not wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD. This deserves to be in everyone's movie collection, and rated five stars by all. Enjoy this fun and exciting movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sorry no dice,"I'm new to this so give me a break .... Wow so many user reviews. I'm sure this will not get through.I do not know if they intended this to be a children's tail ... of course i was a child when i read TinTin but bringing it to a movie .. hard work.... Fail in every aspect ... looks like they tried more for money ...This movie could have been great .. but childish scenes make this move terrible. sorry this movie does not live to it's expectationsThere is more suspense in the books than in the movie ... Haddock Fails miserably this time ... Tin Tin is OK .. but ""snowy"" is as bad as Haddock They could have brought more ""REAL"" in the movie and it would be OK .. But .... as I see it this was a flop....sorry my English",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animated movie of 2011,"We got a lot of good animated movies in 2011, Kung Fu Panda 2, Rio, Rango, and Whinnie the Pooh, but Steven Spielberg's, The Adventures of Tintin was my favorite. Maybe it is just because I'm a Spielberg fanboy and like anything he does. Not true, sure I haven't hated anything he has done so far, but I never saw 1941, and I wasn't a big fan of Catch me if you Can. Also, while I did enjoy them I was never the biggest fan of the Indiana Jones movies, they're fun, and I own them, but they didn't blow me away.Tintin is Spielberg's first animated film, and man was it a lot of fun. The action scenes are so well choreographed, and they are able to get angles that they can't get in live action. The films highlight is a motorcycle chase through Morocco, which is a three minute chase scene all in one shot, not one cut, and it was amazing.The acting is great, Andy Serkis plays Haddack and he is absolutely hilarious. But the one who steals the show for me was Snowy, he was funny as hell, and just so cute. And Thompson and Thompson have quite a few funny moments as well, although they aren't in the movie that long.But that's all well and good, but what about the animation. I have actually only seen two motion capture animated film before, The Polar Express, and Monster House, both of which I really liked. However this animation is done by the same studio that did Avatar, and it looks great. While I was pretty much always aware that I was watching a cartoon, the animation is so well detailed that I can totally see people being fooled by it.Tintin is one of Spielberg's best films, in terms of my personal favorites I would actually put this in front of Schindler's List. And there are supposed to be two more Tintin movies, the next one to be directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Spielberg, and the third to be co-directed by both of them, and I can't wait.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Animated Movie Ever,"I thought this movie was amazing.I have been a Tintin fan for years, and me and my friends went to see this on opening night. it did not disappoint. there was action, humor, a good storyline, they stayed true to the book, and the animation was AMAZING!i was thoroughly surprised that this wasn't nominated for an Oscar,(except for soundtrack), and thought that it should have won best animated film. I have seen hundreds of animated films, and I can honestly say, that this was my favorite. I expect to buy this on Blu-ray the day it comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
So painfully dull my family could not bear to finish it,"The good: The cgi is outstanding, the most realistic I have ever seen. John Williams' score is wonderful, as always. The casting works well, the acting is acceptable.The bad: Everything else. I hate to criticize the story, as it is beloved and a classic, but it needed much fleshing out and expanding to work as a movie. Instead it seems as thin as the newspaper it originally appeared upon. There are no subplots, no character development, nothing to draw us into the story, nothing make us care about the characters and what happens to them. Some predictable things happen, and we are left uncaring and bored.Overall this movie is a disaster -- a terrible waste of time, money and talent. Many other reviews say it was a good story ruined by the Hollywood treatment. Instead it seemed to me the exact opposite, a thin story which worked as a comic but needed to change a lot more in order to work as a film. Other similar projects have worked in the past because they were properly rewritten for the screen. This one, instead, was just Tintin the comic, remade in cgi, and that didn't work at all.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
