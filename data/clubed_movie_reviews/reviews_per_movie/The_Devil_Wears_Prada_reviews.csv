"Move Over Henry VIII, Louis XIV, and Napoleon: Mirander Priestly is Here -- Realistic Exposé of the Feudal-like Realm of the Madison Ave Fashion Scene","We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get's seen and what doesn't. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.In addition to the public's clamoring to glimpse these powerful elites, another segment of the population desires to become one of these people by trying to ""break into"" the media business. Since there are many more people who dream of being in these circles than there are spots available, this gives enormous power to those already on the inside, particularly those who have sway to either make or break an up-and-coming career. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" chronicles an aspiring journalist who lands a dream job that, she is told, ""thousands would kill for"": being the personal assistant to the editor of one of the largest fashion magazines, Runway, whose editor-in-chief makes Bill Gates seem like a softy. The character, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep in a tour-de-force Oscar-nominated performance) is in fact modeled after real-life Vogue Magazine editor Anna Wintour whose chilling detachment from those around her, her ability to make or break fashion careers, and her cut-throat demands on her staff have become legendary throughout the fashion world.In the film, the corporation that is ""Runway"" is no democracy. It is feudalism, with Mirander the absolute queen ruling over her dominion of serfs who constantly scatter about trying to please her. The central character, Andy Sachs, is plunged into this Madison Avenue purgatory without knowing the rules of the game. A journalism-major from Northwestern, Andy knows next to nothing about the fashion world, but it's not just the fashion world--it's the world of the elite in New York. Since everyone wants to gain favor from the higher-ups in order to step up the ladder, there's often over-the-top deference to those in elite positions. I half-expected her female assistants to curtsy when Mirander entered the office. Mirander knows perfectly-well her status and she uses it, often flaunts it, to her advantage. Her staff run around like castle servants anticipating the arrival of the Lady of the Manor.Streep is magnificent as her voice never reaches past mezzo-piano. When one of her staff has transgressed, or simply cannot fulfill her expectation (I doubt Superman could hold a job there), in the softest tone possible she expresses her disappointment. And yet, the anticipation of her negative reaction is what makes for moments of anti-gravitational intensity. Of course, she never compliments anyone when they've done well. Excellent performance is taken for granted in this kingdom. I've never found the raging tyrant frightening. Rather, it is the even-tempered soft-spoken empress with absolute power who sends anyone who to displeases her to the block with a disinterested wave of the figure that is the most terrifying.At one point in the film, Andy chuckles when Miranda fusses over some seemingly identical-looking belts which of course spawns a lecture about how Andy's current wardrobe was in fact created by the fashion elite. This does point to another side of the fashion facade which I think may be the point of the film. If you take away the cameras, the celebrities, the allure, the models posing in museums wearing the latest by Christian Dior, at the end of the day all this is about is just jackets, belts, purses, skirts, dresses, and pants. I think one of the characters says as much. These clothes may look wonderful, even stunning, but that's all they are. They are lifeless pieces of fabric cut in a certain way to make the wearer look appealing but that's all it is. The fashion industry of course needs to perpetuate the idea that clothing is much more than clothing: that beautiful fashions will create fairy-tale existences for the purchasers. They are meant to represent a life of luxury and splendor and the purchase of these articles will bring you closer to that reality. When it doesn't, you need to buy more of these clothes. And you need to read Runway (aka Vogue) to tell you what you should buy. Of course, the only ones who actually have these fairy tale existences are the ones providing the clothes. Most of the people buying these fashions are still behind the barricade. Is there an irony here?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Meryl Streep, A Character Actress As Star","Unmissable for Meryl Streep fans. She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great performances in standard fare,"Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent journalism graduate hoping for a job at an important news outlet. She gets hired by the ruthless Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) editor of Runway fashion magazine. Only she feels the magazine is beneath her high minded journalism. Emily Blunt plays Miranda's long suffering assistant, and Stanley Tucci plays her longtime second in command.Of course Andy learns some lessons, grows in character, and faces a choice. The story is pretty standard loosely based on Anna Wintour editor of Vogue. The big plus is the great performances from all three ladies. Emily Blunt is funny. Meryl Streep nails her performance. And Anne Hathaway is great at holding the screen with these powerful performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Four great performances and a dazzling idea--skip the filler and enjoy the best,"The Devil Wears Prada (2006)There are four and a half major stars here, and any part of this movie with any of them is really fabulous. I'm talking Streep of course, and Hathaway who has the main role. Add Tucci who is terrific (as always) and Blunt who is also terrific (as always) and you have he makings of a terrific movie.So why the downer reviews and semi-dud status? I don't know, except the other parts without any of these, or with just Hathaway and her friends (her peers including her cute but dull boyfriend) are really dull stuff. This is partly the actors and partly the writing, which is truly filler. I can see some people grabbing their remotes at these points.But let's get to the crux of the movie, which is actually pretty great fun. The parade of great fashion that whizzes by, the haughty power queen that Streep pulls off with such panache, the steady dribble of insults coming from Blunt's mouth, and the transformation of Hathaway, over and over, as she moves her way into this world are all really dazzling. It's a fairy tale with its feet firmly on the ground--but what odd, worldly, glitzed up ground to be standing on.There are no depths here, just light romantic comedy. It's a situation many of us know--either by having to look good, or by having an impossible boss, or just seeing a relationship dissolve as you move on in your goals and maturity. Between the dreck there is a mostly wonderful idea made into an intermittently wonderful film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than I had been led to believe,"I had been told that Merryl Streep is great in this movie but the movie isn't really very good, so I went in with very low expectations. Maybe that was good: I really liked ""The Devil Wears Prada"" a lot.Maybe I liked it because of two things I had in common with Andy: first, I have had the experience of starting a new job with only the vaguest idea of what I was supposed to do (and how to do it) and finding that everyone expected me to perform competently, without any training or help, right away. Second, I have had a boss (female) who was so difficult to please and so willing to tell her underlings how stupid they were that several quit without even waiting until they could find other jobs. In other words, I could really relate to Andy's situation. Stuff like that actually does happen in the real world. Perhaps, that is the reason that I was possibly the only person in the theater who was hoping Andy would not make the choice she made.One thing that Miranda Priestley (Merryl Streep) had going that my Boss From Hell did not was class. It would have been very easy to create Miranda as a monster, but, wisely and skillfully, Merryl Streep allowed her to have a dignity and intelligence that made her seem to be demanding but not sadistic.Stanley Tucci is superb as Nigel, the ambitious, hard working man who dreams of having a position of power like Miranda's some day.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a very funny movie that is not as far divorced from the real world as, I believe, the producers of this movie may have thought.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Meryl and the Depth Of Shallowness,"No! Miranda Pristley can say it or merely breath it and the refusal comes as a devastating blow to her eager bunch of minions . Those moments were my favorites in a film that promises a hearty meal but delivers a frustrating bland soufflé. Meryl Streep however, makes it palatable and some times right down delicious. Anne Hathaway , so good in ""Brokeback Mountain"", is so uninteresting here that she manages to survive only when she's sharing the frame with Meryl Streep and that's because we're not looking at her. How can the fairy tale be so uneven, how can we possibly root for the evil stepmother rather than Cinderella. That seems a miscalculation of enormous proportions. All in all I could actually seat through the whole thing again just to see Meryl/Miranda purse her lips.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than Expected,"I got a chance to see a sneak preview, and it was better than expected. First, I have to say that I've never read the book. My friend who saw it with me read it, and she said that the movie was pretty faithful to the book.The movie stars Anne Hathaway, a writer who winds up applying for, and getting the second assistant position to the Editor-in-Chief of THE fashion magazine called ""Runway."" Her boss is played by the always fantastic Meryl Streep. While she gets less screen time in the movie, her mean looks and bitchy attitude makes her character stick with you. Also, the movie does give you some soft moments to make her a little more sympathetic than she was portrayed in the novel (or so my friend told me). I do wonder whether or not this movie would've worked if Meryl's character was male instead of female.I won't bore you with the other plot details because it was actually fun to not know how it unravels. Without the novel to go by, it was fun to figure out what bad thing was going to happen to her next. I do have to say that the movie has achieved the balance of being cute but not corny. You also get to understand why she just takes it all instead of just quitting to begin with. It's funny enough to make you laugh out loud, but more importantly, it's a great film to escape to. Hey, at least for the majority of us, we can come out of the theater and say, ""At least my boss isn't like that.""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Better for Teens than Adults, the Devil Still Pleases","With dialog that absolutely crackles, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is bound to please most audiences but will primarily appeal to the MTV generation, I suspect. When all is said and done, it's your typical fish-out-of-water, bright-lights-big-city fable, just dressed up all purdy.Or, put another way, it's essentially ""The Princess Diaries"" with much, much, muuuuuuuuuch better dialog and a slightly more sophisticated and dramatic story arc.So while older audiences may feel the film is a bit formulaic, the hysterical, but occasional cruel, one-liners and zingers hurled at Anne Hathaway's Andy are sure to keep them entertained. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt get most of the barbs, and Blunt in particular is fantastic in the film.Tucci and Meryl Streep, however, get to make the most provocative and stirring speeches in the film, and they deliver. Hathaway capably carried the movie, perhaps overacting, but she makes it work. Streep proves again that she's a gifted comedian. Emily Blunt, as Emily, is pitch perfect, and her performance here gives beautiful irony to her given name.The film is just too long, however, primarily because the director feels obliged to explain everything -- every plot point is rendered obviously and painfully clear, and nothing left open for interpretation. That said, we're spared the ""perfect ending"" and left with a heroine who can truly stand on her own two feet, and in any shoes she might desire.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Glossy and entertaining, but a bit shallow!","This is a glossy and mostly entertaining film, if a little shallow in terms of story and depth. However, there is a well-written script, that sometimes borders toward predictability, and nice camera-work, not to mention the fashionable costumes. The film's main merit is the performance of Meryl Streep, who rarely disappoints in anything she's in. Here she seems to be relishing the role of the hard-to-please Melinda Priestly. Anne Hathaway of Princess Diaries fame, is very charming and suitably dorky as Andrea Sachs, though I will say her clothes at the beginning of the film were hideous. There is also scene stealing support from Emily Blunt, who delights in making catty remarks throughout the film, and Stanley Tucci, who helps transform Andrea from her former self. One may question whether the film is too long, but it's very fast-paced, so I didn't have a problem with the length. The few criticisms I had with the Devil Wears Prada, is the predictability of the story, and sometimes the lack of depth. Overall, an 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fully Dressed,"Phil Spector invented modern pop music. Oh, some elements shift from time to time and different performer types are selected to posture in front. But the basic formula is one of filling all the holes. He called it ""wall of sound,"" but Eric Clapton popularized the notion that the lead defines ""holes"" and its the job of the producer to fill them all.It has to do with some hardwired notion of richness in the way we perceive things. My own theory is that usually we encounter things that to be understood have to be placed in some sort of context. We have to provide that context by being whole beings who have our own world and understand it. But we don't, usually. We're incomplete, lazy about this. We want prefabricated worlds to provide context and eliminate ambiguities.That's why we prefer it when an object comes with its own context, like in pop music where there is no vacuum for us to use. Fashion is the same way: there's some sort of bold statement, but it only works if all the holes are filled with accompanying items and attitudes.And its the same with movies. If you want a movie to be popular, to sit well in the popular eye, you need to make it lush in the small. This project shows signs that it is carefully produced in this way. Look at what happens in the backgrounds: colors, energy, motion. Look at what happens in the blocking: compound events conflated. Look at even the simple setup where a friend sees our young heroine flirt with a suitor. There's a huge amount of attention paid to the environment and the people which surround her.A Paris street walk is another very fine example.It isn't as valuable as what I usually look for: actual cinematic art. This is more craft, stagecraft. But it is well enough done to be admired. And entirely apt for a story about an industry that does the same thing.+++++There are essentially four characters in this. The boss, our young writer, the ""first assistant"" who is placed in between in several ways, and the gay (we infer) fashion expert who is placed in between in other ways.Part of the richness is that each of these is fuller than the usual ""lesson"" movie would have. All four are compelling performances. But if you haven't yet seen this, I'd like you to pay particular attention to Emily Blount. She's the number 1 assistant.You've probably seen her before in the very special ""My Summer of Love,"" something human about love and seductions. I think she's a real talent, something different than the others. Oh, they're very good at what they do, finding the right notes. But this woman has something else, something more visceral.You see, you can dance your own context into this and turn it from something that has no room for you. Try it by following the Emily Blount character, whose name is also Emily. (Hathaway's character is the ""new Emily."")+++++The moral issue we are meant to capture is more sophisticated than usual, too. Streep's character isn't a devil at all. She isn't quite a useful person in the manner that she actually creates. She doesn't make anything. She doesn't create or design or do anything normally considered the root of the food chain in term of value.She's part journalist, a sort of elevated, influential journalism that Anne's character doesn't have the horsepower to accept. She's also an arbiter of what matters. Its not a new notion, that some journalists create the world they present, and make it seem real by absolute consistency and projected confidence. Its what politics is. Fashion and politics, religion.That final challenge, about whether our young journalist will follow what she sees as the devil, that final challenge is more complex than it seems. And though this is a mainstream movie, part of the enrichment is that they didn't tone it down. And they left us with the conclusion that the girl left and wrote the story we see, one which casts the successful worldbuilder as the devil.++++Speaking about worldbuilders and fashion. To appreciate this movie, you must see the one on which it relies, ""Funny Face."" Audrey Hepburn, with the smile that Hathaway mines. Similar situation: fashion, clunky girl becomes fashionably adept, conflict between the ""real"" and pretend (in that case, philosophy). A trip to Paris  some of the very same establishing shots in fact. An ambiguous resolution that in Hepburn's case involved photography instead of writing.That movie made Jackie Kennedy possible, which made Jack Kennedy president, and from there, another ""wall of sound"" that built a reality, incidentally concurrent with the rise of Phil Spector...Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Budding fashionista,"The Devil Wears Prada finds an eager young journalism major Anne Hathaway
starting a new job at the fashion industry magazine Runway. She's got the
writing credentials, but experience in the industry not a bit. Which is going
to be tough because she will be working for Meryl Streep a queenpin of the
fashion industry. She's a tough and exacting and demanding supervisor and
can't seem to keep good help.Watching Streep as Miranda Priestley I was reminded about how law clerks
worked that way for William O. Douglas on the Supreme Court. He went through them like tissue paper he was that demanding. A brilliant jurist not a
very nice man.Anne Hathaway ever since she was a Disney princess seems always to be cast
as sunny, upbeat characters and the casting suits her well. Streep really puts
her through the ringer. But the girl had grit.Streep's a survivor, she's tough in a tough business. One wonders when she was up and coming herself what she might have gone through that make her
the way she is.Hathaway's also got relationship problems with her boyfriend Adrian Greiner who is trying to make it in another tough business, cooking. Hathaway temporarily falls for the charming fashion designer Simon Baker on a quick
trip to Paris with Streep.The Devil Wears Prada got two Oscar nominations, one of the many for Meryl
Streep as Best Actress and one for costume design. As this is a film about the
fashion industry that would almost seem a requirement.Fans of Meryl Streep will enjoy this one. You might try viewing this back to
back with the Susan Hayward classic I Can Get It For You Wholesale. That
film will give you an idea where Streep might have originated from.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stanley Tucci stole the show!!!,"My daughter read the book and wanted me to go see the movie with her. I was truly entertained by all of the back-biting and bitching that went on at ""Runway"" magazine, which is helmed by the inimitable Meryl Streep. She puts the 'itch' in bitch. You wait on tenterhooks for her to devour demure, clueless little Anne Hathaway. Keep waiting. All the while their little dance of death is going on, there is Stanley Tucci in the background, chewing up the scenery. He plays Fairy Godmother to Anne's Cinderella and it is a scene that would make any girl's heart go pitter-pat. All those designer close being thrown about, and the JIMMY CHOOS!!!! If you're going to see the clothes, you will be happy. If you are going to see Meryl act like a bitch, you will be happy. But go to see Stanley Tucci; he is poetry in motion, dressed to the nines (especially in his plaid suit), and as bitchy and gossipy as any old queen!! Plus seeing New York in all of its glory is always a treat. This was a great movie. I highly recommend it to: 20-30something women, gay men, anyone who loves anything Meryl Streep does, and those Stanley Tucci fans out there (and you know who you are!!).Enjoy!!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated as HELL,"I saw TDWP on the week it came out, and although I wasn't surprised that it became such a big box-office hit, the glowing reviews it got are beyond my comprehension. Granted, 2006 wasn't the strongest year for movies, but we had at least 10 or 15 better movies and the fact that the National Board of Review included this on their top 10 list is pretty ridiculous. It's nothing more than an average romantic comedy with some above the average performances (read: Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, all of them steal the show from beautiful but bland leading lady Anne Hathaway), and a nice but predictable satire to the fashion world. As much as I love Streep, I wouldn't give her another Oscar nomination for this (Annette Bening in ""Running With Scissors"" - a pretty bad movie, but her performance is glorious - or Maggie Gyllenhaal in ""SherryBaby"", just to name a couple, were better), but then again, she could play a door and the Academy would still recognize her. Gorgeous Brazilian Gisele Bündchen got US$350 grand to appear in 2 brief scenes and proved (again) that, as an actress, she's a fabulous supermodel. If she had to act for a living, she'd be starving now. When you think of so many wonderful actresses who are waiting tables in NYC to pay the rent, this is even sadder...Anyway, I digress. All in all, marginally enjoyable with some funny moments/good acting, but nothing too special. 5/10.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Forget about Meryl Streep, forget about Anne Hathaway  Emily Blunt's is the standout performance","... in an otherwise forgettable fluff of a film that remains afloat, but falls apart a little due to morals and messages. There has certainly been buzz surrounding Meryl Streep's devilishly delicious performance as the cold Prada editor, and rightly so, for she does a fine job, capturing the tingling sarcasm in her character's voice, the pursing of her lips and the icy chill in her voice. She perfectly gets her bitch on. However let me debunk the myth that 'The Devil Wears Prada' is exclusively Streep's show: Hathaway's competitive assistant at Runway Magazine is a blunt scene-stealer whose emotional transparency translates sharply into a bitchy-yet-likable-young-career woman. Hopefully we'll see more of her...When Andy Sachs (Hathaway) first steps foot into the prestigious Runway building  fresh out of Northwestern university and no interest whatsoever in the couture scene  she it met by a world of rapid-fire fashion jargon, cruel stares from skinny models and sass from superiors. It is a whole world of hierarchies, codes and fancy dresses (Runway is more than ""just a magazine"", after all) but arguably the first thing that jumps out and grabs you is Emily Blunt as Streep's assistant Emily  the sole survivor. The first half of the 'Prada' is an assured success due to its fast-paced navigation of the fashion industry and its many colourful characters like Nigel and Emily; it sucks you in. Hathaway fully reprises 'Princess Diaries' here but it works.Next it regrettably initiates a process of ticking off clichéd ingredients from a standard formula: the homely-yet-likable-girl makes progress at work, she goes through the mandatory makeover moment from the gay designer and comes out stunningly pretty, her rivalries' jaws open, her boss approves. Cut to her private life, which takes a backseat in the film, but nonetheless suffers the more involved and ambitious she gets at work. The film raises questions such as, how far will she go to get what she wants? Will she conform? Will she be sucked in? Prada tiptoes around these notions for a bit but there is always the underlying message that says a woman has got to choose: love or career. Nice going on the equality front there, Hollywood. Way to perpetuate gender roles.Nevertheless, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a good little diversion and for fashion buffs it must surely be heaven, or at least a petit mort, because the amount of product placement is baffling. Undoubtedly high-fashion labels such as Karl Lagerfeld and Jimmy Choo have paid good cash to be 'casually integrated' in the film. There is also a totally solid soundtrack that accompanies key scenes, such as the opening montage of Hathaway getting dressed in the morning in frumpy clothes while juxtaposed with the high-fashion models and their sleek outfits. Fun, but ultimately highly clichéd and too peppered with sexist messages to fully work.""That's all.""6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great comedy with a whimsical production with an agile rhythm realize that not spending time and provides well-developed characters,"Undoubtedly one of the best films of 2006 and was not for nothing so well at the box office and managed to please critics and fans in full. You are right that The Devil Wears Prada is a thorough and predictable movie but this is by far superdo several other points highlighting the quality of the plot. To begin with the title of the film could not be more perfect and creative, especially in the film where this ""devil"" is a great character and hits above all the serious approach of the fashion world instead of opting for a comedy excessively stereotypical frivolous and arrogant frame of the fashion world.The story tells of young and competent journalist Andrea Sachs, who recently formed and looking for an opportunity, get an internship at Runaway Magazine, the most important magazine in New York, as an assistant to Miranda Priestly. Andrea plans to stay there for a while to gain more experience until you get something more serious and engage in other career paths. As warned by other characters, Andrea had gotten a job that many would kill to get, but with time the first impressions get worse and she realizes that working with Miranda could turn your life into a living hell.Based on the book by Lauren Weisberger, the work conducted by competent David Frankel (Marley & Me (2009)) with the script very well adapted by Aline Brosh McKenna, unlike the book focuses more on the character Andrea, gives one character Miranda greater importance and that is the big difference to the plot works and believe we can hate and demanding boss who gives title to the work: Meryl Streep, who dominates his scenes and steals the spotlight. Through their interpretation can realize their unconventional character who is not connected to the fashion world. Miranda is a smart, competent, but at no time weakens and shows a hint of feeling and emotion, getting through to the public by meticulous gestures, head movements, gait, all the coldness and arrogance of their unique character. The counterpoint is done by the ever talented, expressive and charismatic and outrageously gorgeous Anne Hathaway, who manages to make the audience identify with her, taking pity often rooting for her in her personal and professional life while witnessing the transformation a character off but well resolved from the start for a character confident, powerful, well-dressed, and was able to adapt and triumph over adversity. It was a complex character, which required a high degree of behavioral transformation, and at various times overrode his personal life due to eccentricities of Miranda, but Hathaway managed to convince and move well. At one point Andy says Miranda is seen as the devil because it is a woman, if she were a man, his actions would be great. Aì can also show machismo and how she had to work hard to reach the level we reached.The rest of the cast is also worthy of applause. Impossible not to mention the work of Emily Blunt, as the first assistant of Miranda, always having fun with his paranoia of the head and Andy, especially in the first half of the plot. The always magnificent Stanley Tucci once again proves to be a superb actor and lends its elegance, confidence, refinement and good humor to Nigel, always with a sarcastic tone adequate and well posted, and shine tawmbém in some scenes that required higher emotion. Simon Baker and Adrian Grenier also go well in his few scenes. Even Gisele Bundchen showed up, this time in your world of fashion, and has a small stake, which further increased the status and curiosity on the plot.How to talk about this movie without mentioning the wonderful work wardrobe and makeup. The clothes shown, one more beautiful than the other, is a character the most and very important, especially in changing personality of Andy, which still breaking stressed even more the beauty and eelgância Hathaway. Another key factor is used well and the soundtrack Theodore Shapiro, knowing be accelerated, fun and emcionante, running through the songs relevant to the universe displayed, ranging from Madonna to ""Vogue"", through to KT Tunstall ""Suddenly I See"" and ""Every Girl"" by Chris Trapper. Editing by Mark Livolsi is accurate and shows good cuts and transitions of time and contributes to the fluidity of the film for its over 100 minutes long. The art direction and photography highlighting the beauty and importance of the New York fashion world fulfill their role well of delight and engage those watching, exploring the natural locations and key points of the city.David Frankel, who has experience with fashion tinna having directed some episodes of the TV series ""Fri and The City,"" can show the main points that make a lot of people interested in this world, around all the glamor afforded the possibility of work with their idols, always surrounded by people influential consumer dreams, success and professional recognition, good wages, but also shows that the level of demand and things that should give is a high price to pay for this frivolous world, of envy, greed and interests. Portrays very well the world of capitalist consumerism immediate and often unnecessarily, the futility of the people, the dictatorship of fashion and laying down their throats by some in society with power.The film plays and entertains the situations that arise naturally and for good twists that arise. Is not the typical comedy that tries to induce the viewer to laugh directly and forced. The comedy is in the reactions and situations experienced. The work worries still show us that we must cherish the simple things, who cares and worries of truth and whether it's worth it all by hand rather than professional staff. A film about choices and how we should deal with the consequences of those choices and the adaptation. The environment in which we operate may change us to what extent? The ending is just right and made to pass values to those who attend, but would also be interesting to see what each would do if his life would change so much by buying expensive clothes, and status, and they are traveling to Paris and taking care of the most important people. After all, what's wrong with it all if she is not stealing or hurting someone?A great comedy with a whimsical production with an agile rhythm realize that not spending time and provides well-developed characters and interesting, with beautiful performances, do you know the grace of the fashion world itself, with interesting content, plus the direction of millimeter Frankel are factors that make the film appeal to virtually all public bringing a plot a bit more realistic, less cartoonish and invigorating the fashion world while maintaining its fundamental characteristics. Can be seen quietly with family, girlfriend (o), with friends (as), with children etc..Fun, friendly, lightweight and always recommended. Watch always passing on some channel or watch DVD. Always good to see the competence diva Meryl Streep and beauty and charisma of Anne Hathaway. This there a chemistry on stage that worked. It is proof that you can make a movie blockbuster with content.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great adaptation of an alright book.,"For the past month or so, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie. I love Meryl Streep, I like Anne Hathaway, I though the world of magazine publishing could make a great setting for a movie, and I thought the premise of the book 'The Devil Wears Prada' had a lot of movie potential. So, now that I've seen it, I have to say it is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. The screenwriter has maintained everything that was funny about the book, as well as chucked a lot of the duller subplots, and has formulated a movie that is a great deal more enjoyable than the book.I'm sure you're all familiar with the basic premise - naive small-town girl comes to the big city hoping to be a journalist, and gets a job as assistant to Miranda Priestly, the much-feared editor of 'Runway' magazine (a thinly veiled take on 'Vogue' magazine, and its editor). Thankfully, the cast was almost perfect (though I did think Simon Baker was somewhat miscast at the rakish writer who takes a liking to the protagonist, Andrea), and elevated the movie to a level it would not have otherwise reached.Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing as Miranda Priestly, and I especially liked the way that, as Miranda, she never raised her voice above normal speaking level. Streep has said she based this mannerism on Clint Eastwood, who as Dirty Harry talks very quietly but still intimidates. This made Miranda much more interesting than the stereotypical, screaming gorgon she could have become. She is certainly the best thing about this movie, and I think the odds are good that she'll score a best-actress nod at the next Oscars. Miranda is also made more complex (and slightly more sympathetic) than in the book, which I thought was very good. In the book, which I recently read, the author (who actually worked as an assistant to 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour) was very bitter and whiny about the difficulties of her former job, and she made Miranda out to be a totally two-dimensional villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities. However, the movie shows us (briefly) a different side of Miranda - we see the compromises she has had to make to get to the top, and we see the toll this has taken on her personal life. We aren't made to agree with her diva-like behaviour, but we can understand how hard her life must be.I also thought that Anne Hathaway was very appealing in her role - she made Andrea more likable and less snobbish than she was in the book (although the screenwriter deserves credit for that, as well), and she looked great in the couture she wore through most of the movie.The supporting players were also very good, especially Emily Blunt (as Andrea's caustic fellow assistant, Emily) and Stanley Tucci (as Miranda's loyal but beleaguered right-hand man, Nigel). On many occasions, they stole scenes from the ostensibly 'central' character of Andrea.The movie, while maintaining the book's premise, does not follow the book too closely, which I liked. The entire 'Lily' subplot from the book is eliminated (readers of the book will know what I mean), and Andrea's parents and boyfriend are less significant in the movie than in the book. I agreed with these changes, though - I found those aspects of the book to be quite boring, and their omission made for a more streamlined movie.I strongly recommend this movie to virtually anyone, and I just hope ""The Nanny Diaries"" (another somewhat-similar 'chick lit' movie adaptation, coming out soon with Scarlett Johannson, that I am eagerly awaiting) lives up to the shining example of this excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent but very different from the book,"The movie is funny and entertaining, but for someone who has read the book it ends up being slightly disappointing. A lot of the best parts of the novel are omitted from the movie or are altered completely. The movie even tried to humanize Miranda more which fit the plot of the movie, but changes the whole purpose of the book. I also felt like the movie focused so much on the Paris storyline when it was only a couple of pages from the novel. I think it would've been better if they extended the storylines regarding the many impossible tasks Miranda asked from Andrea. Apart from that, the movie is still fun to watch and I did enjoy the new ending more.And most important of all, we cannot ignore the amazing performances by the cast. Meryl Streep was the perfect choice and I can't imagine anyone else who could've pulled off this role. Anne Hathaway was also phenomenal, same goes for Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Life Is Made of Choices,"In New York, the simple and naive just-graduated in journalism Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is hired to work as the second assistant of the powerful and sophisticated Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the ruthless and merciless executive of the Runway fashion magazine. Andrea dreams to become a journalist and faces the opportunity as a temporary professional challenge. The first assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) advises Andrea about the behavior and preferences of their cruel boss, and the stylist Nigel (Stanley Tucci) helps Andrea to dress more adequately for the environment. Andrea changes her attitude and behavior, affecting her private life and the relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrien Grenier), her family and friends. In the end, Andrea learns that life is made of choices.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a sort of dramatic comedy, with magnificent performances and a great final message. Meryl Streep is fabulous as usual in the role of a cruel bitch; Anne Hathaway is excellent and very beautiful performing the naive and sweet Andrea, a girl who sells her soul to the devil, but returns to her origins and principle; and Emily Blunt is also great, in the role of the caustic and jealous colleague of Andrea. The elegant and sophisticated locations in Paris and New York are nice, and the music score presents many hits. The story is never corny and I really liked this movie.

I'm a boy. I play football. I liked the movie.,"I think this is one of the most brilliant movies I have seen. It is quite scary. There is one quote that Miranda (Streep) has later in the movie and I think it is dead on 100% correct: ""everybody wants to be like us"".The movie sends a strong message, more than just a quest for self-knowledge. It tells us more than fame isn't everything. It tells us that in order to truly be happy as yourself, you must experience what you want to be. Everybody wants to be famous. Everybody wants to be skinny. Everybody wants to be sexy. Only when you are famous, skinny, sexy, famous can you be satisfied of it. There is a quote a friend of mine used a while back; ""You can't be taught what bitter tastes like. No matter how many people tell you that you won't like something bitter, you will want it. Everybody must taste something bitter and learn that they don't like it."" This quote applies very well to this film. Go see it!",,Anonymous,Comedy
"more devil, less Prada","Without Meryl Streep, The Devil Wears Prada would get maybe a 5 rating, but because of Ms. Streep giving a performance that will undoubtedly get her a 14th Oscar nomination it is reason alone to see it. Is it even possible for her to do something that is even remotely similar to anyone of her past characters? The answer is NO! Her Miranda Priestley is once again a completely new role that seems made for her and she is so deliciously devilish that you want her in every scene, but we'll settle for a supporting actress nomination come February in a movie that would have essentially been Pricess Diaries 3 without her. A very enjoyable summer fluff movie that is a great escape thanks, once again to the brilliant Meryl Streep.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The devil wears a mask of friends,"A classic story about the path to success from the bottom. It may seem so. But ... you know, I'm just furious, from the thought that the film carries. Come on first. You have just finished your studies, but so far you can't do anything, and you are not worth anything. You send a resume wherever possible, and unexpectedly ... You are invited to a place that everyone is only dreaming of. Furthermore! They take you to work! Here we must clarify that I personally hate interviews, I think that this is humiliating. And in general, if you are treated like dirt, then there is nothing to do there. But, I abstract from this. So, you were taken to work. Fabulous. At first you have to have a very hard time. You do not understand anything, do not have time, you can't remember. Your boss does not get tired of humiliating you, colleagues look like an empty place. All your thoughts about whether to send all this to hell and not find something simpler. But you find the strength to withstand all this, you accept the rules of the game, and even more so ... You become better than all your colleagues. But your friends and ""guy"", instead of rejoicing for you, begin to complain that you are no longer the one they knew. They feel that they have nothing more with you and are trying to drag you back to the bottom with all their might. All your efforts, all the way that you have passed - all this is dust. Don't you think that these are not friends, but enemies? What such people need to be forgotten as a nightmare? I am sure about that. Like any normal person.

Funny but...,"Who the hell would rise to the top in a fabulous job & have the finest in fashion to wear & smart talented people to interact w/ & leave it all for a commonplace dull life w/ an ugly boyfriend/husband?

Meryl is great but I needed more of her and less of the dumb main character. It's fun to watch when the story isn't being frustrating but it could've been so much more satisfying.

"Frumpy girls are smart and thin, fashion plates are stupid","This could have been a terrific movie if the script had not been so predictable in it's content. Meryl Streep is sensational, and without her there would have been no movie at all to speak of. She's as brilliant as ever, and perhaps more so because this isn't a typical role for her. Emily Blunt also steals every scene she's in and I really look forward to more of her work. Anne Hathaway is just playing herself as always, pandering to the teenage crowd who come to this film only to see Ms. Hathaway become Streep's Galatea, turning from frumpy to Gucci-toting hot mama. The most disappointing message I got, however,was the typical American message to most poor girls out there - if you dress down or unbecomingly, it must mean that you're brighter than the rest.

Minor  Streep is better than none at all,"If you have only 80 to 90 minutes to kill before you MUST be someplace else, and are in the mood for a stylish, funny film that is in some ways a valentine to every first job and bad boss in every high powered city in the world (but admitting that few are as high powered as New York), THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a perfect fit.The film actually clocks in at 109 minutes, but if you are pulled away before the last quarter hour, you may remember it as a minor masterpiece.The chemistry between top billed Streep as the fashion publisher (in what is, in reality, a strong, flashy but supporting role), Stanley Tucci as the designer, Anne Hathaway as the much put-upon assistant (who is the heart and soul of the movie) and the rest of Manhattan in support is generally outstanding, but - except for a lovely grace-note final quotation from Streep's character delivered by another character - the film as a whole simply ""peters out."" Actually, that ""heart and soul of the film"" is somewhat inaccurate. Hathaway is the heart (with Tucci and the assistant Hathaway is replacing as effective ""pacemakers"") - Streep is the soul. Without her, this film would just be THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS without the comedy or any Rosalind Russell comedy without Ms. Russell.Weak finale or not, Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay is a notable improvement over the bestselling Lauren Weisberger novel it is drawn from. Does one ever know the extent one should credit the director (David Frankel in this case) in a modern film when things go well? I'm inclined to blame him for not finding the punch for the ""final curtain."" In Ms. Weisberger's novel, there was never really any growth in the whining central character. In Ms. McKenna's DEVIL..., the assistant makes the real practical journey most talented people make in their first jobs - learning from tasks and unreasonable circumstances. It makes taking the journey with her fun.Someone once said that comedy is like sex: if you don't have a climax, someone is going to come away unsatisfied.

Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay cuts to the bone with its chilly, caricature-border lining skewering of the hoi polloi and TV vet director David Frankel uses montage very well in the storytelling in this curdled fairy tale of ambition and self-respect.

"Sincere,although a bit clichéd","There're lots of films dealing with the stories that the protagonist fights his/her way into some tough businesses and finally, either succeed or quit knowing his/her own places.One strength of this film is that it,too, picks up this sort of storyline,but the story is told in a sincere and believable way instead of a hyperbolic pretentiousness.Although I assume some of the audiences were going for the 'glamorous' part in this film,i.e.the fancy shoes,dresses etc.worn by pretty Hathaway,one thing needs to be noted is that the story is far more accessible than those big brands.A newly graduated girl trying to get a job which can not only pay for her rent but also open doors for loads of opportunities.This, I believe, is something many of us can identify with in real life. Despite that she's admitted into a top-notch fashion magazine with a demonic female boss(which is somewhat dramatic of course),her dilemma about choosing between career and friends/love is yet another thing that most of us will have something to say. As I see,it is the key of this film's appeal.Indeed,I shouldn't forget about the power of the cast.Attractive Anne Hathaway and great Meryl Streep.Lacking some handsome guys isn't the point,it's a film mainly about women: to be a career-obsessed woman or to be an ordinary women enjoying life is the question.And hell yeah,it's never solved.But this film,in the end,points out a direction for the women -well,perhaps implicitly -that smarter choice is to know your place and not to be so ambitious.As the cost you pay,seen in Miranda and Emily,is the absence of normal family and love relationship, is'the whole life that goes up in smoke'.Therefore,it can be argued that this film is ideologically conservative in nature.Average audiences won't care much about this,all we need is a good story and I think we have it in this film.Although there're some clichés(such as the affair between Andy and Thompson),I have to say Streep plays quite well,also the actor starring Nigel.Hathaway could improve a bit but she's not too bad nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
fashion passion,"As Meryl Streep has long been known for serious roles - some of them a bit sappy - it was great to see her play the bitchy lead in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Anne Hathaway plays a young woman who moves to New York and gets a job working at Streep's fashion magazine, only to find that Streep lives an entire existence based on schadenfreude (she's only happy if everyone else is on pins and needles), wants the most impossible things (e.g., the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript) and that the people in the fashion industry are too full of themselves for their own good (they act like they're curing cancer). Unless she can do something to rock the boat.I think that Streep had some of the funniest lines that I've heard in a long time, namely her whole monologue about cerulean. It goes to show how ridiculous these people in the upper echelons really are, but I also like some of the stuff (oops, ""stuff"" is a forbidden word in fashion!) that Hathaway pulls. Like ""Pret-a-Porter"" and ""Zoolander"", this movie leaves nothing unscathed. You gotta love it as much as I did. It certainly deserved its Oscar nominations.

I should have known that they were going to pick the most enjoyable scene from the entire film. In fact, it makes complete sense to me.

Aside from what I like to call ""The Meryl Streep Save of the Day"" In which the 13 time Oscar nominated actress is able to do what she does best, ACT! And not that fake crap you see throughout the rest of the movie from everyone else. I just couldn't believe it.I mean if I were the studio forced to make the trailer for this unbelievable piece of crap I too would have suggested that we just use the best scene and be done with it. I can see it now. ""How about a Trailer...where we show an entire scene! And we'll use this scene right here because it's soooooo GREAT! Oh my gosh... its different, it's edgy, the people will go nuts!"" To which 20th Century Fox probably said, ""BRILLIANT!"" It really just makes me sick.

Machiavellian ice queen,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the comedy drama The Devil Wears Prada (2006) where Anne Hathaway plays new graduate Andy, short for Andrea, who lands a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly, an editor of a global known fashion magazine. Streep's character Miranda is a demanding dragon editor-in-chief of a high fashion magazine. Andy is constantly told in the film that her role is a dream job where millions would kill for, however Andy doesn't quite understand this in the beginning. The story continues with Andy's ordeals as she struggles to survive one year in her role as she is trying to balance her personal life, her work life and the fashion industry life she has found herself. Will she accept the dark side of the fashionista industry or will she be able to retain her pureness?If you look at the surface of the film you may see the transition of Andy, from an aspiring journalist who is size 6 and doesn't mind looking like a dork by wearing lumpy poly-blend sweaters, to a sexy size 4 who doesn't mind wearing cleavage-revealing designer clothes and has stilettos, makeup and fancy hair. I guess it could also mean that in order to be successful, you need to understand that life is ultimately the set of choices you make for yourself. Another perspective could be how artificial looks and glamour always comes at a price, which usually is abandoning the people you love and care and the values you hold. But to me this movie really reflects on the ideology that women should not pursue career goals if the career takes away time from crucial figures from their lives including partners, family and friends. Throughout the movie there are people in Andy's life who disapprove of her newfound independence, including her dad covering her late rental payment and questions her leaving a law degree scholarship and not pursuing her dream job in journalism. Other individuals include Andy's friends who do not approve of her job as it makes her less available. So, to me this movie is about how a career-oriented woman can't please the people around her, this includes Andy's partner, family and friends. This points out that a non-patriarchal career isn't the right path for women. This is not true; one does not have to appeal to others in order to be complete. It's all about choices, not about making others happy.Going back to the flick, Streep is once again amazing in her ice queen role, her soft-spoken voice is express with such absolute power and can burn anyone who displeases her. Streep's ""cerulean"" speech around how Andy should not be making fun of the fashion industry and draws the connection of how important the fashion industry is for literally everyone. The other actors including Stanley Tucci as Nigel and Emily Blunt as Emily do a great job in illustrating what it takes to be ambitious and hard-working - sacrifice and hope for the best. All of the actors have great comedic timing and also play grounded individuals who want to see their own dreams come true one day. Funny and witty, overall 7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Wears Prada: A Hurricane of Fashion and Fury,"Calling all fashionistas and aspiring journalists! Buckle up for a wild ride down the runway of ambition with The Devil Wears Prada, a film that's as sharp as stilettos and as hilarious as a poodle in a tutu. With Meryl Streep at the helm, channeling the icy perfection of Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief who could make Anna Wintour look like a cuddly teddy bear, this movie promises a whirlwind of designer labels, workplace drama, and a whole lot of self-discovery. But does it stay in fashion, or end up in the bargain bin of forgettable rom-coms? Let's spill the tea, darlings!First, let's strut down the catwalk of praise: Meryl Streep is, as always, a force of nature. Her Miranda is a deliciously wicked blend of icy wit and cutting sarcasm, making every line a quotable gem. The supporting cast is also good, with Stanley Tucci stealing scenes as the ever-so-slightly sycophantic Nigel, and Emily Blunt adding a dash of devilish charm as the ambitious assistant, Emily.Now, let's adjust the lighting for some constructive criticism: While the film is undeniably entertaining, the rom-com elements might feel a little predictable. The chemistry between Anne Hathaway's Andy and Adrian Grenier's Nate is lukewarm at best, leaving you wishing for a spark that never quite ignites.So, should you sashay into this cinematic experience? If you're looking for a fun and stylish romp with a powerhouse performance by Meryl Streep, then The Devil Wears Prada is definitely worth a watch. Just remember, it's more of a fashion show than a groundbreaking drama, so adjust your expectations accordingly. And who knows, you might even learn a thing or two about the cutthroat world of couture (or at least how to rock a fabulous pair of sunglasses).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Angry Reaction from Wintour and her minions ""clackers"" !","I would call this the first real fashion movie ever as all other attempts (Altman & co) have been totally amateurish in describing this world. Lauren Weinsberger (the author of the Devil Wears Prada) having worked/survived at US Vogue for one year has provided a quite accurate look of madness of the fashion world and the even crazier world of high end fashion magazines.The movie will make any fashionista laugh and will introduce non experts to some lesser known yet interesting aspects of this world (how a magazine is created and the many conflict of interests behind it....one word ""freebies"").No wonder Vogue's editor in chief Anna Wintour's bitter reaction clearly showed in the fact that Vogue did not review the movie. And once Mrs.Wintour found out Miranda's office in the movie looked almost exactly like hers (www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg) she totally redid it. What's pathetic is that her former minion Kate Betts or ""clacker"" as they call Vogue gals in the movie has used the pages of once respectable NY Times to trash the movie and Weinsberger while ultimately sounding pathetic in a blatant case of conflict of interest( Article ""Anna Dearest""). Betts seems to miss the time when she was herself a ""clacker "" at Vogue magazine and probably regrets leaving Wintour all of a sudden in the worst career move ever, having later been fired from her editor post at Harper's Bazaar and now starting from scratch at NY Times.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The cast elevate this film up a lot,"The cast elevate this film up a lot.Everything else to do with 'The Devil Wears Prada' is all perfectly fine don't get me wrong, but I most certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it as much without the cast. Meryl Streep does an excellent job portraying Miranda, while Anne Hathaway matches her as Andrea. Emily Blunt (Emily) is also enjoyable, as is Stanley Tucci (Nigel).I never, personally, held too much interest in the plot, it does get a little bit repetitive in parts. With that said, thanks to Streep & Co., it's still a film that's definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Clackers,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read Lauren Weisberger's best selling novel, I am not sure whom to credit with the terrific dialogue and sparkling one liners throughout the film. There are some doilies! As if there were any doubts, this movie belongs to Meryl Streep (how can there be any debate that she is the greatest working actress of our time?). If one was not familiar with her staggering resume, recognizing that this is the same woman singing into a microphone in the recently released ""A Prairie Home Companion"" would be impossible. Ms. Streep is the master of her craft and is simply mesmerizing on screen. Studying the details of her performances should be where every actor wannabe starts their training. Streep complements her stream of non-stop dialogue with facial gestures and body language that convince you she is Miranda Priestly. By the way, her character is a cross between Cruella DeVille and Gordon Gekko - not the most likable or accessible personality one could design.The rest of the cast is fine, although doe-eyed Anne Hathaway gets pretty much chewed up and spit out in her scenes with Streep. Probably what the casting director had in mind. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt (as the real Emily, not the new Emily) really add some punch to their roles and Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential) and Adrian Grenier (Entourage) add eye candy for the ladies - as if the shoes, clothes and accessories aren't enough.What keeps the film from reaching the next level is simply the direction of David Frankel. His TV background is obvious as most every scene as the feel of a ""Sex and the City"" episode and not a full blown Hollywood movie. The same material in a true movie director's hands would have been a step up.Can't help but mention, from a guy's perspective, that there is more lipstick in this movie than in the movie ""Lipstick"". Make-up, hair, jewelry and clothes are overdone to the point of being laughable. Again, it's all part of the show, but it does help to point out what a joke the fashion industry plays on women every year.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Is A Hit,"I saw the movie on opening day and again on July 4th. I think Meryl Streep is a home run, and the supporting cast is excellent as well. In my opinion, the clothes, jewelry, etc. is worth the price of the ticket, not to mention the beauty of Central Park, the various shots of Manhattan, and Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I didn't read the book but will purchase it for my bookshelf and anxiously await the arrival of this film on DVD to add to my home collection as I plan to view it over and over again. It is light hearted and refreshing without any of the vulgar language and sexual scenes which plague too many of our movies today. It's a keeper!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Well, it wasn't BAD...","I watched The Devil Wears Prada on a flight from London to Newark last week. I had decided to watch it because I had heard Meryl Streep gave a very good performance in it (hey, it got her nominated for an Oscar after all) and both my mom and my sister really liked it. Yes, I know what you're thinking right now--what I was doing, trusting my mom and sister on a movie about fashion? Well, truthfully, I didn't know what myself I was doing.It's a good movie. It's anything but great. The acting is a huge highpoint, though, I can't think of one actor or actress in the movie who didn't do a terrific job. I remember seeing Anne Hathaway in her premiere film role, The Princess Diaries, a million and one years ago. I hadn't seen her act on screen since so that was kind of fun. Meryl Streep definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Stanley Tucci never fails to amaze me.Well, I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm a guy, I'm not into fashion at all, and I believe one should just wear whatever the hell they want and not care what they look like. Seriously. But anyway, it's a fun movie and it teaches a good lesson, that there's more to a person than the outside. Good, not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Cute, but not worth the hype","The acting is excellent and the writing is sharp, but I hope that this isn't ""the funniest movie of the summer.""

I think both Streep and Hathaway are great, and while they deliver their lines well I never once laughed out loud. Every now and then a smile, but I don't remember a single big laugh moment in the flick. If you want a feel good movie go see this, but if you want a comedy keep looking. Also, if you saw the preview and went ""I know exactly what's going to happen,"" you're right. The plot is fairly predictable, but as I said you will most likely leave with a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
18 YEARS LATER! - A Look Back Before the Sequel,"So, I just rewatched The Devil Wears Prada, especially since I heard that a sequel is in the works after 18 years! How wild is that?Although The Devil Wears Prada 2 doesn't have an official release date yet, it's exciting to know that the other cast members are set to reprise their roles. However, it seems that Anne Hathaway might not be part of the film.This movie pretty much launched Emily Blunt into stardom, showcasing her comedic timing and impeccable acting alongside Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Emily Blunt was just 22 when she played the snarky, sarcastic senior assistant Emily Charlton. Her role in this film opened the doors to more prominent projects, proving her versatility in both comedy and drama.As for the rest of the cast, Anne Hathaway was also 22 during filming. It's crazy to see how much both actresses have evolved. Hathaway had already gained recognition in films like The Princess Diaries (2001) and Brokeback Mountain (2005), but The Devil Wears Prada really solidified her as a leading actress. Emily, on the other hand, had her breakthrough in 2006 with this film and Gideon's Daughter, making it her breakout year.Interestingly, both actresses benefited from privileged upbringings. Hathaway, raised in a creative family with a former actress mother, found her way into Hollywood early, while Blunt, whose mother was an actress and her father a barrister lawyer, had similar connections. Their background, combined with their undeniable talent, definitely helped them make a name for themselves in the industry.The movie itself is still hilarious, with those over-the-top moments showcasing how demanding Miranda Priestly can be. Streep's performance is iconic, and the humor mostly comes from the absurdity of her character's requests-who else could pull off such a ridiculous task like fetching the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript?THE GOOD: But let's dive into the good and the bad. On the plus side, the performances are fantastic, the fashion is gorgeous, and the dynamic between Andy and Miranda drives the plot. Andy's transformation feels relatable, and the whole idea of balancing personal ambition with self-discovery really resonates. Plus, it's just fun to watch!THE BAD: Now, onto the negatives: some parts feel a bit dated. Nate, Andy's boyfriend, comes off as cartoonishly unsupportive, which drags down their relationship arc. Miranda, while fierce and captivating, is portrayed as a one-dimensional monster boss-getting a deeper look into her character would have made for a richer story.If they'd fleshed out Miranda's character a bit more and made Nate less of a stereotype, it could've added depth to the film. A glimpse into Miranda's personal struggles would've brought some balance to her harsh exterior.A fun touch that helped to set the tone of the movie's high-fashion world was the inclusion of Madonna's iconic song Vogue during a fast-paced fashion montage where Andy (Anne Hathaway) undergoes her transformation into a more stylish version of herself. As she walks confidently through the streets of New York, we see her wearing a series of high-fashion outfits, marking her shift from the ""frumpy"" assistant to someone embracing the world of fashion.FUN FACTS: Meryl Streep reportedly earned around $1 million for her role, while Anne Hathaway made about $300,000, and Emily Blunt earned around $250,000. It's wild to think these young actresses were making that kind of money at the start of their careers while also showcasing their talents in such a successful film. That's crazy money!Additionally, the film featured cameos from several real models, including Gisele Bündchen (age 25 at the time) and Heidi Klum (age 32). These cameo appearances added to the authentic fashion vibe of the movie, immersing viewers in the high-stakes fashion world.I'd rate The Devil Wears Prada a solid 8/10.Overall, The Devil Wears Prada remains a delightful watch, seamlessly blending sharp humor and iconic lines with a peek into the glamorous (and often absurd) world of fashion. However, adding a bit more depth to certain characters could have elevated it even further.* I wonder if anyone would read this review after 18 years, but if you did, click the ""Was this review helpful?"" to let me know you did.

Pretty as a purse.,"A curiosity of a movie that is most fascinating by considering how much this resonated with a fairly large audience.Sort of funny and sort of poignant, I suppose the crux of this movie is a vision of a character who is a regal figure under a Republic government, who is something of a priest of fashion, glitz and high society in this world where we do seem to be turning from prayer books to glossy magazines to put significance into our lives.We see her from a distance through the eyes of the non-believer and indeed, Hathaway's you-could-bring-home-to-mother goodie-goodie businessgirl makes a fine antithesis: a girl who knows the nuances of business but not so much the nuance of....nuance (""it just looks blue to me"").Gradually we learn to see the human that hides within this Channel-clad matriarch who seems to get whatever she wants except apparently for those things that are what the writer considers most important.On that note: dear future people, in the mid-2000s, Harry Potter was like 60% of people's favorite book series. It was basically Twilight but with wizards and less romance. Thus getting that manuscript was a big deal.All very chic and slick, it passes the time alright but I remember a rather tacked on issue with Hathway's lover feeling annoyed with her for some reason.Was it Hathaway? I'm not even sure right now.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not a great message to learn from this movie,"It's about the girl who chose her job and a random guy for a night stand over an amazing relationship she had, her good friends and family. The job she is doing is not so great as her boss never appreciates her effort and people are only looking for your faults. It's about working with people who will use you and will replace you once they don't find your need. One should always choose your friends, family and your relationship over any job in the world because that's what truly matters. Secondly, one should always look for a job where their efforts are appreciated and they can find balance between work and personal life.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hathaway and the audience deserves better,"I'm not a chick flick guy. That may seem like an odd statement, considering they are called chick flicks for a reason, but there are some guys that actually find something to enjoy in the endless reign of female oriented films starring Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts, or the new queen of the genre, Anne Hathaway. With two Princess Diary movies under belt, Hathaway continues her foray into the world of chick film with this adaptation of the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger. Hathaway plays Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, a wannabe journalist who gets a job working as second assistant to Runway fashion magazine's editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). Priestly is the stereotypical mean and nasty boss seen in just about every film made in the past two decades about working. However, Devil Wears Prada is too light hearted to really dive into Priestly's black heart and instead of dark humor to capture Andy's pain working for her, director David Frankel chooses to settle for lame put downs, such as insulting the way Andy dresses. Maybe there's humor to be found in that for women, but it's hard to imagine any guy finding the jokes here humorous. When jokes aren't failing left and right, the filmmakers throw montage after montage at the audience rather than focusing on character development and telling an interesting story. All this makes 'Prada' impossible rubble to sit through with no fun or wit in sight. Worse, the performances are generally annoying and/or dry. Hathaway, a great actress who has been in more bad films than any actress in recent memory, is given little to do but sound whiny and self-centered. Hathaway and the audience deserve better. 1/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
I love this movie☆+*,"I'm going to tell you about this movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"". The reason to choose this movie is that appearances wear wonderful fashion, and that it is a work by which this movie depicted the woman who strives to work in love. I like such woman.The main performers are Anne and Meryl. Anne Hathaway played the role of Andy.She is employed as Miranda's junior assistant but she is not careful about her appearance,and she has a hard time. Meryl Streep played the role of Miranda. She is editor in chief in famous fashion magazine, and she order Andy anything.Costume designer is Patricia Field.She is also ""Sex And The City"". Fashion is one of the necessary for this movie because Andy and Miranda work fashion magazine company which is well known by everyone.Andy was employed in the editorial department of the fashion magazine as editor in chief's assistant. Everyone hope to work this company, but Andy didn't hope because she wants to become a journalist. Therefore, she is not interested in the fashion and an assistant that being possible to do is bad. Besides Miranda who is the editor in chief was the worst superior.Can she endure Miranda's satanic demand? Can she become a journalist?This movie's theme is ""It is a story of you who holds out to work to love."" I like this theme and she is lovely because she does her best to work and love. I also want to be a charming woman like her.Please see by all means because it is a wonderful movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good Movie with Decent All-Around Performances. Not a ""Chick Flick""","Minor thematic and plot spoilers ahead.First and foremost, get it out of your heads that this is movie is tailor-made only for women. The themes this movie explores are much more universal than anything you'd find in a women's-only movie. Secondly, the actors' personalities help to mitigate any romantic sap this movie has. There's romance, but it takes a backseat to the hustle-and-bustle world of the fashion magazine industry. Meryl Streep gives a fine performance as Miranda, playing it quiet as opposed to over-the-top. She's the perfect ""ice queen,"" cool and silent yet sharp and biting. Sure, the character is exaggerated, but Miranda is a great example of someone driven for success at all costs. She is actually quite a sympathetic character towards the end. The lovely Anne Hathaway is also great as Miranda's protégé, who is willing to do the Labors of Hercules to succeed in her new career. Stanley Tucci is great as Miranda's fashion-savvy and snide assistant.Men and women alike will relate to both Streep and Hathaway's characters, and understand the onerous business of working one's way up in the world. It's a very universal theme, and it works in this movie's favor. While not really a ""chick flick,"" I will give the movie this: the main female characters are complex and engaging, while the men, with the exception of Tucci, are weenies. In spite of the rather negative portrayal of the men, it is very unfair to call this decent film---one of the best of the year so far---a simplistic ""chick flick.""A scene to watch for is when Miranda explains to Hathaway the subtleties of color in fashion, and how Hathaway chose her ""blue"" dress only through the tortuous promotion of fashion magazines and designers. It is a lovely example of a businesswoman indoctrinating her her naive protégé into her complex world. While the film was not great, I think Streep should at least get an Oscar nomination for her subdued performance, ""that's all!""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Fun Watch,"This is another movie I'm surprised doesn't have a higher rating. Yes, it's a fluff movie, but I like a little fluff. It's a fun, lighthearted movie that I always stop to watch again if I'm channel surfing. It's fun to see Andie's transformation, and Miranda's character is a so well-written - and of coursed acted by Meryl Streep.It's also another movie with some good life lessons - like there's more to life than things like material possessions and a glitzy lifestyle. It shows us that these things don't bring the happiness that many of us think they would, and that at the end of the day, the things that are important, like being true to who we are, and being a good and kind person, are what really bring happiness and fulfillment.Love this movie and will be watching it again the next time I come across it channel surfing!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not faithful to the book but a decent independent story,"Meryl Streep as Miranda was awesome! I love how she showed a human side to Miranda but remained the demanding and bitchy boss. Although the movie deviated quite a bit from the book, I think it successfully showed how Andrea was being consumed by her job in terms of her identity. Perhaps due to the time constraint, it didn't portray the breakdown in relationships as effectively. I didn't like Andy's boyfriend in the movie. He was nowhere near as desirable or compelling a character as Alex in the book. The whole Lily-becoming-an-alcoholic-and-getting-into-a-coma element was completely removed as well, which made Andy's decision to quit less convincing. I would have loved to see the book faithfully portrayed on screen, but I think the movie was independently pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Funny & Heartwarming,"The Devil Wears Prada is a loose adaption of the book of the same name. It follows Anne Hathaway as Andy who moves to New York city aspiring to be a journalist. She ends up getting a job as an assistant to fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).This is a review coming from a blind-viewer; someone who has never even leafed through the book on which the movie is based. But from the opening lines of KT Tunstall's 'Suddenly I See' it's clear what kind of movie this is. But chick flick or no chick flick, The Devil Wears Prada is something different. It's a feelgood movie that really anyone can enjoy.Meryl Streep is brilliant as Miranda Priestly, the 'bitch' of the movie, who never raises her voice above usual speaking level throughout the entire movie, leading you to think there's something more to her character. Anne Hathaway, as usual, plays the charismatic and 'sweet' role and does it perfectly. It's odd how funny it is when Hathaway swears. Emily Blunt, appearing in one of her first major supporting roles here,There is a bit of a story twist during the second half of the film which makes the story a little more three dimensional than how it was previously running. You get to see different sides of the central characters too.You can pretty much guess the ending, but that doesn't stop you from getting a warm feeling inside and a sense of satisfaction that everything worked out okay in the end. The Devil Wears Prada doesn't ask much of you, it's a very funny and heartwarming tale.http://ukmore.tk/",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
All grown up,"Anne Hathaway is on her way to grown up roles. And she seems to be on a good way. With this, Brokeback Mountain and a little less movie called Havoc. It will be interesting to see, where she goes from here then!But the real treat here, is of course is Meryl Streep. She is fantastic as a sadistic, ruthless cold as ice editor! Anee Hathaway gets great support from Emily Blunt. Who's also great here. Then you get the excellent Stanley Tucci as a mentor and you're set to go! The story of the naive girl facing this kind of difficult task isn't new, but it's played out nice here. Which mostly relies on the acting chops of the cast you got here.

Excels,"Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing as Miranda Priestly, and I especially liked the way that, as Miranda, she never raised her voice above normal speaking level. Streep has said she based this mannerism on Clint Eastwood, who as Dirty Harry talks very quietly but still intimidates. This made Miranda much more interesting than the stereotypical, screaming gorgon she could have become. She is certainly the best thing about this movie, and I think the odds are good that she'll score a best-actress nod at the next Oscars. Miranda is also made more complex (and slightly more sympathetic) than in the book, which I thought was very good. In the book, which I recently read, the author (who actually worked as an assistant to 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour) was very bitter and whiny about the difficulties of her former job, and she made Miranda out to be a totally two-dimensional villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities. However, the movie shows us (briefly) a different side of Miranda - we see the compromises she has had to make to get to the top, and we see the toll this has taken on her personal life. We aren't made to agree with her diva-like behaviour, but we can understand how hard her life must be.I also thought that Anne Hathaway was very appealing in her role - she made Andrea more likable and less snobbish than she was in the book (although the screenwriter deserves credit for that, as well), and she looked great in the couture she wore through most of the movie.The supporting players were also very good, especially Emily Blunt (as Andrea's caustic fellow assistant, Emily) and Stanley Tucci (as Miranda's loyal but beleaguered right-hand man, Nigel). On many occasions, they stole scenes from the ostensibly 'central' character of Andrea.The movie, while maintaining the book's premise, does not follow the book too closely, which I liked. The entire 'Lily' subplot from the book is eliminated (readers of the book will know what I mean), and Andrea's parents and boyfriend are less significant in the movie than in the book. I agreed with these changes, though - I found those aspects of the book to be quite boring, and their omission made for a more streamlined movie.I strongly recommend this movie to virtually anyone, and I just hope ""The Nanny Diaries"" (another somewhat-similar 'chick lit' movie adaptation, coming out soon with Scarlett Johannson, that I am eagerly awaiting) lives up to the shining example of this excellent movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
People in the fashion industry should see it.,"About 10 years ago I saw this movie on cable TV, and I wanted to see a movie about fashion so I chose this movie tonight.This movie reminded me of how I used to work for a cosmetics company. The cosmetics industry, like the fashion industry, is a market run by women. There is a female boss in the office, and the boss's subordinates have the most demanding personalities and are harsh with new employees.In this film, it is interesting to see how Andi, who wears dowdy clothes, gradually develops her fashion sense. This movie was made 17 years ago, but if it were 2023, I would have thought that Andy could voice type on smartphone all the orders from Miranda.Anne Hathaway is better suited to comedic characters like this than to serious roles like La Miserable. By the way, Emily's acting is outstanding, but her hair make-up is always not good at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

SO fun!!,"I thought this movie was SO much fun and while it drifted from the book, it did so in a way as to not be annoying but to add to a really viciously fun story.

I am puzzled with what I consider the miscasting of Simon Baker -- not intriguing enough (or hell, at LEAST he should have kept his accent). Otherwise, vicious, silly and all around great.

Thin Story Elevated By One Performance,"I saw The Devil Wears Prada during its original release and decided to give it a second viewing all these years later to see how it help up. It seems that it held up mostly well because my thoughts around it have not changed. In large part it's an OK film and even though Anne Hathaway is technically the star, and I have absolutely nothing again Anne, but the real meat of this film is wholly Meryl Streep's performance as Miranda Priestly. Her character has all of the best lines, the best dialogue, the only one with anything actually interesting to add to the story. Anne Hathaway, her boyfriend and their relationship didn't bring the comparative pull it was intended to have and actually becomes almost irrelevant. I'm not completely holding that against those actors or their performances as the script and direction played a large part in it as well. I know a lot has been said in praise of Streep's performance here, but this time it's justified. Check it out and see what you think for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Sublime - a breezy, sexy, party of a movie","Meryl Streep is wonderful. Aloof ice queen with a vulnerable side.

She was excellently cast and deservedly so. I look forward to seeing her in a bigger role very soon.The male characters are all very attractive and charming - but this is a very female film. The women are powerful, ambitious, successful and above all - fabulous.Some have criticised the ""wrapping up"" of the Andy and Cliché-nice-boyfriend storyline.

Comedy? There is not even 1 (one) reason to smile in this movie,"When I choose to see this movie I was thinking that will be a pleasant, relaxing evening. I taught that I will laugh because it was rated as 'Comedy'. I have to admit that I might not properly understand the meaning of this word in USA. In Romania a comedy means a movie based at least partially in humor. So I was expecting to laugh. But I found out that watching this movie you don't have even ONE reason to even smile. It is true that most of the actors did a great performance. But the script gave me the feeling that I saw this movie at least 200 times before. The same old stereotypes. So I spent the evening trying to anticipate the next move. And, unfortunately, I was almost always right. But there is a good thing to say about the movie: my girlfriend liked it.

Why Hollywood is falling apart.,"I went to see this film last night after reading a few favorable reviews and having had several people told me that they were surprised that they enjoyed it. (Reasons for going - Had to - the GF wanted to see it. It was the only film playing at the time we were there. Wanted to get out of the heat and sit in the air conditioning. etc.) The simple fact is that The Devil Wears Prada is a lazy, sloppy effort by a lot of professionals who know the ""basics"" of film-making and shot more like a long form music video than an actual film. There is no dramatic tension at all, and in the case Anne Hathaway's character no discernible character arc at all (and it's her story). Unless you consider Anne's Andi character starting out nice and ending the film being really nice.The sad thing is there are so many chances to torn this film into something really entertaining but it seems like everyone was so concerned with making everyone look good that they just avoided it. And the critics who have been raving about Streep's performance are either A. In denial B. Paid off by the studio or C. Drinking the Kool-Aid. Seriously, I guarantee there were probably ten people on the production crew who were scarier bosses than Streep's Miranda. Most people would kill to have a boss as nice as Streep is. I mean really, she's impatient about her coffee order and takes Andi to big shows and a trip to Paris. Ooooow - scary! The bottom line is this - if you watch Gap ads on TV and wished they could go on for an hour and a half - then this movie is for you. Hathaway is a pretty young woman and she looks good in high end clothes. I'm still not sure if she can act, but then I can't tell if Adrien Grenier can act either. And it isn't their fault - it's the script and the director.The thing is - this is one of the best films Hollywood put out this year - and it isn't very good. And worst of all - they didn't even try to make it good. Because it wouldn't have been that hard to do. It just would have required a little effort.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A pleasant movie,"This was a pretty enjoyable movie. . . much better than APHC which I last saw Meryl Streep in. We decided to go because of rotten weather here in NE (wouldn't you know it turned out nice) & this would be a perfect rainy day movie. Anne Hathaway is an very, very beautiful young woman with gorgeous eyes. All the actors were good. a real treat for those who like fashion. Story very predictable and reminds me of old Hollywood movies of the 40's & 50's where being a ""good"" girl was the most desirable path for any female to follow. I was disappointed in end and found several (or more!) plot devices rather unbelievable. But still nice to see a movie with people beautifully dressed & made up and absence of foul language and gratuitous sex!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The inspiration for Ugly Betty,"I don't know when the wonderful TV series ""Ugly Betty"" was conceived, but the parallels with ""The Devil Wears Prada"" are numerous. Anne Hathaway is Andy, a sweet young aspiring journalist with no fashion sense who is, to everyone's shock, hired by the boss from right out of hell, Miranda (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Confessing that every other assistant has been horrible, Miranda, while telling off Andy says, ""So I said to myself, take a chance, hire the smart fat girl."" Andy learns fashion from one of Miranda's fashion henchmen, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), and slowly but surely gets more and more sucked into Miranda's demands and life at Runway. Her friends notice a change, and her boyfriend believes they no longer have anything in common. ""Wait until your life blows up in your face,"" Nigel advises her, ""then it will be time for a promotion."" The bitchy world of fashion is fun to watch. No one eats and everyone is shallow. Size 6 is the new size 14, so says Nigel. The politics are behind closed doors, vicious, and make for a rousing scene in the film - and a look at just how evil and disloyal people can be. It's never anything personal; it's just the way it is.And that is what's not fun. Too many people have told me that Mildred ""is my boss."" It's hard to believe but it must be true. And the politics? Having once been a victim of behind closed door politics myself, I can attest that they, too, are equally true. While it gives one a few chuckles in a film, the reality is that corporate life today is ugly.I enjoyed ""The Devil Wears Prada"" very much, particularly the marvelous performances of Streep, Tucci, Hathaway, and Emily Blunt as a frazzled ex-assistant, Hathaway, and the sexiness of Simon Baker. However, I basically felt like it was a movie for really young people. I'm not the target audience. And that's another thing: the message about women, targeted to really young women, has been Hollywood's message about women since there was a Hollywood. If you want to be miserable, be a powerful person in your chosen field. There, you will find yourself alone, i.e., manless. It gets a little tired after a while.If the message is tired, the production values, the performances, and the clothes are anything but. There's some great humor to be had as well. I saw this on DVD and had a miserable time adjusting the volume. The music was too loud and the voices too loud - proof that I'm not the target audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Wears Prada a Pleasant Surprise,"The Devil Wears Prada I'm not a fashion geek nor am I especially into so-called ""chick flicks,"" but I had a little extra time to kill before meeting a friend this weekend. Since I think that Meryl Streep is arguably the best actress alive today, I decided to occupy an hour and a half by buying a ticket for The Devil Wears Prada. Yes, it's a film focused on fashion. Yes, you'd probably call it a ""chick flick."" But you know what? I was entertained.The titular devil is Runway Magazine editor, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). She goes through assistants like some people go through chewing gum  and she treats the girls with just about as much thought as she'd offer to a used up wad of Juicy Fruit Enter Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who is applying to take the place of the most recently fired Second Assistant. Andrea (or Andy, as she says most people call her) isn't into fashion, but she needs the job and she knows it will be good experience for her. But Miranda's First Assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) isn't so sure that Andy's right for the position.Unfortunately, just as Emily is ready to send Andy on her way, Miranda herself arrives and decides that only she can hire a suitable replacement. While she also doesn't consider Andy a good fit, a brief burst of assertiveness on Andy's part wins her the chance at the job. As she jumps in to the deep end and flails around accordingly, she's repeatedly told that ""millions of girls would die for"" her new job. In fact, it's not long before Andy wishes she was dead.Miranda is hopelessly demanding and impossible to please. Emily resents Andy and offers the barest possible amount of help. And Andy herself would frankly much rather be writing than hanging up Miranda's coat, buying her coffee, or delivering her dry cleaning. But she doggedly keeps trying because she's hoping her position will at least open a few editorial doors down the road.Andy's boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and her friends Lilly (Tracie Thoms) and Doug (Rich Sommer) sympathize even as they're taken a little aback by Andy's lack of interest in her job. Even Doug is excited about the designers she might get to meet, and the inside gossip she might get to hear; Lilly is impressed with the perks. But Nate and Andy's father only see that Andy is on call virtually 24 hours a day at the whim of her demanding boss, and that no matter what she does, it isn't good enough for Miranda.In a fit of despair, Andy all but decides to give up. But when she complains to co-worker and Miranda's right hand man, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), he offers her at least the beginnings of a solution. Andy determines to give it a shot. Her attitude changes and she becomes more and more competent at her job. She also, however, becomes less and less of a friend  or a girlfriend. And when she meets the handsome writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), Andy realizes that her chance may finally be right here, and right now. But can she afford all it will cost her to take it?Meryl Streep is, by virtually every account I've ever heard, a nice woman. Miranda Priestly, however, will convince you that she can't possibly be anything but cold, calculating, and downright cruel. All this, and Streep never once raises her voice! While this isn't the kind of role that wins anybody any awards, Streep apparently doesn't care. Her performance is stellar.Anne Hathaway, whose previous efforts have mostly been fluff roles (the lead in The Princess Diaries films, for example), made a point of showing her range by accepting a significant supporting role in Brokeback Mountain. With The Devil Wears Prada, she's gone back to fluff, but it's considerable fluff given her many scenes with Streep, and she does a surprisingly good job at holding up her end of the bargain. While she's not there yet, I suspect that Hathaway is capable of being formidable herself.The supporting cast is all quite good, but special mention must be made of Stanley Tucci. His character is fussy and egotistical, yet vulnerable; he seems flighty at best, yet exemplifies stolid loyalty. Meanwhile, Simon Baker is relegated largely to the role of eye candy. That being said, he's very nice eye candy which, in a movie like this one, does count.The Devil Wears Prada isn't anything other than what it's supposed to be, and that's a diverting hour and a half. It does offer up some life lessons for young girls (at the same time taking away from them somewhat by glorifying the very thin models and holding up starvation as a diet technique), but the one thing the movie really has going for it is the simple fact that most women of most ages, whether they'll admit it publicly or not, will probably be entertained.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Devil Wears Prada is rated PG-13 for ""some sensuality."" Everything is ambiguous enough, though, that I don't see a real problem with kids of age 11 or so and up. The Devil Wears Prada would be a pretty good date movie for the younger set, and a great flick for mothers and daughters. Drop your sons off at a Superman Returns screening though; as much as girls are going to enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, boys are going to hate it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertainment at its best,"The Devil Wears Prada was a most enjoyable movie. Streep was amazing as always and I loved how she just seemed to become her character. Filmed mainly in New York City, it definitely showed the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple.Ann Hathaway, was lovely as well. She's a lovely young actress and I thought she played her role well. She changed her outward appearance but did not realize that she was also changing some of her values as well.The men in her life were also played by great actors and I loved seeing the former ""The Guardian"" actor on the big screen.My fifteen year old also enjoyed the movie and it was nice that the ""sex scenes"" were not embarrassingly overdone. Definitely worth the ticket price. Streep should be nominated, hopefully for an academy award. The audience also enjoyed the movie. To me, it moved at a great pace and had a good mixture of both comedy and drama.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A very interesting film and one that defines fashion,"This movie, the devil wears Prada, is an interesting film. The plot seems to be predictable for the first hour of the film and you feel as if you know the exact ending. However, the film then twists and bends into something you didn't predict, something you never would have imagined, but nevertheless something that is genius; sub plots. The devil wears Prada is a great film with very different moments. Comicial moments, happy moments, sad moments, even surprisingly touching moments that grab your heart. The acting is fantastic. Meryl Streep is, of course, fantastic. You can't even tell she is acting she plays her part so well. You feel as if you are REALLY looking at a mean and cruel boss instead of a person simply stating lines. Anne Hathaway is also wonderful, and she brings us moments of comedy, joy, satisfaction; tons of different feelings inside of you. Emily Blunt plays her character very professionally and with elegance and, of course, somewhat fear of her boss. She plays her part perfectly. Everyone plays their part perfectly. From the main character do a guy who walks into a party. As you watch the film, you realize that this film does define fashion and the fashion world. The mandatory requirements are being skinny and being beautiful. This film I would have to say meets those requirements. It is somewhat short and doesn't waste time on scenes that are pointless, so one could say it is skinny. And more importantly, it is beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Go see it!,"The Devil Wears Prada is an amazing movie! For all of those people who believe it is just a chick flick, it is so much more then that. The back-stabbing and devious nature of almost all of the characters is to die for and Meryl Streep pulls a stunning performance. Anne Hathaway is completely believable as the sweet and smart girl who just happens to land a job with the fashion diva of the century(Meryl Streep). Stanley Tucci definitely livens up the screen with his witty humor and sense of fashion. If you don't go to see it for the plot line, you should definitely go see it for the clothes!

Meryl Streep is deliciously devilish,"Anne Hathaway plays a sweet person who finds herself employed in the fashion world, a place full of shallow, bitter, miserable, stuck-up, Machiavellian snobs. Why would she want to work there one day? Nevertheless, determined not to quit, she does a better and better job, while those around her accuse her of selling her soul. I thought the movie was pretty funny. Meryl Streep is such a powerful editrix she gets a laugh with a dry eyebrow-raise. Hathaway was a sympathetic protagonist. I kept rooting for her to wake up and realize she's better than everyone around her and needs to quit the magazine now, NOW! Stanley Tucci is really good as the sniping art director who eventually takes Hathaway under his wing so she can survive. I should mention my wife hated it. She said it was a movie about a good person who slowly loses her integrity while everyone around here is mean and gets away with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
And the message is.........,"No prizes for guessing this was a wifey pick. Not much about it appealed to me at all, but I gave it a go.""The Devil Wears Prada"" tells the story of Andy Sachs (Hathaway), a young aspiring journalist who gets a big break by landing a PA role for the queen of the fashion world, Miranda Prisetly (Streep). Andy isn't a fashion follower at all and only sees the job as a stepping stone into big time journalism. She soon learns though that if she wants to get anywhere, she better get into the fashion thing. Before she knows it her personal life is getting infringed by the demanding hours and chores that come along with the job.Will she stick it out? Will she sell out?OK, but a totally confusing message which seemed to change several times through the movie. Some good performances, but certainly way too over rated.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Billed as comedy and romance?,"This was a very disappointing film. Streep isn't stretched and I was surprised to learn she'd been nominated for awards. Hathaway showed some talent, and Tucci as the camp art director shone through.This is a weak treatise on bullying in the workplace excused by competition and excellence.The name dropping bored me, and I was surprised that a few fashionistes appeared as themselves.It certainly isn't a comedy other for than a couple of instances of witty repartee, and the romance is at best a sub-plot.

A stylish and funny comedy that's spot on.,"The plot: okay so the plot is a little bit predictable but I think that it is still very fun to watch it unfold in front of you. I mean it's a little Ugly Betty and Princess Diaries but it's fun.The performances: First of all, Meryl Streep's performance is superb. She was literally perfect as Miranda Preistly (and the hair is rockin') Anne Hathaway as Andy Sacs is pretty good. I mean it's as good as usual. Emily (Miranda's assistant) delivers a solid performance. She's sarcastic so it's pretty funny.Anything Else: This movie has a lot to do with style so you basically feel cool just watching it. And how bad could that be. Meryl Streep is so mean it's funny. The costumes are great. The New York scene is awesome and they make plenty of Starbucks references (which is awesome lol.)

Two movies for the price of one,"There are two movies here: one is a terribly vapid, insipid, shallow, hokey, schlocky (you get the impression) small-town-girl-in-the-big-city flick that will appeal mostly to small-town girls and their sympathizers. I couldn't make up my mind which was the schlockiest bit, when Anne Hathaway, the girl who holds the Guiness world record for biggest lips and eyes and who makes anorexic nymphs look ungainly, has to play the fat, unstylish, ugly duckling, or when she has fake moral qualms about telling her colleague that she will supplant her on a dream trip to Paris. I was writhing on the floor in agony and shaking my fist towards the sky at so much cinematic glucose. And, of course, in the end our ingénue gains everyone's respect including that of her demon boss, and does the right thing by writing stirring stuff about servants on strike for a newspaper where everything and everybody has a greyish hue of brown (viz, the real world). And her boyfriend's a cook (Jamie Oliver's influence becomes palpable here) who makes her grilled cheese sandwiches with ""five dollars' worth of Jarlsberg"" in them. Retch!Luckily there is also the other movie, one that features The Streepster as the fashion editor which makes the devil on his throne with his troop of succubi and incubi dancing around him look meek; Stanley Tucci as the extravagant fashion expert; and most of all Emily Blunt as our lead's super-sarcastic colleague (the one who doesn't get to go to Paris). Emily Blunt is a real discovery and pretty much makes this movie. I'm surprised that she hasn't been in every movie that was ever made since then. On that level the movie is really well-made and fun. All you have to do is to tune out of the scenes that don't feature the aforementioned three actors, and you'll be sound as a pound.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, Anne Hathaway very enjoyable!","We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.A very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms. Dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick. Meryl Streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the ""super bitch"" of the fashion magazine business. Stanley Tucci is his usual wonderful self as the ""gay"" assistant. Anne Hathaway continues to grow as an actress.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meandering comedy falls short on the satire and the coming-of-age side,"This one plays out as glitzy attempt at one of Garry Marshall's contemporary Cinderella comedies. He struck gold with Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, and PG'ed the hooker into a teenager when he cast another leggy ingénue with an engagingly over-sized smile, Anne Hathaway, in The Princess Diaries. In this adaptation of a popular novel, Hathaway stars as a bright, earnest journalism grad, yearning for her first job in Manhattan. The first big interview opportunity she gets is to become a personal assistant to the most influential (and absurdly demanding) magazine editor in the world of high fashion, underplayed flawlessly by Meryl Streep. Our girl looks like a librarian from the Midwest, and couldn't be more of a misfit among the obsessively skinny feminists, but Meryl apparently sees something under that drab surface, and hires her, anyway.For nearly two hours we see Anne's aspirations and ties to her boyfriend and old circle of pals wax and wane as they clash with her new role. Of course she starts dressing the part, with the assistance of a relatively non-snotty honcho (Stanley Tucci), who furthers the Marshall model by filling Hector Elizondo's kindly-mentor shoes. Somewhere between the fantasy of glamor and the lack of time to form her own thoughts, since she's at the mercy of Meryl's every whim on a 24/7 basis, her outer and inner beauty start heading in opposite directions. Will this job remain as her tone-year, resume-building stepping stone to writing about serious social issues, or will she be seduced by the perks of hobnobbing with the rich and famous, including the romantic interest of a successful writer (Simon Baker) who may be more suited to the evolving edition of Anne's personality? Beyond the obvious eye-candy feast inherent in this setting, the script serves up some good laughs and effective sentimental moments, though not enough for nearly two hours. Had the story been lightened and tightened into a breezy industry satire with a dollop of romantic intrigue, they wouldda been a contender. But the attempt at depth (presumably more true to the novel) requires more distance from reality than usual. Getting Julia off the streets, and seeing a gawky mid-teen Anne grow into her birthright (including a much-needed sense of self-esteem) were more intrinsically desirable than watching a bright young woman of conscience drink the Kool-Aid Streep is pouring.Early in the going, Meryl rebuts Anne's disdain for everything they stand for with a sharp diatribe about the value and pervasive influence of the designers she makes or breaks, even on those who don't realize it. For a while, that speech seems to validate their existence more than expected. It certainly causes Anne's character to shift her thinking. For anyone who doesn't rely on Cosmo and its ilk as essential reference material, the only reason those lines work is that Meryl Streep is saying them.In what kind of Bizarro world should a woman as slender and wholesomely pretty as Hathaway at the beginning be derided as too fat and frumpy? Who believes it's even possible, much less admirable, to float above all the cares and problems the rest of us live with in an endless quest for the smallest size of whatever some distant strangers decide is chic? Beauty in troubled times gives relief and hope...to a point. The Devil of this title isn't Streep's overbearing manner; it's the temptation of form over substance, mirrored by the film's ultimate lack of substance worthy of its stars. Looks great; less filling.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A real gem,"In brief, Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestly a big-time fashion magazine editor and Anne Hathaway, who has no fashion sense at all, manages to get a job as her second assistant. Emily Blunt plays her first assistant. There are a few love interests, mentors, and wheeling and dealing scenes thrown in for good measure but the movie is essentially about the interaction between Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Sounds a bit lame, and it would have been were it not for Meryl Streep. She plays her role so perfectly that you can't imagine anyone else could even come close. Meryl Streep has truly created a movie icon worthy of an Oscar.Anne Hathaway puts in a terrific performance and Emily Blunt, apart from being very pretty, adds just exactly the right amount of comic relief without being a caricature to make it all work. Blunt's facial expressions were so spot on and timed to perfection that they had everyone in the theater in stitches.I highly recommend this movie, specially for the women in LA who have about as much fashion sense as any $20 color-blind hooker with massive silicone implants and a cellphone surgically implanted into her skull.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Brilliant, Glamorous, and Delightfully Sinful!","Wow, where should I start??? Normally I wouldn't go watch a movie about fashion, but after pretty much every single one of my friends told me to go watch this movie, I went and checked it out...AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! The movie, even though trashed by some critics as ""shallow and unfulfilling"", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, ""Runway"", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.Not knowing much about women's fashion, I must say all the clothes, accessories, and style that the women in the movie wear were pretty nice (obviously I'm not a good judge of women's fashion =P). What makes the film shine is the ATTITUDE that each of the people in the fashion industry brings on screen. You'll laugh at the outrageous (and sometimes decadent) indulgences these people have in their clothes and looks, their arrogance, and their contempt for the ""sad people"" who do not understand or care for fashion.All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the ""high-class"" laughs that it packs.

The ending was hanging too. I was searching for more and quite surprised that it was it.The only thing this movie should be proud of is its actors.

Even as mindless entertainment, it fails, due to its paper-thin plot, limp dialogue and one-dimensional characterisations. This is so bad even the great Stanley Tucci can't save it.

Anne Hathaway shines as well in the role of an aspiring journalist who gets thrust into the high-stakes world of fashion.

The film does a great job of poking fun at the fashion industry while also exploring themes of ambition and personal sacrifice.This movie has surely aged quite well.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Why Couldn't Andy Sachs Have it All?,"Over the weekend I happened to catch Hollywood's latest chick flick fare served up lukewarm, lightly salted and without butter of courseThe Devil Wears Prada. I'm sorry to say that it was the same old tired, coming-of-age, high-browed moralistic, princesses are always pretty and nice, drivel. Not that I need those 106 minutes back or anything. I'll be o.k. But c'mon. Enough already! Let's portray the real world, shall we? Just once. (No, this cinematic commentary on the fashion industry was not expected to portray the real world.) I don't mean some swanked out MTV pad where washed up actors and wanna-be's torment each other on cable airspace either.No, I mean the real world, where girls pay rent (until they can buy a house) make student loan payments and car payments and credit card payments and blow money on great vacations in some sunny locale, (where hopefully tanned, hard, body shots are involved).It's nice to be moralistic. But it's even nicer when you can afford it. The long and the short of it is we pay our dues until we get to where we want to be. And like a closet stuffed full of designer labels, it's different for all of us.She has a boss from hell. Whose isn't? That's where they cut their teeth and your self-esteem all in a day's work. Get over it! If you're competent you'll be fine. If you're not, figure out how to get competent. There's already more than enough incompetence going around. Look at our current administration. The level of incompetence is criminal.In our fairy tale, the devil has an unusually large set of matching boules. This is why she can't keep a husband. No man wants to be Ms. Miranda Priestly. Honestly I can't help but wonder why. There seems to be an abundance of lazy/incompetent men who could surely benefit from the steady hand of a competent woman. See Supreme Court, Senate, or White House. Surely I am many years ahead of myself.While working for the devil our sweet princess develops her own set of boules. Boules make a great fashion statement. Although they are usually reserved for men, they have an unusually transformative effect on women. Basically, they turn them into bitches. My gawd, just living in New York (the main setting for our tale) provides fertile enough growing conditions for that. I ©New York! I'm not advocating bitchiness. When a man is a leader, no matter how many heads roll, how much of a SOB he is, or how many expletives he uses, he is, well a leader. When a woman is a leader, even if she doesn't engage in any of the former (and especially when she has several males reporting to her) she is a bitch. I don't make the rules I just observe the rats in the lab.After this manifestation our heroine has a choice. She can stick with her loyal, tried and true, souse chef boyfriend, whom she has clearly outgrown. Or go for the slick, hot, journalist who knows how to work the system. Why not learn a few tricks of the trade? The problem with this story is our fearless heroine doesn't know who she is yet. She's growing up and she's cute. Let's not forget that. After about a decade in the trenches she will figure out who she is. But maybe she won't be cute anymore. That depends on whether a) She takes care of herself. b) She doesn't take care of herself, but can afford corrective surgery. c) She takes care of herself and develops confidence and conviction and makes her own choices. But until then she is an apprentice.Dear sisters, even while one is apprenticing one should be well compensated. No one teaches women to do it. But men do this. They set their price. Compensation can take many forms: Swag or bennies; Great hotels; Great parties; Opportunities for great sex; And or self-satisfaction. You have to set your price. Yes, you my dear. No one else can do it for you. Certainly, not cute puppy-dog eyed, souse chef, boyfriends. Since our heroine had not yet fully developed, she was in jeopardy of losing her own sweet self and her high-minded values. I am not knocking values. They are great! They keep the world spinning on its axis. But unless your daddy (or mommy) is a mmmmbbbbillionaire you're on your own.Values don't pay the rent. Money pays the rent. And after you've made some, then you can donate to your heart's content. Why not work on the inside from a position of power? So tell me Hollywood, why couldn't Andy Sachs have it all? A hot, studly boyfriend and a glamorous job with all the trimmings, including annual sojourns to gay Paris? Why did she have to go and work in some dank newspaper office as if it were a moral victory? Why couldn't Amanda have it all for that matter? Yes, she's as cold as the ice in her martini shaker, but still. Surely, we can have it all! That message, my friends, I would pay top dollar to see!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Her Miranda is a juicy, imperious, richly layered character, for whom you actually feel sorry at times.The shoes and outfits are to die for, and you just can't imagine any other settings for this movie than New York and Paris. Anne Hathaway is merely OK. She is beautiful and can certainly act, but she is not THE star. Meryl steals the show and runs away with it.I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of gossipy details about the fashion industry. We get glimpses of how the magazine, Runway, is put together, but no real meaty stuff. So much time and energy are spent on the secondary characters, that one of the primary characters, the fashion industry, is given short shrift.But all in all, this movie was worth every dollar I spent to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A nice visual experience and acting package !,"Meryl streep steals the show with her cold blooded take on the fashion Mogul role ! she looks so great i cant begin to explain , its a total overhaul of her appearance,and it might sound absurd , but she really looks HOT !the movie is well written and is very nicely paced,although at the end u would ask what was it all about,but the fun lasts while its there !the background score is also well influenced form the ongoing story and mood ! the clothes are fabulous and is to expected from the legendary fashion adviser for sex and the city ! i will not be surprised if this book to movie adaptation will end up on a TV serial..with all that said a great movie 7/10 !",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining but...,"I only saw this because my wife has it on DVD. I thought Anne Hathaway did a fine job as did Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt. However as we all know Streep's portrayal is based on Anna Wintour, who is the Editor for ""Vanity Fair"".Because my mind is in tune with the culture and politics, I just saw this film in another way: all of these snoots at Runway love humanity, but they hate people. And in real life--especially in the one party city of NY--they all vote Democrat. This is not just sophistry: Anna Wintour refused to put Melania Trump on the cover of ""VF"". So much for the party for the ""little people"".",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meryl Wears Prada,"I didn't knew what this movie was about before watching it. I just knew Meryl Streep and Anne Hattaway were in here so I decided to watch it, expecting a fun movie but nothing more. Well, it's true that it's a fun movie, but it's not only this. It tells the story of Andrea (Anne Hattaway), a young girl who wants to be a journalist and she starts as an assistant to Miranda Prestley (Meryl Streep) in one of the most recognized fashion magazines, Runway.Anne Hattaway gives a great performance, with this feeling of innocence at the beginning, running from one place to another to get the tasks of Miranda done, but at the end she starts to understand what does it means to be in the world of the fashion and it's consequences. But the true star in here is Meryl Streep, who gives a devilish and glamorous performance, but also at parts with a human touch, but only her presence in the movie is worth the watch of it.Well not only Meryl Streep is what makes the movie worth the watch. Also, I was impressed on the costume designs. How many different dresses they wear through the movie! From Meryl to Anne Hattaway to Emily Blunt or even Stanley Tucci, they all have such a great variety of clothes that will make you keep staring at the movie. This and also the great soundtrack provided by Theodore Shapiro which transmits the feelings of rush and evilness of Miranda, and the innocence and sadness at parts of Andy.I recommend it to every one who wants to watch an entertaining movie with an awesome performance by Meryl Streep and who wants to discover the price you have to pay for being in the world of fashion and glamour.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Better than I expected, which wasn't much.","I finally got around to seeing this after all the talk about Meryl Streep's performance. While she was good, I found Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci to be on her level.When a young and somewhat naive woman, Andy (Hathaway), goes on a job interview for an assistant position, she gets more than she bargains for when it turns out she is working for an icy editor of a prestigious fashion magazine, Miranda (Streep). Her focus remains with being a journalist, but to get a crack at that job she must get through the tedious task at working for Miranda. To put herself in the good graces of her demanding boss, Andy ends up distancing herself from her boyfriend and friends. Soon she begins to question whether she is actually growing further and further away from her career aspirations.While the critical acclaim has gone to Streep, I really enjoyed Hathaway. It's rather refreshing to see a young actress who isn't blonde and rail-thin. While Hathaway is known for her Princess Diaries fame, she might just be on her way to higher profile films. Staring opposite Streep might be a good start. Hathaway reminds me of a younger Julia Roberts. Stanley Tucci also stands out as the magazine's art director, who turns out to be Andy's confidant, helping her stay on her feet and handling Miranda's ruthless demeanor. A secondary character in itself is New York City, which is beautifully captured by cinematographer Florian Ballhaus.In closing, the story is somewhat syrupy with its conclusion, but its actors make the film enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
DWP best film of the decade! Ten Stars in a walk.,"So after being pleasantly surprised by Lauren's book, which, by the way, supplied the answer to that long standing question: Can a twenty something Cornell grad write really funny prose? we have the film.Oh, and what's the correct answer?

"The She-Devil returns, only this time its Meryl, in an enjoyable movie","Miranda (Meryl Streep) is at the helm of a Vogue-type magazine called Runway. She is indeed a prickly, over-demanding creature who lives and breathes for herself and the magazine only. Enter Andrea (Anne Hathaway). She is an aspiring journalist who takes a job as Miranda's assistant only because she hears Miranda's name opens future doors in abundance. Andrea is not fashion gaga and she learns later that this is the reason Miranda took a chance on her. But, given the close exposure to the dragon lady, Andy begins to change. She does begin to bask in the designer duds they get as gifts and starts to neglect her boyfriend and friends when Miranda is summoning her. But, does power corrupt absolutely and does it reach those circling the powerful one? This is an interesting movie about the fashion industry. It is obviously a cutthroat business where the players come prepared to dedicate themselves entirely or get out of the way. Streep is terrific in a totally unflattering role. Hathaway is also fine as the naive young woman who learns many lessons in integrity and ethics. The supporting players are also nice, with Blunt giving a great turn as the assistant ready to sell her soul for the she-devil. It goes without saying that the costumes are of the finest and that the NYC setting is always spectacular. If you are an aspiring model or fashion designer, this movie should be required viewing. But, for anyone who wants to experience the dog-eat-dog world behind the loveliest clothes on the planet, this film will have you glued down on your chair.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As a New Yorker working in the media industry, I was insulted and disgusted. I've worked with a lot of writers, editors, and publishers, some of which were mentioned in this movie, and they are nothing like the ones portrayed here.Sure, the cast is great and acting excellent, but the premise, story, and plot is a big fat ""0.""

Better than Most Comedies,"Andy Sachs is a young woman who looks for a job in New York as a journalist but instead, she becomes a naive young woman working as an assistant to one of the city's biggest magazine editors, the ruthless and cynical, more like the Devil, Miranda Priestly.This is a funny film. It's very similar to the hit TV show, Ugly Betty. Meryl Streep gives an Oscar-worthy performance. She should get nominated for an Oscar. The film wouldn't be as good film Meryl Streep wasn't in. Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucciall has great performances, too.Unlike many comedies, this film is unpredictable. Miranda Priestly is a boss that you can think that would be as mean as you can see without even raising her voice or look angry.I haven't read the book for the film but heard the film was better. If you like good, smart comedies, you should go see this film and it's not a chick flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A well thought out comedy that has something for everyone,"My girlfriend was dying to see 'the Devil Wears Prada' after having seen previews and read the book upon which the film is based. I was curious about the film after seeing the previews, and having a great deal of respect for Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, I thought that it would at least have some strong performances.'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very enjoyable film with a well developed script and fine performances all around. While it is obviously marketed as a typical ""chick-flick"", it sets itself apart from the crowd by being a biting, dark comedy about the boss-from-hell that anybody can relate to. In that, even your average guy -- like me -- will be more than amused by the setup and scenarios as they play out.Meryl Streep proves yet again that she is a force to be reckoned with who can turn any part into something wonderfully memorable. Her portrayal of a fashion magazine editor who chews her assistants up and spits them out before lunch is fantastic to watch. Her performance is certainly not based on dialog, as her discussions on the nature of fashion and her complete lack of regard for anything that doesn't fit into her schedule does not provide any real depth in words. The strength in her performance is in the delivery, and she more than proves why she is oft considered the greatest living actress.While Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway both provide excellent performances, the real standout amongst the rest of the cast has to be Emily Blunt who portrays a brown-nosing, self-absorbed assistant who supplies a great deal of the more memorable moments of the film. Her principle position in the film is of consistently standing in the way of Anne Hathaway's character, only to have the tables turned in hilarious fashions, and in this she simply shines. Her comedic timing is impeccable and she certainly proves that she is easily of the same caliber as the principle cast members.In the end, the film does end up wrapping itself up a little too easily and provides a somewhat disappointing Hollywood style ending. But, obviously the film was designed for a certain audience so it cannot be faulted for attempting to match the expectations of those who would pay for a ticket. Even then, 'the Devil Wears Prada' is a fun, light-hearted and well crafted film that could easily be enjoyed by just about anybody.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Even though I wish it were less formulaic, it's still pretty enjoyable","Not an especially interesting movie narratively, but the performances are so good that it's very watchable. Anne Hathaway plays a frumpy girl (Hollywood frumpy, that is  only in Hollywood could Anne Hathaway be repeatedly referred to as fat) who gets a job in the fashion industry under the cruelest exec in the biz, played by Meryl Streep. Streep has been getting pretty much all the credit for the movie. It's not entirely fair. She is indeed excellent  you just want to strangle that bitch. But the film would be utterly worthless without a strong central performance, and Hathaway supplies it. Even when the film is at its least engaging, Hathaway makes it engaging. More her presence, I suppose, than her performance. I mean, damn, she's an attractive young woman. You'd think her smile could cure cancer, or at least bring dead puppies back to life. Emily Blunt and especially Stanley Tucci also deserve a lot of credit in the main supporting roles.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meryl aka Queen of Hollywood does it once again!,"The devil wears Prada (2006) showcases so much talent! Talent from the actors, talent from the writers responsible for the script, and talent from virtually everyone involved in this film. Meryl Streep is absolutely fabulous as Miranda Priestly. Miranda kind of reminds me of Sadie Shelton (Bette Midler) from big business. Streep plays her with deeper meaning though, really gets into the character and there are scenes that give us the opportunity to see into Miranda and understand her as a person versus only seeing her as a tough as nails dragon lady. There is one in particular where she has absolutely no makeup and delivers a wonderfully written and very well executed monologue. It's great to see both the funny and dramatic aspects of this starring character. Anne Hathaway also stars as a young journalist living with her very sweet chef boyfriend. She comes to work alongside Emily blunt as one of Miranda's assistants. She is good in the film and I loved seeing her evolution as a character, she goes on a journey that tells her what's really important in her life. And just like Miranda, Anne's character has her comedic side also. Emily blunt is here and she's hilarious as Miranda's #1 assistant. And let me just say that the coat throwing on the desk part of the movie becomes important later in the movie so pay attention to that. The writing is both funny and touching at the same time and it's all tied together beautifully at the end. 9/10 for the devil wears Prada! A great choice for young teens and up.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Silk purse from sow's ear,"Lauren Weisberger's eponymous tome was a thinly-veiled memoir of her brief stint as personal assistant to ice queen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. It wasn't the style or the storytelling that made the book a six-month Times bestseller item. After about the fifth trip to Starbucks schlepping coffee back to the fashion maven on excruciating four-inch heels, Weisberger's writing begins to get on your nerves. You're fascinated that a young woman would put up with such torture to make it in magazines or that any fashion world boss-lady could be so spoiled and mean, but the narrative is clumsy and repetitive.That the movie sparkles is due to several things. Well, why shouldn't it? This is the world of high fashion. The pressure, the waste, the arbitrariness, are breathtaking -- but so, you have to admit, are the beauty, the elegance, and the glamor of this world. Aline Brosh McKenna worked wonders with the book, paring it down and introducing more of a sense of progression in her screenplay. The director, ""Entourage"" and ""Sex and the City"" alumnus David Frankel, and his team have made excellent choices, starting by casting Meryl Streep as piranha Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, her fashion editor.It's hard to say if one would want to watch the movie without Streep -- certainly not as much; but who cares? Steely, cruel, elegant, icy, and just a tiny bit pathetic, she's a wicked delight and a huge welcome relief from such Streep frumpery as Madison County, The Hours, Lemony Snicket, or Prairie Home Companion. Who knew she had so much delightful meanness in her? This is Streep with a whole new edge. But Meryl is a great actress, so there's balance to the extreme. The brief scene near the end where she tells Andy (Anne Hathaway, the author's character, Andy Sachs) that her husband is divorcing her is a quiet marvel. For a few minutes we look into this opaque creature and discover a human being who's caring and hurt. Tucci's Nigel is similarly nuanced, not the tacky, camp creature of the book but again a subtle, modulated portrait of a gay man who's got a lot of class. And yet this is all comedy and grotesque, because the world of fashion and above all Miranda Priestly's end of it are so awesomely, absurdly over-the-top.And it's a lark from scene one, because Andy walks in for her interview as an eager young journalist out of college, but one who's never even heard of this Miranda Priestly lady, and who doesn't really want to write for Runway (the Vogue stand-in). Andy has big eyes and a wide mouth and she's pretty and she's not fat but she's a fashion idiot. She doesn't know who designed the clothes she's wearing, and she soon wishes the people in the office didn't either. She gets looked over from top to toe every time she turns around, and none of them like what they see. But she gets the job because Miranda is sick of sycophants. Not that she doesn't expect and demand that Andy will obey her every whim, and right this instant now, and ""that's all"" (which is how her commands all end, not with a ""please"" or a ""thank you"").Streep is effective because she is never, ever shrill. She speaks always in a calm, low, modulated voice. ""I cannot understand what you find so difficult about the instructions I have given, which were perfectly clear."" That kind of thing. It's like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, it's crazy and it's autocratic -- Miranda is the supreme ruler of her considerable domain -- but we know that Andy is doing this only for a year, for the experience and for the line on her CV; she's not trapped in this world. And there are tiny, tiny signs that Miranda is favorably impressed by Andy's performance, despite the absolute absence of thank-you's or words of praise.What also makes the movie work well is that fashion is about the way things look, and this is a pretty film, much meaner than Funny Face but as visually appealing. Lauren Weisberger is free with names, but she never makes us quite see the svelte ""clackers"" who hover around, or the exaggerated, hugely expensive clothes -- above all she can't show us how Nigel and staff dress Andy up to be seen with her boss. In the movie the sleek transformation unfolds breathtakingly before our eyes.Absent from the movie is most of the book's meanness and hatred and bad language and Andy's nightmare drunken roommate. A lot of the grouchiness is absorbed into personal assistant number one, Emily (the able Emily Blunt, Tamsin in the dreamy My Summer of Love), who also takes the bump from a car the roommate gets in the book, but emerges less scathed.Andy's suffering ghetto schoolteacher boyfriend Nate becomes an aspiring sous-chef played by spaniel-eyed cutie Adrien Grenier of ""Entourage"" whose biggest problem is achieving a killer port wine reduction. Andy's a central character in the movie but not the narrator and we're not stuck inside her head. The movie still has a little posse of underdeveloped friends, though, including a black woman photographer who has a big show, whom we never quite understand or see the point of. Luckily, the focus is always chiefly on queen bee Miranda with her vague commands and clear threats, and Andy trying to keep up, never quite succeeding, but still surviving beyond anyone's wildest expectations, so that before the end when Miranda tells Andy in the limo in Paris during the big fashion week, ""You remind me of myself when I was your age,"" we're startled but not entirely surprised. This is the paradox that sustains the story: Andy hates Miranda, but she wants to please her. She hates this world, but it dazzles her. We leave the movie with somewhat the same feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Witty fun,"Meryl Streep is fantastic in this enjoyable fashion-filled film. Anne Hathaway holds her own, but her character's story is far less interesting than Streep's. The film comes alive when Streep is on screen. Her character, while the ""Devil"" in the title, is more complex than you would think. The critique of the New York fashion scene is pretty amusing and on point as well. The plot is predictable, but The Devil Wear's Prada is ultimately quite a bit of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie much worse than I expected,"It is a rare day when I walk out of a movie theater really angry. But it happened today. Why? Because I just saw Devil Wears Prada. Did I know the movie would be about a boss from hell? You bet! I just didn't know how nasty and unappreciative this boss would be. Expectations were not met because they were ridiculously impossible! And we don't just feel sympathy for the naive newcomer who has an insane amount of loyalty to her uncaring and undeserving boss. We also feel for everyone else working for the company. Hey! You get crapped on and guess what you do  you crap on everyone you work with.Unfortunately, Devil Wears Prada is not just another boss from hell movie. It highlights the values of the fashion industry  values which are incredibly superficial and damaging. If you are a woman and you happen to be lucky enough to wear a size 6 dress, you simply aren't lucky enough. If you aren't size 4 or below, you are fat and need to lose weight. Come on people!Yes, I am angry. I am angry with myself for seeing this piece of trash movie.

There has been a lot of praise towards Meryl Streep in this film, and you can't deny, if she weren't a talented actress. But the thing is, like it is for all ""villains"" in the films, the story isn't about her. It's about this young, naive girl played by Anne Hathaway, and her friends and life, which is actually left as a background noise. In the end, her life outside the jobs pressure is just a flat piece of paper, with people with make up personalities. But for what it's worth, this movie flows with ease,",,Anonymous,Comedy
I wish it showed more redemption and less 'being cool and hip',"I gave this movie an 6 because Streep does a very fine job in this one. This movie somewhat exposes the shady side of the fashion industry. With the characters at the top of their game their chemistry (as characters not actors) blends well and creates a highly entertaining movie all-in-all. The story itself is very good, to be honest we see glimpses of fashion shows, New York. Everyday yet how many of us really wonder what's going on? This movie answers your questions somewhat and shows u the grit and glam that we don't see in the numbers reported daily. I recommend this movie to any Streep fan.However, the film doesn't show enough of the redemption of man. It's like 'Entourage' - Hollywood is so in love with itself, yet never stops to ask why are we in love with ourselves. There's nothing funny with getting backstabbed, yet Hollywood celebrates it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Better than I assumed, but Streep's excellent performance does not make up for all of its flaws","Going into The Devil Wears Prada, I was not expecting all that much. It looked intriguing, but looked like it was a chick flick through and through. Despite Meryl Streep's obvious Oscar nomination, I still was only vaguely interested in seeing it. And despite my thoughts to the contrary, I did enjoy it a whole lot more than I assumed I would.At a price of course.The film tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent journalism grad who is down on her luck, and is basically forced to apply to be a personal assistant at a fashion magazine. Despite her lack of fashion sense, evil boss Miranda Priestly (Streep) hires her on, and puts her right through the gears from the start. Even with the amounting stress from Miranda and her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt), who hates Andy from the start, she has to continue to work there, or risk not having a shot at a job she really wants.Thinking I was going to fed standard issue fluff, I was very surprised by how hard-hitting the film tries to be. Everyone at Runway, the fashion magazine Andy works for, are downright obnoxious. I figured they would just poke fun at her, and treat her like trash, but these people are just mean and awful to her. Although it got frequently interesting, I was downright horrified by some of the phrases and words being thrown around, and was impressed by the amount of pathos the filmmakers made for Andy's character. Watching her have to run around like an idiot added a jolt of realism that I did not expect to see at all.But almost carelessly, any uniqueness about the film is thrown away in the latter half when it just becomes a cookie-cutter tale of becoming what you hate. The morality tale it slowly becomes is just nowhere near as interesting as its original ""boss from hell"" storyline. Just watching the film slip into this mode was very disheartening, and almost ruined anything the film had going for it. It was as if they realized that their novel idea was only vaguely novel, and just decided to make the rest of the film dull and predictable to try and make up for it. It essentially became exactly what I half assumed it would.Another neglectful aspect of the film is the need to continually bring in Andy's friends into the mix. So much is going on with Miranda and the world of Runway that when these characters continue to enter the mix off and on, they just feel awkward and forcefully put in to help bridge gaps. All three of her friends, Lily (Tracie Thoms), Doug (Rich Sommer) and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of Entourage fame), just feel tacked on haphazardly, and really stand to do nothing in the film. Yes, they do have a point in it (especially Grenier's character), but none of them are developed at all, and essentially become useless in the grand scheme of things.Hathaway is barely developed herself. Yes, she does go through a very drastic transformation as the film goes on, but her character's stupidity and naivety are never quite explained. We know she wants to get ahead, but any secondary details are just completely negated from being told to us. Her second love interest, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), only continues to add confusion for the character, and just makes for some of the most clumsy and angering moments in the entire film. Her interaction with this guy should have been replaced with more scenes with her friends and/or boyfriend. On one level, she does fairly well for herself. But on the other, she just brings the entire film to a standstill, and seems to be channeling an older version of her character in The Princess Diaries.Streep on the other hand, is pitch perfect in her deliciously delectable role. When she first came on screen, she looked a lot like Cruella De Vil. But as the film went on, I realized she was so much more evil than that. Her barely wincing and thoroughly melancholic portrayal is marvelous, and makes her one of the most convincing antagonists of recent years. Just watching her coldly directing everyone around her is the key to her devilish demeanour, and it lights up the film in a way that no one else manages to do. She does truly memorable work here, and more than deserved an Oscar nomination.Supporting turns from Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both particularly memorable, if not for working great against Streep, but for completely showing up Hathaway at any point they are on-screen with her. The two of them bite right into the scenery around them, and make their supporting roles feel so much more important than they should be. I have come to expect this great level of character work from Tucci, but having never seen Blunt in anything made me have doubts about her performance. But thankfully, she delivers in spades, and makes her presence known. She will definitely be one to look out for in the future.The costumes are also very well done as they needed to be. In some cases, they almost seem like they are characters themselves.On one hand, the film works very well in its depiction of the ""dog eat dog"" world of fashion. On the other, it really feels like something we have all seen done before. It is disheartening, but Streep does a fine job in her magnificent role to try and make up for its shortcomings. Backed up by great supporting performances from Blunt and Tucci, she really is the reason the film is watchable in the first place. If for any reason, watch the film for her, and just ignore the storyline.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wonderful but too short,"I didn't see this movie until after I had seen four seasons of ""Ugly Betty"", a great TV series that I enjoyed a lot. And with all the similarities between the two, I naturally found myself wanting more from this movie. On the TV series, it took the bumbling ingenue years to become indispensable. Here, it happened in just over an hour, commercials included. And I couldn't believe it was over so fast.I've liked Anne Hathaway for a long time, and she was charming, adorable and quite pretty. It took her a while to demonstrate intelligence and drive but she did it admirably. At the beginning of the movie I couldn't see anything so wrong with Andy, but then I thought she was cute and attractive and didn't understand what someone working in the fashion industry was supposed to look like. Later, with the proper clothes and hair she looked amazing. Andy wasn't quite as sweet and innocent as I would have expected; with her friends she could be a little on the edgy side. But overall I liked her a lot. It was a shame to see her having to deal with moral dilemmas late in the movie, but she did what she had to, and then she did what she should. Andy is a good person.Miranda was enjoyable and considerably less of a monster than one might expect. Though incredibly demanding throughout the movie, her evil persona mostly came from being relayed through Emily. Miranda seemed much more human when making the demands in person, though you get the impression one still expected to be punished severely for the least little offense. One effectively edited sequence showed Andy being harassed day after day after day, too fast for the viewer to really take in each individual action, but fast enough to convey Andy's misery. Mostly Miranda was throwing her coat on poor Andy's desk, but there was surely more to it.Later Miranda showed much more of a human side and even appeared vulnerable. The night after I saw this movie, Meryl Streep accepted only her third Oscar and made a point of mentioning the wonderful hair and makeup artist Roy Helland who had worked with her on all her films for years. He really did good work; I'm not sure how old Miranda was supposed to be but she looked attractive enough to be working in the fashion industry. But in one scene, the one where Miranda actually showed herself to be the most human, she looked like she belonged in a nursing home. Was Streep really that old or was it just more of Helland's work? Either way, very effective.Emily Blunt did a great job. I don't think we were supposed to like her, and I didn't in the sense of loving to hate her, but she made Andy's life miserable in an entertaining way, mostly by relaying Miranda's unreasonable expectations. But she didn't want Andy to succeed, so she made Andy figure things out more than she really helped her. Andy, forced to do things herself, eventually figured it out, and Emily ended up making us care about her.Stanley Tucci did a fine job as Nigel, Andy's biggest supporter. Now this is a character we were really supposed to like.I recognized ""The Mentalist"" as the man with the potential to further Andy's desired career. I've never seen the show, but I sure did like him and found myself wishing I had watched his series.I didn't really like Nate. One wouldn't expect a cute girl like Andy to have such an edgy boyfriend. But she wasn't really all that cute, was she? I found myself rooting for Christian as Andy had to make a choice.Overall, it was a great effort, and the one weakness I observed was that it all happened too fast and we didn't really get to enjoy any single stage for all that long.

"Good, but unsound","This is one of those movies that seems solid and entertaining, then starts to crumble a bit when you think about it afterwards; however, it still holds up for the most part, and the main purpose of a movie is to keep you interested while you're watching, after all. The first problem is the title, which also implies that Meryl Streep is the main role, rather than protagonist Anne Hathaway who is, in fact, effectively plays an interesting character rather than just a sounding board for another virtuoso Streep performance (which isn't to say that Streep isn't good, either).The main problems mostly lie in how Andy, Hathaway's character, deals with her dilemma; should she stay true to herself or fall into the fashion world? This isn't as lame as it sounds on paper, especially since they managed to convey some sense of the aforementioned fashion world's glamour to someone like me who by default reviles every aspect of it. This, however, might mean that I sympathized more with her plight than someone who, say, never had any qualms about ""fitting in"" at all costs. However, the weakness of the detractors seems to sap this film's moral clarity, as does its eventual mutation from a series of critiques of a whole industry to a mere interpersonal conflict; of course this is inevitable in Hollywood film, but the way this happens in this movie decidedly muddies up and changes the entire issue at hand. Of course, a film like this wants to have it both ways, but one hopes at the very least that when several characters describe a size 4 as ""fat,"" the filmmaker means to attack that perspective. A lack of clarity on this issue is a lot more unforgivable. All that said, I did find it to be compelling and well-played.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Entertaining corporate ladder movie that is not about men,"(2006) The Devil Wears Prada
DRAMA COMEDYEntertaining 'chick-flick' adapted from the novel written by Lauren Weisberger about optimistic, teen employee and intern, Andy Sachs (Ann Hathoway) hopes on working herself up the corporate ladder by working alongside the rather abusive, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) an owner of a popular fashion magazine. Story loosely based on Anna Wintour, the editor and chief of the popular American ""Vogue"" magazine. Stanly Tucci and Emily Blunt also stars as she plays Emily the other intern. Nominated for two Oscars including Best Actress in a Leading role for Meryl Streep.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I have a different take on this from most reviewers,"I have to say as a male - and approaching the fashion industry as Anne Hatheway's character did - thinking she was ""apart"" from it - a bit of dialogue from Meryl Streep's character was really an education for me.Anne's character, ""Andrea"", snickers when a model, selecting 2 belts for Streep's character, saying that she ""still has to learn this stuff"".What follows from Streep's character is some of the most powerful dialog I have seen on the screen.Addressing the innocuous sweater that Andrea is wearing, Miranda Priestly then goes into the history of the color of her sweater - not ""blue"" but ""cerulean"" when the color was unveiled, how it filtered down from the designers to the department stores and finally "" where you fished it out of some bargain bin in some Casual Corner"".""So It's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when in fact - you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of ""stuff"".Having seen back-to-back Streep movies Julie and Julia - now this - I can see why she is so revered as an actress.As to the movie it is funny and for a relatively fashion-ignorant guy, educational.Most of us have all had a ""boss from Hell"" and it is funny to see how Andrea handles this as it unfolds.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A mellower version of something that could have been a lot more dark,"The movie surely is a masterpiece and when we got Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway working together we cannot expect less and it met all the expectations. The storyline was a simple one yet had a lot to offer for someone who understands the kind of problems it posed. A life shred in pieces, a dark yet widely known truth of the fashion industry. One of the most exploitative ones probably. The movie also tend to tell about the capitalist tendencies prevalent in the country where there is a class struggle between the upper class (Maranda Presley ) and the working class (our protagonist- Andrea). Where one is the exploiter and the other is exploited. The master and efforts of the workers are hardly noticed and the assumption is that it is their duty of the same to get exploited. The movie also depicts how the industry chews you up and then spits you out the moment you seem unworthy (Incident where Emily was not taken to Paris as she wasn't as sharp as Andrea) while Miranda was right in doing so as she has to look good in the event and why should she take care of the incapable and that is one of the reasons that I took the help of capitalism as an ideology to explain the phenomenon, where exploitation is a culture and is considered to be a norm the one exploited are supposed to be obedient while being exploited and if there is any kind of resistance there is so-called 'choice' that you have to leave the job (is that a real choice, a choice is where you have an option you weigh the pros and cons and then decide, here the choice is one-sided and thus I don't consider it as a choice by one's free will) which is disastrous to a human whose personal life is hanging by a thread and can snap anytime. And yet you cannot say NO as it is not taken as an answer the moment that happens you are reduced to an insignificant jobless nobody. There is no security may it be in the domain of job, emotions or relations. A false narrative of a job that is highly desired is created and that 'everybody wants to be us'. Tendencies like these are responsible for a discrepant work-life balance leading to poor interpersonal ties, increasing mental issues, and a strange feeling of insecurity in modern times. All these problems are beautifully depicted in the movie and therefore the movie is a definitely is a one time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Princess Diaries meets Vogue,"Who can resist a movie starring Meryl Streep? I couldn't, even though my idea of fashion is wearing silver bracelets with my overalls. And then there is relatively newcomer Anne Hathaway. I just wanted to see how they would chem together. It worked. But--we have seen Ann in too many of these makeover/change of character movies. She did the princess makeover thing in both Princess Diaries and in Enchanted Ella. She has obvious talent and needs to find a movie where she is stretching herself, like Meryl. Meryl cannot be typecast since she has the ability to make the role hers. She becomes whatever the part calls for. She is amazing.As for the movie... If you are looking for an outsider's peek at the fashion world, and a fairly predicable plot, I would then say go watch The Devil wears Prada. But go for Meryl even if you don't like fashion.

A Perfect Adaptation,"An excellent cast ensemble. A funny, intelligent screenplay from fine source material. Great, restrained direction. Fancy clothes. An awesome soundtrack. Fish all that up, stick in a blender and what you get? The sophisticated, ""The Devil Wears Prada"".Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Blunt headline the picture and all form together and come out with exceptional performances. A surprising uproar of an ensemble. Meryl Streep was nominated in Lead Actress at the Oscars, but this was clearly a mistake. This is Anne Hathaway's movie. She plays the part to a tee, she's beautiful, she makes you identify with Andy as she goes through this torture. Meryl Streep is fierce and cruel as the antagonist. If the studio would've pushed her in the supporting category, she'd have her overdue Oscar right here. Emily Blunt is here in her breakout role. She's the funniest out of the entire cast. Just laugh after laugh and she doesn't have to be obnoxious out it; what an awesome performance. Stanley Tucci adds yet another underrated performance to his resume.The film uses it's source material here and creates something short of masterful. You can watch the picture over and over again because of it's fresh and hilarious story. The director does something genius here. He applies a very gentle touch; it fits.

"It's Okay, Nothing Great","The Devil Wears Prada How important is money and success? ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines that question at full force with some comedic angles and struggles to engulf the viewer in the tale but comes up short like a blurb of research from a magazine column. ""Prada"" tells the story of Andrea, a naïve young woman wanting to be a journalist but ends up in the premier of the fashion world. Anne Hathaway portrays the ever-loving and innocent ""Andy"" who walks into the high-maintenance, sky rise building of the famous ""Runway"" magazine and lands the second-assistant position to the Editor-in-chief and starts her downward spiral into high heels, Gucci sweaters, and Coach Bags. It's there that she is tormented and verbally abused by many of her fellow co-workers and most of all by the editor of the illustrious publication, Miranda Priestly depicted by the great Meryl Streep.Andy finds herself being rudely ignored and spoken to from minute one. Through simple tasks to her ""Plain Jane"" attire she is pitiful to all around her. As a solution to her constant anguish she decides to give into the world of trend, shape and style and finds herself moving closer to Miranda and farther from friends, family, and long time boyfriend. There is where the film flaws; it's too much like a recipe and less like an original blueprint to present with admiration. It's a Cinderella story with the same exact formula we've all seen before. The three standout performances are what keeps the story moving and provides us with care and pleasure.Stanley Tucci is truly an always dependable and reliable supporting player of film making. He is ""Nigel,"" Miranda's right hand man and Andy's gateway into fashion expertise. Nigel is funny, witty and hugely charismatic. Tucci is definitely the character you could care the most about and gives the most natural performance of the cast but doesn't have that Oscar scene. Tucci's character is a bit flat in some areas and underdeveloped. Nonetheless, gives great mannerisms, fantastic quotes and exquisite chemistry with any of his co-stars. A scene about the character's background or sexuality could have sealed the deal for a nomination and unless the academy is feeling compelled to reward, which I think they aren't just yet, he'll be sitting out of the ceremony. He has one more film this year, ""Four Last Songs"" which could revive and increase his buzz by year's end so we'll have just wait.Anne Hathaway is having a hell of time riding off some ""Brokeback Mountain"" love to land her some solid leading female roles. She is the true lead of the film but there's nothing that screams Oscar about the role, it's just a solid effort to show us that she can act and is ready to leave her cutesy ""Diaries"" girl behind. Andy is a highly enjoyable character to inhabit and completely likable. How can you not? She's completely vulnerable and completely lovable. Hathaway will probably be going for a Knightley-Portman kind of year and if ""Becoming Jane"" is something great than she could find herself as the breakout star of the year like Terrence Howard last year. Andy's flaws and chink in her armor is where Hathaway truly shines. From putting on her first fashionable outfit to finding herself being relentlessly pursued by a business acquaintance, Andy is defenseless to the active world of media and glamour which leads to her character's downfall and inevitable rise up.And of course, who could forget the wonderful Meryl Streep. She is brilliant, bitchy, cruel, unkind and malicious. That's a lot for a character to expose and then suddenly surges into a character to mourn for, to feel for and feel completely sorry for. Streep is having a hell of year thus far and along with her ""A Prairie Home Companion"" buzz she will undoubtedly land in the top 5 of the supporting category. Her Miranda is clearly a supporting role and it boggles my mind how people thought otherwise. This will hopefully be the year that Ms. Meryl will land her 14th and record breaking nomination but will most likely be for ""Prairie"" and not ""Prada."" Her Yolanda is more Oscar bait and up Oscar's alley. Miranda has a lot to offer to cinema but not enough to go down in the books.The film has the a+b part of the equation but I was expecting a more capitalized ""C"" and got the anticipated ""c."" The film starts to build the gigantic climax and just leaves us somewhere between premise and resolution. Even though disappointing in some aspects, the film is quite enjoyable and you could get a few laughs but don't expect miracles to happen and new ideas to be made. The rest of the supporting cast is good with some showing some range and some just showing. Emily Blunt is a great character to look and watch as the first assistant to Miranda. Enjoy the film and expect some Globe consideration and nominations but don't hold your breath to her a ""Prada"" name or nom be called out on Oscar morning. It's all too cliché.Grade: **1/2/****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The movie is a story of a naive girl and her terrible friends who have no sympathy regarding how hard she works....,"I thought this movie was a fun watch, especially if you are with a girl who does indeed love fashion. What I hated about this movie was the best friend and her weak ass boyfriend. It seems to me that all they gave a crap about was themselves. You never come to anything anymore, you're late, guy kisses you on the cheek OMG you're a cheating ho...These people don't live in the real world. Jobs are demanding, bosses are demanding and in order to afford to live in Manhattan sacrifices have to be made. Real friends would have put up with her, been patient with her and been there for her when she eventually breaks down because working they way she did it would have happened naturally anyway. Yes they were trying to add this dimension, but considering she was working her way up the ladder a better ending would have been she keeps her status and ends up with the Mentalist who could have gotten her a real writing gig and dumps her friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Really just an excuse to show off some really great clothing,"The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy, a young reporter who lands a dream job working for Miranda at Runway, the best fashion magazine in New York. Although it is said numerous times in the movie ""a million girls would kill for this job,"" Andy is not sure that she wants it. Here lies the first flaw of many thorough the movie. We are never told how Andy, a girl with no fashion sense whatsoever has been pushed to the top of the pile of candidates for the job. Yet we have to accept this and an expected turn of events if we are to make since out of the rest of the movie. The story is so cookie cutter that an audience could probably quote the characters along with the movie having never seen it before. Prada is also filled with outrageous coincidences in order to keep the story moving. (At least 4 in one span of 5 minutes) But a predictable story line does not always make for a bad movie. This movie is worth seeing for two reasons: the cloths and Meryl Streep.This movie is a fashion designers dream come true. If you love fashion, clothing, shopping, are a girl, or like to wear any cloths at all in public then this movie's wardrobe is a feast for the eyes. Anne Hathaway changes costumes like Amadala from Star Wars in this movie except she manages to make each and every outfit look more stunning than the last. Plus there is a scene where Andy walks into a massive closet stocked full of designer cloths that will make teenage girls squeal with joy.My personal favorite reason that I recommend this movie however is the performance given by Meryl Streep. Here portrayal of the ice queen of fashion is worth 4 of the 6 stars that I gave to this movie. If you don't get to this one in theaters then at least rent it to see Streep in all of here glory. You're in for a treat.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A strangely addicting film,"I'm not into fashion, but I have seen this movie multiple times and I enjoy each time as if I'd just seen it for the first time.I think the concept of this film is great. Runway. A fashion magazine and - for millions around the world - a lifestyle.I'm going to say this review has no spoilers, because it's 14 years old and you should have seen it by now, but if you're about to read my review having not seen the film, I may give away bits, but my review won't spoil the film.Meryl Streep plays the fashion guru, Miranda, the one everyone looks up to, and the one everyone aims to satisfy. She's the type of person that people feel rewarded when she acknowledges, agrees, or let alone speaks with them. She can be hard-nosed, unforgiving, and downright rude, but with that comes a lifetime of knowledge that translates to notoriety, success. She's been there, done that, knows all, and she's not dated. People look up to her and it's because they want to be like her; to be in her presence, maybe get a crumb.Stanley Tucci has played an array of characters in his lifetime, but he seems to be right at home in his role. I don't know if he's gay in real life, or if he understands what women want, but I thought he was perfect as Miranda's puppet. The guy who knows all, does all, but never quite gets the recognition he deserves.There are a couple different scenes where Anne Hathaway (aka Andy) gets some life lessons in her short career. They're actually very interesting scenes. In the first, Miranda lectures her about the history of fashion and how more relevant her perceived plain attire is. Andy acts like this rebellious temp who's above all this fashion stuff, until Miranda puts her in her place. Later we see Andy seeking support from Nigel (Tucci), but he's not having it. He tells it like it is, grow up, this is the world we live in, and it's a lesson for everyone getting out there in the world. Andy learns in that moment that it's make or break time. She's either going to quit with her tail between her legs, or she's going to make it happen. So she does it, she changes, because she has this desire to win, to please Miranda, to succeed. I think it's a trait inside everyone, that we're driven to succeed. Like that Geico commercial, everyone wants more. Well, maybe not everyone, but most people want to be rewarded for a job well done, whether that be given more responsibility (to feel important/rewarded) or to get a raise.Anyway, I think there are life lessons in The Devil Wears Prada. It's a movie about learning who you are in this world.All that aside, I think there are some great performances and the story is compelling, to the point where a guy like me that doesn't give a hoot about fashion, has seen this movie multiple times and I really love it.The Academy has all these rules, about how many can be nominated in each category and such. I wish they'd wing it each year and nominate those that are worthy instead of ""he didn't quite make the cut"". Tucci surely could have been nominated for best supporting actor. Anne could have been nominated. I'm glad Streep was nominated and she could have won and nobody would have bat an eye lash. ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
tired clichés about women in business,"Yes, an entertaining bit of fluff and Meryl Streep was great, but after hearing such rave reviews, I expected more. Not only are the characters stereotypes and the plot predictable, but in a way that is irritating to real career women. Powerful women are vilified while sweetness and innocence win out. When are we going to see happy powerful women, and young women who demand that their friends and boyfriends support their career choices? The story also assumes that in some fairytale land one will have a great career without ever having to kiss up to one's boss, dress for success, miss family events, or play office politics. Any other working moms find that annoying? Or maybe that is why so many people like this movie- women, more so than men, want to believe that we can make everyone happy, have a rewarding career, and stay sweet forever. If that doesn't make you puke, you will love this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Surprisingly Cerebral Experience- But not For Children!!!,"When I first saw this movie I wasn't sure whether to love it or hate it.The movie of course is fun with delightful outfits for the girls and lots of eye candy (in particular Anne Hathaway) for the guys. Both Streep and Hathaway deliver some of the better performances of the year and the supporting cast is great as well. The make up artists are fantastic as well, doing a great job subtly changing Hathaway as she ascends through the fashion world.The writing and/or editing could have done a better to flesh out Anne Hathaway's Andy with particular focus on her relationship with both her family and friends. Also at times, the film comes across as cartoon-like, not just with certain characters, which is probably intended, but also with the cinematography of New York and Paris.But none of this disturbed me as much as the way Anne Hathaway's Andy develops. In the movie she takes many ethically questionable actions, many of them in a casual enough manner to be missed by most of the audience. While there is an ultimate and perhaps predictable conclusion to her actions, I felt utterly dissatisfied about the consequences of her actions. Perhaps because of this I was both drawn to and repulsed by her character. However in the end, these dichotomies may be the strongest feature of the movie, as it is thought-provoking. Since that what good movies are supposed to do, I give it high marks.A warning should be given to parents of the children and young adults that will be drawn to this movie. As mentioned before, Andy makes many questionable ethical judgments and really few of these are explored to any kind of consequences. Younger member of the audience- especially ""young"" women (this likely includes any women under 25)- will have trouble identifying much less understanding, what is wrong about her choices. I'd therefore recommend any parent watch it with or before their children do.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"No, no, no!! This is NOT a good film!","I was intrigued by the trailer, and the fact that some of my cinema junkie friends had said it was worth a look. I am so glad I didn't spend my hard-earned cash on a cinema ticket but saw it on DVD.It is mind-bendingly dull, the characters (and the acting) are wooden and two-dimensional. It says nothing of note, and - shock! horror! - it's just NOT funny! Great things were said about Streep's portrayal of Miranda Priestley, the bitch-editor from Hell, but her performance was repetitive and frankly, dull. The most that can be said about Streep is that the role is far removed from anything she's played before - and that's all the news that's fit to print about that as far as I'm concerned. She's an actor - that's what they do!! Act! God forbid anyone should get an Oscar for playing the same role over and over again (no, that could never happen).Anne Hathaway, the unconvincing innocent, struggled to act; I may forgive her because she has a risible script to work with and seemingly no direction. The story was implausible and yes, that word again - dull. Her character, Andy, was in need of a good slap on more than one occasion just to get some life into the bones.The best thing about this movie was the game I invented to while away the time until it had finished. It's called 'Spot the Product Placement' and I think I won with over 45 incidences and that's not counting the shoes....Truly, a waste of time and money. Zoolander's the movie that says most about the fashion industry, and guess what? That's funny.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Once again Meryl Streep is wonderful.,"Does Meryl Streep ever STOP being amazing? She was so convincing as the wicked Miranda Priestley that I just wanted to go on screen and slap her. That's when you know she's doing her job so well. This movie was fun to watch because of her performance. I think she will definitely be taking home an award. Anne Hathaway was great in her role as Andy Sachs as well. It's fun to watch her go through the transformation from sloppy to chic.

Worth seeing if you like this kind of movie,"The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie and worth seeing. There are things I wish they had done differently but the production values were very good, the picture was unusually sharp and clear, the soundtrack wasn't piercing, and it wasn't crude or misogynist. Adrian Grenier is in it. He has a supporting role but appears periodically throughout the movie. He plays the main character's loving, down to earth boyfriend. He has a three day growth of beard throughout and bushy eyebrows, but otherwise looks handsome. I'd say his acting ranges from very good to o.k.The director is fascinated with Meryl Streep and her character; in fact it's a Meryl-centric production. I'm not as fascinated as he is; I would have liked to see more of Adrian and I don't think I'm alone. There were a lot of things that could have been done with regard to that. I mean, this is a chick flick. Instead this movie will go down in history as one of the most loving, detailed depictions of an aging ice queen ever made. The movie is almost trying to kiss Anna Wintour's and Vogue's but in a way. I didn't find that to be necessary.There is plenty of fashion and many elegant settings. A lot of money was spent. The movie has also been very well promoted and supported, which is unusual for a ""chick flick"" these days. I'm glad of that. If the studios did a better job of catering to them, females and grown ups would come back to the theaters. I'm glad the people at this studio realize that. I look forward to seeing what they do next.NOTE TO SENSITIVE PEOPLE AND PARENTS: There's nothing bad in this movie. It is rated PG-13 but it could even be rated PG or a G. There's less swearing than you will hear in line to get your tickets. There's no sex or nudity. You can tell some characters have had or will have sex but you really don't see anything of it at all. There's no violence. As I said earlier, the soundtrack was less noisy and obtrusive than usual and I'm thankful for that.NOTE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MOVIES AND REAL LIFE: In this movie, and a lot of movies, there is a clear cut choice between doing something snotty and superficial and following a path with heart and integrity. A lot of teenage movies present this dilemma as well. My experience is that life hardly ever plays out that way.I've written for magazines and am familiar with the publishing industry. First of all, to use this specific industry as an example, every day there are fewer publications to write for, of any type. The ones that remain are often getting eaten up by corporations and or having to downsize personnel, so even the idea of having a job at a publication is semi-mythical. Muckraking newspapers such as the one appearing in this movie are almost non-existent. People that work at alternative newspapers are often cranky, drug-addicted, and far from reasonable. Wages at such enterprises can be ridiculous and payment for freelance writers is often far less than minimum wage. Exploitation and mistreatment of writers is common at many publications, perhaps especially idealistic ones.High fashion magazines have just as much to answer for. They cause anorexia and self-loathing in women, exploit hopeful young people, prostitute themselves to their advertisers, and recycle the same tired articles over and over again. For all that, your chance of ever getting a job at one of them is virtually non-existent.Other industries have plenty of problems too. A business that espouses high ideals might have a bunch of maladjusted, difficult people running it and be a perfectly miserable place to work. Poverty sucks no matter how you slice it. You have a few years when you are young when it's o.k. but after that it grinds you down.I'm not trying to tell anyone to lose their idealism, I just think that these movies collectively create a false picture of reality for young people. I can't tell you what to do, just don't go looking for the muckraking newspaper in this movie to apply for a job; it would have been shut down twenty years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Meryl Streep's Best Performance,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" starts off in similar fashion to Anne Hathaway's earlier role in ""The Princess Diaries"": She is the ""ugly duckling"" who eventually becomes a swan, mentored by Julie Andrews in ""Diaries"" and Meryl Streep in ""Prada."" But that's where the similarities end. Julie Andrews was a bit stern but ultimately a warm and caring grandmother in ""Princess Diaries."" In ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" Meryl Streep--playing a version of real-life ""Vogue"" editor Anna Wintour--is as cold and haughty as we've ever seen her. Streep received an Oscar nomination for the role, and won a Golden Globe, and many film critics consider this to be the greatest performance.Freshly graduated from Northwestern University where she edited the daily school newspaper, Hathaway's ""Andy"" (Andrea) turns down law school admissions to try journalism in New York City. A fashion magazine isn't at all what she's looking for, but it's the one place where she is able to talk herself into a job. She is the assistant to the assistant to Streep, with a young Emily Blunt in an excellent comedic turn as the ""first assistant."" This is a movie about workplace mentorship and career decisions, sometimes deliciously funny, and sometimes almost horrifying. Andy makes a lot of mistakes at first--it's almost impossible to ever please Meryl Streep here--but her toughness and smarts eventually start to shine through, with a little help from the magazine's art director, played by Stanley Tucci, who, among other things, helps Andy learn to dress for the industry that now employs her.Streep publicly called this her ""last ever"" effort at method acting. She stayed in character as the unpleasant editor even when not filming, and was unable to form any friendships with the other members of the cast, or, for that matter, have any fun at all during the filming. When not on set, she stayed in her trailer, depressed. We certainly benefit though, from a movie that is very good, and ultimately very satisfying.As an interesting side note, most ""real world"" designers and models declined to appear in the film, for fear of alienating Anna Wintour. They did, however, allow their clothes to be used, ironically giving the movie some of the most expensive costumes in film history. As to Anna Wintour, she later said she liked the film and Streep's performance! Who'd have guessed?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A must see ""The Devil Wears Prada""","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is an insiders look at the world of fashion magazines and its inner-workings in the industry. Andrea Sachs (Hathaway) is a newly graduated journalist, fresh out of college who takes an internship at Runway magazine under the editor-and-chief, Miranda Priestly (Streep). Runway magazine is a world that Andrea finds that she is not ready for.Stanley Tucci (""The Terminal"") stars as Nigel, Runway's stylist and friend to Andrea, who helps her to dress more professionally and be noticed by Miranda. A stressful job and home life almost ruin Andrea's life, to the point that she realizes, while in Paris, that the job is not for her, so she walks away from it all. However, Miranda holds high regard for Andrea, even as she quits.Meryl Streep was wonderful as the cruel Miranda Priestly, and she somewhat resembles Cruella De Vil, and Anne Hathaway was a bit mediocre in her part.

"As Glossy as a Magazine, and About as Substantive","A slick entertainment with a plot someone phoned in and a fairy tale ending in which every conceivable loose end is tied up as neatly and happily as your average network sitcom. I had a lot of fun with the movie, but my expectations were low and would have been sorely disappointed if they'd been any higher. The key to any movie like this is: ""Know what you're getting.""Meryl Streep of course gets all of the praise for this film, and indeed she is a riot. She resists the temptation to play the role of Miranda Priestley as a gross caricature, and instead decides to play her as a real person, which gives the movie dimensions it wouldn't have had otherwise. The character of Miranda would have been too unbearable to be fun if someone else had played her, but Streep knows how to deliver a nasty line while letting us know she's in on the joke, and her character is by far the best thing about the movie.Stanley Tucci, that unsung character actor, is also terrific as Nigel, Anne Hathaway's Henry Higgins. Is there anything this guy can't do?""The Devil Wears Prada"" sends an obligatory message about staying true to yourself and your priorities in life, a message the film itself undermines by making the world within the fashion magazine office seem more interesting and glamorous than anything going on outside of it.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Flat as the pages of a fashion magazine,"If you like watching a beautiful woman wearing beautiful clothes, see this movie. If you like acting, see another Meryl Streep or Stanley Tucci film, preferably one that is well enough written to let the actors do their jobs. The attempt to develop a ""Friends""-like energy among Andy's young friends stalled totally, and their characters never passed the first-draft/first-reading level of development--a tragic waste of the talents of an actress like Tracie Thoms. The secondary love interest (Simon Baker) didn't make us feel she should be attracted to him, while the boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) made us wonder why she took up with him in the first place. Meanwhile, we only get a vague impression of the tension between Andy's growing respect and even sympathy for her boss and her horror at the costs of following Miranda's footsteps. Streep and Tucci deliver in spades, of course, but the only bright light among the younger actors was Emily Blunt, who plays her role as the suffering-servant senior assistant with a nice comic touch.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Prada"" different  to the book, but  a good movie nevertheless.","I have to disagree with blackbird2379 about the movie being faithful to the book. In the book Andy did not live with her boyfriend, she shared an apartment with Lilly, her childhood friend. The reason Andy goes to Paris is because Emily has mono and is too sick to go. No question of Andy being chosen over Emily. Whilst in Paris, Andy learns that Lilly has been in a serious car accident and Andy's parents and her boyfriend (Alex in the book) ask her on the phone when she will be returning to visit Lilly who is in hospital in a coma. When she tells Miranda about her friend, Miranda congratulates her on choosing to stay in Paris, rather than returning to the States. This does not sit well with Andy and she tells Miranda in no uncertain terms what she can do, and leaves for home.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie, except that when Miranda and Andy were in the car together, I could not hear what Miranda was saying.

A series of humiliations...before and after the makeover,"Wide-eyed college graduate in NYC, a journalism major who dresses in old-lady skirts and lumpy sweaters, applies for a second assistant's job at the leading fashion magazine, Runway; she (improbably) gets the position, but soon finds working for the editor-in-chief, a notorious dragon lady, to be taking a toll on the rest of her life. Lauren Weisberger's novel becomes super-slick, chic and commercial take on the modern working woman's woes. Whether or not is mirrors reality (or, indeed, any actual person's day-to-day life in the Big Apple) is up for conjecture, however the performances by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep are first-rate (Stanley Tucci is also excellent, and nicely not-flaming, as a fashion consultant).

Great Camera Work,"I had some lag time yesterday, so I snuck over to the movie house to watch ""The Devil Wears Prada."" It must be its third week already here and the theater was not empty that afternoon, to its credit. It has some innovative camera-work. The opening sequence of Anne Hathaway and other girls preparing to go to work looked great. The sequence of Anne Hathway wearing all these different designer clothes while weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic on the way to her office was also very nicely shot. Using Anne Hathaway for this film made it feel like another Princess Diaries sequel at times, admittedly.Meryl Streep, what can I say, another good performance, as usual. This character, she has done something like this before, hasn't she? It feels familiar...or have we simply watched her so many times?Overall, not a waste of time. Obviously geared more for a female audience, who I am sure would love to have those dresses, bags and accessories for themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
High Camp,Meryl Streep is a delightful sociopath in this film and Anne Hathaway is right on target in her portrayal of the loyal assistant.

Because "" the devil wears Prada"" Miranda had her perfect philosophy against her job.I agree with her thinking of job that all is the result, not the process. That's exact her indication. In the business scene,the progress and the accident don't matter. It works in only resumes. This story depicted 'the progress' mainly, but, in the ending scene, Andrea smiled, ""Even though the result is same, the progress is so different.""

"Above average chick flick with humor, fashion and great acting.","An enjoyable chick flick elevated by some great performances, lots of fashion sense, and common themes we can all identify with: balancing work and social life, trying to get ahead without sacrificing your morals, and the battle of pursuing a dream but not alienating family and friends.Meryl Streep was admirably awful, not her acting but her character. If this is an insight into the fashion industry, I certainly don't want to be a part of it. On the flip side, it's an intriguing world we get to see a glimpse of without being overwhelmed by insider-only lingo. Anne Hathaway also does well at creating a sympathetic character we can cheer for, even though we're pretty sure she's going to somehow win everybody over.This movie is like popcorn... easy and fun to eat, not too heavy but with good flavor. It definitely is above average in the chick flick genre, and I believe its appeal will be wider because of the humor and smarts. There's enough for the guys to enjoy with their gals, and I also appreciated it being a fairly clean movie.

Don't set your hopes high!,"I expected this film to be like a comedy like Monster in law, where 2 female protagonists fight at first because of their different views, but as the time progresses, these two make up. But instead, it's a really strange movie, where Andy (Anne Hathaway) wanted to be a journalist, to achieve her dreams and succeed, she decided to work for a very strict boss Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep). Yes! It was hard for her, especially due to the fact that Andy wasn't a huge fan of the Runway fashion magazine. But she found a way to impress her boss, by dressing up the way Miranda wanted. She gets higher salary and even a fashion trip to Paris. But loses her boyfriend. Thus making her life sad. I can see how this movie challenges Andy by making her choose between close people and career and she decides to persue her dreams.I must say the acting is great! It makes all characters feel real, like it's something that is down to Earth. No over acting or under acting, just calm expressions. I also liked the conflicts, for example Emily being in a car accident or Jacqueline being the new boss instead of Miranda because of her divorce and soon retirement. Sadly, despite that, it's a forgettable experience. Because, it's not a comedy, I didn't laugh once. As for drama, it's a bit complicated, but it wasn't too thought provoking, at least for me.

Here you have these shallow people and this person who goes to work for a horrible boss and wants to please her. Firstly, I wouldn't have taken such a role but I think I probably would have lasted about 5 minutes before telling her to shove the job up her a**e! The people are all so plastic and shallow that it is hard to see anything in them to like. I guess there are people who are attracted to this sort of industry and probably loved the movie as a result but I just didn't get it. I think it is because I can't see how anyone could put up with these cardboard cut outs. There is a scene where they are discussing what colour something is and then the Meryl Streep character enlightens a slightly bemused Hathaway that it was her who bought this new colour in fashion to the world's attention. I mean, give the women a Noble Prize for her contribution to the world.The whole thing is a pointless episode in shallowness.I have given it three stars because the acting (particularly Streep) is pretty good and the film is well shot.

Meryl's Still Got  It!,"After 30 years, Meryl Streep shows that she is still the Queen of the films. This film based on the novel about a young girl played by up and coming Anne Hathaway as a college graduate, Andrea, who has high aspirations in the journalism field. She accepts an assistant job to the dragon lady known as Miranda Priestley who resembles more Leona Helmsley in personality. She is the editor and power broker in the fashion industry of Runway magazine. Think of it as Cosmo or Vogue. As Miranda, Streep steals the scenes. She can make her vicious, complicated, and then vulnerable. She earned an Oscar nomination (her 15th) so far. Despite the film having more youthful roles for Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway, Streep shows that she's tops and why. I loved the scene where Andy runs to Smith and Wollensky's restaurant and I have eaten there and have their steak sauce. It's an excellent restaurant. I love the New York City scenery as well. I was disappointed with the scripting of the film. I thought they could have done better and more. Still I love Stanley Tucci as Nigel and the film is entertaining but not much more.

a guilty pleasure - in the best sense,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a fish out of water comedy based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger whose experiences at ""Vogue"" Magazine inspired her bestseller. The film follows aspiring journalist Andy Sachs into the offices of ""Runway"" magazine, as she stumbles into the ill-fitting shoes of the second assistant to tyrannical editor Miranda Priestly. Andy has no intention of being outdone by this job which she initially looks down upon, but as the story rolls along she begins to sell out her dreams, spending every waking hour on call for her new boss and the inevitable transformation that brings.Anne Hathaway brings certain clumsiness to the role of Andy that makes the tones of ""Pollyanna"" that much easier to spot. As endearing her characterization is, her performance is frequently overshadowed by Emily Blunt, who plays Miranda's bitter, British, first assistant. Of course neither can hold a candle to Meryl Streep's flawless take on Miranda, the devil in the title. The film makes for great fun and good comedy with just a little bite thanks to its sharp dialogue and strong casting. There are many missed opportunities to offer a more scathing statement on the fashion industry, but its focus on vain people with self-importance issues does hit several high notes.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fantastic film...that's all,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one of those movies that some people will watch and come to love, while others may watch it unsatisfied. That's because despite some of the outrageous humour regarding the demands of the devilish diva Miranda Priestly (portrayed by Meryl Streep), the movie actually has a lot of subtleties in its tone and overall message. And believe me, there's a message. Many, in fact.Anne Hathaway is generally likable and believable in her role as Andy Sachs, an aspiring journalist in New York City, who becomes the assistant to a high maintenance editor-in-chief of America's hottest fashion magazine. She is outshined, however, by the brilliant Emily Blunt, who is sassy and hysterical in the snooty role of Emily who easily becomes many viewer's favourite character. We also have Stanley Tucci convincingly playing another co-worker along with Andy and Emily, managing to make him likable despite a few petty insults he makes towards our protagonist near the beginning.Then comes Meryl as Miranda. Words cannot describe how much you'll adore this character. She is oozes class, elegance, and beauty in a unique way. Streep immediately IS the character and remains in character in every second of screen time. She never even loses the slight sneer in the upper-lip. Her character is intimidating in a quiet, realistic way that is beyond amazing. The woman is a goddess in this film and that cannot be argued.Throughout the course of the film, we see many layers to many characters working at this fashion magazine. We see the shift in priorities as Andy struggles to maintain her personal life while making the climb up the corporate ladder. It's extremely interesting to watch a romantic comedy that doesn't focus on romance but instead relies on the relationship between a woman and her job, and the women she works with. The cast is strong, the material is fun and fresh, and the film is just an all-around great time! Watch it and be prepared to watch it again, because the fashion is fabulous, as are Streep and Blunt in ""The Devil Wears Prada""!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A witty and clever comedy,"Andy Sachs has just graduated from college. She hopes to land a job as a journalist for a popular magazine. But instead of becoming a writer for a magazine, she becomes the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief for a top-notch fashion magazine called Runway.Miranda, a ruthless and cynical woman, dominates the fashion world. She makes outrageous demands that have to be carried out immediately and within time limits, otherwise the people in charge of running the errands could be fired.She is very outspoken and honest and not afraid to speak the truth about what she thinks about someone. Andy, however, puts up with the unconventional and humiliating requests from Miranda because, she is told, if she lasts a year in the position she could land any job she wants, even the journalistic one she desperately wants.As Andy adjusts to the position, she starts to change. From a young woman with no sense of fashion who always had time for her family and friends, Andy becomes career obsessed as she pays more attention to her job than anything else.Ultimately Andy realizes that she must make a choice between her family and her friends and the job she has worked so hard for, as she starts to become more and more like the woman she despises working for.The film is witty, funny and clever. There is not much you can't like about it. The characters are great, with the actors delivering solid performances. Meryl Streep portrays Miranda brilliantly as the wicked person she is and Anne Hathaway is as sweet as ever as Andy Sachs.

Aside from the underdeveloped main character and an inconsistent romantic subplot it was building up to something unique before it failed to deliver it.,"First I'll start praising what the movie does well: Meryl Streep's ruthless character is obviously the highlight of the movie, all the characters have great performances and their character motivations are consistent throughout the film except that of the main protagonist, which is exactly where the movie falls down to me.What makes cakes great is the harmonic symbiosis between the different elements that conform it. If this movie was a cake, it delivers a great top and base layer that are the flashy, makeover, glamour-life aspects which are essential to a fashion movie; but misses the butter icing, the jam and the decorations in regards to comedy, romance, life lessons and realistic character arcs that similar ""rom-coms""-like movies like this normally also have. Movies from the same writer like ""Morning Glory"" or others like ""The Intern (2015)"" also starring Anne Hathaway which, while not having the same main plot or characters, the themes and spirit are similar featuring career-focused people ruining their personal life and interacting with experienced professionals played by famous celebrities.To put it simpler, I get it. I get what the purpose of the whole backdrop of the fashion scene and how tough, superficial and demanding it is. But honestly, I wanted to watch this movie for the career angle because it was listed in many ""Top 10 movies about job seekers and uplifting movies"". And for the first half the movie had something different going on from the rest of the ""genre"" which was the angle of starting to work in a business as an intern/assistant of sorts while working your way up to your dream job and, in the process, finding an interest in the business you thought was only temporary.However, the movie fails to deliver that feeling. And it is essentially due to our main vessel, Anne Hathaway's poorly written character. It baffles me how so many actors featured in this movie have great performances and character arcs and the main protagonist might have the worst one. Not in terms of progression but in terms of consistency. Let's be honest, these movies are predictable, there's so much you can do in a rom-com-esque genre like this and some try to do something different and that should be commended, but the choices she makes here make no sense. There is such a lack of consistency in her actions that her choices and reactions seem unnatural to that of a real person in romantic, career and friendship-related situations.The change from a ""dorky"" selfless smart girl to a career-focused glossy self-centered one is too sudden to be believable. You mean to tell me the girl which didn't care about fashion at the beginning suddenly goes to a fashion show in Paris and has her jaw dropped emoting a found a passion for it? Perhaps, but we as the audience have not seen or felt it through her actions. She began as this strong opinionated person who knew what she wanted and didn't care about fashion to making every selfish fashion-oriented decision ever possible. You could attribute this to the theme of how the job and industry ""consumed"" her and how she was meant to realise all the wrong things she was doing, however it is so inconsistent to her character that it makes you wonder if you missed something. It's weird to say it but it almost seemed as there were some montage scenes missing for how underdeveloped it looked.I don't want to get into spoilers, but the romantic subplot is so cliche and unrealistic that it is damaging to the protagonist integrity. If Anne Hathaway's character was supposed to be so smart and strong-willed, it doesn't really show. Her heart doesn't break when it is supposed to, she doesn't show that she cares about how she wronged her family and her friends after she realised the wrong things she did. And the reason is that it's just underdeveloped. There are so many scenes missing: apologizing, crying, frustration scenes. The runtime limits this movie so heavily, and I'm pretty sure all these underdeveloped themes are well fleshed out on the novel but here they are replaced by over the top scenes that may not even be that essential to the plot.The comedy is not nearly as funny as it could have been in the frame given. So many other fashion movies have provided some of the best makeover scenes and flashy over the top but charming humorous scenes yet here there are no where to be found. As mentioned previously, even movies like Morning Glory and The Intern have better comedic timing and humorous scenarios that exploit the setting and situations the characters are put in, but it's unfortunate how this film doesn't exploit the fashion-scene (which by itself is already over the top) and still manages to be more praised than the other two. Perhaps this movie was the genre pioneer for the other two which came after this one, but that doesn't excuse it from its narrative mistakes.IN CONCLUSION, it should have been more self-aware and push the dramatic and comedic aspects a bit further. I was hoping to see a movie about the perils of a recently graduated girl getting an unsuiting temporary job (even though it is a highly-demanded job for a very important company in NYC, which is odd she would get hired) but finding herself learning the positive aspects of the competitive corporate world yet the themes taken from the fashion scene did not aid her development, the romantic subplot in ALL its parts was inconsistent and unrealistic not to mention unsatisfying to say the least; and the overall message and life lessons were either confusing due to their mutual exclusion or not fulfilling enough to fit the protagonist's personality. It's unfortunate because all the elements presented had a lot of potential and could have been very entertaining to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
High Heels and High Stakes,"The Devil Wears Prada, directed by David Frankel, is a captivating cinematic exploration of the relentless pursuit of success and the sacrifices it often demands. The film follows the story of Andrea Sachs, played by the talented Anne Hathaway, a young and ambitious journalist who lands a job as the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the ruthless and intimidating editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, brilliantly portrayed by the incomparable Meryl Streep.The central theme of the film revolves around the power of the fashion industry and its ability to transform individuals, both physically and mentally. As Andy navigates the cutthroat world of high-fashion, she is forced to confront the question of how far she is willing to go to achieve her dreams, even if it means compromising her values and alienating her loved ones.Miranda Priestley, the film's antagonist, serves as the embodiment of the unforgiving nature of the industry. Her unwavering dedication to perfection and her relentless drive to maintain her position as the most influential figure in the fashion world create a constant source of tension and conflict for Andy.As Andy becomes a polished and sophisticated fashionista, the film highlights the emotional and psychological impact of her transformation. The movie's exploration of the fashion industry's ruthless culture is similar to other films that tackle related themes, like Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd, which examines the corrupting influence of power and fame.The film's use of lighting and camera angles is particularly noteworthy, as it serves to reinforce the power dynamics between Miranda and Andy. The dim, shadowy lighting in Miranda's office creates a sense of unease and tension, while the bright, airy spaces of the Runway offices convey a sense of glamour and prestige.The film's use of motifs, such as Miranda Priestly's renowned monologue on the subtle nuances of the color ""cerulean blue,"" powerfully highlights the fashion industry's fixation on minute details and its remarkable ability to shape and influence cultural trends. This insightful scene underscores the industry's uncanny knack for manipulating consumer perceptions and dictating what is deemed fashionable, demonstrating its far-reaching impact on societal norms and individual choices.The Devil Wears Prada is a thought-provoking film that explores the sacrifices one must make to succeed in the high-stakes fashion industry. Its themes of power, ambition, and personal integrity resonate with audiences, making it a compelling commentary on the complexities of the modern workplace.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There are moments for Andy to see her boss's private face but these are never exploited. I've worked for hard people and trust me, at weekends at home they're totally different people. Andy's boyfriend is such a complete dork he's totally laughable. She'd ditch that guy the second she got that amazing job and be doing coke and sleeping around just the way we should see the Emily Blunt character doing - again where's her private side? The one moment when we think - at last Andy's going to be nasty (hooray!) it's totally fudged.

Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway are two of my favorite actresses, and I, like Prada's Andy, work as a personal assistant (though my boss is much easier to work for than Miranda).However, I have a little rule for myself: if I am going to be seeing a movie based on a best-selling novel, I must also read the book. So, I did. And it was amazing. That said, I should have seen the movie first... then maybe I could have enjoyed it.Streep and Hathaway gave amazing performances, but the movie simply did not compare to the book. I'm sure the movie is pretty good for those who have not yet read the book.Bottom line: read the book (it's a REALLY enjoyable, can't-put-it-down read), but make sure you see the movie first so that you won't feel you wasted your $10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A Surprisingly Enjoyable Chick Flick,","The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific cast.I really thought this was going to be extremely mediocre but I just decided to watch it when I saw it on television and there was nothing else on,and it was surprisingly much better than I expected,Anne Hathaway delivered a great performance and was really able to make you care about her character,also Meryl Streep was very good of course,her character is mean but somewhat likable in a strange way and was nothing like any character she has played previously.Its certainly nothing outstanding,but Devil Wears Prada is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy if you ever see it on television.An aspiring journalist lands a sought after job at a fashion magazine, but her strict new boss puts her in her place.Best Performance: Anne Hathaway Worst Performance: Simon Baker",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A high-class film.,"Andy, a young graduate aspiring to be a journalist, comes to New York and becomes an assistant to one of the city's biggest magazine editors, the ruthless and cynical Miranda Priestly.Personally, I'm not a fan of ""romantic comedy"" or comedy films in general but this film is an exception. I love this film, it's like therapy for me - I continue to reflect on the movie's lessons long after the laughs have diminished because they are sound, relevant and conveyed by the talents of actors who offer legitimate stakes in the material. If you have ever held an office job, you probably have encountered the ""boss from hell"" and Streep manages to make the character both amusing, scary and touching (sometimes simultaneously). She alone makes the film worth seeing.I haven't seen a film of this genre come along that is as enjoyable. It's smartly directed with a witty script and superb performances from Streep and Hathaway.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fashionably Unforgettable,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a film that effortlessly marries style with substance, thanks to the unparalleled prowess of Meryl Streep. As Miranda Priestly, Streep delivers a performance that is both ice-cold and blazingly intense, capturing the essence of a fashion world doyenne with every nuanced glance and meticulously delivered line.The film, directed by David Frankel, is a delightful romp through the high-stakes world of fashion publishing. It tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a young journalist who lands the job ""a million girls would kill for,"" working as an assistant to the notorious editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Miranda Priestly. What unfolds is a tale of transformation, ambition, and the price of success in an industry that is as cutthroat as it is glamorous.Streep's portrayal of Priestly is nothing short of iconic. She embodies the role with a grace and severity that is mesmerizing to watch. Her method acting approach, although challenging for her, resulted in a character that is both formidable and surprisingly human. Streep's Priestly is a woman who wields her power with an iron fist in a velvet glove, demanding excellence and settling for nothing less.The film received widespread acclaim, particularly for Streep's performance, which earned her numerous awards and nominations. Her ability to convey the intricate layers of Priestly's character-her unyielding standards, her vulnerability, and her rare moments of softness-cements Streep's status as one of the finest actors of her generation.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a testament to the power of great acting. Streep's performance is a masterclass in character development, and it elevates the film from a simple comedy-drama to a compelling study of power dynamics and personal growth. It's a film that stays with you, long after the credits roll, and much of that staying power is owed to Meryl Streep's always amazing acting. That's all.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Surprisingly subdued, but unremarkably so.","The Devil Wears Prada has always been claimed one of those 'good' chick-flicks, in a crowd with films like Mean Girls where they appeal to a broader audience. I was willing to give it a go since I liked the cast but unfortunately the film treads so lightly that it doesn't seem to break free of average. Granted, it doesn't tend to make any mistakes that other chick-flicks in its mould would do, and to call it a chick-flick is misleading as that implicates romance and comedy. It has them, but in short supply. It's a drama, and that's fine though unexpected on my behalf, but it doesn't seem to have much drama to it either. Its strongest item in its wardrobe is the reliable and colourful production and costume design. Streep, Hathaway and Tucci are good and effortless but unremarkable even at their best. Perhaps I was expecting something else but The Devil Wears Prada is merely solid and disappointedly subdued as it's not insightful or personally identifiable enough to work as a straight drama. At least it's not as juvenile as it could be.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect for when you want something light yet meaningful,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a smart, stylish film that blends humor with a touch of drama, set against the backdrop of the high-pressure fashion industry. Meryl Streep is magnetic as the commanding Miranda Priestly, delivering a performance that's both intimidating and captivating, while Anne Hathaway shines as the relatable protagonist navigating the chaos of her new role. The movie's greatest strength lies in its ability to make you reflect on the sacrifices we make in pursuit of success and whether they're truly worth it.The pacing is well-done, keeping you invested without dragging, and the supporting cast, especially Emily Blunt, adds layers of wit and charm. What stands out is the film's subtle commentary on personal growth, ambition, and staying true to what really matters, all wrapped in sharp dialogue and stunning visuals. It never feels preachy but leaves you thinking about how much of yourself you're willing to compromise to fit into someone else's definition of success.While it doesn't dive too deeply into its themes and follows some predictable beats, the movie more than makes up for it with its entertainment value and heartfelt moments. It's a fun, engaging watch with enough substance to leave a lasting impression. Perfect for when you want something light yet meaningful.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best movie that i have seen in a long time,"The Devil Wears Prada was wonderful. The movie was put together very well, i really give it to the costume designer for making all those outfits. Anne Hathaway just blew me away as (Andrea) and Meryl Streep character was played very well... The movie showed how the fashion industry really is and let the audience see that. The director gave us what we wanted and we just came back for more. The movie is in my top 5 , You should sou t in get it because it just that good.""A naive young woman comes to New York and scores a job as the assistant to one of the city's biggest magazine editors, the ruthless and cynical Miranda Priestly""Andrea (Anne Hathaway) at first does not want to do the job. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)Character took a chance on her. Things were not going good at first but as scene went on you could see the changes. the ending in my opinion could have been better but all in all the movie was wonderful for me .",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I can't wait to watch it again!,"This film is about a young graduate (Anne Hathaway) who stumbles across a job as the assistant to the Chief Editor of a prominent fashion magazine. After the poor start with her boss, played by Meryl Streep, Hathaway learns to reinvent herself and climb higher and higher up the ladder, and in the process alienates herself from her past, family and friends.Meryl Streep is great as usual. She gives a fine performance as a very confident and powerful businesswoman. There is a scene in which she is weak and vulnerable, and she also handles that well.Stanley Tucci is also great. He plays a camp man who is very important in the magazine. His campness is so natural that for a while I thought he was gay! Anne Hathaway is lovable and adorable. It is amazing how she shot to stardom in just a few movies, and I can see why! The script is great, the dialog is witty, and the movie is fast paced and never leaves you bored. The soundtrack is upbeat and relevant, and even appropriately including the material girl Madonna's recent song! The make up is amazing as well. After seeing Meryl Streep looking very dejected and vulnerable in one scene, she becomes strong and confident again. I can't help but notice that apart from acting skills, the make up department helps a lot in this transition too.I laughed out so many times during the movie as there were so many subtle jokes. It does not rely on any toilet humour or obscenities to make viewers laugh, which is very refreshing to have.I definitely recommend this film, and I can't wait to watch it again!",,Anonymous,Comedy
No more than watchable,This movie had a stellar cast and an interesting premise and then .... nothing of interest happened.It's probably the subject matter but there wasn't one single character who I gave a single damn about.The only plus sides are Meryl Streep's performance and some of Stanley Tucci's catty asides but apart from that the movie delivered very little.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

By the end of the movie you will be so in awe of her acting - the way she just got into the skin of the character & each gesture & nuance spells excellence - A treat to watch.Others have a done a good job - but Meryl Streep steals the show!

Pretty good adaptation of pretty lousy book,"Yeah, I know - I'am a guy who actually read the book - fat lazy Russian who's even further from the fashion world than Anne Hathaway's character at the beginning. The only excuse - it was my wife's, and it was dull.But as for the film - it has one thing book haven't got, one and only Miranda - Meryl Streep. Her performance boosts this otherwise walk- through movie from 5 to 8 stars in my opinion. If you want a flick on fashion - go see Altman's ""Prêt-à-Porter"", which is brilliant, actually. But if you want to see the Dragon Lady herself - look nowhere else. She's just like Al Pacino in ""Devil's Advocate"" - charismatic, stylish and... complete.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Mary Tyler Moore for the new millennium,"I reluctantly went to see this film, but came away very glad I did. While in many ways very much the ""chic flick, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is more than just a pretty picture.The plot is pretty simple. Andy, a recent college graduate, manages to land a dream job as number two assistant to the editor of the top women's fashion magazine in the country. Andy, played smoothly and appealingly by Anne Hathaway, is smart, resourceful and has a kind of quiet self confidence that allows her to be good at her job, even for the most part brushing aside the highly negative comments from her coworkers, most of which center around the fact that she does not dress up to their standards. But with the help of a mentor, art director Stanley Tucci, she is able to tap into all the free clothes left around there after photo shoots and winds up looking like she stepped out of Vogue every time she steps out of the house. (Okay, that does stretch things a little, as obviously the clothes would be recognized by the other girls, who would probably whine about why they didn't get the same treatment.) The big conflict here? Andy's boss makes Mary Tyler Moore's Mister Grant look like Mother Teresa. Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, is truly the boss from hell. She is the kind of officer who gets fragged by his own men on the battlefield. But, to the film's credit, she is also portrayed as smart, exceptionally good at what she does, and a person quickly able to spot a phony a mile away.Streep gives an Academy Award winning performance here and no doubt will get a nomination. Her work is exceptional, when you consider that in her other big hit of the year, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" she plays a small time country western singer and pulls that role off with equal success.**************spoiler alert****************While the film does in fact feature lots of nifty clothes for the women to ogle, it does go more than skin deep,for Andy slowly but surely finds herself sacrificing her life to this 24-7 job she has taken on, eventually losing her live in boyfriend and most of her friends, too.And in the film's most controversial twist, she decides in the end, after watching Miranda lose her third husband in a row, that the job just isn't worth it. So, Andy symbolically throws her cell phone into a fountain and walks out -- on the limousines, the trips to Paris, the potentially big salary and the chance to rub shoulders with the rich, the famous and the well dressed.Would this happen in real life? Maybe, but probably not. And when Meryl Streep whines that if she were a man, nobody would complain about the long hours she works, she may be mouthing feminist rhetoric, but not being truthful. The fact is, lots of wives complain about the very same thing, when their husbands are the ones who are never home or always missing the kids birthday parties. The fact is, people of both genders sacrifice their personal lives to achieve success in their careers.Perhaps the biggest lesson of the film is found in Stanley Tucci's character, who is promised a major job with a new concern, only to be screwed over in the end because of Miranda's need to maneuver a rival into that job to protect her own position at the magazine.That is probably the real lesson of this film. Even if you are very good at your job and even if you do work 24-7 and sacrifice everything for your career, there is no guarantee that some superior will not screw you over, because of his or her personal agenda or maybe do it just on a whim.Unfortunately, all the pretty clothes and glamour of this film may conceal that important part of the message.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good character-driven movie ...,"I must admit, it took watching the beginning of this movie 3 times before I got interested enough to follow through to the end. Once I finally realized it was not really a comedy, the movie started to work for me.Generally stated, the story is about a recent college grad who lands a job as assistant to the head of a top fashion magazine. The funny things is, this isn't her field and her values are at odds with everything about her new job.If you think the plot sounds familiar, it is - it's been done a million times. Plus - the characters are fairly simplistic and one-dimensional.So what's so good about the movie? First, the performances for each of the characters are near perfect. They become very ""watchable"" - you want to see what they are going to do next and what's going to happen to them.The second thing that really intrigued me were the bits of information about the fashion industry - they were very nicely integrated into exchanges between the characters. If anything, you'll get a feel for how ego, tension and subjectivity can play out in a fashion magazine.As long as you know that this is really a drama (or black comedy without much comedy), you can enjoy this movie from the start.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Wears Prada - A Stylized Revelation of Workplace Dynamics and Female Ambition,"In a world where cinematically portrayed female ambition often walks a fine line between stereotype and empowerment, ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" directed by David Frankel, emerges as a nuanced exploration of the professional and personal growth journey of its protagonist, Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway). Based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger, the film navigates the high-paced and often merciless world of fashion, while also delving into the dynamics of power, fashion elitism, and the cost of success.The portrayal of Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the powerful and feared editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, is iconic, not just for Streep's impeccable performance but for the character's representation as a woman in a position of power. Priestly is often cited as a prime example of the ""boss from hell."" Still, through a lens informed by the understanding of sexual politics in cinema, her portrayal can be seen as a commentary on the challenges faced by women at the top echelons of their careers. A nuanced look reveals a character who, despite her tough demeanor, navigates a world defined by high expectations and a constant battle for respect and authority, a battle often magnified for women due to gender biases.Andy Sachs, on the other hand, represents the transformation from an idealistic, somewhat naive young woman to a determined professional, realizing the complexities of ambition and success. Her journey reflects the sexual politics of the workplace, showcasing the sacrifices and compromises women often make in pursuit of their careers. Initially disdaining the fashion industry's perceived superficiality, Andy soon understands the hard work, dedication, and passion driving it, mirroring the real-world dismissal of ""feminine"" industries as less serious or valuable.""The Devil Wears Prada"" does not shy away from depicting the sacrifices demanded by high-power careers, especially from women. The film's treatment of Andy's relationships, particularly with her boyfriend, Nate, highlights the common expectation for women to prioritize personal over professional success, a pressure less frequently applied to their male counterparts.One of the most compelling aspects of the film is its refusal to offer simple resolutions. Instead, it presents the realm of high fashion and media as a complex ecosystem with its own rules and challenges. The relationship between Andy and Miranda, fraught with tension, also carries moments of silent understanding and mutual respect, suggesting that the path to success in such competitive fields is intricate and lonely.""The Devil Wears Prada"" thus stands as a significant film that, beyond its glossy surface, offers a sharp critique of the fashion industry and, more broadly, the professional world's demands on women. It challenges viewers to look beyond clichés of female power and ambition, prompting a deeper reflection on the gender biases still pervasive in the professional realm.All in all, the film, while a vibrant and entertaining portrayal of the fashion industry, serves as a poignant commentary on female ambition, power dynamics, and the often-overlooked challenges faced by women climbing the professional ladder. Its ability to entertain while also engaging in the sexual politics of cinema makes it a thought-provoking piece worthy of discussion.Reviewed by Chujia Zhang.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still holds up after all these years.,"Re watching it recently I thought to myself « how extremely 2000s this movie can be », so I was afraid it didn't age well. But I was obviously wrong, the characters are still sympathetic, the heroine is very relatable once she starts making choices everyone blames her for, and the story simply takes you on her journey. I'm not too big on fashion, but I've spotted a couple of nice outfits here and there, and Anna Hathaway was just too good not to be chosen for the part of Andy. Of course Meryl Streep is great, but her character lost her flavor over the years, and it's Stanley Tucci's and Emily Blunt's I had the most fun rediscovering. Nothing bad to say about the secondary characters either, and the actors were good as well, especially Adrian Grenier. Only like I said earlier, the way each of them (except Emily and Nigel) made the heroine feel guilty trying to adapt to whichever situation she was put into, made me kind of uncomfortable this time... And I simply am over Simon Baker, after years of being subjected to The Mentalist series. The Paris setting was so dreamy back then... and the ending is just as good and rewarding as it was, and I love the closing scene where everything is back to « normal ». As a music lover who loves to babble about it in each of my reviews, the soundtrack is also as great as it was. Both the song selection (minus the opening track, that reminds me too much of Grey's Anatomy or Ugly Betty, now) and score have a special feel that fit the movie perfectly. It's certainly not overrated or outdated either, and should become a classic soon, if it isn't yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Elegant movie,"Anne Hathaway is a great actress as she portrays a smart, humble, down to earth, simple, young woman about to enter the working life. She is magnificent alongside Meryl Streep. I really enjoys a late night watch movie and Anne is simply elegant and charismatic actress. It was a flow state movie and I really like the change of clothing lifestyle from the beginning to the end. Anne absolutely nailed the role and become more confident and moving forward in her life trying to juggle a work-life balance. For me, the best part of the movie was the filming scene in the city where she appears with different clothing style in the streets. It really looks like a New York scenery.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Can Be Very Relatable,"Despite this movie had tremendous success and stardom, I must confess that I was avoiding this flick through the years. Somehow I built the image, and the marketing around it helped, that this would be a very empty, futile, pointless experience and that I will learn nothing useful. I was wrong. This can be very relatable, namely the office emotional abuse by an authoritarian and disrespectful boss, the jealousy of a close colleague, and the everyday struggles of a young well educated woman in this century. I also really need to emphasize the stupendous acting performance by Maryl Streep has Miranda Priestly, the very real arrogant boss. When she realizes that she needs Andrea's dedication, commitment and competence to make her life function almost and every day, she finally sees her worth. But this time Anne Hathaway character go forward with her professional ambitions and finds a new job, in the traditional journalism area where she belongs.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Boring.,"I gave my 12 year old daughter the choice of this movie or the new Pirates of the Caribbean and she chose this one. I have enjoyed Anne Hathaway in other films, so agreed that we could see this movie. Big mistake. 10 minutes into the movie, I found myself glancing at my watch and thinking that I would have to sit there for another hour and a half. This has to be one of the most dull, boring, predictable movies I've seen in a long time. My daughter was enjoying the movie (it was a junior high mentality-type film) and I couldn't just walk out and leave her, so I filed my nails and cleaned out my purse My only regret is that is 109 minutes of my life that I will never get back.Wait for this movie to go to the 99 cent rental bin...then watch it if you have nothing better to do for two hours.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anne Hathaway Keeps Her Shirt On Through the Entire Movie!,"Apparently Anne Hathaway has made her bones by making Disney a small fortune, done a couple of edgy flicks wherein she bares her ample bosom (and gets fired by Disney), and has finally arrived with The Devil Wears Prada, a chic-flick powered by two good performances, those of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci.I don't understand the buzz about this movie--and you have to take that statement from a 48-year-old man living in a very red state with a grain of sea salt--but I know it's very popular. There's a whole lotta cliché-in' going on in TDWP, but Hathaway is an appealing and charismatic young woman who holds her own against Meryl Streep, doing the high-fashion diva act without breaking a sweat.Streep is crisp and professional, so easily hate-able that you might miss two things she does that distinguish her performance. When Hathaway, new to the fashion industry, snickers at the imperceptible differences between a pair of blue belts, Streep verbally carves her up like a Christmas goose, and puts in a little bit about how Hathaway doesn't appreciate the thousands of jobs, the working-class paychecks the fashionistas create.Later, when Streep is facing her umpteenth divorce, she appears rough, raw, without makeup, tearful and puffy. You expect her to reveal more, to let the audience see behind her armor, an actual human underneath the diva. But after a few unguarded moments with Hathaway looking helplessly on, she slips back into Imperious Bitch Mode.She saves the scene from becoming maudlin by putting her armor back on. It's almost a dutiful suiting up, as if, if she didn't, she'd be betraying her obligation to kick the competition's collective ass.It's as close to human as she gets until you see her in a tight close-up at the end of the film, when you understand that she knows who and what she is in the grand scheme.Hathaway doesn't get to be that subtle. She is a beautiful woman, but her performance plays to Hathaway's strengths, nothing more or less. She gets to cry, laugh, get angry, and look good, but there's no stretch here. Putting pretty clothes on a pretty mannequin is not a big challenge.Which brings us to Stanley Tucci, the wise homosexual who pounds Hathaway into professionalism with tough love. His character is as predictable as any other, but the last thing I saw Tucci in was the 1995 crime drama, Kiss of Death. He was reptilian and ambitious as a district attorney who betrays David Caruso. His balanced performance--neither too masculine or drag queen--is the best work in the movie and it took me twenty minutes to remember where I'd seen this guy before.From my perspective, The Devil Wears Prada is a pleasant, if vacuous time-waster. There's nothing to be too cheerful about and nothing to get mad at. If the buzz sounds appealing, by all means rent it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Devil's in the Details,"Storytime! So, I'm beginning to think my TV is possessed. I'm one of those people that generally watches tv to bed so at night I'll toss on some series I've seen a bunch and can just tune out along with a sleep timer and drift off. Bob's Burgers, Rick and Morty, Community, Ash vs the Evil Dead, whatever it may be, regardless of what channel or streaming service I last had the tv on the night before, when I wake up in the morning and flip it on as I get ready for the day it turns to MTV. Invariably it's some home video show about people doing stupid things that I can only imagine is for shame watchers and people who haven't discovered YouTube yet.Normally, I click away from that as soon as I can but today I got distracted by other things and let it run and soon found myself treated to my first viewing of The Devil Wears Prada. I write all of this to say that the first time I watched this lauded movie it was edited for time, content and a whole laundry list of things that annoys me but for some reason I decided to watch it anyways. So this may not have been the perfect way to watch the movie but it is what it is.Wow, long preamble. Anyways! Devil Wears Prada. I think this is actually a pretty simple movie really. You get Streep, Hathaway, Tucci and Blunt all together, first off how could you lose with that lineup? Beyond the cast though is where that simplicity really kicks in. This is remarkably predictable and really pretty generic. New person joins a group they don't necessarily like, they fight against it but eventually start to assimilate only to realize they don't have to be what other people want them to be to love themselves. It's a good message but it's pretty commonplace.Where this one really fumbles, I think, is in the conclusion. The ending really takes away any tension or stakes involved and just wraps the whole thing up with a neat little bow and everyone gets their wish and the people live happily ever after, lives slightly bettered/altered by their experiences. There was potential here to go somewhere totally different with that, to give this conclusion some weight and some consequences but it's not interested in that. It just wants the tidy little happy ending and that's fine but it takes what already felt like a fairly generic movie to me and adds a lovely dollop of vanilla on top.That's not to say I hated this. Clearly, from my rating I enjoyed it well enough but that has absolutely nothing to do with the story or plot and everything to do with the performances. Again, you put these people together in a movie and it's gotta be harder to fail than to succeed and the skill of our leads is really the only saving grace I think this has and fortunately it's a doozy. That said, Hathaway's boyfriend, who I don't feel inclined to know the name of, was a disaster of mediocrity only further highlighted by the performances around him. His whole life, his percieved future is being ruined and he never shows the slightest emotion.Overall, this is worth checking out but sadly I almost think the way I watched it was the way to go. Toss it on in the background, give it some attention but don't expect the world from it. It's a decently good drama but it's no great masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Beware the dreaded chick flick,"PRADA is a lightweight comedy set in the fashion corridors of Manhattan, a movie aimed squarely at the teen and tween audience. Anne Hathaway plays a young college graduate landing her first job at a fashion magazine lorded over by an imperious and bizarrely attired Meryl Streep. As a fresh journalism graduate, Hathaway is a fish out of water as the new assistant to a boss obsessed with haute couture in the same way Martha Stewart is obsessed with turning the universe into her kitchen. But soon enough, Hathaway is transformed into a fashionista, and she quickly alienates her friends and family. The film is right out of the Disney or Nickelodeon school of film-making, and doesn't begin to live up to its arch title, which is based on someone's memoirs. Hathaway is pretty but just not up to her role, which would have called for someone like Sandra Bullock 10 years ago. Today, it might have been better served by someone like Rachel McAdams. But frankly, I don't think the director was up to the job. The tone is so slight and airy, the movie threatens to blow away at any second. And talk about clichéd. For girls only, preferably those still young enough to be playing with their Barbie and Bratz dolls.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Devil Fashions Well ****,"Win or lose, Meryl Streep is sure to garner her 15th Oscar nomination for ""The Devil Wears Prada.""Not since Joan Crawford's performance in ""The Best of Everything,"" have we encountered such a nasty bitch for a boss.Streep is just impossible to deal with. Cold, demanding, degrading and downright impossible are words not even adequate enough to describe her. She is a 1000% business woman. Amazing that she has married and has twin daughters! Where did she ever get the time for that?She hires a Northwestern graduate, Anne Hathaway, to be her second assistant. Miss Hathaway soon proves that she is adept at her job and starts to win favor with the hard-nosed Miranda. (Streep)Along the way, her dedication to her job leads her to a falling out with her friends and long-time boyfriend. Naturally, as part of her job, she begins to rub elbows with the biggest people of the fashion world.The film also deals very well with deceit and back-stabbing; unfortunately, so common in the business fashion world.The ending is well-timed and those who love fashion will particularly enjoy this.Along with Miss Streep, I wouldn't be surprised if Emily Blunt is nominated in the supporting category. She plays the first assistant to Miranda, a dedicated worker who thinks only of fashion week, that is, until she has a rude awakening.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Wears Prada,"The Devil Wears Prada has been Hollywood-ized, so instead of sharp satire, we have musical montages with bad covers of 90's hits (Crazy by Seal is an example). However, the two female leads (Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep) are so good that they transcend the clichés, or at least make them less nauseating. The movie, like the book, has no substance or deep issues, it is just enjoyable trash. The book was plane reading, but this movie deserves a little bit better than plane watching. Maybe a rental or an HBO viewing. I must say it is refreshing to see a movie with two female leads that isn't a complete waste of time for anyone who has testicles or a sexist horror film.2.5/4",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

disappointing,"i hate Hollywood....only there one can take a mediocre book and make a bad movie!when i say bad i'm not talking bout the acting or bout the effects. I'm talking bout the plot. everything that had made the book interesting is gone and replaced by the most elementary clichés ever known! the whole story is messed up, all the spicy moments are missing and i thing that the film is giving a wrong concept about the main character and shows it in a different light compared with the book for me thats one of the worst filming I've ever seen.although I'm really disappointed I'll give a 6 for the movie because of the good act, the brilliant Meryl and the clothes if you haven't read the book and u like the sweet Hollywood clichés than thats the movie for you:)enjoy",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wonderful movie! i could watch it over and over!,"I really loved this movie. For one I really like Meryl Streep and her performance in this movie is stunning, she completes it with her witty remarks, and Anne Hathaway's transformation in the movie is amazing! The actors do a really good job and become their parts well. For parents the movie is alright there are a few sketchy scenes and implications but overall it is alright in that category. The soundtrack is also a plus, the Alanis Morissette song is great, and the City of Blinding Lights by U2 is classic! Please check this movie out, it was worth my time and my money and truly the actors play very convincing roles. It is a really good, cheery movie and it involves betrayal, realization, and love in the plot and storyline. Anne Hathaway plays a girl, trying to get somewhere in New York, on purely good journalist skills but then she realizes to get to the top, fashion has to be involved somewhere.

Too many obnoxious characters,"Only made it through about 30 minutes because I couldn't stand any of the characters except for Andy and her friends. Hard to say which character was worst, but since I saw & heard more of her than any of the others working at the fake magazine, I'd say it was Emily.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The fashion world is not for the faint of heart,"The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie. It will make you laugh and make you think about work. It's one of those movies people like to revisit because it's feel-good and easy to watch. But I couldn't help but feel stressed watching it, at least at the beginning. Once Andrea gets her bearings at the job, it's nice the rest of the way. I really liked Tucci's character. That speech he gives to Anne's character about the importance of the magazine and how influential it is really hit. There was passion and sincerity in that dialogue. He's sort of like a caring uncle for Andrea. I get that they're trying to make Anne Hathaway look like a plain jane, but my god, there's no denying how charming, beautiful and attractive she is.Good camera work, although it lacks any cool memorable style. There was this one transition with Andrea changing outfits while walking on the street that caught my attention. Those were some smooth and clever transitions. The zoom in shots were hilarious and they always seem to happen with Emily Blunt's character. I didn't really like what Andrea did with the blonde dude though. Miranda is ruthless and cunning. Wonderfully played by Meryl Streep. Emily is great as well, she's funny. But the make up and outfits they chose to put on her - my god, they were hideous. But I guess it was purposeful and that's the whole point - fashion.I remember liking this movie a lot more when I was younger. I feel like the movie can be a bit unrealistic at times, but you're not really watching it for realism. It's almost a satire on the fashion/model world. It's a movie about choices and the ones we decide to take. It's a refreshing way to remind us that we don't have to stay at a job our whole lives. We're not bound to one certain job, we're free to make our own choices and forge our own paths. Andrea knew she wanted to be at Runway with Miranda for a year because she knew it would help her with her ultimate goal in journalism - and that's exactly what she did. The moral is don't follow a certain path that you don't believe in, that you're not passionate about. Follow what you love and what truly drives you. It's also a foretelling of how our jobs can shape and change who we are, sometimes not in the best way. Performances were great and there was a good amount of funny moments. The only thing is that this movie is quite surface level and shallow. I get it, it's about fashion and how unfair and ruthless the industry can be. But the movie lacks depth both in story and character development. The story is presented in a standard way, nothing innovative, but it gets the job done. I don't think I'd watch this movie again, I feel like it doesn't really resonate with me and there's not really anything that's worth revisiting. Good movie though, check it out if you haven't yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I loved this movie really much,"It's not just a women's movie, but it's a movie for everybody, even the guys. This movie isn't just about fashion, it's about having a boss who's very strict with you, and you want to show her that you can keep up with her and finally earn her respect. First of all, all the acting was just undeniable, it was fantastic. Anne Hathaway was great and made herself more than a star, while Emily Blunt's breakthrough and terrific performance on stage brought her to the top in the first place (and she should have gotten an Oscar nomination, in my opinion), another terrific actor was Stanley Tucci, who should have earned more praise in this movie, but the real devil in this movie was Meryl Streep, who never seems to disappoint, she was fantastic, she stole the show, and, believe it or not, there was heart in her cold and evil character. The Devil Wears Prada is a very fancy, original film with fantastic acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a realistic movie,"Andrea, who aspires to be a journalist, becomes secretary to Miranda, the talented editor-in-chief of a major fashion magazine. However, she continues to be forced to do odd jobs unrelated to her editing work, and her life remains harsh. After whining to her friend, Andy begins to make an effort to meet Miranda's unreasonable demands, and begins to change both physically and mentally. It not only shows the growth through work, but also the difficulty of balancing his personal life that arises as a result of those changes, so I think you'll really empathize with it if you watch it again after you start working.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"So so, redeemed somewhat by good actors","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not in the right demographic to enjoy a film like this. I'm a guy, I'm not interested in fashion, and I'm not fascinated by fancy parties. So right off the bat this film had to do a lot to interest me.And as it turned out, it didn't really do much to interest me. Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actress and she did a credible job here - enough to hold my interest. It's not like she had a lot to work with here - the character was largely a cardboard cutout - but she made me pay attention.One problem the film had was with its basic premise. Ho ho ho, the characters say, how could someone who looks like Anne Hathaway expect to work at a magazine like this? Uh, maybe because Anne Hathaway is an almost ridiculously good looking young woman, and is the kind of person whose face looks as if it was designed specifically to go on the cover of a magazine? Yes, she's not as skinny as a stick like some models, but she is thin, and when the characters talked about her like she was some ugly duckling it completely took me out of the moment. They should have either cast another actress (although that would have been a mistake because Anne's a good actress) or toned down the dialog.Stanly Tucci was good as always. Adrian Grenier was fine, although didn't have much to work with. Emily Blunt was adequate.But overall the movie just didn't connect with me. From the first scenes I could predict almost everything that would come, and I don't mean that in a good way. The decent performances save this from utter oblivion, but I certainly wouldn't rush out to get this one, unless you're a nut for fashion.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deserved better rating,"Meryl Streep was absolutely brilliant. A bit of a different acting style for Anne Hathaway from her usual sensible ways which I love. I understand the whole story is probably mundane and predictable, yet it's still well put together by the cast, not to mention several hilarious moments in between. Can't really understand the low IMDb rating. Not every movie is like Godfather or Shawshank Redemption with deep implications, and it doesn't have to be. Those modern city/fashion movies with charismatic actors are great pastime for me, and they deserve good ratings. Good ratings should be applicable for all sorts of movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth a watch,"Pretty good story. Not especially original, but very well done. The performances are all very memorable and there is some sharp dialog.

Only slightly funny/entertaining ... Hathaway gets to dress nice,"I only went to see this movie because I had read a few reviews that raved about how hysterical Meryl Streep was in this role. I can accurately state that in a theater 1/3 full there was not ONE scene which caused the audience to laugh out loud. In fact, it was a pretty silent crowd.Sigh. Why do we keep *hoping* that we'll go to the movies and be surprisingly delighted?I will say that the fashions were fun to see and that Stanley Tucci was the best part of the movie ... wish he'd had a bigger role. Anne Hathaway is a charming beauty and it's nice to just see her stunning smile and perfect complexion on screen. I hope Hollywood doesn't ruin her.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not bad...,"I really loved Meryl Streep in this, she was a perfect Miranda Priestley. I think I would have enjoyed the movie better had I seen it before reading the book. The movie stands fine alone as a comedy (in the ""9-5"" category of revenge movies), but I got more pleasure out of the book because of the more developed secondary characters. Lily was more interesting; the boyfriend a little more fleshed out. The movie didn't really have time to go into that. It was more of a slapstick comedy where the book was a little more cunning. I found it interesting that the character development in the movie was actually focused on Miranda instead. Not a terrible idea, but then it made it impossible for the movie to end the satisfying way the book ended. Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci were wonderful in this movie...I think Anne Hathaway is underrated as an actress, she's very believable and natural, Stanley Tucci's character is really sympathetic in this film. Overall, the movie wasn't bad, but I wish it had retained some of the exasperation of the novel.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Indulge the Devil, she demands it, how else can she perfect little demons","In this delightfully delicious skewering of the high fashion magazine industry and Anna Wintour from Vogue specifically, we follow Andy (Anne Hatheway) as she gets a job as 2nd assistant to Satan personified, Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep, in a perfectly chilled performance). Miranda can be none other than the spawn of Satan, because a real human could not be so nasty. Andy, who wants to be a journalist, looks down on the fashion conscious, just as they mock her size 6 body (""Size 2 is the new 4, Size 6 is the new 14""). Eventually to get ahead, she embraces the fashion industry, works all hours to please Miranda, offends her boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) and her friends and starts to lose her soul, nearly becoming an apprentice devil. As happens so often in movies, she realizes what is really important, walks out on her job and gets a poor-paying, unglamorous job at a real newspaper. I could have done without the ending, but the rising to the challenge of working for the devil was fascinating, and excellently accented by Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt.This movie is like a minty devil's food brownie, with a lot of mint to impart a certain icy quality to it. The rich, decadent devil's food calls irresistibly, making one want to partake a little more, a little more until you are filled with chocolaty goodness, and your taste buds are almost numbed by the mint. Inside you are feeling perfectly sinful while barely able to sense what is in your mouth, numbed by excess and willing to continue eating. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I can't dispute, however, that it does pretty much what it aims to do, and it is thoroughly exhilarating, but I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it, per-se. That said, Meryl Streep plays a monster so brilliantly that I can't help but be in awe of her performance, and everyone else does an absolutely sound job; there is fortunately little by the way of stereotype and I'm glad I've only ever met one person in my life who would be at home in the type of world displayed here (and he was a total idiot).

Miranda is an impossible witch with very few redeeming qualities; as the antagonist, she is a superb example of unhappiness. The protagonist is also superb in her naiveté and enthusiasm. The depiction of the cutthroat world of fashion, publishing and advertising was a real eye-opener and although disturbing in its negativity, educational just the same.

1930s comedy for the 21th century,"It's so clever. The first hour is completely according to the manual, which was settled in Hollywood before WW2. You know from minute to minute what's gonna happen, but it's there at the right second. Professionalism! Meryl Streep is great, but lives only on her technique. There is no intention to make this she-devil a complex person. She never raises her voice, just works with faces, glimpses and ways to say her lines. It's like an instruction movie about making a mean comedy character.But once again, everything is so very clever, until the plot gets too eager in moralizing and doesn't want the audience to make its own judgments (which has been really easy that far).

A Guy's Perspective,"Here we are, nine years out from this movie. I revisited it wondering...why? This movie is about starting out in life. And that it's not going to be an easy ride. Magnify this with just a terrible boss. Now, if you work in anything entertainment base, you've heard the stories. And it extends even to the menial of heads of departments. Even a key grip can be a total jerk. And they play these mind games constantly. Most likely to conceal a deeper anger of being...not the top of the pile. Whilst everyone envies those who are in power, they are oftentimes faced with decisions that are just...morally bankrupt. Is it forgivable? Possibly. Is it understandable when you're in the midst of it? Nope. And Andy (Anne Hathaway) figures this out fast.While not an amazing movie, it really hits on the fact that even the devil could have human qualities. Could it be a way to allure their victims, or be a learning experience. Testing you to see what type of person you are. Palming an bright shiny sweet apple to see how close you get. What I liked about this movie is that it rides that line. Never is Miranda (played wonderfully by Meryl Streep...duh) ever unjustified in her behavior. She is high-stressed and can't be bothered by details. As a new person, you see this as ridiculous pretentious garbage, but...the question is, why criticize something you desperately want? Andy is a Ivy League school go-getter. Probably would annoy you in school. But she is ambitious. And the reality is, girls like her, are seduced by a Miranda. They are jet setters and feared. The power is intoxicating. So in order for her to fully commit, she has to take the leap. With the guiding hand of Stanley Tucci's character. He is, I consider, the most tragic of Miranda's minions. He went through the ranks, in anticipation of the rewards. But the truth is, the world isn't fair. He doles out this advice to Andy in hopes she toughen up. Which eventually becomes putting it to practice.There is a lot of truth in this movie that the novel may seem more one sided. The movie is far more even to how the world works. Had it been the straight novelization, we wouldn't get Miranda's motivation to her behavior. It's not terrible (as most would feel), it's how that world works. And if you don't like it, you don't have to belong.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Yet he dropped her like a sack of spoiled potatoes when she just got too much, in her constant nagging and complaining about the way he dresses, for him to take.

A regular movie with good comedy and too much advertising.,"This comedy seems to be a scathing critique of the huge ""non-sense"" that surrounds the world of fashion. Its the story of a young journalist (Anne Hathaway), serious and idealistic, newly output of the university, which seeks to adapt to the wording of a major fashion magazine, run by a very strict and demanding director (Meryl Streep), absolutely convinced of the crucial importance of fashion to the society that surrounds her. The way she explains it couldn't be more honest about the egocentric way the fashion industry thinks about itself, looking to format the world according to their own standards while seeking to give the world what their think he wants (its like an ouroboros). The film is full of small critics and humorous moments, as Andy is ""tempted"" by the seductive universe around her.Unfortunately, the script is not particularly innovative and ends up becoming quite predictable. Another problem of this film is the excessive advertising to brands and products. It looks like a family size commercial, with hundreds of references to brands embedded in dialogues and situations. In the other hand, the performance of the main actresses is excellent. Hathaway is at her best level and can really give some grace to her character and put it in conflicts of interest and situations that will oppose her values ​​and ideas to her need to keep her job. Meryl Streep is a chameleon-like actress, able to wear the skin of the devil himself in a convincing way when she wants. She is the star of this film, with her closed face and her inability to show some kind or human warmth.In short, this film is very positive because the performance of the two actresses involved and good comedy moments.

"Average film, great acting","I may be missing something in this film (I suspect that my gender excludes me from the target demographic) but I saw it receive almost universal gushing praise on release, so thought I'd give it a go. And? Well, it's really pretty average, overall. Actually, in fairness, it can be looked at in two ways. First, the bad. The plot is flimsy, the message obvious, the structure by the numbers. It is a glam episode of Ugly Betty, but with no ugly people (at one outlandish point Anne Hathaway is called ""fat""?!) stretched to just under two hours. Nothing surprising happens at any stage. However, it is worth watching thanks to the good bits  the cast. Hathaway is very good and very watchable, if not massively convincing when in the dowdy phase. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, on the other hand, are both tremendous, with Streep excelling, and deserve the plaudits they received. Stanley Tucci is a little one dimensional, but also very endearing in his role. On the whole, this is an average film in which not much happens and is meant for a female audience, but the acting is of a high calibre so film fans in general could do worse than give it a spin.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Where's my coffee? ;),"The adaptation of the bestseller ""The Devil Wears Prada"" boasts Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Watson in the roles of Miranda Priestly, the almighty editor of the Runway magazine with a penchant for sadism, and her two assistants (Hathaway and Watson) who are all about trying to stay in her good book, to the extent of doing absolutely ridiculous tasks that border on sweatshop-style exploitation. Anne Hathaway continues her habit of makeover roles with Andy, the fashion-unconscious intern at Priestly's office who has Emily (Watson) sitting at the desk across from hers, throwing passive- aggressive insults at her all the time. The film is definitely worth checking out not just for Priestly's hilarious antics but also for Stanley Tucci's Nigel, the dramatic stylist who helps Andy with her make-over. The writing is brilliant, with good quips and a couple of great monologues from Tucci and Streep, whose speech on the influence of fashion on those who ignore it is very much on point. The bad part of the movie-although expected-is the fact that it's more or less like a film-length product placement, and the very antiquated notion that you need to abandon your career in order to satisfy your partner's vision of what's appropriate for you. But hey, to paraphrase Tucci, we're all in desperate need of Chanel, after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Intelligent and hilarious,"Thinking this was going to be another frothy chick flick, I was pleasantly surprised not only with a brilliant cast, but an edgy and intelligent story. I was engaged from the get go and the suspense build up to Miranda's entrance was palpable. Stanley Tucci was the hero of the story as he played the understated male fashion guru. He played it light but not campy. Meryl never raised her voice once, but her genius was in the nuanced turns of her beautifully coiffed head and her favorite phrase, ""that's all!"" The plot turns and the conclusion were predictable. The director chose to leave some loose ends that either means he forgot to tie them up or left them for a sequel. Andrea was most believable as the not so naive aspiring writer who got more than she bargained for. A very enjoyable night's entertainment which was more than I was expecting from a fashion flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ms. Streep saves the day,"I wasn't really impressed with the book, but I thought the cast of this film could possibly make it into a good movie. Meryl Streep was absolutely fabulous and believable as the quietly bitchy boss from hell. Anne Hathaway, in my opinion, was miscast as Andy Sachs, the hapless wannabe journalist who is hired to be an assistant to Streep's character, who is the editor of THE fashion magazine. I never bought that Hathaway had transformed into the kind of person she'd never wanted to be. She just seems like her sweet self throughout the entire movie, regardless of her change of wardrobe. Her so called transformation needed to be much more obvious in order for the film to truly work. The nasty assistant, Emily, played by Emily Blunt, nearly steals the show. And of course, Stanley Tucci is his usual brilliant self. His part of the story, unfortunately, is too marginal to make a difference. The group of young people who play Andy's friends are also not given enough of a role. The movie was fairly true to the book, which might be its main problem. All in all, not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but this probably won't be a DVD that joins our personal collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Did they read the book?,"For anyone who hasn't read the book this film will appeal to teenagers who will undoubtedly find it funny, however if like myself you have read the book you will realise that Anne Hathaway is totally wrong for the lead role, she is neither an average weight size and even when at the beginning of the movie whens she suppose to know nothing about fashion or beauty she looks remarkably well groomed. The movie is based on the book in parts but surly that means they should try to cast someone who at least resembles the personality of Andy Sachs. Anne Hathaway's performance is bland and mind numbingly boring. However in casting Miranda Priestly they were spot on with Meryl Streep, she's stylish yet has an edge to her. The film itself is well shot and is generally enjoyable to watch (if you pretend the lead was actually good) and will make a lot of people laugh however if you are going to turn a book into a film more time should be taken in casting as anyone who actually read the book that Hathaway just isn't Andy Sachs.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Glamorous, materialistic nightmare","A movie with an interesting insight into the world of fashion, and a pretty average story to accompany it.Meryl Streep absolutely owns this movie as Miranda. She's a ruthlessly cunning villainess, taking charge of the screen, characters and overall surrounds. Aside from her interactions with everyone else in the film, the editing keeps the movie at a fun and decent pace and Anne Hathaway does a fine job at being the wide-eyed newbie.That said, the primary story, regardless of it's content, is very boiler plate, by-the-numbers and therefore comes off as predictable many times. Moreover, the score undercuts the weight of emotional moments in several instances. Also, Hathaway is supposed to be the main character, but she finds herself greatly overshadowed by Streep.Overall, a kinda fun movie with not all that much to offer aside from the typical 'dangers in the pursuit of fame' plot and stunning costume designs present throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can watch when your blue or when you need motivation to shop!,"I went to watch the movie largely for Meryl Streep. And with the opening sequence she doesn't leave you disappointed. To put it simply, this is a chick flick with the girl-losing-and-finding-herself kind of story.Excluding the nitty-gritty details, I must say that the dialogues keep you entertained. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job and delivers some of the best lines in the movie. He almost makes you want to be skinny, gorgeous and rich! But Meryl Streep is still the cherry on top.Personally I liked this film for other reasons instead of its central theme. Although David Frankel perhaps intended it to be satirical,I loved the glamour he has created. I loved the fact that he did not openly mock the fashion world. Some of the lines in the movie especially Tucci's reflect the idea of fashion as art.All I can say is its a visual treat for any woman. Watch out for the shoes! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simply Entertaining,"I hadn't heard a word from my friends or family so I went in unbiased, but intrigued by the commercials.

There is also this one unexpected and out of this world scene, which could have been thought through better, BUT, none-the-less I have to admit the movie was entertaining.What I came away with: The girl finally waxed her eyebrows, the boy needs to; I have a new found respect for fashion and if I had a Sidekick I would change that RING!Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Ci, ca","I disagree. So many crucial parts of the book were lazily omitted from the movie. Most important of these is Miranda's accent-- where did MS' come from? Also, the comic relief of Lily, who came off bitchy and inconsequential in the film. Personally, I miss the part with the private jet to chauffeur the HP books. Somehow I ended up sympathizing with Miranda because of all these missing pieces. Double agreement on Stanley Tucci and Simon Baker. We love us some Nigel, but Simon came off so plebeian as Christian. Whencely went the tall, dark, and handsome man of whom I fantasized while reading the book?

"Appealing to women, but not a chick flick","Although any film with the word ""Prada"" in the title might seem like a chick flick red flag for men and people that don't enjoy romantic comedies, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a surprisingly un-cliché film that is really quite far from a romantic comedy--it's simply a fashion-focused spin on the classic ""what happens when you sacrifice your personal life for your career"" theme.The film, based on the popular novel, stars Anne Hathaway as Andy, an aspiring journalist who looking for a foot in the door in the Big Apple takes a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep, who really steals the film), editor-in-chief of Runway magazine and queen of the fashion industry. Andy, however, doesn't care much for fashion, and Miranda is notorious for being unreasonably demanding, cold and cynical. Regardless, Andy sticks with the job and begins to stray from her goals, affecting her career and personal life with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of ""Entourage"").Streep is simply the highlight of the film, something she's been known to do. She's so convincingly detestable that the script needs no mention of ""the devil""--the book/film title makes sense just watching and listening to her. At the same time, Streep also portrays the person inside the stone-cold machine, complicating her character and making the viewer truly think about his or her opinion.At the same time, Hathaway is deserving of recognition that she can be a bankable marquee star. She's way beyond ""Princess Diaries"" now. Her struggle to fit in, try her hardest, make things with her boyfriend work and decide on her future is so easy to identify with every step of the way. We're never left unsure of what her character is thinking or feeling and that's a tremendous accomplishment. Other noteworthy performances include Stanley Tucci, who also works for Miranda, as the effeminate mentor Andy turns to when she needs help fitting in with the fashion scene, and Emily Blunt as Miranda's other assistant who is a nervous wreck.Directing the film is David Frankel, whose experience directing a handful of ""Sex and the City"" episodes certainly comes in handy. He makes sure all the critical fashion elements of the film are shown off, including some effective montages that show a variety of outfits to appeal to the female audience. Although I haven't read the book, Aline Brosh McKenna delivers a very witty script that steers clear from all things cheesy. Some of the lines that Streep and Tucci have will make you think about fashion in a totally new way.So what makes the film male-friendly? It has to do with the fact that Andy's struggle is incredibly universal. The struggle between trying to advance your career and holding on to what you care about most is something that anyone can understand. Also, everyone in working world knows that feeling of complete powerlessness that Miranda forces upon Andy. Streep is so easy to hate because she has some oppressive qualities that we all relate to in our lives. Lastly, guys don't have to fear their being too much romantic drama between Andy and Nate. Their relationship exists for the sake of affecting Andy and contributing to the film's themes. They barely feel like a couple on the screen. The other romantic relationship between Andy and a major journalist figure played by Simon Baker doesn't get too sappy either.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Jon Monsarrat review: slightly disappointing, but message could change your life","The Devil wears Prada contains few surprises. Obviously, it's a coming of age story where a young innocent encounters an abusive boss and has to decide how to react.On the positive side, the acting is good, especially by Meryl Streep who simply shines in the film. There is one scene where Meryl's character forgets her makeup and it's immediately shocking.However, the story is a slow-paced and predictable. The love interest doesn't have much to do (for once it's a male, usually women get stuck with this). It's a little silly to cast Anne Hathaway as the ""fat awkward girl"" since she's already beautiful and shining before her transformation into a fashionista. There's nothing fat or awkward about this actress.The largest two flaws in the film were, for me, first (and this is not spoiling anything) the temptations of the young innocent becoming just like her boss... it didn't come across to me viscerally. Characters would comment that Andi was becoming just like her boss, shallow and kind of evil, but I don't know, it didn't work for me.The second flaw was that the boss just didn't seem evil enough to me. Verbally abusive, nasty, unfair in judgment... this is rare enough to spark the interest? Now the boss in Working Girls, she was evil. And without spoiling anything, I can tell you that at one point in the film the Meryl Streep character does seem to have a heart. Which sort of broke the idea of the film for me, i.e. rejecting this person's personality.Finally, despite all these comments, I really liked the message of the film. The primary message seemed to be that over-investing in a relationship for future rewards (working for a cruel boss hoping that she'll promote you to greatness) can be foolish. A secondary message is that it's easy when working closely with a dominating personality to blame yourself for silly stuff that isn't your fault. I think everyone's had a family, romantic, or business relationship with a continual complainer and it's hard not to let that get under your skin. Emerging from this and realizing ""Hey I'm OK!"" is a great message. This second theme is slightly lost in the film (you have to piece it together yourself).Who should see this film:-- If you are currently in any kind of dominating relationship and need to get a backbone and get out of it.-- Egotistical fashionistas who will end up excusing the boss's abusiveness because ""she's just trying to get ahead"". Heck with ya.-- Anyone interested in the world of fashion Everyone else, you are OK to skip it without much regret. I'll give The Devil Wears Prada a 7 out of 10 because it was slightly boring, but could potentially change your life.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Acting is the soul savior of this super predictable film,"The Devil Wears Prada is a comedy drama film directed by David Frankel and stars Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker, and Tracie Thoms.The Film is based on the life of an aspiring journalist who becomes assistant to ruthless, cynical and egoistic Miranda Priestly.I have heard lots of about the film and was excited to watch the film but after watching the film was fairly disappointed majorly due to it's super predictable story line. The only soul savior of the film is the feckless acting of lead characters specially Meryl Streep.The plot of the film is simple and screenplay as mentioned is very predictable, the screenplay is so predictable so that even a layman can guess what will happen next in the film and this is the most disappointing factor of the film as the film raises lots of hopes due to the talented star cast and the predictability can play a spoil sport.Acting in the film is superb and Meryl Streep was spot on in her cynical and ruthless owner of a Fashion magazine, in my opinion her acting was so superb that it seems that the character was written for her only. In my opinion only Judi Dench could've played the character as perfect as Meryl Streep. Anne Hathaway was another shining star of the movie and she had also done a tremendous job. She essayed the character with ease and utmost perfection. Emily Blunt and other characters were also impressive.In my opinion an average film primarily spoiled due to predictable screenplay but is saved by superb acting.

Good summer fluff,"I read every issue of ""Vogue,"" ""Elle,"" et al as soon as they hit the newsstand. When the book ""The Devil Wears Prada"" came out a few years ago, I was anxious to find out what goes on behind the scenes at my beloved glossies. I found the book tedious and pointless. I put it aside half read and ended up selling it to a used book store for a few bucks.I was interested in the movie because I could get the same story and see the sumptuous couture in the movie and while only sacrificing two hours of my time. I did enjoy the movie. There are some laughs to be had, and unlike most movies these days, this one doesn't stoop to toilet humorI thought Anne Hathaway is adequate as our heroine, Andie. Hathaway's wide- eyed look suits the character of the corn-fed midwestern college graduate well. During the movie, several character refer to Andie's intelligence. I just don't quite the light of intelligence in her eyes or the ambition to pursue a career in journalism that would be required to withstand the constant stream of abuse to which she is subjected. She merely seems like a nice young woman who has a mean boss.Meryl Streep, on the other hand, absolutely possesses the imperious couture- clad character of Miranda Priestly. She walks the fine line of cartoon dragon lady and brittle flesh and bone woman with the expertise of a tight rope walker. She's hissably hateful without ever losing touch with the character humanity. Earlier in the day I saw Streep in ""Out of Africa,"" and I was astounded that the same actor could have played both characters.Stanley Tucci also deserves strong props for his role as Nigel, Runway magazine's stylist. He's long-suffering without being weary and and he carries on his job in as professional manner as Miranda with none of her cruelty.The movie was styled by Patricia Fields, best known for her work with ""Sex and the City,"" and I could see more than a little of Carrie Bradshaw in the gorgeous costumes. It was nice to see what the SATC characters might be wearing a few years after the show left us.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More than I thought it would be!,"I was looking for an entertaining afternoon. But it makes anyone who puts too much into work stop and think. A good viewing for anyone too wrapped up in work! There is also an excellent message regarding staying true to your values. Anne Hathaway loses her way in the excitement and status of her position. Her friends bring her back to what is really important to her. Meryl Streep, as always, gave a defining portrayal of a driven woman in her 50s. She did not overplay the role, which could be tempting. She really wasn't ""the devil""; she was just a misguided, over-achieving woman. From my point of view, there were two extremely poignant moments. The first occurs when Miranda is speaking with Andy regarding her (yet another!) divorce. We see Miranda stripped of the accouterments of her power, and she is just another lonely, driven woman. The second occurs when we see Miranda observing Andy after Andy has quit and sought another position with a real newspaper. There is a sterling moment in which we see Miranda smile, acknowledging the journalist she might have become if she had chosen a different path. I was underwhelmed by the gentleman who portrayed Nate. He was unconvincing as Andy's voice of reason. I was overwhelmed by the portrayal of the ""first assistant"" Emily, portrayed by Emily Blunt. She captured the striving, strident young professional, but with just enough humanness for us to love her! I would recommend this movie to anyone. It contains significant messages for both young and old - or not so old. It also contains a ""just right"" performance by Ms. Streep, capturing Miranda's coldness without beating the daylights out of her. Stanley Tucci as Nigel was over the top!! His grace under fire was incredible and he graciously conveyed the kind of wisdom we all look for in our coworkers. He was truly amazing! Tracie Thomas as Lilly also gave a wonderful performance. All women need a conscience like Lilly to keep them from taking the wrong path. She was professional, empathetic but as stern as we sometimes need our friends to be with us!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
this is the kind of chick-flick a guy can like too,"I'm a guy and I really liked The Devil Wears Prada. I don't typically like ""chick flicks"" but this is a smart movie...the kind of movie that Hollywood made in the 1930's with three dimensional characters played by Kathryn Hepburn or Rosiland Russell. It's such a shame that there aren't more roles like Amanda Priestly (Meryl Streep) and Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) for women in movies today. Streep and Emily Blunt (as Emily) are fabulous in this film about a tyrannical editor of a fashion magazine.I'll admit I was expecting a lot of obligatory teaser shots of models from this movie, but only because that is what I expect out of Hollywood at this point... garbage that panders to a shallow, dumbed-down America. The Devil Wears Prada does not take this easy route and this is why it's so refreshing. Andy is a young journalist wanting to work her way up and applies as an assistant to Miranda, who sees right through her in the opening interview scene. This is such a wonderful scene and I was impressed with Hathaway's ability to not get blown right off the screen by the incredible, understated performance of Ms. Streep. Streep has definitely earned her place as one of the greatest actresses in film history and her performance here is just more evidence of this, and it is a pleasure to watch her work.Stanley Tucci is also perfectly cast as Nigel, Mirandas unappreciated right hand man. Nigel, we presume is gay, but we don't know for sure because it isn't the typical Hollywood ""lets-throw-in-a-gay-guy-for-the-obvious-jokes"" (or because its fashionable and/or politically correct). Nigel is another three dimensional character who later becomes part of a sub-plot...and his sexual orientation is never even taken into consideration. Again, this movie is too smart to take the obvious or easy way to entertain us.We need more movies like The Devil Wears Prada...a well acted, well directed, and entertaining story that doesn't go for the cheap thrills.And Kate, Roz, Bette...you'd be proud of Meryl, Emily and Anne.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

She becomes a plastic type of person and all for a cold boss and company that will easily place us. This film hints of the faults of capitalism. At the end of the day we're all replaceable and shouldn't lose forget that we work to live, not live to work. Andy's journey was a little different, she had to go back to a career that she was truly passionate but still some valuable lessons.

It would have been more believable had Andy been forced to learn to use an espresso machine to satisfy Miranda's need for caffeine.Also, if Nate is supposed to be a sous chef, why was he always home in the evening? No matter how late Andy worked, given Nate's profession, he would have almost always been home after her; instead, he was always home in their apartment sulking and waiting for Andy's arrival.

A nice surprise,"In 2003 a small book named ""The Devil Wears Prada"" by the then unknown author Lauren Weisberger, came out of nowhere and surprisingly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list becoming the proof that this new genre fiction named ""chick lit"" was here to stay. However, more than its literary style, what made Weisberger's novel suddenly popular was the rumor that this fictional tale of an insanely capricious boss was based on the real life experience of its author while working in Vogue magazine under the rule of the editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Wheter Weisberger really based her book in Wintour is still open to debate (Weisberger denies it), but the book's huge popularity soon ensured a film adaptation, and the legendary actress Meryl Streep was the once chose to play the Devil dressed in Prada.The film is about young Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who fresh from college, gets a job as personal assistant of Runway magazine editor, the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), famed for being a powerful influential figure in the fashion industry with little to no regard to those under her command. Andy, a complete foreigner to this environment, will have to put up with her eccentric boss and her insane capricious demands. To make things worse, as Andy begins to discover the industry she'll have to make choices, as her past life begins to feel incompatible with her new career.While the screenplay (by Aline Brosh McKenna) remains relatively close to the source novel, it's fair to point out that it has several (probably necessary) departures from the book's plot, making it a simplified version of the story. Still, the movie keeps the overall themes of the tyrannical boss and the choices of life, as well as the charm and freshness of Weisberger's book. However, due to this simplification of the plot, it becomes a bit predictable as it has a lot in common with many other similar films (""Swimming with Sharks"", 1994, for example) about a young newcomer being bullied by a mean boss.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is director David Frankel's first theatrical feature film, however, it's by no means his first important job, as Frankel perfected his craft directing several episodes of the famous TV series, ""Sex and the City"" (also inspired by a ""chick lit"" source). In many ways, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" retains the feeling of Frankel's previous work and it's probably the obvious next step in his career. While it may not be the most original film ever, it has quite good features, such as a very good edition (by Mark Livolsi) and a well-selected soundtrack.Many words have been written about Meryl Streep's excellent performance, so I'll just say that she was perfect for the role, as she gives a deeper, more complex personality to a character that essentially exist to be mean. While Streep's performance is essentially what makes the film to stand out from other similar movies, credit must also go to Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt, who play Miranda's two main assistants. Hathaway as our main character, Andy, delivers a quiet, subtle performance that allows her character to be likable, specially as her actions begin to show the slow but constant effect that Miranda has in her. Emily Blunt is the film's best surprise, showing a great future and a big talent for comedy. Finally, Stanley Tucci has a minor role, but shows off his scene-stealing abilities and makes gold of every moment he appears on screen. The rest of the cast is quite effective, but nothing really as special as the four main characters.Personally, I think that the film's worst problem is the many similarities it shares with other films, as it gives the feeling that the story lacks originality. However, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" makes up for this flaw with its light-hearted tone and its big charm, as it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously (as other similar films do). Also, Frankel's past directing a TV series becomes too notorious at times, making the film look like an extended chapter of a TV series; however, this is not really as annoying as it sounds, and it's probably due to the act that this is Frankel's first feature film.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is quite a good film for a nice evening, it's charming, funny, and most importantly: entertaining. It's always a joy to watch a very talented actress at work, but it's also a joy to discover three new talents (Hathaway, Blunt and director David Frankel) having a chance and making a good job. It may not be a life-changing experience, but this devil is a nice surprise. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Peppered in Prada,"I thought ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was an excellent film. It contained the perfect mix of comedy first, drama second. Meryl Streep shows again why she is the best actress since Lauren Bacall. Anne Hathaway is always enjoyable as the protagonist who usually gets the ""necessary"" makeover. I always wonder if the makeover scenes are actually shot at the end of the movies, making her under for the before shot. Her outfits and style throughout, maybe minus the blue sweater, are amazing and make Emily look like a London dock walker. Emily's character is fantastic as well and adds such immediate high strung humour, keeping the pace moving. It makes me wonder how she managed to not have a complete meltdown as her character, and on set as an actor. I enjoy how Meryl told Anne Hathaway prior to filming that she thought she was a good actress and then told her that would be the last nice thing she said to her during filming. Meryl wanted to stay in character, making Anne's reactions indeed real. Whether it is Runway or actually Vogue, the idea is great, the filming and dialogue are immaculate. It is a feel good movie, even though it may not have the typical beginning, middle or End that we have come to expect from most Hollywood films. After you watch Prada, you will want to wear it, as well as Gucci and Dolce for that matter.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Anne Hathaway, not particularly interesting at any time, is as wet as a fish here, adding nothing to the old tale of an 'Ugly Betty' made good with a bit of Chanel and Dior.All the clichés are here - the sulky, supplanted assistant; the ordinary Joe boyfriend; the glamorous other man who is after something for something; right up to the contrived ending, which any viewer could see coming a mile away.

Even stock characters can't make Paris look bad.,"The talented and beautiful Anne Hathaway looks fabulous as a wannabe journalist in this bit of fashion fluff. Meryl Streep, wonderfully bitchy as the editor-in-chief of a major fashion magazine, delights in tormenting her assistants with impossible requests, but even Streep can't save this soap opera. The plot is obvious from the moment Streep hires Hathaway, the ""fat, smart girl,"" as her second assistant. (If Hathway is fat, there is no hope for the rest of us.) Every character, from Hathaway's naive ingenue to the gay fashion director, catty first assistant, shallow ""hero"" writer, and college boyfriend, has stepped straight out of Screen writing 101. The frantic editing leaves little time to enjoy the marvelous clothes although Paris, as usual, looks fine. Beautiful to look at but ultimately vacuous, ""...Prada"" left this viewer feeling stuffed with cotton candy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Movie Of 2006,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the best movie I have seen all year! Hands down. This is a wonderful movie that has some of the best acting I've ever enjoyed on screen. The film says ""quality"" from beginning to end. It's for people who like real movies more than Hollywood formula tripe.I think that most everyone knows that Meryl Streep is one of the greatest living actresses this country has ever seen, and she proves that to the max in Prada. I believe this may have been her finest role. Meryl Streep plays ""the Devil"" (Miranda Priestly) and Anne Hathaway plays ""Emily"" (Andy Sachs) in this wonderful comedy which is also a movie about choices and values. I will tell you nothing about the plot. It's best to let it unravel before your eyes. Is it about working in the fashion industry for the top fashion magazine. Who would have thought that could be so fascinating?It will have you laughing hard from human interest type comedy, and it will have you sympathizing with both the ""victim"" and the ""villain."" In the end, it will have you crying. Take my word for it, this is a truly wonderful movie that will lift your spirits and keep you glued to your seats. Do your friends a favor - take them to see this. They will be grateful that you have such good taste.I give this 10 out of 10 stars, and I would give it double that if I could. This is the best movie of the year. If Meryl Streep doesn't win an Academy Award, then no one should get it. No one can top her. She is just too good.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A witch performance from Streep. Meryl always makes the screen glow.,"I myself have never really been a fan of fashion type movies, but anything with Meryl Streep is well worth a watch. I must say I was pleased when watching ""The Devil Wears Prada"" because Streep is so good in this role of a wicked witch New York city fashion magazine editor(Miranda Priestly). I can always see that Streep always takes her roles serious and she puts every ounce of heart and soul into it, making her perhaps the best actress around. This story is somewhat Cinderella like with a smart hard working Ohio girl(Anne Hathaway) who arrives in New York City with high hopes and dreams, but it's not going to be no yellow brick road journey when she lands a job as magazine assistant to the wicked Priestly! I know that all of us male or female can say that we have worked under a boss like Miranda Priestly who's so cold and demanding. All of us at some point have felt used and abused and the Hathaway character experiences the same slave treatment and cold shoulder many of us have felt. Yet because of ambition and determination and a little luck success and happiness is possible. Just like the Hathaway character we learn to look back and miss the tough nature of hard and dedicated love from bosses like Miranda, because the cold nature and tough love only helps us in the ever competitive world. Anne Hathaway gives a fine performance you just root for her underdog role, and good supporting roles are provided from Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. Mostly this film has the light to shine because of Meryl's strong and no nonsense performance, as always Streep is a pleasure to watch she gives so much to her characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Can't Act,"Films like this, and the people who star in them, should thank their lucky stars someone invented the term ""hater."" The word is a get-out-of-jail free card to anyone who wants to walk over others and not have their victory party interrupted by the noise of those they trampled upon. Like few other films could, this film exposes the hypocrisy not in the fashion industry, but Hollywood itself. It also proves, convincingly, that Meryl Streep is the most overrated actress in the history of the civilized world.Ask Anne Hathaway to do a nude scene, and she'd likely refuse. If she wouldn't, most actresses on her level would refuse. Ask her (or Streep) to play a role that sends the wrong political message about women (say a movie about how to sexually harass women in your office and not get caught), and she might get up on a soapbox and refuse it. After all, actors are such role models, and their films leave such an impression on their audiences. Just ask Geena Davis, who was thrilled to be playing the nation's first female president. Strong, independent women on film send a great message, and the actresses who play them love being the messenger.When you can call everyone you oppress a ""hater,"" you can marginalize their statements as sour grapes. You can even call them a hater if they fail to be as happy and enthusiastic about your success as you are, even if yours came at the expense of theirs.That said, would Hathaway revel in the role of a young legal secretary praying she's pretty enough to be hired and dismissing the concerns of the older women she displaced? Is Streep proud that the 20-minute lunch she assigned her assistants violates NY state labor law? Does she like gender discrimination? I guess so, because we all know that actresses won't do things on film if they don't approve of the political message.Ever wonder why young Hollywood actresses are always smiling so much? Aside from needing to send a biological signal that they just might be ready to have sex (gets them ahead), they are happy because they get paid six or seven figures to play around with these ""important political messages."" While they are doing this, and while movies like this are being made, the stories that really need to be told -- the ones about the people left in the wake of narcissistic dimwits like the leads -- are not, because the ""devils"" in Hollywood don't want that story told, and they don't hire those who can tell it. Instead, they hire the Emilys and Andies of the world, and in the course of mistreating them, destroy the careers of those who never get in their door because they aren't that slither of the population that is young, female, and attractive. Streep was nothing more than a glorified housemom in this film.Hathaway's ""struggling"" young adult female in New York City is about as unrealistic character as exists. A fat girl who grows up in Manhattan without family money will find herself boxed out of the job market by Andie, while a space has been reserved for Andie all along, by the powerful men who want her socializing near them and working for them. To her credit, Hathaway is not one of those young women herself, in that she did not capitalize on gender bias at regular jobs to keep her in the big city long enough to sleep her way to the top. She's acted all her life and is also a Soprano, i.e., a real performing artist. Her performance may stink theatrically, but politically she's the cleanest of the film.Streep's character, Miranda Pristley, must have felt like she was in a kennel with all the scenery being chewed by Streep, whose into-the-wall performance smacked of litte more than her industry-induced narcissism that her ""loo droppings"" don't stink. Streep has to be the most annoying actress on- and off-screen of this era. Her character in Defending Your Life is a caricature of the undeserved pedestal the public has placed her on throughout her fourteen Oscar nominations. Those who think Barney is the Devil have good reason, but they're wrong, because Streep is a lot closer than he'll ever be. She takes her paychecks and glory from an industry her characters lampoon. This is like when the media complains about political spending in shows sponsored by high-priced political advertising. Hypocritical.The film is simple enough: Fashion magazine, queen-bee boss (Streep) hires naive assistant (Hathaway), who barely escapes the sharks before becoming one, proves she can survive, and then wonders if she wants the fruits of her struggle. Stereotype the world and present racist, sexist backdrops (did Manhattan turn into South Africa?) without commentary, while pretending to make a meaningful political statement.Message to the people in this film: there are no wealthy victims in this world, and there are no wealthy activists. Lip service changes nothing, but putting injustice on film for ""realism"" without showing its ugliness or sparking its eradication is nothing more than profiteering and enabling. But don't worry, anyone who points this out must be a ""hater."" Pristley is Streep's better half, because she's honest about what she is and what she does.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

At least the Hollywood money-makers know to make something watchable from a very predictable and unfunny script.Character building could have been a lot better. Meryl Streep (Miranda Priestly)should have been brought in a lot more to add drama and evilness to the story. Instead, we see regular glimpses of her, too short to really deepen out the background of her devilishness and make the movie more interesting (and entertaining).The focus is almost completely on Anne Hathaway, who is an OK actress, but lacking in expressiveness and comic skills. Pay attention to first assistant Emily Blunt instead, she is the only real star in this production.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Learn from Meryl Streep what separates Fashion from cliché.,"The Devil Wears Prada showcases two stars, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Mrs. Streep Portrays Miranda Preistley, CEO of Runway Magazine and a woman of refined character that has built her life using whatever it takes in the Game of life. We never truly get to know her character but see fragments of her abilities in the High Fashion world. She is a Bitch and she knows that being a Tough Bitch is the Key in making it in her Career. She is most definitely the Devil. That's if Corporate Capitalism and the dollar is the True Hades Dweller that the holy book alludes to. Miranda Priestly is beautiful and mean, shrewd and experienced...Meryl Streep is given three scenes to really showcase her acting. She defines fashion and we have her attention. Her performance as Mrs. Priestly will become a film note for sure. She is cruel but a good woman in love with power and fashion.Anne Hathaway portrays, Andrea (""Annie"") a Northwestern Graduate who has landed a Job at Runway Magazine as 2nd assistant to Miranda Priestly. The Lion and the Lamb. There is an innocence emitting within Hathaway's character mostly expressed in her rosy cheeks. The transformation she goes through is expected and comes along well and is refreshing. She defines to look within oneself and see how beautiful we can become especially in the art world of fashion where individualism is expressed purely. We welcome her transformation as Hathaway is captured beautifully at times in exquisite dresses. The black dress even received recognition from envy as Annie's boyfriend unconsciously reacts to her epiphany. Annie is a confident Graduate who states; ""Well, that would not be fair."", when a High Executive advises her to quit after being shrewdly told she was a dumpy fat slob by Mrs. Priestly.The weakness in the film lies in the script. The plot is predictable and a silly subplot about a takeover distracts from the character development. It would have made a great film had the writer examined the two lead characters more where each one has something to learn from the other. It was not clear if Miranda Preistly learned anything from Annie. She never became self aware of her pompous behavior and gave in to the aspect of life that the other side was cool. Then again Thats the Devil.Annie did the job as a Northwestern Graduate would do. Perfect! She is out to prove to the world she can do anything. She walked away from the high fashion world displaying confidence and experience. She saw the ill effects of such a career as sex and corruption, betrayal and deceit, let alone the missing drug abuse would have consumed her. Her first ski lift would have taken her into that lust pool where the Devil flourish's and smiles pompously and shrewdly at her while she caves into desire. However, The film goes to fluff and remains a fun family film without getting to absorb in seriousness. Annie is the angel that showed us how to beat the Devil when she or he or it appears in our life.Love thy enemy and help them.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Refreshing Comedy -- I'll probably see this one again.,"This movie makes a good case for adapting spicy books like The Devil Wears Prada. Rather than overtly conforming to Hollywood formulas which pace romantic comedies at 90 minutes, this film is a hilariously fun film which takes a breezy look at the fashion industry and its various players.All three principal characters played by Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Stanley Tucci, are immensely pleasurable to watch. We enjoy them because they relish what they do, and what they do is not very nice.The joy in this film is seeing the constant degradation of the main character played by Hathaway. But the flip side to the constant dumping which also makes the film equally pleasurable is seeing some cunning moves by her character that earn her a measure of respect.You do not have to be a woman to see this film. In fact if you have a basic IQ which allows you to speak in complete sentences, to understand sarcasm and have had experiences with Ultra Type-A personalities you will probably relate to and enjoy this film.This is a good date movie.

Acerbic drama criticizing luxury fashion magazine companies and the fashion industry as a whole,"Backed by engrossing performances including from Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt as the standouts, this is a must-watch mid-2000s comedy-drama. The editing and cinematography create the sleek, sophisticated atmosphere of the luxury fashion magazine company. I like the film's soundtrack of rock, neo-soul, dance pop; the soundtrack definitely elevates this film. The commentary on the fashion industry's obsession with size/weight and the cutthroat working environment, where Andie literally has to ""sell her soul"" (dress to the nines, is expected to diet and look a certain size according to the fashion industry's beauty standards) to move up in her job and succeed, is acerbically executed through a critical lens.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Most Enjoyable Movie This Year (So far...),"I went into this movie with lukewarm expectations and came out of it extremely entertained. The cast is probably better than the material, but they were so good that they elevated it to a film that I can't wait to own when it is released on DVD. Meryl Streep is fantastic. She never raises her voices above a loud whisper, yet she commands so much fear and respect that you're in awe. I also love the way they made her up--silvery hair is a great touch to add to her icy personality. Anne Hathaway was a good choice, making Andy smart, klutzy, independent, and cleans up nice with a make-over. Stanley Tucci, Adrien Grenier, Simon Baker and Emily Blunt were perfect in their roles. It is a really enjoyable film with some good lessons about the choices that we make and their consequences.

"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA : Cinematic Equivalent To Wal-Mart Clothing, Enriched By A Killer Performance","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADAIn one of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA's most interesting moments, Lucifer herself Miranda Priestley (played like dry ice by Meryl Streep) discloses to her unknowing assistant Andy just how deeply layered fashion's influence on the world is. Whether others see it or not, Miranda knows that fashion determines everything. Even an article of clothing as hideous and offensive as Andy's Wal-Mart sweater was born from Miranda Priestley's knowledge of fashion. Everything from the most expensive Prada handbag to the cheapest department store purchase was born from Miranda Priestley's influence. In other words, fashion is more then just pretty clothes... it's art. Or at least that's how the boss from hell sees it in this high-style comedy directed by David Frankel.THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA tells the story of Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), a recent graduate with dreams of a being a real journalist in the big city. One morning, she finds herself interviewing for one of the most coveted positions in the fashion industry, an industry she knows nothing about. Andy interviews to be the second assistant for Miranda Priestley, Editor-In-Chief of ""Runway"" Magazine... and by some twist of fate she lands the job. Despite a lack of passion for fashion, Andy takes the job because after one year she'll have the only thing she currently lacks... power in her industry. However, life in this industry proves more jarring then Andy could have ever imagined.It's ironic that, despite Miranda Priestley's eloquently stated belief in the importance of fashion, the film that depicts that industry is nothing but a fun and expensive display of pretty clothes. Granted, the clothes and styles on screen in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA are incredibly beautiful, and this is sure to please the fashion conscious world that will make up most of the films audience. However, for someone like me, it would have been nice to have a director take the reigns in a Miranda Priestly style. By refusing to accept anything that is mere fluff, and demanding depth and precision at every turn, this film could have really soared. Sadly, the aforementioned scene in which Miranda lectures Andy on fashion was the only moment in this film where I felt the movie had a distinct voice.Aside from that moment, I left THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA thinking ""Yes, it was fun... but what was the point?"" The film has been heavily promoted as a comedy, yet I didn't find myself laughing. On top of that, I never cared about a single character more then I would in a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. So why did I still find THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA to be a decent film? I think the appeal lies in that carnal curiosity everyone has since grade school. The desire to see what it's like to be the most popular kid in the room... even though every ounce of common sense tells you the popular kids are not worth your time. Miranda Priestley represents the cruelest of the cool kids, as she flaunts her power and money in the cruelest way. Her life is one people yearn for even while she cuts them down with an evil glare for simply breathing in her air. This living devil of a woman is captured brilliantly in a magnetic performance from Meryl Streep. Much fuss has been made over this being Meryl's best ""comedic"" performance ever... I disagree. As a matter of fact, I didn't find anything funny in the entire movie. Nonetheless, the performance is fascinating to watch. What a pleasure to watch a performance so lived in given by such a great actress. Every fiber of her being wreaks of evil.Aside from Meryl Streep, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does feature an enjoyable performance from Anne Hathaway and some killer clothes... but not much more. The story is formulaic, and every twist and turn is cliché. It's just decorated a little more expensively then your average romantic comedy. As I think back on how well Streep was able to convey the importance of fashion in one scene, it becomes clearer why this movie disappointments. If you take away the fancy clothes and Streep's performance, this movie feels as familiar and ordinary as the Wal-Mart sweaters that ""Runway"" magazine looks upon with unabashed disgust....

This movie is entertaining from the get-go. It has a very good sound track too. This movie is somewhat predictable, but it keeps you entertained and it isn't completely obvious. I thought the best aspect of the movie was watching Hathaway turn into a clumsy lovable woman into a superficial fashion diva. I gave this movie a 9 because it was very well done, but not a ten because I thought the ending could have been improved, and they made sure to fix every mistake(just about...not every one though), and I would've liked to see the ending not be the typical ending(even though she makes mistakes....everything is perfect in the end).",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

lots of fun--but about that chef-boyfriend,"So. I thought the movie was lots of fun (and omigod, the CLOTHES!) (and how fabulous was Meryl Streep!) (and Stanley Tucci is just absolutely my hero).

But I did have a tiny problem with the portrayal of the chef-boyfriend. And the scene when I saw the movie in Manhattan was something else--in a pretty fab way.

Devil Wears Prada -The Movie,"Although this is most definitely a ""chick-flick"" and very predictable, it doesn't ruin your enjoyment of the film. The laughs come from watching Andrea struggle in a world where the only things that matter are how thin you are and how expensive your clothes are (oh, yeah, nearly forgot - and how high your heels are, too!). There are moments of suspense and a sense of, ""Oh no!"" a few times in the film, but you are always pretty much aware of how it will all turn out. Sometimes, though, predictability can add to your enjoyment and this caters to that rather well. Anne Hathaway is perfect for the role of the naive but underneath-it-all hard working and smart Andy. The fantastic Meryl plays the Dragon Lady to utter perfection, never once raising her voice , yet is believably scary without having to do so. She makes the Iron Lady look like the Tooth Fairy. I took my thirteen year old daughter to see this and we sat riveted from start to finish, loving the gorgeous scenery shots (wow, Paris!) and the fabulous clothes. And yes, the absence of vile language and gratuitous sex was refreshing. A film you can enjoy with your offspring without once having to stick your fingers in their ears or cover their eyes during a raunchy bit.

"Not quite a size 6, but it's personality might just win you over","The fashion industry: The giver and taker away of all things ""in"" and religion to every insecure, under-fed teen girl (and sometimes guy) in the western world is given a right smack (but never more so than that) in David Frankel's sometime satire. Anne Hathaway plays Andy, a smiley young girl who moves to New York in order to move up the fashion world. Her goal is journalism, but her right of passage is through assisting the cold, maliciously cruel fashion editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep, doing a po-faced Cruella Deville). She soon realises that the industry is cruel, shallow and incredibly undignified. Will she fall foul of it's devilish charms and superficial face, or keep her charm amidst a glamorous indecorum?The fashion industry, at its worst, is absolutely monstrous. It gives birth to terrible self-indulgence, unhealthy lifestyles, immoral role models and hideous insecurity. Whilst The Devil Wears Prada does its best to caricature the embodiment of the fashion world, by having Miranda Priestly make mince meat out of her assistants, and those assistance being every bit as self-conscious and docile to her demands, it is never as savage as it needs to be to show up the beauty obsessed world. Miranda Priestly is as delicious a villainess as you'd like her to be, but her actions don't portray the true shark that we know exists in that office. She's a one-dimensional cartoon first, and satirical allegory second. Take a film like Swimming For Sharks (1994) for instance  Kevin Spacey's movie boss is every bit as snarling and callous as Miranda, but with a vicious honesty that chokes out the niceties attached to The Devil Wears Prada. Whereas Mean Girls (2003) showed how a character can be sucked in to a world through vengeance, but end up just as nasty as her enemies, Andy is never truly swayed by everyone else's superficiality. At the start of the movie she doesn't define herself by her clothes, but half way through she turns into Kate Moss. She becomes obsessed with her work, and alienates her incredibly uninteresting boyfriend. She even flirts with other fashion designers, but then that's only human of her. Does she become a monster like some other critics have suggested? Not on your life. Her charming smile follows her right throughout Frankel's picture, never letting up despite the constant abuse thrown her way.But whilst it may lack a bite or two, there's nothing terribly wrong with this film. It is consistently entertaining, if predictable at times, has some ripe old performances  Stanley Tucci steals every scene his in  and is generally a feel good couple of hours. Is the satire reminiscent of Wall Street (1987)? Certainly not. But if you liked Sex & The City, you'll love this. There is, however, a much darker film yet to be made about this subject.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dazzlingly successful in portraying the cutthroat fashion empire.,"It may be unfair to say this, but this would have been a much less entertaining movie without the marvelous Meryl Streep. Actually, one could say that of any movie she is in, as she so completely overwhelms most of what Hollywood has to throw at her. The same is true here, with the exception of Stanley Tucci, whose counterpoint to Streep is so effective it was repeated almost immediately in Julie and Julia.It's no secret that Streep's character is based on Anna Wintour, the tyrannical editor of Vogue, but Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly really reminds me very little of Wintour, a credit to Streep's ability to create effective characters even within the persona of someone as well-known and contemporary as Wintour.The cast of the film is tremendously uneven. Streep and Tucci are the stalwart cornerstones, without whose truly inspired performances the film would disintegrate tragically into banality. Anne Hathaway, good as usual though still a lightweight compared to Streep and Tucci, is the nominal star of the film, but she is more often than not a foil for the dynamic duo. Emily Blunt, as a devoted fashionista, nevertheless looks a bit odd from time to time, including her first appearance in the film criticizing Hathaway's conservative attire while she herself sports a sort of post-apocalyptic Goth Judy Jetson garb. She seems strangely underutilized and stretched a bit thin at the same time here, but she is delightful nonetheless.Then there are the boyfriends. Adrian Grenier is definitely fighting above his weight class, and it doesn't work. He does a creditable job of moving dialog along with Hathaway, but he has to work too hard to appear interesting, and fails miserably. As for Simon Baker's Christian Thompson, aside from the fact that he's a bit self-obsessed, there seems to be no reason why Andy would not choose him, handsome, suave, successful, well-connected, over the scruffy, dreary and ultimately insecure character presented by Grenier.Despite all its shortcomings, however, the film is dazzlingly successful in portraying the cutthroat fashion empire presided over by the ruthless, Cruella DeVil-ish editor of ""Runway"" magazine. Some people put on music for background noise. I put on a movie. This movie has been my background noise dozens of times, and I still love having it on. I savor every word, every gesture from the truly magical Meryl Streep as, in my opinion, the greatest Bitch of all time.The soundtrack is wonderful, and one can enjoy this movie simply by listening to it. There are plenty of delicious surprises too, like the minor appearance of Gisele Bündchen, who just happens to be the richest (her net worth exceeds the rest of the cast combined, even if you throw in Anna Wintour) and most successful supermodel of all time, as Serena, a work-friend of Emily Blunt's character.In the end, I'm not sure why, but I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it twice in a row and have done more than once. You may not become that attached to The Devil Wears Prada, but it should definitely be worth the investment of at least one serious watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tucci saves the day,"Streep is brilliant and Hathaway is cute, cute, cute. Streep, a sadist of the ""good kind,"" dispenses her venom through a thousand tiny cuts and exercises her control through a thousand demands for trivial satisfactions, and the movie looks like this stuff is supposed to be somewhat addictive to Hathaway, drawing her close to Miranda. But, no, for me Streep and Hathaway seemed to be acting each in her own bubble, sealed off from any simple human contact with the other. Hathaway and Tucci however, seemed to me to connect in every one of their scenes. And Tucci and Streep connected similarly--lightly, easily. His helpless hurt and rage was buried so deeply one could catch only occasional glimpses of it, but I saw in him what Andi would be in time. So, to me Tucci provided conductance among the characters that, without his skill, might never have been felt.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"if you liked the book, just read it again instead.","What an unfortunate way to celebrate a well-written novel. The screen-play adaptation loses all the magic of the book. This film has none of the charm; instead of an interesting, funny and touching plot, the campy big-screen adaptation only has two things going for it: Meryl Streep's substantial acting chops, and the lovely Anne Hathaway. Readers, say goodbye to the interesting subplots of the book; in fact, you can say goodbye to plots, period. Forget what you know about the characters. The screenplay's portrayal of Andi is flat and shallow, and Miranda's devilish tendencies have been pared down to boring antics. Brace yourself for cheesy replacement subplots that distract from the story rather than add to it. And finally, beware the ending that only satisfies because the ride is almost over.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth seeing,"I didn't expect much before watching this film despite all my friends' interests in it, but it turns out to be quite satisfactory.Andy is a university fresh graduate and dreams to be a journalist. She gets a job interview for the assistant of the chief editor, Miranda, of ""Runway"". Having no sense and knowledge of fashion, Andy is unexpectedly hired by Miranda, which later changes her life. The difficult job forces her to learn to survive, but also transforms her into another Andy.There's no wonder why a girl who has her own dream can be fooled by the reality as she's just too ""fresh"" to the real world. She is first tempted by the idea that ""after a year as Miranda's assistant, you can get whatever job you want"". This must be very attractive to many fresh graduates as nowadays it's getting harder to make what you want to do a living. This more or less reflects the real world and also fresh graduates' feelings.As the story goes, you'll see rather loose, or boring, development of the story flooded with clothes in a lively way, and this is what my female friends find amazing about the film.It's not unusual to see everyday examples of mistaking what others want as what you want, just like what Andy does. At last Andy does make a choice that I find uneasy and expected. Maybe it's better to have a happier ending anyway.The whole film is like an examination to Andy, with Miranda as the examiner. Miranda's image as the devil is ruined by the reference she writes as I suppose the devil will never give you any rewards. But this role can be regarded as Meryl Streep's showcase for her ability to handle different kinds of roles. Anne Hathaway proves herself to have much potential and yet she still needs to polish up her acting.I've seen not a few films of this kind and I would say this is one of the good ones. It would be better if the film can be shortened and focus more on the inner side of Andy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Still, pretty good soundtrack and not bad performances.But Wow, did this movie seem like it was the model for a new movie made very recently. That being, Disney's ""Cruella"". Cruella, although a bit of a surreal odyssey, is far far superior.So Hathaway's journey of self-discovery is a fairly good watch, but not really profound as intended.Certainly, aimed more toward the chick flick genre viewer, I would recommend to those who enjoy those types of movies.ThxBob R.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sometimes it's kinda entertaining to watch adults act childish,"I don't really like Anne Hathaway and I don't think she is attractive like some people give credit for and just about any actress could have played her role, although she did a fine job. Meryl Streep however seems to have the talent to make just about any role she is her own, she was perfect playing the devil with somewhat of a human aspects that show during few scenes. Emily Blunt put on a good performance as well and actually somewhat noteworthy. It's basically about Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who is trying to become a good journalist and tries to work for Runway magazine and does anything they tell them to do, which is a supposed dream job for women everywhere. And as she goes farther into the company and become like them, she starts to lose her soul and who she really is. It's a entertaining film and isn't over the top or irritating to watch to the point of hitting your head or anything for example ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"", I was expecting a terrible film and got a okay one instead, most people can guess what is going to happen throughout the main story. I also felt that Anne Hathaway's character changes way to easily throughout the whole movie, especially when the movie started coming to a end, it wasn't believable at all for her to change that drastically. It's one of those films where overacting carries the film. It give it a 7 since it was kinda entertaining watching adults act childish while not making me angry watching it at the same time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

She may not be ALL Devil...,"...but she runs her workplace like Hell.Fresh-faced and ambitious college grad Andrea""Andy""Sachs(Anne Hathaway,a perfect blend of gawky and pretty)has bitten off more than she can chew when she's brought on as assistant(one of them,actually)to Miranda Priestly(Meryl Streep,in probably her best pure role in what feels like ages),a cutting,cynical,cruel and demanding she-beast who runs Runway,a sort of Cosmopolitan-type magazine. She meets(at first)little help from her immediate peers at the magazine,particularly Miranda's established assistant Emily(Emily Blunt,with some of the best lines in the movie)and Nigel(Stanley Tucci,shaved and stylish),and has to rely on her savvy,determination and charm to try to work the job to her advantage. Of course,this being a comedy,she is able to do just that,but in the process,she starts to lose her friends,particularly her boyfriend(Adrian Greiner).This film,when you strip away the strong,strong performances,feels pretty predictable(In fact,to me it felt like this movie took on some shades of Pretty Woman). And the added potential romantic entanglement that comes in the form of a renowned journalist(Simon Baker)seems kind of forced. The amount of times that Hathaway's character is referred to as either ""fat"" or ""ugly"" by people around the office,while understandable coming from the obsessed-with-skinny-tanned-and-chic fashionistas,still is galling. To be honest,the whole fashion industry theme of the film pretty much chased me away from seeing this in the theaters,and had Ms.Streep not been nominated for an Academy Award,I'm not sure I would've rented this DVD while it was still a ""New Release"". Still,this movie is entertaining,mostly on the backs of Streep,Blunt,HAthaway and Tucci,with help from a sharp script by Arline Bosh McKenna(adapting off Lauren Weisberger)and direction from David Frankel. If you are somewhat(or completely)fashion-phobic,you might be intimidated by this film,and who knows if you'd care for it or not,but this film is actually anything BUT a celebration of the industry,and the comedy that comes from it is worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Horrible friends and boyfriend!,"I wish I could give it 6 1/2 but I don't think it quite deserves a 7 because of the friends. The leads in this are wonderful. I'd give that aspect of the movie a 10! Not surprising since we are talking about Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci. The script gives each of these characters depth and great lines and they deliver with superb performances that were a delight to watch. What dampened my enjoyment of this movie significantly were the secondary characters--namely, Hathaway's boyfriend and best friend. Apparently, they see that she is becoming interested in superficial things and they feel that she is losing track of proper values. But seriously, who needs friends and significant others who mock you from a holier than thou position and even actively undermine your work--as opposed to supporting you in your career and choices and wishing you all the best even if you are different from them in some regards. One scene would be tolerable but it is EVERY SCENE with these characters that made me cringe and the overall position of the movie that Hathaway's character has something to be embarrassed and sorry for. What's wrong with female ambition? What's wrong with going through a period where work becomes a top priority? Adrien Grenier's pouty face in particular made me want to puke! Tracie Thoms likewise. Simon Baker's character was very one-dimensional and that's a bit boring. But luckily, the 4 leads make up the bulk of the movie so there was still plenty of enjoyment to be had. And the fashion was fun! Who doesn't like a dramatic makeover?! Pacing was good but it was a tad long. I wish they had omitted all the friends stuff!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little moments of magic scattered amongst trash,"What a bizarre movie viewing experience this was. It was like the film was written by a child. The ""drama"" this film comes out with would be laughable in a daytime soap opera. Friends stealing your phone for ten seconds while it's ringing, not knowing which table to put a book down on, being asked to find someone a plane out of Miami when no planes are flying out of Miami - and the most ridiculous of them all the Harry Potter manuscript sequence. What even was this movie I just watched?And then amongst one of the most pathetic scripts ever written are these tiny little moments of magic every 20-30 minutes, delivered by an incredible cast. Just every now and then a line would come along or a character would do something and you'd think, that's terrific, that's a moment that should've been in a much better film. And then you'd go back to suffering through the trash hoping another one of those moments would come along.But here's the thing, those moments are often all that people need to remember a film. There's a lesson in there somewhere for screenwriters. All I learnt though was that everyone in the fashion industry is a monster. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Did exactly what it was supposed to do!,I am not a fan of chick flicks. Rarely to I say a chick flick is good but this movie was great. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway really she should do more movies together because they worked some great chemistry hear. Alone Hathaway was believable but Meryl Streep takes center stage. She is amazing as usual and it is great to see her experimenting with more interesting characters. I don't think I have seen a movie where she is a villain before this and I have seen her in plenty of movies. (Kramer vs. Kramer doesn't count when it comes to villains.)

Meryl Streep Once Again Proves She Act Any Role!,"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA may put off many moviegoers because it sounds like a silly bit of fluff best seen when released on DVD. But this is a fine little movie that, despite its rather predictable and silly storyline, gives a number of fine actors the opportunity to sharpen their skills in playing roles not usually associated with their repertoire. Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments. This is a piece of powerful characterization.The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life. But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement. Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners, and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman. The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7. This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress. This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category. Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada? Strong work!

"Average comedy, lifted by performances","In a way 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very recommendable film. It contains enough laughs for a comedy and is build around a perfect performance from Meryl Streep. On the other hand the film always feels fabricated, with scenes both predictable and unnecessary. We follow a young girl, just graduated, named Andy (Anne Hathaway) who takes the job of Miranda Priestly's assistant. Priestly is the chief editor of a fashion magazine and although Andy gives nothing about fashion, it will help her to get a job for any magazine later in life. Miranda (Streep) is the devil from the title, driving most people around her crazy. Of course Andy's personal life, especially dealing with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), will be messed up. Close to Miranda are her first assistant Emily and fashion man Nigel, superbly played by Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.Reading the above gives you probably an idea of how the screenplay will continue. But the film does not really care for its own story and why should it? It has Meryl Streep. Every single scene is made entertaining by her, and admittedly, Blunt does the same things with her scenes. For some reason it is always fun to see mean people as long as you are able to realize they probably have a good heart. Hathaway is the sweet girl and she is good in playing sweet girls. That said 'The Devil Wears Prada' is basically just another comedy, elevated by performances.

Both display papers with details of their employment and both have identical elevator up and open shots, before viewing the Employer's name printed on the office door / reception.

"Good, but not great","Yes, the acting was wonderful. Hathaway and Streep were great, and the chemistry between Andy and Emily really made you believe it. However, the end of the movie leaves you with an ""eh"" feeling. You don't walk out feeling happy, scared, sentimental, or anything.

And if you haven't read the book, you sit there wondering if Nate is going to be mailing Andy grilled cheese sandwiches from Boston, as they both have jobs in different states. The biggest disappointment is the comprimising of values in that Andy does not stick to who she is, and continues to dress in overpriced clothing--and loses a dress size when she is already very healthy looking.

We're asked to believe that an honors graduate of Northwestern University goes for a job interview at a fashion magazine and doesn't know the name of the magazine's editor. It doesn't occur to her to dress up, rather than dress down, for the interview. She chooses an onion bagel for breakfast. (All of that is just in the first five minutes of the movie.)We also have to believe that Anne Hathaway is frumpy and dowdy before she learns about fashion at her new job. Makeup and costuming did their best, but Anne Hathaway is Anne Hathaway, and she's drop-dead beautiful even before someone gives her high heels and designer dresses.So--why see the movie? Three reasons--the fashions really are great; Paris looks wonderful; and Meryl Streep can do no wrong. Streep plays Miranda Priestly--demonic in her intensity and her demands, never looking anything other than her best, and contemptuous of anyone who doesn't recognize that the fashion industry is the center of the Universe. That portrayal doesn't require us to have any suspension of disbelief whatever. Streep has the talent to make you believe in her character, and the physical presence to stand out in a room filled with supermodels. Streep can inhabit a character so completely that it's hard to believe that, when the filming is over, she's really Meryl Streep and not the character she plays.This is a movie worth seeing, as long as you don't expect to leave the theater with a new and profound appreciation of the difference between good and evil. See the movie because it's great to look at, and it's a pleasure to watch Meryl Streep do what only she can do.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
brilliant!!!,"I was really impressed by ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I was lucky one - I watched it in August in the USA in its original version. The plot is great and of course actresses are brilliant! I think the ideas of model business and fashion are one of the most trendiest topics nowadays, so the director's choice was right and extremely successful! Especially I liked the moment when Anne Hathaway became dangerously beautiful and stylish while working at the ""Runway"" magazine. However some guys I know well told me that she was beautiful enough before that. Of course it depends on person's individuality, but in my opinion she became gorgeous after Nigel's help. Meryl Streep is unforgettable too - she deserves one more Oscar for actress' play. I'm sure, that she fulfilled the Miranda Priestly role at the screen. She is pretty tough and kind of cruel sometimes, but in some scenes we see, that she has feelings too, and she is not just a stone-lady. I advice you to watch this film is you hadn't seen it yet. It is brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sorely disappointed,"If your expecting the witty dialogue that goes with the hype then prepare to be mislead. Okay, so I am not a great lover of chick flicks - but I liked Legally Blonde and am prepared to give most things ago. But this was plain dull, predictable and hollow.On the plus side its generally easy on the eyes and you don't need to concentrate in anyway to follow the plot. In fact if your really hungover and need something to take your mind off feeling ill for two hours - this could be the film for you.However, my score of 2 is way below the average - so if designer labels, buying the right car, going on several holidays a year & basically living a materialistic lifestyle is for you. Then watch this film, if your looking for laughs and think Prada is somewhere in Eastern Europe - don't bother!",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Cinematography a delight for the eye,"The cinematography is beautiful both of The City and the fashions. Manhattan hasn't been so lovingly displayed since Woody Allen.Meryle Streep turns Miranda Priestly into a three-dimensioned and complex character, not the flat evil persona of the original novel. Streep has never looked more elegant with small waist and arched back. She gets some inspired lines of dialog. It's hard to believe this is the same woman who played a frumpy housewife 11 years ago in Bridges of Madison County. Miranda Priestly will become a classic character of the cinema like Cruella de Ville long after the movie.Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, the bright and eager journalism-school graduate in preppy sweaters skirts who wants to be a journalist, but takes a coveted assistant's job fetching Starbucks to her icon boss, whom she hadn't even known before the interview. That's the easy part of the job, balancing four grandes in a cardboard holder. To Andy falls several Herculean tasks as well. Hathaway's conversational style, wardrobe and body language changes, but she tries to be in that rarefied fashion world, not part of it. Occasionally Miranda lets her know she is pleased, but Andy loses her personal friends, who don't see the distinction. (She's already experienced indulging the whims of her self-absorbed boyfriend who sulks if he feels he's not getting enough attention. Miranda is only a few notches above him.) In the end Andy has to decide whether she is willing to let herself be absorbed by a way of life that sacrifices people for the cause of art and ambition.Stanley Tucci as Nigel, one of Miranda's deputies, is serves as a mentor to Andy. Adrian Grenier,Simon Baker, and Daniel Sunjata are some very eye-catching hunks in contrast to the estrogenic environment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It Made Me Wish I Was An Assistant,"I went into this movie with an automatic bias because the title contains the word Prada in it. (Which I still don't know what it is...) The Devil Wears Prada was intelligent, funny, and classy. It was the dry humor of the movie that I loved. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway are outstanding and made the movie totally believable. The thing I really liked about this movie was that while I hated her I loved Meryl Streep's character and I wanted Anne Hathaway to ditch her boyfriend and friends and follow her footsteps. I think it was still a chick flick but a tolerable one and even though you could probably guess the ending within 20 minutes it was all bearable and great to watch 'til the outcome (adding a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming). Overall I liked the movie and it was a truly enjoyable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Movie For All,"You do not have to know anything about fashion to enjoy this movie. A great story about losing yourself(and your life as you know it) because of the demands of a job and the desire to succeed. Stanley Tucci is amazing as usual and Anne Hathaway continues to impress and show that she will be one of the great actresses of this generation. Meryl Streep....what do you think? A legend providing a legendary performance. The dialogue is quick-witted and the story really moves. As a viewer I found myself easily sinking into the world of high fashion and believing Andy's(Hathaway) rise to acceptance. Funny, heartwarming and a great break from the doldrums of summer action mediocrity.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Delicious Treat!  Encore!,"Here is the best compliment you might want to pay a movie: I want to see it again and again. Here is one of this summer's true guilty pleasures, a film that showcases an amazing, incandescent, and scathing turn by Ms. Meryl Streep. She should be recognized as the best this year has to offer. Her editor from hell has to be one of the best female performances of the last fifty year, a role that is funny, scary, intelligent, and delivered by impeccable comedic timing by one of our greatest living actresses.The film glides, with no dead time, in a little less than two hours. For most of the time, we are given insight into a world that would have been perfect as one Darwin's studies and more than proves his theories: only the strong will survive. Hathaway might lack some of the experience that Streep has, but her performance is almost flawless. She is the innocent that learns to deal with impossible odds and looks good doing it.This is a sharp script that demonstrates that a good screenplay can throw sparks when it's written with knowledge, skill, and care, and in the hands of actors like Streep, Tucci, and Hathaway, it can even catch fire. I could go on lavishing praises on Streep's perfection; let it suffice to say that a movie with a cold adversary, able to to turn humans to mush with a single look or a venomous phrase is much more enjoyable than any mythical rehash that pretends to have a heart, or gasp! worse, save the world when the hero in question can't even show a soul who he really is or wants.It's time to see why original material can makes us cheer and run back to the multiplex and I'd rather have a battle of the wits than a battle of the witless.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ethics v. career: A tough call.,"Some might characterize this as a""chick flick"" or a ""teen flick"" from the MTV generation. This could be true. Nevertheless, my take on this film is the enduring conflict of family values and personal ethics v. the need to succeed.Anne's entrance is superlative as is her character arc while the film progresses. Streep is the perfect Miranda and Tucci is absolutely Nigel. All the actors and even cameo performers did a wonderful job. I believe Simon Baker was miscast because his ""good looks and killer charm"" were no match for Anne.The actual story is believable and defines conflicts that rage from fashion icons to night manager jobs at McDonald's. These conflicts erode relationships, friendships and marriages, and they create stress, anger and doubt about how to actually live.In Miranda's case, she fails while she prevails, albeit temporarily, but Andy catches herself before crossing that faint line separating what is really important from things (and people) that become out of place and out of style.I read comments regarding Nigel's alleged homosexuality. What does that matter? He refers to ""a boy in Rhode Island with six brothers who pretends to go to soccer practice while reading ""Runway"" under the covers with a flash light."" But was he referring to himself? He states: ""Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board!"" Can you imagine him with a big head, and a conspicuous Adam's apple in drag wearing size twenty? I do not understand the relevance of such comments as they have nothing to do with the film. This was a great blend of comedy and real life challenges that kept my interest due to high energy, characters with vitality, and sharp direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The movie was much better with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts,"Sucked sucked sucked.......and I love Meryl Streep. I REALLY disagree with the previous poster who thought Streep was great. She's done a variation on this role to death. Didn't you see 'She-Devil' or 'Death Becomes Her'? She was basically the same yet much funnier.I just wrote a letter to David Poland suggesting he's greatly underestimating her box office pull: she might be the BEST guaranteer of box office among female stars right now (I'm talking this decade)...but again..this was so routine. Her 'bitchiness' was more about editing than acting (Do you think wearing a different outfit and tossing a coat on a desk ten different times requires skill?). Hector Elizondo..oops, I mean Stanley Tucci, made no sense, Anne Hathaway made even less, and none of it was their fault. This was a horribly written/adapted piece of crap.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Marvelous Ms. Meryl,"Meryl Streep is a veritable chameleon. She never seems to take on the same role twice, and is completely believable in every role she takes on. As Miranda in The Devil Wears Prada, she delivers a performance worthy of the haughtiest haute-couture. Fully nuanced, with depth in every glance, every dismissive ""That's all."" Anne Hathaway was the archetypal doe-eyed princess, again, but she pulled off Andrea's transformation capably and seemed to have fun in the role.While the author of the novel upon which the film is based, Lauren Weisberger (a former assistant to legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour), insists she didn't draw on her experience at Wintour's Jimmy Choo-clad feet for inspiration, she obviously saw the fashion publishing and haute couture world for what those of us who do not own $1,900 handbags believe it to be: very serious about something that's really very silly. But the moral of the story -- be true to your self, don't sell out to The Man (who is, surprise-surprise, a Woman this time), etc.I'll say one thing for this film. It never got smarmy, and had a number of chances to go Hollywood that it didn't cash in on. Hoorah! Also, the clothes were Divine, but all those stilts (heels)? Eeks! Poor marks for the boyfriend and Andrea's friends... the actors were OK, but no one would keep friends who are as disloyal and judgmental as they were. (Well, I sure wouldn't...)As art director Nigel, ever-impressive Stanley Tucci adds depth and flavor to every scene he's in. I can't get enough of this character actor we've been enjoying for 21 years.Overall, film's worth seeing, not necessarily on the big screen, but fun either way.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
very good! better than I thought it would be,"I really liked this film. One of the best I've seen all year. I've read the novel and I thought it was alright so when production of this film took place I was both curious to see it and also ""meh"" since the novel to me could've been better on many other levels.When I went to go see the movie, I was taken aback. At first glance, Meryl Streep does not ""fit"" the character of Miranda. But as the movie progressed I really liked her. Anne Hathaway did a good job too, but at moments I found that she was trying too hard. I really thought that Emily Blunt did an amazing job at playing Emily, her one-liners were hilarious. By far, my favorite character is Nigel, if you go see the movie, you'll see why.In total honesty I thought this movie was going to turn into crap, but instead, the movie kept my attention throughout the entire movie. For me, I was able to keep up with everything since I've read the novel, so everything was just a refreshment really...but if you haven't you might have problems keeping up with some things, but it's not TERRIBLY CONFUSING so it's all good.I really liked this movie, the plot lines got twisted around a little bit, but in overall I think it was for the better.

Quite possibly the cutest movie ever made...,"This is one of them- one of the films that is essential from now on to our culture as what film-making should be. While delivering an hilarious script, the superb cast also teaches the audience some very important lessons about what each of our lives can become if we spend our days trying to be better than everyone else. That competition can get so fierce that we end up destroying ourselves in the process.But now I'm preaching...This film is brilliant: Hilariously funny, touching, smart, and it contains some of the best performances of the year. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both great and hilarious. Better even then that: They give real depth to their characters that could have been so clichéd and stereotypical. But it's Meryl Streep that truly steals the show. This film ahs made me a die-hard fan of hers forever. She will blow you away, more than ever before. Months later, and I'm still quoting her.Really, it's just a really fun and enjoyable film for anyone and everyone- don't miss it!

Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this movie because I thought it would be a light hearted, feel good, chick flick. I left the theater sickened and disappointed. I never saw The Princess Diaries, nor did I ever have any desire to, but 'I'm guessing many of the girls who are going to see this movie are fans of Anne Hathaway from those movies and so they were just excited to see her on the big screen again in a non-Brokeback Mountain sort of role.The jokes and jabs directed at Anne Hathaway's character (Andi) about her ""chubby"" size 6 body were frequent. Eating disorder conversations were abundant here is an example.(I may not get the words exactly right) ""Andi you look so sophisticated"" (Emily, Andis bitchy co-worker) ""Thanks Emily - you look so thin"" ""Oh thank you!!! Its the new diet I'm on, I basically eat nothing until I feel like I'm about to pass out and then I eat a cube of cheese"" Now, if this little conversation happened and then the story went on to make fun of the girl with the eating disorder for the insane-ness of that then fine, satire, I get it...but no, just on to the next bit.Near the end of the movie one of Andi's co-workers, the one who sort of became her mentor said ""So, size 6..."" (this is what he called her) to which she replies ""Not anymore, I'm a four"" and they toast to her success. Never mind that she looked absolutely fine before. And there were no toasts to her career success....only the weight loss.These comments bothered me on a couple levels...first, they glamorized the world of thin, eat nothing women. Second, who is the target audience for this movie? Women and/or young girls. Isn't there already enough pressure to be think without seeing someone that is admired go from a size 6 (small) to a size 4 (in some cases too small)!??!?!?! Meryl Streeps performance was fantastic. She was fabulous in the role of Miranda Priestly, aka the Dragon Lady. But I am hugely disappointed in both her and Anne Hathaway for participating in a movie that glamorizes eating disorders and adds pressure to the already pressure filled culture that a woman can never be too thin.I don't know maybe I missed something????",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Crazy Life,"There were two times in my life that I had the opportunity to chose something similar to Andy's job at Runway magazine. When I was in the military, I was offered the o0pportunity to work on the IG Team. It would have meant certain promotion, but I would never be home. After I left the military, I interviewed for a huge law firm and would have likely gotten the job changing their software to one I was very qualified in, but the interviewer wanted to know how I would handle picking up the lawyer's dry cleaning. I wasn't willing to do the job and it likely went to someone who would give up their life for the firm.The Devil Wears Prada was an enjoyable journey back to those times, and it was a great movie. Anne Hathaway (Andy) was fabulous as she tried to find herself in a world where she was clearly out of place. I enjoyed her in Brokeback Mountain, and I am really looking forward to seeing her as Jane Austin in her next film. Meryle Streep was fantastic as her boss, and Stanley Tucci deserves a statue for his incredible performance. Of course, I may be biases as i thought he was incredible when he did an episode of Monk, and I thought it a crime that 3 lbs was cut. Tracie Thoms had too small a part in the movie, but made the most of it. I loved her in Rent and am glad to see her in Cold Case.I gave up seeing Dreamgirlsfor this movie and I do not regret it. I will, of course, still see Dreamgirls next week.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meryl Streep All the Way,"While Ann Hathaway's ""junior assistant hoping for a career in journalism"" may have been the lead character in the novel and be regarded by some as the lead character in the movie, the plain fact is that this movie belongs entirely to Meryl Streep as the most self-centered, bitchiest boss in the entire world of fashion magazine-dom. Streep dominates every scene she appears in and the lead actress becomes her foil. The audience awaits the next whim that will drive her assistants to desperation, to invention, to achievement -- all rewarded with not even a snarling thank you. Although it's said to be no secret that ""The Devil..."" is said to be a young author's revengeful portrait of an actual bitch-on-wheels, Streep's character is like a creature out of a horror movie, Boris Karloff in drag, and it is a masterful performance. Ann Hathaway is charming and the first assistant, later demoted as Ann's character rises in the world, is nicely limned as is Stanley Tucci's, Streep's -- what shall we call him, managing-editor-on-a-leash -- but they are each 60 watt bulbs in the presence of a pulsing 10,000 watt search light. Streep deserves something for this role -- perhaps a flogging on a Paris runway? But she is a marvel of the dragon lady incarnate.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
hilarious yet probing,"This 2006 Pictures 2000 Production, based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger, is a comedy, yes, but simultaneously it deals with the character of the individual persons and how they affect others around them. Succinctly, it is a story about a very recent graduate from Northwestern University who rejects Stanford Law School to go into journalism, but ends up going to New York to work for the company known as Runway Fashion, and for her it is a foray: she doesn't know the first thing about fashion; the girl, Andrea Sachs (Ande) is played well by the attractive Anne Hathaway. Meryl Streep plays the very demanding supervisor-so cold, overbearing, unbearable, unsmiling, and so seemingly-heartless that she is referred to as a witch. Emily Blunt plays the secretary Emily, a young British lady who herself is unsmiling, hateful, and bitter; she is so much like Amanda in personality, yet, despite this, or maybe because of it, she and the ""witch"" Amanda don't get along well with each other. Both are initially very ugly toward Ande, but that does change later. Stanley Tucci plays Nigel, a somewhat sissified man who, however, in his own strange way does help Ande. Despite Ande's awkward start, she soon does begin to do her job efficiently and thus proves herself, and thus also betters herself, but her friends begin to think that she is changing toward them, and not for the better. At the same time it is unfair of them, and especially her boyfriend, to be ugly toward her, though the vice-versa of that isn't true. (Does anyone follow the Golden Rule anymore?) The setting is not only New York but also Paris, which is very glittery at night. Again, it is a comedy but also a very introspective movie, and worth the time to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

(Looked it up on IMDb) Although I had a hint when I saw that Patricia Fields did the costumes! Not a big fan of the series. Just like the series, this was a little too much like New York City and fashion as Hollywood imagines it. Thought Meryl Streep gave the whole business some semblance of class, always a pleasure to watch her. But what predictable mediocrity in story and execution.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Rich he played Doug, one of the 3 friends of Ann's. What i think i liked most about the show over all was the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G outfits that Meryl had on. And of course the fact that she was head to toe Prada almost the whole movie. While Ann on the other hand had mostly Chanel, and Calvin Kline on, still glowed like always.

It is a movie that you can understand only while growing up!,"I don't expect from a teenager to understand such a movie or in fact anyone who has low ambitions in life. This movie is meant for people who have great ambitions and the more they grow in age the more they will appreciate this movie.It's a great movie in a very new context with the Goddess of acting Meryl Streep. It's a movie about choices in life when it comes to career and climbing up the ladder. Too bad that people who don't understand this kind of movies comment with confidence that it is not a very good movie? Well anyone who concluded that this movie is not good enough either was sleeping during the movie or analytical skills are really below the average level. I am sorry but this movie is just great. It made me tear at the end. Yes I teared. Some people they cry for things that are sad but this movie just hits on the strings of heart. It's not a sad story... It's a real life story! If you are still on the first step of the ladder waiting to climb higher, you'd better watch this movie till the end and rethink everything that you expect awaiting you.Last two scenes when Anne Hathaway leaves the car and throws her mobile is very expressive of the feel of freedom that today's career people have lost and I am one of them. The last scene is just wonderful when Merly streep admires Hathaway's decision but she chooses to continue with her style of living which made her lose two husbands and lead a miserable personal life for the sake of feeling the power she got herself used to.There you go, this movie tells you which path you would love to find yourself in; is it power vs. sad personal life or freedom vs. career with no power but talks to your passion.Great movie indeed ... not anyone can understand and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Nice little Chick Flick (this from a guy),"Okay my girlfriend read this book and all she could talk about was the upcoming movie. Now being a guy I'd rather not pay movie fair to see a lifetime TV like movie, but also thinking like a guy I figured if I shelled out the money and took her of my own volition I might receive a few perks. And hey Anne Hathaway is good for the eyes.All that being said I knew very little about this movie upfront, except Prada is a handbag or something. I was very surprised and delighted to see Meryll Streep in the movie, from that moment on I thought I may give it a chance. Meryll being the iconic actress she is brought a lot to the movie. She is heads and shoulders above most actresses. So there I sat ready to give this movie a chance, get a few perks and maybe along the way see a good film. And I was not disappointed, Meryll brought her usually game to this movie playing a very business minded woman who only twice in this movie showed she might have a human side. Anne brought what she brings all of her films, thus far, the doe eyed, innocent girl. Even though in one portion of the film you get the idea that this may not last forever. Her acting was good, but like I said it was standard Anne Hathaway. Now the rest of this case was very impressive. Emily Blunt's character was a typical High Brow fashion queen and she pulled this off flawlessly. She is a wonderful actresses, kudos to our cousin's across the pond for discovering this talented young lady. I must not be the only one to think so as she is a very busy girl as she will be seen in 6 upcoming works. And a big round for Stanley Tucci as well whom I best remember for his recurring role in Miami Vice (TV) and as the uptight customs boss in the terminal. For him to reach in this and give an award winning performance in my book is great. I love this guy and think he is a special actor, not a leading man, but the perfect fit to almost ant cast.So basically I can say this was a good effort as movie and I won on every front with it. Guys see this movie with your girl she will appreciate it and you'll get to see a decent film. Think of it like this to women this book maybe like ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" to us, or the film is to women as ""My Dog Skip"" is to men.

Mumbling school of acting,"Please! Meryl Streep mumbles all the way through it. You want 2 dimensional voice? You have it: mumble-mumble she lifts her finger, mumble-mumble, she gives that look, mumble-mumble time for some fast edits and cute faces because diva Streep just hasn't got what it takes in the voice department. And this is a film that swims or sinks on its vocal merits.Mumbling has sunk many a film, just look (before you lurch screaming for the exit) at Al Pacino in Revolution. Clint Eastwood did it because he could pull it off, cool, it was his persona - and you cannot pull that out of your handbag. Why do actors keep thinking they can pull it off? As for the English girl (why mention her name?), she is so out of her element; you just want to tell her to go back to chewing horse grass in daddy's paddock darling.VERDIT: The film is now in the UK.

If you read the book...,"If you read the book, the film will upset you due to the fact that, to you, the film will seem to lack the vital content that made the book so wonderful, interesting and all around ""gossip-y"".I disliked how little the character of Lily was involved, and who was that random other man? He seemed strange and bland at the same time. Quite an interesting feat, if you ask me.However, I now simply must own one of those Chanel necklaces Ann Hathaway's character sports later in the film.Anyone know just how much those would run me?Haha...I guess the best part for me, besides Streep's amazing delivery of those lines that dripped with sarcasm, were the clothes.:) xo",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Devil Wears Prada,"The Devil Wears Prada is based upon the novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger. The film is about a young woman named Andy Sachs who gets a job at a fashion magazine as an assistant to the magazine's editor named Miranda Priestly. Andy finds out that working for Miranda is no easy task having to answer and take calls from Miranda all day and do several errands for her without ever being thanked or told that she is doing a good job. Miranda is a very tough boss and enough to make some people go crazy. A co-worker at the magazine named Nigel starts to get friendly with Andy and gives her a whole new wardrobe seeing as everyone who works at the magazine is fashion obsessed and Andy's previous clothes were bringing her ridicule. Andy's family and friends are soon realizing that Andy is spending all of her free time doing things for her job and that she is neglecting them and herself. Eventually, Andy will have to make a decision on whether to stick to a job that millions of young women would kill for or continue to work for a woman like Miranda and continue ignoring her family and friends. The Devil Wears Prada has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the main cast members and a good supporting cast as well, good film editing and good costume design. The Devil Wears Prada is probably a movie that more women will see than men, but in the long run I really liked this film. The acting is great and Meryl Streep who plays Miranda will undoubtedly get an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel will likely get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well. Meryl Streep uses her face, movements and body language to play this character and she does a great job of it. The film is also very entertaining and has a very sharp and well written script. There are a lot of intellect inside jokes in this movie and some of the dialog between the magazine co-workers is sassy and smartly written. The film is compelling and in a lot of ways this is a very pleasant film with a likable young woman who has to decide about her future and her family and friends at the same time. This movie entertained me and kept my interest and it has a well polished directing job and great performances that will not go unnoticed come awards time, so basically in every way this movie is a hit. And even though this movie looks like a mere chick flick I think it would be a really good date movie and that guys will enjoy the film and the acting as well. The Devil Wears Prada is one of the first great comedies of the year and starts off the summer as one of the best film's so far this year. A huge success of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great watch,"This movie was not in my watchlist but I decided to watch it after it came on my home screen of Disney+. It was a great watch. Loved every second of this movie.

Miranda's psychology,"Miranda is a really tough personality. When I watched the film; I did not feel any anger for her, I just felt that she was a loser in the end of her life. She was angry at Andy because Andy did not choose the career path of Miranda but at the same time Miranda was somehow proud of Andy because of her courage of not following her. Miranda is really a complex character but she saw herself in Andy but she ignored Andy's own personality. When Miranda said to Andy ""I saw my adolescence in you"", the audience thought about Miranda once more. Was Miranda really a capricious, cruel and intolerable person? Or time and conditions made her like that? What is the cost of a shining life? The scene when Miranda was in bathrobe without any make-up was a symbol of Miranda's real personality without any mask. I really liked that film because I found myself questioning about people we don't really like.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
size 4 - o jolly good,"I knew this was not going to be a philosophical film characterised by deep thought into the ethics of fashion and that it would entail a simple plot line of personal rediscovery and 'belonging'. However as convincing as the cast was in their callow characters and they did a lot with the script - it had its charm. The issues i have with this film are nonetheless plentiful. Comments made about Anne Hathaways' figure were made uncorrected i became much more humorless. I think you'd have to be defected not to acknowledge the flaws of the film petaining to female stereotypes - one can overlook it and see it as a thoughtless stock standard Hollywood film enjoyable for its unmeditative qualities. However I am very concerned about the ""I am now a size 4"" ""well done"" This is an unhealthy statement and it goes uncorrected. The character is called fat and large repeatedly - I went out and ate a focaccia and a mud cake after the film - i hope everyone else did too.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
most likely the best comedy of the year,"The Devil Wears Prada is the biggest surprise and will be most likely the best comedy of the year. It seems that the film has achieved not only financial success (over 120 million bucks only in the US), but also artistic one, which is extremely rare nowadays. Journalism graduate, Andrea has just been hired to be a 2nd assistant in a legendary Runway magazine devoted to fashion. Her psychotic chief, Miranda Priestly seems to do everything within her power to humiliate and fire Andy. The film is not another over-the-top chick flick. In fact, one may even refer to Devil Wears Prada as an intriguing and funny battle of cultures, in which people from different backgrounds and with different priorities participate. The writing always goes in the right directions as choices that screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna makes are never wrong. The movie unfolds smoothly and during the 2nd half, director David Frankel applies, aside from humour, also some moving drama-like scenes as Andy has to take important decision. Besides, the flick contains loads of unforced, mainly verbal and situational humour, which absolutely cannot be classified as stupid. Both humour and drama are superbly combined by director who captures losses and sacrifices of workers. The Oscar-worthy acting is a real highlight of this pic. Spontaneous Anne Hathaway is at the beginning sweet and later transforms into elegant chick who tries to make ends meet in his private life. As always great Meryl Streep is simply perfect as a cold editor barking comments with a sense of superiority. What's more, supportive roles are also outstanding. Stannley Tucci displays his comedic talent by delivering some smart one-liners. Emily Blunt is also great in displaying her fear for loony Priestly. All in all, skipping Devil Wears Prada is very unwise decision.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Save your time and money.   Rent ""9 to 5"" !","This movie was a great disappointment. We walked out after 45 minutes (it seemed like 2 hours).

I'm not a skilled enough a critic to judge where the weaknesses are exactly. I haven't read the book, but I would guess script and direction. Meryl Streep performs 100 per cent with the lines provided her. Anne Hathaway is just too good-looking for this part of a clueless, clunky, smart journalism graduate of Northwestern, as she is portrayed to be.

The fact that's this movie it's based on a book that tells a true story just makes it more impactiful and concrete.

A perfect 10!,"I never grow tired of this movie. It will put a smile on my face even if I have to do my taxes, have food poisoning, I've lost my phone . . . Well, you get the picture!

I'm trying to think of something profound to share, but from my perspective it is a clever, humorous, interesting, roller coaster of a ride. Great soundtrack, too! Random question, I see these lovely women beautifully dressed and think their outfits are still relevant, meaning they all look stunning even by today's standards.

Ugly ducking becomes beautiful only to win the hearts of the vain,"This movie stunk up the room. I rented knowing nothing other than Meryl Streep was starring, and wow, what a disappointment.

I couldn't understand why Ann Hathaway's character would even WANT to work with people who are so vain and ridiculous. The movie went on AAA too long.

Surely touching on something big,"Maybe it's because I saw the movie in what would probably be it's ideal setting...(an audience of fashionistas and gay men at a late night showing in Chelsea - I am in neither category, by the way)....anyhow, it seemed that they really touched on something with a solid lampooning of the high fashion world. The crowd was guffawing for even the oldest sight gags, which I won't spoil here. As naturally lovely as Anne Hathaway is (even when dowdy), I really resent the casting of Adrian Grenier in his role as her love interest. He is just way too much the embodiement of the female idea of the metrosexual male ideal. It was grating, and took away from the believability - as did the size of their apartment. Stanley Tucci should be commended -- His first few lines have you thinking he'll be nothing but a walking stereotype (as was much of the aforementioned crowd I was sitting amongst)...but Tucci's character was well-written and well-executed. Meryl Streep was perfect, but I can't agree with the critic's suggestion to just have made a film about her character - you need the context of the Andy character. I noticed that the audience particularly loved the Emily character...she might ring the truest to life of all of the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
About the leading star in this film,"Meryl Streep looks like the only big name in this at the time in this during its making. Streep (in one of what three comedies she has done) looks nothing whatsoever like the highly voluptuous real-life, Well-known magazine editor Anna Wintour. Streep does not act much like Wintour either. But that is not wrong as this is only a highly fictional film somewhat just based on Wintour's life. But there was an actress who I believe is over 20 years older than the real Wintour, that is Lee Grant, that looks, sounds and acts just like the magazine editor herself. Grant may have been dead-on casting (save for tremendous age difference) to have been in this film rather than Streep. Grant is less attractive than Wintour though outside of that and the age difference their stamps for each otherwise Also, Grant never had Streep's star power so if one would not expect Grant to have been the star of this but still.(I am only saying that Wintour is physically extremely attractive. She gets involved in bad left-wing causes and she doublecrossed her friend of decades (Trump) during the recent election and so on.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A severely mentally retarded squirrel would be able to give away the ending after 20-30 minutes into the movie.There are really NO surprises here at all.

"Believing You ""Will"" the Outcome to Your Life; Decadent Mistake","I'm not sure if the drive behind this film had a proclivity toward a different outcome than the decadent ending of a young and/or American idealist who believes she can ""Will"" more than getting out of bed, but if this was considered then I saw it on purpose, if it was not considered then it was an entertaining, accidental undercurrent, par excellence. Life cannot be ""Willed"" and upon acceptance, it can be different, fun, and/or tragic. If we don't accept it, it can also be different and tragic yet a moral bore. Table the mind numbing idea that the ""Will"" you use to succeed in small tasks has any association to what you think is a controlled and/or ""Willed"" destiny and you will feel much freer than the supporting actress makes you believe freedom to be. The scenery, lighting, story, and acting shown in the movie set it apart from others coming out of Hollywood.

Becomes what it criticizes,"Problem is the movie is, for the most part, as airheaded & vapid as the culture it's telling us is wrong. I like Miranda (Streep) too much, as much of what she does is justified by her results, the need of the job & while we feel bad Hathaway's character is short tempered and ready to fire her for stupid things, so are a lot of jobs which don't have the value of the prestige this job would have had. I can't feel bad for a woman who is winning from the moment the film starts and simply can't hang on for a year until her better job comes about. Some people have real problems... haha. This large scale Lifetime Movie plot is a bit overrated, except the actors are brilliant. Yes Streep deserves an Oscar for simply waking up in the morning, Tucci & Blunt are heartbreaking as a people stuck in jobs that will never advance them and doesn't appreciate them (who actually care about what they do, unlike the unlikable character Hathaway plays). There are no real iconic moments in the film, no real realization that everything is a lie, no begging for forgiveness by holding a boom box over a head... it just sort of ends. It has some good moments, but besides the quality of acting is nothing special. And why did they spend a record $1M on clothing?

Everybody wants to be us...,"I finally saw ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I kept bumping into it on HBO over the weekend, and what I saw looked good. So I finally just bought the DVD. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a great movie, and now among my all time favorites. When the movie came out last year, I had intended to see it, but never did. Although, I had read stellar reviews and heard great things, I could not find a comedy set in the high fashion world at all compelling. I was utterly wrong. It is the context more than the content that makes ""The Devil Wears Prada"" both hysterical and touchingly bitter sweet. Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay based on Lauren Weisberger's novel is crisply written with deadly wit and style. The ""Devil"" is Miranda Priestly, Editor-in-Chief of fictional ""Runway"" magazine. Priestly is a thinly veiled characterization of Vogue Magazine's Editor-in-Chief. Commanded by Meryl Streep, Miranda is anything but caricature. As Miranda, Streep gives her most striking performance. She is simply awesome, and so deserving of her Oscar nomination in February. I love Anne Hathaway as Andy, Miranda's unlikely second assistant and eventual protégé. Hathaway of ""The Princess Diaries"" proves more than a younger Julia Robertsshe is a young Audrey Hepburn. First of all, Hathaway is classically beautiful, and has a smile that melts a room. She displays her natural smarts in her joyful presence. She has a deft light comic touch. She also has the star power to hold her own with Streep. Theirs is an amazing screen partnership. What touched me about ""The Devil"" is that it is a razor sharp comedy masking a touching rites of passage tale. The movie works because the context provided by Director David Frankel generates masterful performances by Streep, Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Brunt.Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, a young Northwestern University graduate with a journalism degree, who needs a job desperately. Through some human resources glitch Andy interviews for a second assistant position for Miranda Priestly at ""Runway"". Fashion retarded Andy, does not even know who Miranda is, much less that she should fear for her life. Miranda takes a chance and hires Andy given that she is so unlike her previous girlsbeing that Andy is the ""smart fat girl"". Be mindful that ""fat"" is in comparison to the couture starved. Miranda is merciless. I immediately liked Miranda, probably displaying my own twisted nature. However, I saw that Miranda was training Andy to be strong and survive in the shark infested world of high fashion. Hers in a strange way is ruthless compassion. This undercurrent resonates throughout. After having a horrific day, Andy fishes for sympathy from Nigel (great Stanley Tucci), Miranda's ace Art Director, who says, "" You're whining."" Knock it off. Andy endures unrelenting ordeal including a hilarious ""Harry Potter"" manuscript request. However, Andy cowboys up, and begins to gravitate to Miranda. Andy's relations including her boyfriend Nate (charming Adrian Grenier) begin to view Andy as a sell out. Andy gives her life to her job, no longer mocks the vapid nature of the fashion industry. I think it is director Frankel and screenwriter McKenna's point that Andy acknowledges the greatness in Miranda, and begins to aspire to that. However, the catch is that this at least for Miranda comes at a costsacrifice of her own humanity.In a poignant limo ride scene Miranda says to Andy, ""I see a great deal of myself in you"" Andy says, ""I couldn't do something like that."" Miranda points out, ""You already did"" She then punctuates by saying, ""Everybody wants to be us."" Here Streep is killer, because it is not about vanity. It is fact, according to Miranda. In perhaps her most edgy and powerful performance Streep as Miranda is completely dominating and forceful, yet never raising her voice. She grants Miranda moments of frailty that beautifully capture what Miranda has forfeited on her rise to power. Streep can say more with a dispassionate gaze than entire pages of dialog. I think Miranda sees herself, and what she has lost in Andy. Here Hathaway brilliantly captures the embers of idealism and heart. Hathaway has radiant spirit, and her eyes speak eloquently for her. Everything about her performance is natural with an authentic charm. The rest of the cast is amazing. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the prissy and wise Nigel. Emily Blunt masterfully balances the vulnerability and bitchiness of first assistant Emily.It is mostly the unsaid that captivates and enthralls ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Watching Streep as Miranda as she introspectively gazes, and lets out a subtle smile reminded me why I love movies. When you have the right director, writers, and actors all coming together it is like magic. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is simply wonderful and amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Wizard of Oz meets The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"Can a young woman make it in the big city? Will the Wicked Witch of Women's Wear Wizardry destroy her? Can her lipstick get any redder without stopping traffic on 57th St. & Fifth Ave.? All important questions, you will agree. For the answers, see ""The Devil Wears Prada.""Meryl Streep's character in this movie is named Miranda. That is the name of the daughter of the magician Prospero in Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" (""O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!"") In a way, Miranda in this movie is also a magician, and surrounded by the cutest elves, pixies, etc., outside of a Hobbit/Hogwarts reunion, she transmutes schmattas (rags) and sequins into treasures, or, rather she transforms the makers of these treasures from dwarfs to giants. She isn't very nice about it, but she isn't very nasty either -- and that's what makes her performance so jaw-dropping good.Softly, softly, her voice modulating between a whine and a whisper, she holds her followers paralyzed with fear/admiration, and gets her way with a little petulance and a little pouting. This, after all, is the world of high fashion, and inference and understatement will move mountains where threats and high drama will only garner smirks and titters.Before her withering glance, the rest of the cast can only slink and slither and hope that the gorgon's stare won't turn them into stone.The movie is funny, the acting very good, and the sets and ambiance capture a certain time and place beautifully.

Streep is sensational!,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a smart, amusing look at an industry that few take seriously yet one that affects almost everybody in some way.I thought all the performers were up to the task, but the brilliant Meryl Streep as the demanding editor-in-chief of a Vogue-like fashion magazine creates a character that is absolutely unforgettable. Lesser actresses would have chewed up the scenery as a shouting, wild-eyed boss-from-hell; instead, Streep underplays it with a kind of resignation that no one can possibly meet her standards, that she is doomed to be surrounded by failure and incompetence.In one marvelous scene in which the top editorial staff is planning the next issue of the magazine, Streep wearily dismisses all suggestions as uninspired or yesterday's news. But when the art director finally offers a truly original idea, there are no smiles or words of praise from Streep. She simply says, very coolly, ""I'm glad someone came to work today.""You don't have to labor in the high-fashion world to relate to Meryl Streep's driven executive in this movie. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dressed for success,"Something rare and beautiful has come out of the film adaptation of Lauren Wiesberger's roman a clef novel about working as a PA on a high fashion magazine: we have a new camp classic.The Devil Wears Prada will sit alongside 'All About Eve', 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane' and, of course, 'Mommie Dearest' on the DVD shelves of gay men everywhere, to be quoted reverently and brought out for themed parties and such like.Also, relief for Meryl Streep. After years of trying to shake her somewhat dowdy and severe image as an actress through various comedy misfires, she proves she can truly nail a comic lead by turning in a performance at once so effortless and so refined as Anna Wintour's wardrobe. Streep, as Priestley, incidentally is turned out like Cruella De Ville at a Versace fire sale.It is in achieving this flawless level of studied hauteur and languid disdain as Miranda Priestley in delivering every sentence and every withering look as 'Runway''s iconic Editor-in-Chief, that will see Streep take her place on a pedestal along Bette, Liza, Barbara and Faye, and see Miranda Priestley ascend to the pantheon of great camp characters.Everything else pales. The other leads are there to accessorize, which they do dutifully and with the minimum of distraction. Hathaway's character wrestles with her work ethic, her sanity, her common decency and the desire to 'get on' and at its most serious level 'The Devil..' is a study on how psychological and emotional manipulation can be so skilfully brought to bear to make someone surrender their free will : Andrea initially believes her bid to conform and impress Miranda, in some way, a challenge to her boss, likely to 'prove' herself, whereas it is very much just part of the process of moral capitulation that begins 'when you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choos'.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

1 hour and 48 minutes gladly spent in Hell.,"The best comedy I've seen in years.Let's start from the beginning because I found nearly everything about this movie utterly perfect.The script is sharp and fun, never boring and brilliantly written, there's never a whole, not one scene is too long and the dialogues captured me.The directing by David Frankel is very good and overall smart, in portraying the world of fashion to make it sparkly and captivating inall its pretence.The costumes are like special effects for this movie and well, if you're a girl (or a gay guy) you'll find yourself drooling in front of the screen over shoes and jackets like my girl was.But the acting, oh my God! The acting in this movie is like a perfect dessert. Anne Hathaway is absolutely adorable, she is believable and she does a great job achieving to stand out in a group of superb actors. She is the only lead, however, who in my opinion deserves a negative critique: she could have pushed herself much more forward, I felt like she was playing it really ""safe"" while she could have added a much sharper gap between the pre and post-runway Andy. Emily Blunt is the rising star of the movie, I've always had a thing for British actresses (and red-heads) and, seeing Emily for the first time in this movie, I was totally captivated. She is a superb characterizer, she steals the scene, she is funny, inventive and has an unbelievable screen presence, she is going to go far. Stanley Tucci is one of my favourite supporters, he's given a character here that most actors would have overpowered, letting Nigel drawn in the sea of stereotyped gay characters. However Tucci's capable hands gave Nigel a sharp tongue and a big heart, despite the appearance. But the absolute queen of hell is the always wonderful Meryl Streep. When you think of Meryl you usually think of drama, deep emotions and most of the times tears. She's stepping out of her element here, this performance was calculated, cold and always balanced, like Letterman said commenting the movie ""it's like that club you never have to reach for, but you know it's there""; yet it is impossible to completely hate Miranda Priestly, Streep gives her a touching fragility as we see her as a woman and mother and not as the overruling boss of Runway, she gave up too much of her life for her job to let anything or anyone step in her way, ""If you want this life, those choices are necessary"".Watch this movie, you'll laugh a lot, you'll think a little and you'll find yourself smiling at the end of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well Not Really,"I sat through this for One hour and then decided that I had had enough of Cruella DE Ville in an the fashion business with a cast that is really forgettable..Stanley Tucci was good in this role but the story was very slow and getting the Harry Potter Manuscript was ridiculous..Even the president couldn't get it so why a Fashion editor..Definitely not for me. Even my wife who normally likes slushy films or even stuff on the B movie channels couldn't stomach this and she asked me if we could go..Another interesting point is that the definition on the screen was poor. I thought that most movies would be in High quality Film or 1080p Digital.. This was blurred. Centre wasn't too bad the edges were inexcusable. I feel that someone should either check the film quality, or the projection quality as this was not up to standard.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Splendid movie,"I loved this film. Very smart, very intelligent and very sharp, shrewd, acute look into the depths of Fashion Business magazine. The part of Meryl Streep, who played mighty but still vulnerable Miranda Priestly, is awesome. She conveys the main part of a ruthless and down-to-earth, business-like shark of the glossy mag with such admirable precision that an awe arise immediately. The bags she has, the expensive clothes she wears, the comments she makes, the house she lives in - everything is so first-class, so impeccable, so grand. Her part is a real feast of the film. She delivers her lines with cold snobbish aplomb, but deep in her heart she is a loving, caring Mom and she teaches her new aid so patiently and well that it can't but gives an admiration. The whole big fuss of a mag making is shown with such cute accuracy and the tension is so palpable that one cannot but love this excellent film. Very well done",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
From rags to witches ...,"To the vast number of people of the world, what is called ""high fashion"" is nothing more than a trivial pursuit for the very rich and very gullible. It is an industry devoted to spending huge sums of money to create exotic, often hideous, clothing that few can afford and even fewer can actually wear. But according to various characters in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, fashion isn't so much of an industry as it is an art form. And not just the design and the creation of the clothing itself, but its presentation in word and image, as well as its promotion as a means of shaping and advancing a culture. Like some sort of stylistic Reaganomics, the god-awful million-dollar gowns and garments being pasted onto stick-figure models on the runways of Paris and Milan today may someday, eventually, have some effect on what average Americans will happily buy off the clearance rack at Wal-mart.Maybe. Maybe not.But THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does seem to suggest two things with reasonable confidence. One, the people involved in the fashion industry do totally believe that what they do is important and that minor details such as the hue of a blouse or the hem line of a skirt has meaningful consequences. And two, those who control the industry are so rarefied and isolated from reality that they can't comprehend just how meaningless those consequences really are.The backdrop for PRADA is Runway magazine, a Vogue-like industry bible ruled with cold-blooded self-assurance by editor Miranda Priestly (brilliantly played with self-assured cold-bloodedness by Meryl Streep). The goal of the magazine it would seem is to visually strive for female perfection and if that isn't enough the magazine also prides itself on featuring the works of celebrated writers and photographers. Curiously, when a magazine such as Playboy defends its existence, it will be in defense of the search for female perfection, with the works of celebrated writers and photographers tossed in for good measure. Clothed or unclothed, do we seem to have competing styles of pornography at play? Who is objectifying women more? At least Playboy is thrifty enough to forego the cost of expensive wardrobes.To some extent, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a remake (a designer knockoff?) of the 1957 musical FUNNY FACE, wherein bookworm Audrey Hepburn finds herself transformed into a butterfly by almost accidentally being seduced into the superficial world of high fashion by photographer Fred Astaire. This time around it's Anne Hathaway; she plays a wannabe journalist who rather unbelievably finds herself to be the second assistant to Streep's maven of style. Arguably, PRADA could have been about any business, since the focus of the story is on dehumanizing corporate ethics, the downsizing of personal integrity and other issues dealt with previously in films from EXECUTIVE SUITE and THE APARTMENT to NETWORK and SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. But by placing PRADA in a world primarily ran by and catering to women (and a few gay men), the film challenges the naive notion that women would do it all so much differently if they were in power. And tellingly, for a film about fashion, it offers precious few glimpses of style, beauty or elegance, the very elements with which the characters justify their existence. Hard edged and icy, PRADA has more in common with David Mamet's brutal GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS than with the joyous glamour of Stanley Donen's FUNNY FACE; no one so much as hums a Gershwin tune.PRADA's focus is on Hathaway, who as the lamb among the wolves learns the value of being a sheep in wolf's clothing -- though admittedly, the wolves dress quite well. But just as Priestly sets the style and the tone of the fashion world, that job falls to Streep in the movie. Streep manages to be coolly hilarious and coldly horrifying, creating a career-woman monster that falls somewhere between Martha Stewart and Cruella De Vil -- not that that is such a wide gap. A part that could have been played quite successfully as broad comedy (think Sigourney Weaver in WORKING GIRL), instead is granted surprising depth by Streep, even though she barely changes facial expressions throughout. When the character so much as flirts with being sympathetic or vulnerable, Streep summarily discards such emotions as if they were particularly unflattering rhinestone accessories. Unlike this season's collection, her performance will be a perennial favorite, one not likely to soon go out of fashion.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wardrobe malfunction,"Sorry, not my cup of meat at all, to paraphrase Dylan, a chick-flick based on chick-lit - obviously this was my wife's choice for our Saturday night movie! That said, I really did sit down and try to give the movie every chance to entertain me, I mean I love US TV sit-coms which accomplish comedy by presenting likable characters in humorous situations with quick-fire dialogue and, yes, even gags but this flashy empty so-called rom-com scored zero out of three on that scale.Instead all I saw was a product placement paradise, so much so that I don't doubt the constantly name-checked contributors probably met the full budget for the film! Impossible you may say to make a film about the fashion magazine business without advertising every other fashion house (was Prada the highest bidder, I wonder?) and magazine chain, but it was so in my face and obvious that it distracted from the fare on the screen.The characters were all cardboard-thick (the oxymoron is deliberate) caricatures, Meryl Streep getting her ""Analyse This"" make-over to zero effect and Anne Hathaway improbably transformed from geeky, kooky pleb to a made-up, power-dressed woman of today. The characters are too over-exaggerated, not helped by everyone over-acting for all their worth and the plot situations too obviously contrived, despite the true-to-life locations. Hathaway's character, for instance, the (I hesitate to use the word) epicentre of the film and the gal we're all meant to root for, loses all empathy and sympathy with the audience by betraying her ordinary average guy fiancé for a one-night stand with Mr hunky, career-assisting super-journalist in glitzy Paris! I'll just accept that I'm obviously way too far out of the demographics here for the film to connect with me, but, despite being way over 40, happily married and living in Scotland, I still got ""Friends"" a sit-com about single 30-somethings in New York...A movie as facile and empty as the world it seeks to further glamourise.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprising Good - realistic portrayal of the struggle and fun of a good-hearted-smart-beautiful young lady,"This is actually surprisingly good. Before watching it, I thought the script is going to be filled up with quite 2 dimensional-stereotypical characters. But to my amusement, it's actually quite realistic and believable.Hathaway's performance is nice. Streep's character is NOT MEAN ENOUGH. Yes, no kidding, I've come to expect more EVIL from the ""DEVIL"" than her. She is nothing more than a blunt, hyper-critical, ultra demanding (to the point of extremes) boss, but nonetheless,a highly capable and smart working professional. In real life, young girls right out of college often encounter even worse bosses, the stupid/incompetent kind, but jealousy prone (she might hate that your porcelain skin contrasts her lifeless, dull skin, etc., or that you are potentially smarter and certainly more creative at problem solving than she does, or something alone that line).After watching it, I felt like ""What?? that's the devil? huh?"" The curiously John Galiano looked a like, Christian Thomson character and the Nigel character really makes this whole film credible. Andrea's effects on them looked ""natural"" and it's quite enjoyable to see these ""pretty girl-older men"" relationship-dynamics unfold itself.On the whole, it's a good realistic young lady's struggle/adventure story from Lauren, I am going to read her next book, ""Everybody worth knowing"".",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun with fashion,"I was prepared to be bored into a slow and tedious death by what I mistakenly perceived to be a real dull ""chick flick"". But I was happily surprised. This film is a fine example of how a subject that would seem devoid of interest can be just the opposite. And it owes a great part to the characters. Just when you begin to think, ""a real person wouldn't act like that"". A motivation for such behavior is revealed, and it makes sense. I found the characters to be emotionally engaging, therefore was drawn in caring about what happens. This film might be nominated for several Oscars including Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor. And Best Screenplay Adaptation from Another Source, just for the dialogue alone. The acting, the sound track, cinematography and locations are all really great. If someone is looking for a painless ""Date Flick"", I'd recommend this one. Any guy would come away unscathed and not feeling like they had spent a week in a darkened movie theater. And he'd score ""Great Guy"" points as well. spa rack up the points and see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
surprisingly awesome,"I didn't read the book, and had no idea what this movie was about...and still enjoyed it. the movie made me examine my life and find what i need to do to be fulfilled. Ann Hathaway portrayed Andi well, even though i cant look at her the same after Broke back Mountain, her fashion was on point, and she didn't overact. I do love the fact that Ann's character didn't change everything about herself, just a little makeup, a hair trim and some new/stylish clothes...OK, so it was an overhaul, but she was very put together and classy. Meryl was the best part of the movie...a great boss to work for...someone who makes you prove yourself and your values...straight forward is the way to be! Emily was deceitful, transparent, and fake...everything that the fashion world seems to be made of. I think that the product placement was pretty ""in your face,"" but necessary for this type of film...the Tab energy soda that flashed for two seconds was the worst example of product placement.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cute (don't think about it!),"Mostly because of the brilliant moments of clarity in dialog, this is a cute movie as long as it's not taken too seriously. However, if the viewer takes a moment to wonder why the characters seem to be completely unable to communicate off-screen and thus unable to resolve what would otherwise be very minor issues, it becomes extremely stressful.Meryl Streep is excellent, as always. She shows a range a strength and vulnerability that is both beautiful and realistic. Anne Hathaway counters with completely social chameleon behavior by a character who is set up as an independent go-getter. Who was really meant to be the devil in Prada?Also, beware rampant ""fashonista"" mentality of a size six as fat!",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I saw it once and am glad I did.,"Yes, the principals are excellent doing their jobs. However - for me Emily Blunt stole the show followed very closely by Stanley Tucci, these two really took their roles, started in the basement with them, and proceeded to ascend to the Penthouse.Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are, figuratively speaking, guardian angels to the newly hired young lady.If I had invested in this production, I would be very pleased with the end result. There were some snafus to be sure, but I didn't feel that they took away from the interesting story, or the sometimes frenetic pace.Well worth seeing at least one time, worth the price of a ticket. If you wish rent or buy it, you may watch it more than once.A well earned plus is that two very picky friends of mine liked it very much, and that carries some weight with me, a non reviewer:)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anne Hathaway delivers an awesome performance in a Well-Written Film,"Entertaining? Hell Yeah.Meaningful?

A little look into the Fashion Industry,"This is a great film for everyone related (or not) with Fashion. I liked the way it portrays how serious and demanding a job in a fashion magazine could be. It subtly shows the benefits that comes with the job without looking like a fashion advertisement.Miranda could have been more severe, but equally, the character was very related to its bases (the book and Anna Wintour). It is very focused on Andrea while she manages her personal and professional life and also shows the opinions that everyone around her has on her life decisions.It is real, charming and optimistic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You must watch this movie,"I like very much this movie. It's that kind of cool New York high style comedy/drama with a great soundtrack.The characters is very well built and have a lot of personality. Maryl Streep is great as Miranda, the ""satanic"" editor of the fashion magazine and Anne Hataway is cute just as Audrey Hapburne in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".I like too much the rhythm of the movie, it's fast, it's modern, it's like going to a cool dance club. Pay attention to the scene when Anne is walking from the street to the office and every cut shows her in a different clothing.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Streep is the Boss!,"By the time I wrote this review, I haven't read the entire ""Devil Wears Prada"" novel yet; however, I heard this movie does follow the book pretty well and does it justice. The movie's steady-paced and somewhat intriguing plot tells the story of naive Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who comes to New York and lands a job as the assistant to the demanding and cynical Miranda Priestly, one of the city's big-time magazine editors.I enjoyed watching Miranda Priestly's (Meryl Streep) performance the most - devious, sarcastic, a go-getter and one who expects the job to be done. It is amusing to watch her intimidate Andy and her co-workers with her presence and her flashy clothes, and it is interesting to see Miranda run the entire company with a queen-like approach. Her telling Andy that people would line up to get her job as assistant reminded me of some of the earlier jobs I had in government offices - pay is not grand, but the workplace is prestigious.While the majority of the film is focused on Andy meeting Miranda's demands and deciding how she wants to continue with her life, which I thought was a fascinating plot, I thought the subplot of the romance between her and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) was boring and dragged the movie's pace.Overall, it is a very nice film and is mostly entertaining for a comedy drama.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
