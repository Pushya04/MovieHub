"""The thing-a-ma-bob that does the job is bibidi bobidi boo""","Not the best of Walt Disney's feature length animated films, but any film that has Bibidi Bobbidi Boo and A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes has to rate as good in anyone's standards.I saw this for the first time as a small child on Walt Disney's Disneyland hour and it was as effective on the big screen as well as the small. I don't think there's anyone who is literate in the western world who does not know the story of Cinderella. The story is intact and kept in the mythical medieval times it was written for.As a subplot to the main story we have the story of Cinderella and her relationship with the animals around the house. The pecking order is dog, cat, mice with a horse thrown in for good measure. Naturally the evil stepmother who is voiced by Eleanor Audley has the cat as her favorite. What does that say about us cat lovers.Ilene Woods voices and sings A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes which Perry Como made a big hit record of. Bibidi Bobidi Boo is sung by Verna Felton who voices the Fairy Godmother. She's unforgettable in this role although she's better known as Hilda Crocker, Spring Byington's Ethel Mertz on December Bride.This is one eternal film that I hope my niece let's my new grandnephew check out and his sister or brother to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Magic at its best,"This is another Walt Disney Classic (I know every film from that Time Period is a classic but still!), we all know the story of Cinderella so no plot to spoil really. But Disney's artists did a wonderful job in making this film truly look like an animated kids story book. I think that conventional artistry is or will soon be a forgotten art in today's 3D Animation CGI world. The rags to riches ball gown transformation scene and the pumpkin to a coach fit for a princess are just stand out beautifully drawn with excellent attention to detail. And lest we forget the soundtrack as always some lovely songs from Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston like ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" that enhance both the scenario and the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful Disney animation with some pleasant songs...,"When I first saw 'Cinderella', I found it surprising that the mice had so much to do whereas in the fairy tale they were just incidental creatures. But Disney saw that giving them a big role in the main storyline was the key to providing all the humor and suspense needed to spice up the predictable story. The leading mice, Gus and Jaq are delightful creations and the valiant band of mice are given amusing bits of business.Artistically, the animation art has a rather glossy modern look despite the fact that it's an old, old story from 1697, a classic children's fairy tale that has been done countless times as either a film, a play or a ballet. But this version will charm Disney fans young and old with its imaginative use of animation and a splendid collection of tuneful songs.A highlight is the 'Cinderella Work Song' in which the mice make a dress for the mistreated Cinderella, full of inventive comic touches and accompanied by the intricate blend of song and animation. Add to that 'So This Is Love', 'A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes' and 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' and you have a charming version of the Charles Perrault story.For villainy, the stepmother and her black cat (Lucifer) are two of the most brilliantly animated creatures in the film. The cat reminds me of a naughty black cat I once owned. The scene where the stepmother is stroking the cat as she gives Cinderella a list of chores is striking in its use of shadow and menace. Along with some dark touches, there is always a bubbling sense of humor, particularly in this sequence.Cinderella herself comes across as a pleasant heroine with a sense of humor herself, lifelike in her movements and one of Disney's more successful human figures. Disney's artists did greater art work in other films but this is a well-structured work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal.",,Anonymous,Animation
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-BEAUTIFUL!,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated ""Sleeping Beauty"" which made it's debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: ""Cinderella"" (1950). Of the three films, ""Cinderella"" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike ""Snow White"", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. ""Cinderella"" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like ""Snow White"", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting.A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale"" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"") her own show-stopper.Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.In conjunction with the film's 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) ""Cinderella"" has just been released on a special edition DVD. It simply has never looked better. The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a ""Dream Come True.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanting and enthralling adaption of a classic fairy tale.,"Walt Disney's CINDERELLA takes a story everybody's familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense, while retaining the tale's essential charm. Disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere. It is beautifully, if conventionally, animated; the highlight being the captivating scene where the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown. Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston provide lovely songs like ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" that enhance both the scenario and the characters.Even though CINDERELLA's story is predictable, it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends.  Both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat Lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and the mice. It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers' interest.  The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers.  It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them.  Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A success, on the whole","People criticise Disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy, set in landscapes that are much too pristine.  That criticism is just.  And yet it can't be the whole story, because the two least glossy - ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"" - are also the weakest. ""Cinderella"", on the other hand, set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles, is clearly the best.It DOES look good.  The backgrounds are subtle and consistent; the colours are pure without being too bright.  The animation varies a bit.  I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself) aren't full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough.  It's really the animals that make the movie.  I think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before, as totems rather than sidekicks.  The mice, for instance, are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless Cinderella.  The cat, Lucifer, is a kind of witch's familiar to the Wicked Stepmother.  (The cat is brilliantly conceived and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time.  The supervising animator was Ward Kimball and he modelled it on his own cat.  I wonder how he put up with the animal.)  This approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story.  Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story.Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the King and the Grand Duke.  The King is a one note character - he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion.  The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as Cinderella does.  (Although he, of course, is richer.)""Cinderella"" is Disney's return to features after an eight-year hiatus, and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years.  Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking ""Cinderella"".  She's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that.  (Maybe I'm wrong on this score - I haven't seen the recent ""Ever After"".)  Nonetheless it is remarkable how successful Disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life, without cutting across the grain of its spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Straightforward Disney rendering of the fairy tale...,"Beautiful young woman, orphaned and living with her evil stepmother and two jealous stepsisters, hopes to attend the Royal Ball in the castle on the hill but may be thwarted by her cruel keepers and a decidedly nasty cat named Lucifer. Animated classic from Walt Disney has the company's signature style, but the scenarists skimp on the background details. Walt wasn't exactly into character development, and our heroine seems a bit of a masochist (one has to wonder, especially in this age, why she doesn't stick up for herself; does she feel trapped or is her isolation a comfort to her after her father's demise?). The friendly, chattering mice who help Cinderella provide comic relief, and there are at least two excellent songs (""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes""), but the movie is on the slim side--running a scant 74mns--and is reminiscent of ""Snow White"" besides. There are moments of gorgeous animated magic, and yet the picture is loaded up with villains. The pacing seems to stall in the third act when what we could have used was more of the grandmotherly Fairy Godmother (who literally vanishes). Nonetheless, ""Cinderella"" is exquisite to look at and has some very funny slapstick. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Childhood Classic of My Children and Mine,"In a small kingdom, the happily child Cinderella loses her beloved mother and his father marries with the cruel Lady Tremaine, who has the mean daughters Drizella and Anastasia. When her father dies, Cinderella becomes a servant in her own house and her stepmother and sisters feels only hatred for her. Cinderella's only friends are four mice, a dog and a horse that live in the house.When the King decides that his son, the Prince, should get married, he invites every maiden in his kingdom to a ball in order that the Prince could choose his bride. However, Cinderella's cruel stepmother does not allow her to attend the ball. When Cinderella is hopeless of going to the Royal Ball, her Fairy Godmother appears and uses magic to help her to make her dream come true. But she must leave the ball before midnight since the magic effect will end.""Cinderella"" is one of the classics produced by Disney that belongs not only to my childhood, but also to my daughter and my son's childhoods. This adorable fairytale is wonderful and should be mandatory to every child in the world. I do not have much to say, since I believe that most of the readers certainly know the story of ""Cinderella"". I feel sorry for those that have written stupid things about this lovely fantasy – what a poor childhood they had. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cinderela"" (""Cinderella"")",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I know I'm going to take heat for this...,"but ""Cinderella"" gets my vote, not only for the worst of Disney's princess movies, but for the worst movie the company made during Walt's lifetime. The music is genuinely pretty, and the story deserves to be called ""classic."" What fails in this movie are the characters, particularly the title character, who could only be called ""the heroine"" in the loosest sense of the term.After a brief prologue, the audience is introduced to Cinderella. She is waking up in the morning and singing ""A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes."" This establishes her as an idealist (and thus deserving of our sympathy). Unfortunately, the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about. Freedom from her servant role? The respect of her step-family? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds? In one song (cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD) Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently. You go girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very bland character. She passively accepts her step-family's abuse, escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief. She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family. For this, she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear, a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except, of course, Cinderella. Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat? If Cinderella is dull, her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless. The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time. We are given no indication if he is a good man, if he respects Cinderella or anything. All we know is 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well. Heck, even the prince from ""Snow White"" got to sing a romantic song at least. Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting, it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot, weakening her already tenuous appeal.Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were, the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief, Cinderella's friends, the mice. Granted, these characters are amusing. Even so, when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, well, let's just say your story has some problems.Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as ""masterpieces."" While many of them are, there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way. Cinderella is a prime example of this fact.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical,"Let's not be coy, this is one of Disney's finest animated features. The characters, the colors, the music, it's all wonderful. The studio was at it's absolute peak at this point, with the terrific ""streamlined"" look to the artwork, that would be changed to a more ""rough"" appearance in just a few years following this movie.And what's not to like about it? Cinderella is one of the more endearing characters to come from a Disney feature, her stepmother and stepsisters some of the meanest, and her mice and bird friends, some of the most charming.Memorable scenes include the ""Nightingale"" number, with Cinderella's reflection in the soap bubbles, the evil sisters tearing her dress to shreds, her arrival at the ball, and the trying-on of the slipper. Add to that some great numbers like ""Bibbodi Bobbodi Boo"", and the mice's ""work song"". A wonderful movie, that never loses its magic, no matter how old you are.",,Anonymous,Animation
Classic fairy tale,"The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Even though a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics.It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. One of Disney's most ""simple"" works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and enchantment (which old Disney is well known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics.""Cinderella"" is somehow like a return to Disney's 1st animated classic (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"") because it brings back the fairy tale genre. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by Charles Perrault.There are plenty of likable characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy she sure is funny), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke.Jaques is very smart and amusing. I love his voice. Really has that mouse-like quality. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous.The King is hilarious, but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. They're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from ""Sleeping Beauty"" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) aren't much better than her. However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother.Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. Yet, there's nothing annoying about him.The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although not among Disney's best. The best song in this movie is ""Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo"".There are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten.Despite being simple-looking, the movie has good artwork, as well as its nice details, although never something ""out-of-this-world"". However, the King's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Symbol of the Disney Magic,"As a young boy, I always sort of hated ""Cinderella,"" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy.  I wanted ""Dumbo,"" but my sisters won out, and we got ""Cinderella.""  They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then.  My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces.  I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched ""Cinderella"" together.  With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched ""Cinderella"" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament.  Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away?  I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story.  Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like ""Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo"" and ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks.  I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney.  That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While ""Cinderella"" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history.  It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids.  I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there.  It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Story Dull; Some Very Nice Songs,"I've never been as enamored with this film as with other Disney films. First of all, the villains just are laughable. They don't' have the cruelty that they have in other movies. The prince is a dud. He is strictly window dressing, someone for Cinderella to fall in love with. But the real downer is those tiresome mice and their electronically enhanced voices. After a few minutes of them, I've had enough. Even the Fairy Godmother is a dull, undeveloped character. Cinderella's plight in the original fairy tale is hell on earth. Here she is mostly inconvenienced. I know it's animation out of the fifties and Disney is for kids, but when I was young I didn't like this very much. Again, there are some really good songs, including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes."" A theme for the whole Disney enterprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful,"Cinderella takes me back, when I was a little girl I loved the princesses of Disney. Cinderella was one of my favorites because I always was so enchanted by the story. Any child or family members will enjoy this wonderful and magical story.We have Cinderella who is a beautiful girl enslaved by her wicked step mother and ugly step sisters. She cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks. The only friends she has in the world are the mice in the attic that are so charming and musical. When the ladies receive an invitation to the King's ball to find a lady for his son, the prince, a.k.a. Prince Charming, they all get excited, Cinderella overhears the exciting news and asks if she could come too. Her step mother makes a false promise and says if she does her chores and such, she can come too. Of course, she doesn't keep her promise and destroys a beautiful dress she and the mice made for the ball. Leaving poor Cinderella behind, a wonderful thing happens, Cinderella's fairy god mother appears and creates a beautiful dress and carriage out of things from around the house and even makes the mice and horses into elegant horses and a driver for the carriage. When the prince sees Cinderella at the ball, he has fallen hard for her. All the ladies are jealous, including her step mother and sisters. But Cinderella must return home at midnight when the spell is broken, all she leaves behind is her glass slipper. The next day the prince is on a hunt to find this girl who fits the slipper and is making a stop at Cinderella's house where her step mother has found out about her night and locks her in her room.Can she escape in time to tell the prince that it was her at the ball? You'll just have to find out. Trust me, this is a true Disney classic with beautiful animation and classic music that is so charming. You can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece.

"Classic Disney, with All the Best and Worst","Cinderella is raised by her evil stepmother and two stepsisters, who make her do chores and essentially keep her as a slave after inheriting her father's estate. When the prince (with the prodding of the king) decides to throw a ball, Cinderella ends up going with the help of her fairy godmother and some lovable mice.The problem with criticizing ""Cinderella"" is that many of the criticisms aren't really related to the film so much as to the story it's based off of. Some feminists decry her reliance on a prince to save her from hardship (a common theme in Disney films). Others have the more general criticism that the film portrays women as little more than future brides with no life outside of her husband.You could also say that the film offers no real hope for those looking to it for inspiration. A girl in a desperate situation is saved at the 11th hour by a magical hag with a wand. Without her, Cinderella would be left to toil and the prince would have chosen some other girl to be the princess. In real life, no fairy godmothers exist, so I guess we are left to suffer on our own with little recourse.These concerns aside, the film itself is sound. The animation is great, and looks even better in the restored edition. I've heard some complaint that the ""dirty"" world of Cinderella is too clean, but I think that's really ignoring the fantasy element of the film. It's a simple but effective story, timeless. And the songs are now a part of our culture with good reason.I gave the film a fairly low rating because I don't think there's much about the film that pushed any boundaries. It really played it safe in every way it could. Don't get me wrong -- sometimes following the formula makes a good movie, and I think this is a good movie. But it won't get you recognized as one of the best movies of all time, certainly not by me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The most magical of all the Disney movies for me. pretty excellent too,"Cinderella....I hadn't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains that storybook feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character's all please. The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice making the dress and well you know the rest. To sum up the four of the Disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie.If you think about it Disney movies can really lost their charm. With Elene Wood and others the movie has such a feel to it, you simply can't help but smileThey say the moral of this story is that dreams come true.

Charming in places but otherwise pretty dull....,"Whilst this film is lauded as a Disney classic and a general film classic I found it to be a pretty dull affair overall.The animation in this film really is one of the films biggest strengths as somehow it translates that magical feeling the film is going for. This is why even if I'm not overly keen on some of the stories the classic Disney era will always get extra marks in my book. There is just something magical captured in well done hand drawn animation and it's something that cannot be recreated in these soulless live action remakes Disney have been churning out recently.The other thing I really enjoyed about this film were the side characters of the mice who brought a lot of fun and heart to this tale. The vile step mother really stole the show, everything from her character design to the superb dark villain esque way she was styled (those eyes) to her voice actor really brought her to life and added some much needed spice to this otherwise mediocre tale.Obviously this film is aimed at little girls and romantics of which I am neither so this film was really never going to win me over. However the charm and wickedness of certain characters mixed with the lush animation really elevates this film for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
So inspiring!,"Cinderella was one of the first movies I ever saw, and to me it is timeless. It is a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. My favourite animation scenes were the dress scene- I just love those mice, and of course the iconic Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo sequence. The songs are also lovely, not as good as Snow White's, but they are a delight to sing, and are reminiscent of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a Wish and So this is love? are standouts. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. The stepsisters were also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really evil, in comparison to a great character in the name of the Fairy Godmother. It is true, the movie drags slightly, with the antics of the mice with Lucifer, but they were genuinely funny, so I don't care. I don't think it is overrated, underrated don't you mean? It rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does on Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try the wonderful Ever After, or the lavish Slipper and the Rose, which isn't as good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I have the mistake of owning, because you'll thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Where's my fricking Fairy Godmother???,"Cinderella (1) (1950) -As I continue my journey to watch all of the Disney films in order I have to wonder what foul misery had taken over me when I last watched some of them, because this was the third film that I felt I had done wrong in my previous assessment of it.It was sweet, very fairytale and full of that magic that only Disney can deliver, although I still thought that it was a bit too simplistic and definitely had some elements that were more of the time, including the mice that didn't talk properly, their broken English was really annoying. Either have them speak a specific language or squeak, but don't have them bumbling through with the odd understandable word and the rest spoken like a deaf person trying out new words for the first time, because for children and adults alike these films need to be clearer than that.I have also found that the story itself has always been a bit flawed - Why didn't Cinderella's (Ilene Woods) glass slippers disappear at midnight? How come Prince Charming (William Phipps/Mike Douglas) was so in love, but he couldn't recognise the woman of his dreams without trying her shoe on? Why didn't the Stepmother (Eleanor Audley) and Evil Sisters (Rhoda Williams & Lucille Bliss) recognise Cinders at the ball, a haircut and pretty dress don't change you that much? And so on.Also, what was wrong with every other girl in the city? And by today's standards how dare the Prince judge Cinderella purely on how she looked?I did still feel that the ending happened too quickly and that I wanted to know more about the Prince, whether he was worthy of Cinderella or whether he was just some shallow 'Love Island' reject living on Daddy's wealth who only cared about appearances for one thing.I also wanted more of an epilogue. The build up to show Cinders as a put upon Sister who was made to do all of the chores, but who still managed to have a heart of gold, had been quite long so I felt that she deserved a bigger, more spectacular wedding and finale to round things off. It needed to show that her hardships were over in a way that would balance the struggles out with joy.Something to show her horrible ""Family""getting their comeuppance would have been good too.Other than that and if you don't take it so seriously it was a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon.It really didn't compare to my favourite 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991) but it did have a charm. I do still feel that the Live Action remake (2015) delivered the story better and made the romance more obvious between both Cinderella and the Prince though. It was the best of the remakes too in my opinion.An enjoyable enough watch that didn't require too much brain power and will entertain the Disney Princess in everyone.629.23/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I know that many people remember it for the mice and Lucifer, but look at the human figures: they're (with the exception of the Prince) perfect and truly convincing. For example the relationship between Cinderella and the stepmother is strongly rendered and it's clear that the girl fears that woman. The sequence of the fairy godmother is one of the best of all Disney films (what a dream the transformation of the dress) and the ball episode is exciting and fascinating in both drawing (note the use of the shadows at a time when computer coloring was far away), dialogue and music (the Cinderella Waltz ""So this is love"" is enchanting).",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not the strongest Walt Disney-produced effort, but still another good family film","""Cinderella"" is a VERY famous fairy tale, and I remember it from my childhood in more than one form, but don't recall ever seeing much of this 1950 Disney movie version. I guess I was reminded of this film's existence from watching ""Enchanted"" last week, which is a parody/homage to the Disney princess movies, including this one. I have to admit, as popular as that comedy/fantasy flick is, I thought it was annoying, and it was the third 2007 film I've seen which I personally found to be an incredibly overrated turkey (the other two being ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"")! Still, I watched this particular version of ""Cinderella"" a little over a week later, expecting it to be a lot better than the hit 2007 Disney film, and I was not proved wrong.Cinderella used to live happily in a castle as the daughter of a widowed aristocrat who remarried to Lady Tremaine, a woman who already had two daughters of her own, Anastasia and Drizella. Sadly, since her father's death, Cinderella has been mistreated by her cruel stepmother (who never showed her true nature until after death of Cinderella's father) and spoiled stepsisters, who are jealous of her beauty. She is now forced to be the servant of the castle, but remains kind in nature and has many animal friends. One day, which appears will just be another day of chores for Cinderella at first, an invitation to a royal ball to find a suitable bride for Prince Charming is delivered. Lady Tremaine says Cinderella can attend if she finishes all her chores in time and has something suitable to wear. While the mistreated young woman has her animal friends and eventually a Fairy Godmother to help her get to the ball, her terrible stepfamily obviously doesn't wish for her to be the one who marries the prince!Watching this on DVD, I was very pleased with the animation, with some very nice backgrounds in the outdoor scenes. However, there were a number of things I didn't like about this adaptation of ""Cinderella"". It doesn't feature the greatest bunch of musical numbers in an animated Disney movie, and the film is off to a shaky start with Cinderella waking up and talking to her animal friends. The voice acting for the main character provided by Ilene Woods is also flawed, though it's not always bad. Her mouse friends provide comic relief, but I didn't find them very funny. I did find them mildly amusing at times, with them trying to get their food without getting captured by Lucifer the cat and such, but I've seen much funnier characters in Disney animation. With these gags, it takes a little too long to get into the story. Better comic relief in this film is provided by The King. Even though this character doesn't make as many appearances, he certainly made me laugh. The story gets more entertaining as it goes along, and most of the characters stand out, including the lead.During my childhood, I remember seeing part of an animated film featuring a cat named Lucifer, but didn't know it was this movie. Like I said, I don't recall seeing much of this particular Disney flick as a kid (unlike a number of other Disney animations, some produced by Walt Disney during his long career, like this one, and some made after his death), but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I had seen it all. Finally watching it from start to finish in my 20's, I felt I would have liked a lot of it better as a kid, including the scenes with the mice, but overall, I still thought it was a decent piece of animation. Also, I'm not sure haw many readers will approve of me saying this, since Cinderella is a cartoon character and this is a squeaky clean family film, but during my recent viewing of the film, I thought the main character was hot, which obviously wouldn't have been the case when I was a kid! Anyway, if you're a Disney fan, regardless of age, I can't think of any reason why this 1950 production wouldn't be worth watching. It's still an entertaining family film after sixty years.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A deeply beloved animated classic,This is very easily one of my Disney animated films ever made because it is such a delightful adaptation of the classic fairy tale.

A classic animation from Disney that is still charming after almost seventy years,"This classic animation from Disney is based on one of the best known fairy tales. It tells the story of Cinderella; the daughter of wealthy landowner whose life is turned upside down. First her mother dies then her father marries a woman with two daughters of her own. Shortly afterwards her father dies and her step mother shows her true colours. Cinderella is now treated like a servant at the beck and call of her step family. Her only friends are the local animals; in particular the mice who live in the chateau. The king of the country wants his only son to marry so arranges a ball to which every eligible young woman in the kingdom is invited. Her step mother tells her she can go but places impossible conditions... she doesn't count on the help of Cinderella's fairy godmother though.This film is a delightful retelling of the classic fairy-tale... unsurprisingly it omits the gory details in some versions of the story. While the ball and search for the girl who the glass slipper fits are the most remembered elements they account for a relatively small part of the film. More time is spent introducing with the mice, in particular Jaq and Gus, as they try to get past Lucifer, the cat, first to get food and later to help Cinderella. These scenes are funny in a way familiar to any fan of 'Tom and Jerry' if not quite as manic. While the early part of the film provides the laughs things get more exciting towards the end as Cinderella first tries to get to the ball then as it look as though her stepmother will prevent her trying on the glass slipper which will identify the woman the prince fell in love with. The characters are good, most notably the fun mice and the genuinely mean spirited stepmother. Cinderella herself is a good lead but as the 'nice girl' she is perhaps a little less interesting. As one would expect the animation and character designs are really good and the film features some charming songs. Overall a charming film will that entertain young and old alike; a must see for fans of classic animation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Children will be entertained.,"Overall this movie is kinda dumb. Even though I was really bored when I watched this as a child, I'm assuming that it can only be enjoyed by children? I have no clue.

I think they made the most considering the subject matter.,"""Cinderella"" is among my wife's favorite Disney films and there is a lot to like about it. Although Cinderella herself is among the dullest characters (a problem with too many Disney princesses), the supporting characters are great. The step-mother is wickedly wonderful and Cinderella's friends, the mice, are delightful. It also is nicely animated and has some great songs that have lasted for many decades. But it also is not nearly as lovely to look at some of the earlier Disney films such as ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"" and lacks their artistry. Additionally, my biggest complaint is that the subject matter is way, way too familiar. EVERYONE knows the story and there is little in the way of surprises. It's very good and is probably close to as good as anyone could do with the material.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the most appealing fairy tale for girls.,"I think just every little girl or anyone that grew up listening to fair tales knows the story of Cinderella. It does give little girls the wrong perspective of marriage and all, but I can see why this movie can be enticing for a lot of girls and even women around the world. I actually like the secondary acts and characters of this movie. Even if Gus Gus can get annoying sometimes, but he atones for it at the end and sometimes that is what matters. Cinderella isn't a very standout character, nor do I think she is a strong heroine. And again it plays upon the Prince Charming saving her from all her struggles which includes her step mother and evil step-sisters. However when it comes to the overall package, it's actually a pretty good fairy tale movie from Disney. At least it's better than ""Snow White"", even if some may disagree. Even the musics are more memorable.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful animation and an intimidating villain.,"Cinderella is a classic Disney fairytale and has both the great villain who psychologically abuses our main character and the cute animal sidekicks to support our main character as seen in earlier classics.Lady Tremaine is one of my all time favorite villains in Disney's animated movies. Her calm and collected persona even when being a monster towards Cinderella makes her intimidating and believable. I often see her as an inspiration to my absolute favorite Disney villain, Claude Frollo from ""Hunchback..."" (1996). They share a couple of traits. Eleanor Audley makes a brilliant develish voice for her. What did you expect from the voice of Maleficent?As fantastic as the Disney magic is, it also has its drawbacks. Cinderella herself is a passive female main character. I admit that she is an innocent, kind-hearted, hardworking maid, and that is a great contrast to the spoiled stepsisters and Lady Tremaine's abusive nature, but it stops their. She is supported by her little animal sidekicks and her fairy godmother and never does take matters into her own hands.It is justifiable as a product of the time and by the fact that it is a fairytale where everything magically comes true.The one thing I find lacking is the development of the prince. He barely says anything and that annoys me a bit. His father and his right hand man speak way too much and that could easily have been more balanced.Enough of my complaints. I think Cinderella is a great fairytale and I really like it. Go see it if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For a Toons fan, it's OK (web)","Let's be clear: a lot of Disney movies are rather oriented for girls: royal romance, love songs, dance and dresses, we boys are not really into that, whatever the feminist and gender extremists would like! If you add the crazy king father, the ugly bad characters (why this link?), the sadistic cat and helpful dog (why this discrimination), the abusive stepmother and stupid henchman, you find finally a universe in which I don't feel happy, in which family love is nonexistent and that's a bit hard!At last, we have those chipmunks-like mice that bring fun and lightness! For me, they are essential to this movie because without them, it would have been simply unwatchable. It's not the speedy, delirious, crazy and funny Sylvester & Tweety but some moments makes me laugh!The other thing i notice is that for that date, this animation was showing the future of the live movies: Colored, powerful visuals and horizon lines, stunning effects, only those things was first delivered then by Disney and it would take 10 years before the gap would be shorten by true movies!If Snow White can appeal to every one, this Cinderella is above all a dream for girls and a honest time for boys!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So, This Is Love (?)....","""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!""Yeah. Yeah. I know full-well that the story of Cinderella was, pretty much, just an empty-headed, little fairy tale about wishful thinking, and such - But, all the same, I found that there was definitely some really peculiar problems with this tale (as a whole) that prevented me, as an adult, from giving it more than an average rating of 5 stars.I mean, not only was Prince Charming just another pretty face with no personality to speak of at all, and his father, the king, a blustering idiot of the highest order - But I also seriously thought that the Cinderella character was clearly missing some of her marbles and even teetering on the edge of insanity by having real conversations with a bunch of mice and actually fashioning clothes for them.Another thing that caused me to doubt Cinderella as being a rational-thinking person was the fact that she allowed herself to be locked up in a tower and treated like pure garbage by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. Like, wasn't there such things as ""Human Rights"" back in those days? Surely Cinderella could've found a reasonable out from having to endure the torment from these decidedly wretched people.I also found it rather odd that this animated film's most entertaining moments had little at all to do with Cinderella and more to do with the slapstick shenanigans that went on between the non-human characters, like Lucifer, the cat, and the colony of smartly dressed mice.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The classic princess movie that people still watch,"The classic Disney film, Cinderella sets the standard for years to come with its imaginative animation style, fun characters, and enchanting songs. Animators find a good balance between the silly gags of the mice characters and the enchanting scenes with Cinderella and her path from rags to riches. Some notably colorful characters like the king and Lady Tremaine help support the story with originality, though some characters like the Prince and the fairy godmother probably deserved some more screen time. Either way, the movie kept us captivated with its wonderful visuals, refined humor and compelling storyline.",,Anonymous,Animation
Missing that vital Disney Darkness.,"Good people are beautiful and can sing. Bad people are ugly and tone deaf.That's the Disney message here.Looks absolutely beautiful, though. The comic relief from the mice stops short of being annoying - often genuinely hilarious. I can't recall any real scares, though, and I tend to think it's the darkness in these old Disney films that made them special. Think of the Pleasure Island transformation scene in Pinocchio (1940).Also, I thought Cinderella looked way better in her ripped dress than the magic gown her Fairy Godmother cooked up for her. More edgy. But then again, this was 1950 and it wasn't directed by Luc Besson, so I should shut my face.Verdict: Classic Disney, from before the songwriting got too obnoxious, but missing the dark edge of some of the other early efforts.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cinderella,"Good movie, I enjoy watching the movie, The movie was funny, But I didn't like the mouse voice in the movie except gus voice, Cinderella character was good But she is not my favourite Disney princess, Lucifer was so funny and he was my favourite character in the movie, I recommend watching the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and Endearing,"I really didn't like Cinderella as a kid, but watching it now as an adult and in the company of my kids, I really enjoyed it. I know people have complained that the scenes with the mice and the cat feel like Tom and Jerry but it's great for kids. My son is 3 and he was thoroughly engaged in their interactions. Sometimes the chases made him giggle and other times they kept him on the edge of his seat. I think we should cut Disney some slack and give him credit for the fact that a film made in 1950 can be as entertaining for a kid in 2019 as it was back in the day. Plus why take a Disney film so seriously? While I hate when films insult my intelligence and that of kids, I also get weary of kid's films that take themselves too seriously. Simple, slapstick humor has its place too.
On the complaint about the main character, like other reviewers have noted, Cinderella is IMO a much stronger and likeable protagonist than later princesses like Arielle and Jasmine. Many modern Disney female protagonists are proclaimed to be endearingly free spirited and outspoken but if you really reflect on their behavior, they are self-centered, stubborn, and arrogant. They are quick to anger, they are self-righteous, and when someone has to save them from their own pigheadedness, they rarely express gratitude or acknowledge the trouble they've caused. Cinderella is the polar opposite. She is gracious and poised - she encourages the dog to try to make the best of things and get along with Lucifer the cat. Cinderella herself follows this lesson by good-naturedly serving her vile step-family with humor and a kind smile. People say she is naive or weak for not fighting back when her dress is ruined and when he stepmother locks her in her room. But from what I can tell she does stand up for herself as best she can. When her stepmother unfairly reprimands her for Gus' unexpected appearance on the breakfast tray, Cinderella does not cower in fear. She holds her head high, looks her stepmother in the eye, and calmly defends herself. When she is locked in the tower, Cinderella pounds on the door with all her might instead of sulking in a corner. She also reflects a humble and unassuming character. She is so grateful when the mice help with her dress. When the fairy godmother's magic wares off at midnight, instead of expressing disappointment, Cinderella thanks her godmother ""for everything."" She doesn't even realize that it is the Prince that she was dancing with, never expecting, it would seem, that someone in his position would be interested in her.
It saddens me to hear people complaining about Cinderella and confusing her strength for weakness. We talk so much today about accepting others, about refraining from violence, about love over hate. Well then, Cinderella should be one of the princesses we most revere and hope our kids look up to. We should all try our best to be grateful for whatever we have, to treat others the way we want to be treated - even our enemies, and to do our best in life. When we dissolve into a victim mentality or become self-righteous -quickly noticing the splinter in others' eyes yet completely unaware of the log in our own, that is when we become the weak, passive person we mistake Cinderella to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too much Filler,"Overall, it's not a bad movie. Unfortunately, there is about 30 minutes of actual story with 45 minutes of filler. There's a whole lot of mice, cat, and people talking and doing mundane things that are just uninteresting. As for villains, the evil Step-Mother and Step-Sisters are as obnoxious and cruel as you can get. I know it's a fairy tale, but I just realized how really stupid the whole glass slipper thing is. (And why is it a slipper instead of a shoe?) Why did the Duke go looking for Cinderella? Could the Prince really not remember what she looked like? Is she the only woman in the kingdom with a small foot? Not the best of Disney's efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Cinderella relishes in regality, but not even ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" could magically improve her personality.","Perrault's eponymous fairy tale, which in itself is a folk adaptation of Ancient Greek's 'Rhodopis', received over ten film adaptations before Disney aesthetically changed the story to be the child-friendly tale we all know and, supposedly, adore. Illusionist Méliès himself conceived the first iteration back in the nineteenth century! But when Walt Disney and his animated productions were severely losing money, causing insurmountable amounts of debt thanks to a certain global war, he unknowingly turned his creative eye to the last huge success he garnered. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.Adapting fairy tales became a speciality for Disney, and Cinderella was the catalyst for such a realisation. The female servant whose envious wicked stepmother and hideously vile stepsisters cruelly banishes her from attending a royal ball where the kingdom's charming prince is searching for a maiden to marry. We all know the story. The glass slipper. The Fairy Godmother. The painfully irritating vermin that consume half of the animation's already minuscule runtime. The fundamental question is: should Cinderella go to the ball or not? Both original and contemporary reviews suggest yes. Personally, the opposing side seems more viable.Cinderella, by all accounts, is aimed towards children with its family-friendly distractions one could find in a slapstick cartoon featuring animals. The elongated shenanigans featuring Cinderella's mouse pals, most notably Jaq and Gus, and aptly named sinister feline Lucifer resembled a Hanna-Barbera short such as 'Tom and Jerry'. Mice attempting to scurry back into their hole with considerable chunks of cheese whilst distracting said cat from eating them whole. Whilst it's incredibly cute and a simple method to appease younger viewers, ultimately it distracts from the central character. This isn't called ""Gus"", after all. Yes, shockingly the titular princess-to-be has less screen presence than her animal counterparts. A significant flaw.Audiences knew Disney and his successful animators could bring whimsical beasts to life and produce a moderately entertaining story alongside. But the remarkable weakness, and Cinderella proves this, is with human depictions. For each frame the animators attempt to make humans seem, well, human, they consequently diminish the personality conveyed. Cinderella, for all intents and purposes, has zero personality other than she is suffering and we're supposed to feel sympathetic towards her. Yet, when a glass slipper has more attributable characteristics than the soul wearing it, that's a problem. She somewhat expresses emotional complexities when the Fairy Godmother turns a giant pumpkin into a magical carriage, with Cinderella now embracing the life she once dreamt of, but it was too late. She was as dull as dishwater. The third act however does amalgamate the animal antics with the human characters to create a thrilling race against the clock.Regardless, the vital element that consistently surpasses all expectations is Disney's animated quality. Stunning backdrops fill the kingdom with picturesque locations, and a touch of magic in the air to illuminate the imagination. It's regality remains intact throughout. The songs were hit and miss, and is a weak soundtrack all-round. ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" representing the best, and that blasphemous ""Work Song"" indicating the lowest of the low.Understandably, Cinderella is a significant cultural pillar in animation history. Does that necessarily mean the feature itself is good? No. It is the most Disney of the princess fairy tales. Cutesy animals plague the human story that should've been at the forefront. Consequently turning Cinderella into a Bibbidi-Bobbodi-Mess...",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming Fairy Tale,"Cinderella (1950)*** (out of 4)Very charming animated feature from Disney about the abused Cinderella who is kept from a Royal ball by her wicked stepmother. Thankfully, with the help from some birds and mice, Cinderella manages to get to the ball where she's a hit with the Prince. Cinderella isn't the most original Disney film when you consider that the story had already been filmed before and I'm sure most little girls already knew of it. With that said, as familiar as the story is, the movie still makes for an entertaining 74-minutes. I think the biggest reason for the success is that the story itself is one I'm sure most little girls dream about and I'm sure many can connect with the lead character. I think the film remains entertaining for boys as well thanks to the supporting players including the mice who easily steal the picture. The battles between the mice and the overweight cat were a lot of fun and there are some terrific sequences with the two including one where two of the mice try to get some jewelry but the cat isn't going to turn them over without a fight. Another great sequence happens towards the end when Cinderella is trapped in an attic and the mice must come to her rescue. The vocal performance are all extremely good with Ilene Woods standing out as the title character. The animation is at the highest level, which you'd expect from Disney. Again, I think this falls well short of being a ""great"" film but there's no doubt that it's fast, fun and contains some memorable characters and a charming story.",,Anonymous,Animation
A decent one,"Brilliantly scripted, with excellent voice acting and animation, particularly in the shadow-changing scenes, which look amazing. The floating bubble and Cinderella's transformation are standout animated scenes. The music is also good, the songs 'A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes' is pleasant and nostalgic, while 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' is catchy and fun.All the antagonist characters are well-developed, with Lady Tremaine as a cunning and evil villain. Drizella, Anastasia, and Lucifer are irritating in their roles. Jaq and Gus provide plenty of humor, but their interactions with Lucifer are reminiscent of Tom and Jerry slapstick. Some of these scenes are a bit lengthy and unnecessary, which affects the movie's flow.Prince Charming is underdeveloped, which makes the third act less impactful, and the title character's screen time is surprisingly limited considering the overall length of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who doesn't love that moment, even those with the hardest of hearts couldn't help but sing along.It is a fairytale, so there are going to be elements that don't perhaps fit into today's society, but put it into context, and treat it for what it is, a beautiful escape from day to day reality.The music is sweet and uplifting, the voices were perfectly chosen.Enchanting, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This isn't one of Disney's best films (in my opinion), but holds it's own and is quite a beautiful story. With the mere fact that no one has yet commented on it shows how little of an impression it has on the general public today. Still, I believe anyone who thinks of Cinderella today thinks of mice, birds, and a plump and jolly Fairy Godmother; many of the elements first introduced by this delightful film. In addition, it spawned some classic songs like ""Bibbity-bobbity- boo"", and ""A dream is a wish your heart makes."" I think my favorite part is the mice singing their ""we can do it"" song while making a dress she can wear to the ball. I believe this movie was the first to introduce the concept of having two lovable side-kicks that the kids could relate to and enjoy: Gus and Jack (Aside from perhaps Thumper and Flower from Bambi). Disney realized the success of this much later and now include these types of characters in nearly all their animated movies.

When her evil stepmother receives an invitation to the Palace for a ball in honour of the Prince; she and her two selfish and spoilt daughters pull out all the stops. They leave our heroine alone at home where she encounters an old hag.

There are, for my money, too many talking beasties - particularly the mice. The squeaky voices, slapstick comedy (especially ""Gus"") and accompanying wind instruments grate after a while; the characterisation of Cinderella is so heavily endowed with saccharin as to be syrupy.

The weakest of the Walt-era princess films,"Cinderella (1950) was my favorite movie as a child. I would re-enact scenes as I watched it, dressed up like the titular character, and almost wore the VHS out. Watching it as an adult, I still get warm feelings of nostalgia; however, it is certainly the most bland of the Walt-era princess films.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959) are both more ambitious and visually interesting. Cinderella was made at a time when the studio was (not for the first nor last time) on the verge of bankruptcy and they were starving for a hit film. As a result, Cinderella was made in the Snow White model and feels much safer. The songs are memorable and the characters are fine, though not terribly interesting. Unlike many, I find the mice grating comic relief. Fortunately, they are balanced out by the cold-hearted stepmother, among the greatest Disney villains.In conclusion, an entertaining film, but not entirely deserving of the amount of celebration it receives.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic fairy tale,This film is a colourful retelling of the classic Cinderella fairy tale. The drawings and animation really bring the story to life.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Disney.,"First of all, let's discuss the positives of this film, namely the production value. The drawings and the animation are gorgeous, and the music is catchy and perfectly-crafted. It's not for nothing that people speak of ""Disney magic,"" and what else would come to mind but a fairy godmother and a beautiful girl? Disney's Cinderella is certainly a cultural icon.And that's really unfortunate for our culture. Because, you see, the writers of the script decided to favor the synthesis of the eye candy magic over the essence of the original story. Disney's Cinderella appears to be an unwilling captive in a situation so bad we cannot understand why she does not run away: she IS shown to be of at least moderately illustrious ascendancy and surely she could at least start out in a more worthy setting somewhere else before her masters take note that she's perhaps issue of an education not quite comparable to that of the other scullery maids?Charles Perrault's Cinderella was rather clearer on this point. Cinderella loved her father and even though his second wife and stepdaughters were cruel to her, she stayed behind to look after them out of love for her father, knowing he wanted his two families to love each other and to meld together. This is made clear at the first ball (in the Disney version, there is only one, and the story is robbed of commensurate death): the prince takes notice of Cinderella and gives her a plateau of oranges and lemons (a rarity in 17th-century France), and she immediately finds her stepsisters and shares the dessert with them. The message is that Cinderella had it all to move up in the world, deep interior beauty as well as outer beauty, and just a little bit of divine intervention (through her fairy godmother) cleaned up and allowed people to look past an otherwise soot-laden exterior. She was noble both in birth and in character and she deserved the royal treatment she ended up getting.But Disney's Cinderella does... nothing. Not even talk. And she gets the prince's attention. And what, did she just leave her father's second family behind once she got into the palace? Not that they didn't deserve it (they deserved much, much worse, of course!). But the whole meaning of the original is lost. Her stepmother and stepsisters are not seen at the wedding. Disney's Cinderella is just a pretty but ordinary ""nice girl"" who happens to be of noble birth and possesses little gray matter.What's the point?? I mean, seriously, this stuff is porno for little girls. Yes, everyone wants to move up, everyone wants to be royal. And I'm NOT a feminist.

Slippery,"Recently, I watched ""Snow White"" and was amazed again. So I had to follow it with this, which is a sort of nadir in the art of film.The story, is actually every bit as promising as ""Snow White"" was. In fact to my mind it is better.Unjust subordination. Magic. Love at first encounter. A sexual union. Loss (magic again). Search. Reward.Now, in the source stories, there are plenty of versions that were explicitly bawdy in the search and what was attempted to fit into what among all the eligible maidens. But even without this, there is plenty of room for fable elaboration. You could take this in many, many directions. These things are clouds of rich quantum possibilities.What does Disney do? Insert Tom and Jerry sequences. Where ""Snow White"" pulled short cartoons into long form film, this pulls by then well established long form animation back into short cartoon form.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The one that started it all, again....","The year of 1950 gave us three, perhaps four, great American movie classics. Mankiewicz's 'All About Eve,' Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard,' and, yes, Disney's 'Cinderella.' There is also Huston's excellent, gritty 'Asphault Jungle,' a landmark in American Film Noir, but it cannot reach the cataclysmic heights attained by these three upon their individual releases. And while the remarkably similar, and yet strikingly different, former two films have received their accolades time and again from critics, there seems to be a hesitance to give this classic its dues. After all, its a ""children's picture."" What many don't seem to understand, however, is this film's significance. They don't seem to realize that although 'Snow White' ""started it all"" in 1937, without 'Cinderella,' the American public would not have 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Aladdin,' 'Anastasia,' 'The Lion King,' 'Monsters Inc.' or any other animated blockbuster cherished today made after 1950. Walt Disney, at the end of his financial rope, took one of his biggest gambles in producing this project ""about a girl in trouble,"" and it paid off, making it ""cool,"" once again, to go to see a feature length animated film. He was, in turn, able to produce the subsequent animated classics of the 1950s and 60s, and, perhaps, his live action ones as well.Most remarkable is the way every aspect of this film seems to flow together without interruption or flaw. This is a film that combines the romantic, almost neoclassic technique to be found in 'Snow White' with the more picaresque, bubbly quality of 'Pinnocio.' The Nine Old Men, each with his own distinct style of animation, were able to find a healthy medium so that their characters, different in appearance and mannerisms as they were, could all coexist on the same plane. To watch the Siskel and Ebert review of this film, in which both men have differing views on why this film is great, Ebert preferring the cartoon antics of The King & Duke, the Mice, the Stepsisters, and Lucifer, and Siskel partial to the magnificent realist approach taken to stepmother Lady Tremaine's design, is a testament to the film's versatility.Music, both song and instrumental, is as crucial to this film as it was to 'Bambi,' 'Dumbo,' or, even, 'Fantasia.' Instrumentally, it heightens the film's drama (ex. the dress tearing scene characterizing the sister's hate and Cinderella's confused heartbreak) and suspense (ex. the retrieving of the key from the stepmother's pocket). In terms of song, the team took risks and endeavors not attempted before, most famously with the 'Sing Sweet Nightingale' number, with the blending of Illene Wood's voices. More importantly, I find it an injustice that neither 'A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,' nor 'Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo' were selected by the Academy to win the Oscar, surely either of these are more timeless than the song that was selected.The film's main point of criticism has always been its heroine. Soft and genteel, she is regularly dismissed as uninteresting and of not asset to the film. However, although Cinderella sports remarkably American qualities and values for a humble, French servant girl, she exhibits a sort of intelligence, perseverence, and creativity not to be found in Snow White, or, later on, Aurora. Cinderella's gutsy persona, that she was a rebel, was a source of pride for Walt Disney during and after the film's production. In the film's lead, we see the fabric that would lead to the creation of future model heroines; inquisitive Ariel, learned & feisty Belle, and heroic Mulan. If anything, it is the Prince Charming character who is objectified, and Disney's Golden Age can only sport Prince Phillip, and perhaps the Tramp or Bambi, as an interesting leading man.'Cinderella,' as a whole, has much to offer, not just as an animated film but as quality entertainment, just as timeless and worthwhile as 'All About Eve' or 'Sunset Boulevard.'",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Poor Cinderelly!""","Classic Disney adaptation of the Cinderella story. It's a charming, lovely fairy tale with romance and quite a bit of humor (perhaps too much for some tastes). It's not very fashionable today but it's one of those films that has stood the test of time and will continue to do so, long after one generation of whiners and malcontents has been replaced by another. The voice work is wonderful and the music enchanting. The memorable songs include ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" and ""So This Is Love."" The animation is the strongest selling point. It's Golden Age Disney, so you know the characters and backgrounds are well-drawn with rich, gorgeous colors that really pop.

My second favourite from their opening five animated offerings,"'Cinderella' is a good Disney film, my second favourite from their opening five animated offerings; behind 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.The first 30 minutes of this are a tad slow, though I can appreciate they are building up the character of Cinderella and portraying how poorly she is treated. Once they get that out the way, the film heads off in an enjoyable manner.Ilene Woods is solid in the titular role, though it's Eleanor Audley (Lady Tremaine) and Verna Felton (Fairy Godmother) who bring the best voice performances - they suit their respective parts perfectly. Jimmy MacDonald is notable as Jaq and Gus, also.You could argue that the famous glass slipper is flawed due to the time limit shown, while it would've been cool to get a deeper backstory on why Tremaine is the way she is - in fairness, there is at least some reasoning given.The maker's idea of what beauty supposedly is hasn't really aged well, but overall it's a charming production from 1950.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Has that Classic Disney Feel,"Cinderella herself is a completely passive character that one might actually call a little bland. Yet, she is still somewhat relatable is some degree due to her circumstances, which draw the viewer into the rather simple/ straightforward story. Fortunately she is surrounded by characters more lively and interesting then herself - the evil stepmother and her cat, many of the farm animals all of which are solid and effective supporting characters. Along the way are some pleasant and sometimes fun songs. The animation is well done, but the sets/background elements are a bit overly groomed and pristine, as though they are too well lit.

Classical and A Soft Re-Telling,"I really did enjoy this movie when I was a child. It was great at such a young idea to believe in love at first sight. I also enjoyed the ideal that a girl who was worthless and nothing could become someone amazing and marry the perfect man.I didn't enjoy her singing voice, though. I thought the vocal actress for singing was too high, my ears are sensitive and high soprano doesn't float my boat.I kind of enjoyed the second Cinderella more, it was probably because I was overwhelmed by the original story.When I was young I read the Grimms version, with the cut off of parts of the step sister's feet to wear the shoes, and all the other gore, but Disney did a good job of making it nice.

Quite good.,"I don't have many deep thoughts on Disney's return to feature length narrative animation. To me, it doesn't rank with the best of their work, but it's a very entertaining and charming movie with some excellent animation, music, and characters. What is most fascinating to me is the atmosphere around its release.After most of Disney's golden age masterpieces proved to be financial disasters, and after WWII had led to a focuses on cheaper productions and serving the war effort, Cinderella came about when the whole studio was in need of a hit, or else it would go under. Thankfully, it proved Disney's most resounding success since Snow White, another princess fairytale, and allowed Walt to break into television and, of course, his fascination with a certain theme park.It's not hard to detect that the film was made in more more desperate times for the studio, with its overabundance of rotoscope (quite a bit of live-action footage was shot even before production began) and animation which, though lovely, isn't as lavish as Pinocchio's or Fantasia's. Though I had issues with the rotoscope in Snow White, it bugs me less here since it's not as literal, and the work on Lady Tremaine is legitimately imposing. Unfortunately, the design work on the humans is pretty bland overall.Which is why we must be thankful for the myriad side characters who help Cinderella in her goal to become one of the godless, gluttonous aristocrats. Ward Kimball does a lot of funny stuff on the mice and birds, and Marc Davis has a few standouts too. However, it's Milt Kahl's work on the Fairy Godmother that steals the show. While Kahl usually detested work on human characters, he's clearly having a ball with this one, playing with her facial mannerisms and drapery to give a real sense of fun to the character. Bippity Boppity Boo may be an overexposed number, but her interaction with the effects and other characters in that scene is so enjoyable that I still love it.The plot is pretty boring. She wants the guy, her evil family won't let her get with the guy, her friends help her work to get the guy, she gets the guy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't matter when so many great scenes populate the film. Overall, I think the early fifties is a weaker period for Disney feature animation (though there were fabulous side projects like Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom) but this still shows why they could whip up an entertaining movie even when the conditions were problematic.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Dull But Still Popular Disney Effort,"This bland, tepid Disney cartoon remains one of the most popular animated films produced by the studio, but it has none of the visual artistry that distinguished the Disney style in its early days in films like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia."" ""Cinderella"" acts as more of a transition to the family-oriented Disney of today, that sacrifices artistry and content for popularity and merchandising opportunities.And, to top it all off, ""Cinderella"" has one of the most annoying soundtracks of any Disney film.

"An Art Direction Showpiece, If Not Exactly a Storytelling One","A beautiful Disney classic that helped to rescue the studio when their Snow White follow-ups failed to meet box office expectations. It's been a good thirty-plus years since the last time I saw this, so I was surprised to discover just how much of the plot revolves around singing, talking, garment-stitching mice and not the title character, her family or her love interest. Where Disney is usually able to effortlessly inject extra life and substance when adapting the shorter fairy tales, here those additions just feel like a tonally-mismatched sidetrack. The animation is lovely, of course, with the rotoscoped human characters feeling silky smooth and elegant in comparison to the rounder, more exaggerated cartoon creations, and the scene settings and effects work can be downright magical. I'd consider it an art direction showpiece, if not exactly a storytelling one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney icon,"After her father's death, Cinderella lives under her cruel stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two mean daughters Drizella and Anastasia as their servant.

Bibbidi Bobbidi Beautiful!,"""Cinderella"" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics, a status it deserves. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally awful stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry so he can have grandchildren), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand, and if you don't know what happens next, then I would seriously want to know why.I think we can all admit that the story of ""Cinderella"" as it appears in Perrault's collection wouldn't be able to pad out a feature on its own, so whilst generally staying true to the story, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks, much like how the roles of the fairies were later fleshed out in ""Sleeping Beauty"", or how Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" went from a minor character into the role of mentor. Two of the mice, Jaq and Gus, act as the principal sidekicks, with their own nemesis being a purely invented character, the obnoxious family cat Lucifer. The animal antics intertwine generally with the main plot, and reflect the general theme of the struggle between oppressor and slave (the little mice, birds and barnyard animals live in squalor, whereas the manipulative and selfish Lucifer lives in luxury). The film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since ""Cinderella"" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving and engaging of Disney stories. The stepmother is one of the most alarming of Disney villains due to her having a sense of reality. She doesn't use black magic like to get her way like the evil fairy Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"" or the Queen in ""Snow White"", but regardless subtly controls and manipulates people to horrific effect, including her own blatantly insecure daughters. In short, she uses people skills to a truly terrifying effect.The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", ""The Three Caballeros"" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The bold colours and whimsical, wavy designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, where the characters often play against silhouettes of dark blues and violet. The staging feels theatrical and expressionistic, suiting the whimsical and romantic nature of the story adequately.Overall, ""Cinderella"" ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all. It embodies that uplifting philosophy so present in many Disney films - dreams really can come true.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Too cutesy, lacks in the story department","Revisiting some of Disney's animated films as an adult I have found that some of the comedic bits are the part that bother me the most, particularly when they involve pointless animal sidekicks. They work for young kids, but they don't hold up so well as part of the story when you watch it as a more critically-minded adult. Cinderella is the ultimate example of that problem. There are very long stretches, particularly at the beginning of the film, that are entirely made up of a glorified Tom and Jerry cartoon, where we watch the mice scurry around trying not to be caught by the evil cat. It all feels like filler since they simply couldn't find enough story to fill a feature-length film. I didn't mind as much when the mice and other animals were helping out Cinderella, because it felt somewhat relevant to the plot, but a 10-minute-long adventure to get breakfast is tedious.The story of Cinderella is a classic, and I think it is told well in this adaptation. I think it might have helped if we met the Prince a little more, and got to know him. Perhaps even seeing/hearing some of the one-on-one time between him and Cinderella would have helped as well, so their romance doesn't seem to be a totally shallow affair based all on love at first sight. One of the best aspects of this film are the songs. I think this has a number of the most memorable songs from Disney's early animated films. Cinderella also has one of the most evil villains in Lady Tremaine. Without a single magical power, she is more devilish than Maleficent and Cruella De Vil combined. I want to like Cinderella as a complete film because it does have some of those good elements, but at this point the only way I can imagine watching it is riding the fast-forward button through certain scenes, which is not a sign of a solid movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A classic tale of dreams with Disney's creative animation that can't be forgitten, remade, or touched ever again!","Cinderella (1950) :
Brief Review -A classic tale of dreams with Disney's creative animation that can't be forgitten, remade, or touched ever again! Charles Perrault wrote Cinderella in the 17th century; now this is the 21st century, and we still can't get over it. I remember reading this tale in my childhood and then watching this movie. I was in love with Cinderella as a child. Now, after 2 decades, I am a mature movie buff with more than 5000 movies on my watchlist, so I decided to re-watch it. Something's changed. Guess what? It felt even better. The things I couldn't understand as a child, I understood as an adult and as a movie buff. I mean, it was in front of my eyes, but I couldn't see it. I had to wear the glasses of a movie critic to see them. How on earth did Disney create such a phenomenal animation piece in 1950, and people aren't talking about it much? I know it's a damn popular movie, but that's because the fairytale is popular. People don't really talk about filmmaking or the viewing experience. It is such a sweet, delicious, and heartwarming film, and it will remain so for centuries. Life can be bad, people around you can be cruel, and fate can take things away from you for a while, but you have to believe in your dreams, and by God's grace, things will end happily for you by some miracle or sometimes no miracle. Disney's animation team has been so creative and advanced at that time that some effects look unbelievable. Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, and this-I mean, how many times do I have to say that what Disney has done in the animation world and in our nostalgic world can never be forgotten or beaten? Cinderella is pure magic. It's heart-touching, it's emotional, it's metaphorical, and what not. Every character defines something-be it humans, pets, birds, or even the godmother. I just can't get over those 70 minutes easily, as I enjoyed every single minute of music, animation, presentation, music, and cinematic majesty. I won't say a film, but thank you, Disney, for this unforgettable nostalgia.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cinderella,"Cinderella is an enchanting fairytale that features strong segments that fully immerse you in the moment, unable to look away. Beautifully drawn, voiced and animated, it's a must see classic. That being said, it also tends to drag when the story tends to be more filler than anything.Directing is lovely, Disney animation that is just perfect. The landscapes are accurately fairytale, the lighting of the scenes, fantastic. Animation, the transformation scene, but also notably the faces of characters seem to be very well defined, and the steps between their animation is very well done, turning of heads, notably some of the best so far.Music, the intro is incredible. The hits we already know and love work really well. Besides that there is surprisingly not that much music on average. But when it's there it works, and that's what matters. Memorable for sure.Story, now I think in particular the focus is just a bit messy. I wish we got more time with Cinderella, and not the mice, which at one point seem to be the main characters of the movie. That's my main criticism, most of the mice scenes are close to feeling like filler, and there's just too much of them. I liked them at the start but it just became too much, especially the cat scenes. This in turn also makes the ending for me feel somewhat rushed, just like Snow white (although that had budgetary reasons to end fast) this ending could've used more spectacle to really wrap it up. At the end of it all the most memorable scenes are the intro and transformation scene for me. Just happy I finally got to watching this classic Disney film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinderella,"Cinderella 
It has been a decade since the last time I watched a Disney movie. Of course, the last time I watched one, I was young and naive, and not very perceptive. I loved all Disney movies for no particular reason, just because they were well drawn and colourful and had nice songs. 
Now, I decided to rematch Cinderella. 
Mainly because I watched a video where people criticize her for being a horrible role model for young girls. 
I'm a 21 year old cis-gender white male. I loved Cinderella. 
Okay so there's the Stepmother : A mean, 1D horrible person, who's quite frightening and somehow makes you want to be abusive to women. She loathes Cinderella out of consuming jealousy, and wants both her daughters to surpass her in every aspect. Probably because she herself has no confidence. 
And then there are Drizella and Anastasia. Two lazy ugly girls who aren't all that ambitious and who are brainwashed by their mother, and pressured to do many things they aren't even good at, such as singing etc. 
Then, there's the king. A warm-hearted yet hot tempered, lonely man who griefs his son for growing up too fast and wants to feel alive again with having grandchildren. So he sets up this gala which is basically a speed dating for his son to meet young ladies in hopes of marrying one of them and having children.
And then last but oh so not least, we have Cinderella. She's is a radiant beauty and the kindest human being I have ever seen in a movie. Enslaved by her stepfamily and abused, she's forced to do the chores all day long, and has very little rest. The blame is always on her, and she can't have a moment without her step family calling for her for the most ridiculous things. She was even more abused and humiliated when her cousins ripped her dress apart and to keep her from going to the ball. Naturally, she broke down. Might as well beat her to death. 
Yet, she faces her enslavement with joy and positivity. She has so much love to give to everybody around her. All of the animals love her and can't resist her kindness and beauty. She is jailed, but she's happy with it. Instead of fighting it, she accepts it and sees the good in it, and teaches it around her, (teaching the dog to like the cat instead of fighting him, because she knows he will be punished, and that's not worth it for her, she'd rather live and die enslaved and happy.) 
She's not free, but she's okay with it. She faces the injustice with love and kindness. Which is so brave, and so inspirational. In my eyes, she's the freest person,because she never gives up hope of being freed one day, and in the meantime she would gladly do the chores and wash the dishes and swipe the floor. 
To me, it's not a love story. It has a message of never stop having faith, and accepting the circumstances of your life, not in a passive way but in a mature one, and actually realizing that you can still be happy even with the worst conditions. The love part is only partial and is not exploited at all and I don't mind it. Even though the dancing scene was so romantic it made me drool. They definitely know their way around. She's a victim, but her actions couldn't be as far as those of a victim's . She's honestly a role model for every person who is trapped or lost or abused.
I also found the interactions between the cat and the mice very entertaining and funny, and the ways they always found a solution were clever. 
Each one of them has moment to shine, each one of them is important, each one of them has a role. 
Needless to say the fairy is only but a metaphor for a silver lining. 
I definitely want my children to watch Cinderella.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Safe and Solid Adaptation of a Classic Story,"Disney's 1950 adaptation of Cinderella remains a timeless and quintessential portrayal of the classic fairytale. Serving as a foundational template for future fairytales on screen, it embraces a solid and traditional approach.While the film exudes an enchanting, old-fashioned charm, it can also feel tedious at times. Cinderella is a sympathetic character, yet her flawlessness renders her somewhat uninteresting. The filmmakers themselves seem to acknowledge this, evident in the significant portion of the runtime dedicated to subpar Tom and Jerry-style slapstick involving the cat and mice residing in Cinderella's home.Nevertheless, the narrative takes a turn for the better in the latter half, shifting focus towards the human characters. This transition injects newfound excitement, particularly in the climactic final act as Cinderella endeavours to break free from the clutches of her wicked stepmother and stepsisters and proves her true identity to the prince.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's second princess,"Disney makes a comeback after 8 years and goes back to its roots, giving the audience its second princess. The movie isn't as innovative on a visual and technical level, but Cinderella herself is a more interesting character than Snow White and as a result it's easier to care and root for her.One admires her kindness, optimism and determination to make her dreams come true despite her tough luck. She even has a sense of humour.On the other hand, some of the secondary characters are painfully one-dimensional, such as her two siblings or the prince, not to mention the impossible romance is way too much. Lady Tremaine is a memorable villain but still doesn't hold a candle to the Queen from Snow White.The best part of the movie are undoubtedly the cat and mouse sequences with quick-witted Jaq and simple-minded Gus the loyal mice friends and mean-spirited Lucifer the cat.

Cinderella 1950 Review,"Among Disney's repertoire of classic animated films, their adaptation of the Cinderella fairy tale is one of their most renowned. Even if you haven't seen it, you're probably already familiar with its whimsical magic, character archetypes, and symbolism.Disney's animation is a very short and brisk film, making it easily-digestible and accessible. About half of the film focuses on Cinderella, the country maiden who's forced into servitude from her evil stepmother and her daughters. These scenes can elicit a good amount of sympathy for Cinderella and gives her struggle a decent amount of weight. In between all this drama, there's also a bunch of cute little critters who go around helping Cinderella while dodging an evil cat. These Tom and Jerry style antics provide the comic relief and peril that kids may find most enthralling. And, of course, there are a few cute and catchy musical numbers.Unfortunately, because the film flip-flops between the main story and the animals so much, it comes off as a very thin plot. No background is really given to Cinderella and the ladies she lives with; any motivation behind them hinges solely on their emotional state (which is fine for Cinderella, who wants to break free of her bondage, but all the villains are just evil for the sake of being evil). Even less is said for the royalty - Prince Charming may as well be a literal cardboard cutout, and the King is just wacky. Everything else is filled in with the goofy mice and animals - they tend to steal so much screen time that could have been used on other aspects of the storytelling. Despite these complaints, the story is simple and elegant, and it gets the job done. It relays an implicit theme to the audience that ugliness can be more than mere looks, and grace and love transcend physical and social boundaries.This film boasts pretty good-looking animation. Most backgrounds are well-detailed and stylish. Character and animal designs are much more spartan, but are consistently interesting to look at. Designs for all the settings, costumes, props, and such are straightforward. Voice acting is pretty decent, and the writing is okay. Music is catchy, but not the most memorable of Disney tunes.Cinderella is rather uneven and thin, but it's a good-looking animation with a few decent moments, and it tells a simple story that's worth seeing. This film is worth seeing at least once, but 2015's live action adaptation provides a fuller and more well-rounded story.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",,Anonymous,Animation

You may not agree with me, but, from my point of view, anyone who is capable to keep her head up, while stuck in a hard situation, and still be nice and optimistic is a great role model.Furthermore, Cinderella is not just your average damsel in distress. Unlike Snow White and Aurora, she does not dream about love. She dreams indeed about her life getting better, but romantic love is not necessary for her. She wanted to go to the ball to have fun and because that was her right, not to marry the prince. In fact, she didn't even knew it was the prince the one with whom she had fallen in love.She is not as passive as some people believes she is. Some people complain that she never ran away, but seriously, what chances had a woman in the 18th century alone and without money? Running away wasn't an option. But she won't let her stepmother to take away her few rights. She demands Lady Tremaine to let her go to the ball, and doesn't hesitate to sass out Anastasia and Drizella. She works hard in order to fulfill the conditions her stepmother put to her, and is quite resourceful (no dress? I'll make one). She is just a victim of her circumstances.Lady Tremaine, without any magical powers nor musical number, is still one of Disney's best villains. Her cold, calculating, almost twisted personality is a effective menace to Cinderella.The King steals the show, provides comic relief without being over the top or annoying, and is a memorable and likable character. Same with the Grand Duke and the Fairy Godmother.With the exception of Prince Charming (or Henry), who may be a bit dull, the other side characters are funny and likable.The music numbers are quite good. Some funny songs (The Work Song, the iconic Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo), other are just lovely (So this is love, Sing Sweet Nightingale). On the whole, enjoyable.However, I must say, as a kid I never enjoyed Cinderella that much. To begin with, the mice have too much screen time, and most of those scenes are slow and don't really contribute to the plot.Also, it lacks scary/dark scenes. Not featuring any dark magic, warfare or dangerous situations, this film doesn't really have much action, and can get boring. However, this also make it suitable for toddlers and sensitive children, who might be scared by the more violent Disney movies.A good film, worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Was cinderella really not for real?,"As a young boy of ten, I saw this movie for the first time, though it itself was seven years old then. More recently I've seen it on DVD, and I still like this enchanting film. The technicolor was beautiful. The only thing i didn't like about it was the occasional emphasis on the mice and the cat Lucifer. (ugh!) But all over it was an endearing film for people of all ages. I could see it over and over.
The artists of the Disney studio drew the characters with such perfection that the characters seemed practically real. I hated the mean stepmother, the mean stepsisters, but was so taken with Cinderella: I felt for her when she was treated so horribly, followed by her crying at the fountain. and too, the voices fit the characters well. Again, all this made for a wonderful Disney classicugh!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I guess Disney really, really, REALLY needs money.","We watched this on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at ""the Mouse"" than usual.Since this movie only runs 74 minutes, and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time, they had, and I'm not making this up, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes.  And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a ""TV show"" hosted by the oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True"".Again and again, break after break, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie.Anyway, all this commercialism and cash-register-ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of ""Cinderella"", because by the time the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the story had left off.But of course, the original ""Cinderella"" still maintains its magic, and the story is still a good one, though we've all seen it countless times.  It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The familiarity and, frankly, simplicity of its story dampens its effect; still, it's a classic for a reason.","Seriously impressive animation-wise, this animated fairy-tale flows along at a fairly fast pace and is always an enjoyable, even slightly enchanting, experience even though most of its run-time doesn't live up to the moments it has become most famous for, instead being spent on strange asides seemingly only included to stretch the run-time and, as such, slowing the picture down slightly while also dampening its overall effect. 'Cinderella (1950)' is still a classic, though, and plays as well today as it did when it was first released, but the familiarity and, frankly, simplicity of its story makes for a film that isn't particularly complex or even all that engaging beyond its most surface of levels. It's an easy and usually entertaining picture that passes the time quickly but doesn't really affect you all that much. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very problematic Disney classic,"I'll receive many fingers down, but I need to be true to myself. As a child, I watched Cinderella oftentimes - I had a VHS. It is without doubt one of the most famous Disney classic, was a resounding success when released and was the film that saved the Disney studio going bankrupt. But leaving its historical significance aside, watching Cinderella today as an adult, I realize how this animation is problematic.To start, this movie has several scenes of secondary characters just for comic relief - the mice and the cat - what absolutely does not contribute almost nothing to the central story, feeling as a filler. Disney princesses films have a tradition of have fantasy stories, with lots of magic involved. But discarding the scene in which the fairy godmother appears to sing the song ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" (undoubtedly the pinnacle of the film) and the scene where the clock rings and Cinderella flees the Prince (which, together, does not reach even ten minutes), there is absolutely no magic remnant throughout the rest of movie - ever stopped to think about it? 80% of the movie, we just have Cinderella and mice in the stepmother's house doing trite and mundane things, or scenes with the King in the castle dreaming of grandchildren. Boring.Then we have a poor character development. Disney's Cinderella is not a good example of woman and heroin. She's a bland character, accepting mistreatment with passivity, and she always need others to get it out of their problems (mice, fairy godmother, the prince). Cinderella never changes the situation for herself. She falls for the guy just because ... he dances well? In no time the prince's personality is shown; we do not know if it will be a good husband to her, not even Cinderella have this certainty, but who cares, if he is rich, beautiful and is a prince, isn'it?And we have the animation, which is a bit disappointing. Unlike the beautiful painting that was Snow White (for its time), or stylish, graceful and unique backgrounds of Sleeping Beauty, the animation in Cinderella doesn't have anything extraordinary for a studio like Disney, and there are times really ugly looking. To this day I don't understand why the hell the animators don't draw toes for Cinderella. We're talking about a movie that the ""feet"" have considerable importance, are not we? Instead, we have a hideous ""close-up"" Cinderella wearing her shoes with her feet like a surfboard, or a quick sketch of a foot. I always thought it was horrible when I was a child. I mean, even a child of five years, to draw a foot, would have the decency to do ""risks side by side"" to represent toes.Seriously, Disney. You could have done much better.I gave two stars just for the excellent and beautiful animated sequence ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"".",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
More Disney Magic.,"Disney's animated ""Cinderella"" is another winner from the famed studio. The story is naturally about the titled character, a beautiful but psychologically abused young lady who has two cruel evil step-sisters and an evil step-mother. But she has a chance to get away from them and have her dreams come true with the help of her fairy god mother and some friendly mice. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute classic,"Is it outdated? Yes. Is the story full of plot holes? Yes. Is it still a heartwarming and often hilarious tale? Hell yes. It's very sweet. The characters you're supposed to like are loveable and the ones you're supposed to hate are very hateable, but not in a bad way. The songs are all timeless and beautiful.

A true Disney classic from my childhood.,"This movie has stood the test of time for me over the years. It is still one of Walt Disney's best classics, I think.I haven't seen many renditions of Cinderella on TV or film, but this one could easily be the ultimate and timeless adaptations of the fairytale. Cinderella is portrayed as kind and gentle, but strong-willed character that overcomes her adversaries and befriends her animal friends, including the lovable mice Gus and Jaq. They add comic and charm to the movie and helps Cinderella go to the ball to find her Prince Charming. The stepmother and stepsisters went overtime in being portrayed as cruel and devious, including their sly and mischievous cat Lucifer (I just wished their coldness towards Cinderella was more counterbalanced). And, the Fairy Godmother, as portrayed in this movie, makes you believe in miracles.This movie is beautiful from start to finish - memorable characters, sweet and catchy songs, fast-paced plot, and a story development that just flows naturally and ""magically,"" making it one of the those films you would know that has the definite Disney-touch, as opposed to the more recent movies from Disney.This Disney classic is a definite for the movie collection for any family.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic film for now and always,"Any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re-write of the Grimms' fairytale.

It is a classic for all children, especially those adults who are young at heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The last great one before the decades long slump,"Cinderella is a wonderful film that makes you smile the whole way through. It has a lot of similarities to another Disney masterpiece, Snow White, but it holds its own. By this point, Disney fairy tales were starting to fall into formula, but Cinderella showed that the studio was still trying hard to pay attention to the details. The animation is perfectly smooth (yes, they rotoscoped most of the humans, but it still looks great!), the songs are uniformly excellent (Sing Sweet Nightingale being one of the best), the characters are developed enough to be interesting, and the business the animators give them to do is fun to watch. A critical choice the storytellers made was to give the animals voices (though the mice are hard to understand at times). Snow White's animals were all silent. Yes, the animals in Bambi could talk, but the story was about the animals. In Cinderella, the story is focused on the humans, but the animals still talk. By doing this, the animals become more distinct and their personalities shine more clearly. Disney would change that for their next princess story (Sleeping Beauty) and the animals would be silent again. Pity, because that was one of many reasons why that film was so dull. There is never a dull moment in Cinderella. We are enchanted, we are filled happiness. Disney would begin to cut corners in both story and especially animation after this film. They would turn out competent films that would make some money, but not really show the world what a great studio they were, at least not until 1989's The Little Mermaid and the start of the Disney Renaissance. But Cinderella reminds us why we love Disney films in the first place. Not quite as good as the masterworks of Snow White, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, but fabulous nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of most overrated Disney films ever!,"I don't care if people bite my head off for this review of this Disney film or not, I'm just saying right off the bat: THIS MOVIE STINKS! I hate this movie and everything it stands for. It soooo overrated with people on this forum and in public pouring so much praise on this saccharine garbage. I don't even want to mention the plot (everybody knows it anyway). The movie is total rubbish and don't understand all the praise going towards this movie.

Quite good,"I always thought that Cinderella was a slightly weak heroine, and you'd have to reinvent her to make her at all interesting (which Ever After successfully did). It's a nice story though, aside from the fact that Prince Charming looks almost exactly like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty's princes...the stepmother is very good, and I liked how they made sure the mysterious gal at the ball WAS Cinderella (the glass slipper broke, Cinderella showed them that she had the other), because I always thought it was slightly vague for her to be judged on her foot-size.All in all, this is a nice story, but it doesn't make my heart melt like Snow White did. 6 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's finest,"Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of those films I think you appreciate more the older you get.  Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale.  I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release.  The characters became more dimensional than earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created.  With her kindness and dash of dry humor, she is extremely likeable; however, it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable.  Like many people she is an endless dreamer, and she holds onto her dreams, never giving up.  Even in the most adverse of situations, her dreams endure, and she won't let anyone take that away from her.  Her example should serve as inspiration to everyone, and encouragement to never let go of your dreams.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sweet, Timess Classic","This Disney animated classic sure does live up to the term, ""classic."" The characters here are well conceived, presented, and executed, as is the storyline, the premise, the tale, and the animation.

One of the best animations of all time. A must watch.,"Cinderella is one of those animation films I watched when I was young and I still love to this day. I know it's a fairytale, but I always thought that Cinderella is real. Her life is so pitiful and her love story is adorable and admirable. That is one of the reasons why I love this animation.It's cute that Cinderella can actually talk to mice. And the animals can really understand her, except for Lucifer. He's such a trouble maker.What I like is Cinderella's costume which was created by fairy godmother. The dress is so simple, but it's indeed better than that ugly one from live action film. The songs and original scores are also good too. Because everything's perfect, this animation turned out to be a great one.All in all, Cinderella is old but gold. Thus, it is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could have been more,"Yes, yes, it's cute, funny, a great visual, but the way the characters are used is very bad. The prince almost does not appears, the fairy godmother could have appeared in other scenes etc etc. ""Cincerella"" is the type of movie that, when the ""The End"" appears, you ask ONLY THAT? I found myself thinking that it could have a good 30 minutes more not being boring, but telling the story more interesting and detailed. If you see the DVD bonus material, you'll see some deleted scenes that could perfectly have been used with no matter. Songs are nice, colors are great, Cinderella is beautiful, but because what I have said, I don't like this movie so much. If you want a very well-told Disney's classic story, look for Snow White.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Appropriate rendering Disney-style,"This is one of Disney's top five animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the Prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that's about all. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture---in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.Favorite Disney additions: the mice! Also, appreciated the continuity--Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child--I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil Lady Tremaine to give up her hold over Cinderella and admit defeat---Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Geeky Randy's summary,"Timeless fairytale of a gorgeous, smart and sweet young woman who was adopted by her abusive stepmother and demanding stepsisters after her father died and is used as their slave. But when her dreams are finally shattered and all hope for happiness is lost, her Fairy Godmother appears and turns the remains of Cinderella's dress into a new ball gown with glass slippers—and when she is favored over other women at the ball, her stepmother sets out to hinder Cinderella's chances of marrying the prince. Bruno the dog, Lucifer the Cat and especially Gus the mouse certainly add an element to the already beloved story; and while the musical numbers are certainly not among the best to come out of the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, the songs are nevertheless fitting for such a wonderful and flawless tale.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strong animation with some iconic moments but a meandering plot,"The folk tale of Cinderella told by Disney.This is a strong animated movie with a simple story and a number of memorable visuals.The plot, depending on your tastes, is for me the weakest aspect of the movie. It is the classic Cinderella bedtime story popularised by the movie, but not a lot really happens to the main character throughout the duration, so it presents many scenes of visual humour involving the animal characters to pass the time in an entertaining way.When Cinderella takes centre stage it is in a number of compelling scenes. Her character has a bit more personality and strength than Snow White and the villain follows the formula of being the older wicked woman threatened by the heroine's youth and beauty. It was difficult to invest in the characters with so much other focus on the cat, mouse and dog shenanigans. That's not to say these scenes are bad. They are exceptionally well crafted, but for me are more suited to animated shorts.All that being said there are some iconically memorable moments, such as the ball, the mice attempting to retrieve a key and the grand finale involving the glass slipper.All this and everything else is fantastically well animated, with superb visual storytelling, clever angles, perspectives and physical movement of human characters. There is one sequence where Cinderella is washing and the floating bubbles contain her reflection as she scrubs, which is brilliant.As for songs, it isn't the strongest Disney entry in that respect for me. However, the voice performances in general are all good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fantastic for its Time, Not so Much Now","The 1940s was not a particularly grand decade for the Walt Disney Company. With the exception of Dumbo, all their animated features were financial failures and wouldn't be regarded as timeless classics until years later. As a result, the company could only make package films due to budget cuts and WWII screwing over their studio. It wouldn't be until later on that decade when Walt not only took a risk and made another feature length animated film, an adaptation of the tale of Cinderella, but also put the studio on a gamble. If the movie succeeded, the company would prosper, if not then it would shut down...what resulted was the former. Alongside being lauded back in the day by audiences and critics alike, Cinderella is to this day seen as one of the studio's most iconic features. As for what I think....well, let's just say that I respect it more than I actually like.The biggest issue with Cinderella is the story, which suffers from overly long pacing, too many subplots, and an overall straightforward arch. While the film sets up the lives of Cinderella and her step family decently enough, it isn't until roughly 20 minutes until the plot actually happens. Beforehand, it's just Cinderella working and singing, and the mice messing around with the cat. In addition, we spend too much time on the mice that we don't get to know enough of Cinderella outside of her wishing beyond her wildest dreams for a better life. I don't mind the mice per se and they do have their moments, but less is more. Admittedly, the film does pick up a little once we get to the palace, which has the audience in awe as much as Cindy herself...too bad the prince has even less character than the one in Snow White. The less said about the infamous slipper plot hole the better.As for the other characters, while Lady Tremaine does have quite the malicious mood and evil grin, when you get down to it, there isn't all that much to her. You could argue most of her backstory being unexplained makes her more mysterious, but the fact that she does all these horrid things to Cinderella without a proper reason just makes her seem evil....because. If anything, the step sisters stand out more from how humorous they can get, and that scene where they tear off Cinderella's dress is quite a heartbreaking scene within itself. Also, while the prince is blander than paper, the king and royal duke do make a rather entertaining couple given their witty banter and arguments, and their distinct personalities create some really genuine laughs for the audience. Oh, and the fairy godmother is kind and generous in her own right, even if she's little more than a plot device.Now while the story isn't all that great and the characters are a mixed bag, the animation is fantastically well crafted. It's been stated that nearly 90% of the movie was done with rotoscoping, and it shows in the final product as the movements are very smooth and the characters are realistically designed without crossing into the uncanny valley. As for the animation that's done from scratch, the mice and other animals have a rather cartoony style that perfectly defines their look and personalities. Even if we spend too much time on the animals than we should have, at least the animators made fun usage of playing around with their colorful movements and designs. The usage of a more dark color scheme whenever Lady Tremaine is around is another added touch of depth, making the more bright and vibrant colors of the palace much more astonishing in contrast. Speaking of which, the backgrounds display a quaint European style that looks well detailed, sharp and finesse, even if the environments are only a village and a castle.Finally, the songs in this movie range from forgettable to touching, but they at least serve the plot. A Dream is a Wish does a good job summing up Cinderella's desires outside of her fantasies, the mice's work song is the film's most catchy and upbeat harmony with fun antics of the mice making Cindy's dress, and Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo still holds up for how whimsical, enchanting and downright helpful it is. After all that hard work for nothing, it's great that somebody else is generous enough to make Cindy's wish come true, and it's hard not to song along to. The rest I unfortunately barely remember, as they felt sweet but standard, like it's the typical Disney charm we know and have heard better in other songs. Those other songs aren't by any means bad, and the singing from the likes of Ilene Woods, Mike Douglass, Verna Felton and more are delightful and stunning, they just didn't leave much of an impact on me like the rest.So overall, I can definitely understand the appeal of Cinderella for its whimsical charm, lovable side characters, beautiful animation, and a charming representation of what could happen if your dreams finally came true. However, I personally just can't get into it due to the boring pacing, bland main characters, hit or miss songs and predictable plot. If you love this movie with all your heart, keep on having fun with it, there's no stopping you. Me personally though, I'd skip this film in a heartbeat over other Disney films any day....that being said, I can't wait to see Cindy in Wreck it Ralph 2, get stoked for that.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes...,"After having adapted Snow White for the screen in 1937, I don't think there was a better way for Disney to return to the fairy tale genre than with the world's second most famous tale that takes place once upon a time.At the time of its' release, Cinderella was the company's first full-length feature film after a six-year hiatus due to all of the financial straits that were brought on by WWII. So, in crafting the film, Walt and his staff had to out all the stops and nearly bankrupted themselves in the process. Fortunately for them, Cinderella was a smash hit with audiences and critics alike, ensuring that Disney made enough money off of the film for them to produce many more animated films.However, the question is: Does Cinderella still hold up to this day? Is it truly the masterpiece it was hailed as in 1950? The answer to both is definitely yes!The film had many of Disney's top men working on it and it really does show. The backgrounds which were designed by the renowned female artist Mary Blair are not only beautiful to look at but are drawn in a way that gives them a breathtaking air of grandeur.The musical numbers by Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston are endearing, catchy and will no doubt find their way into your head after you've watched the film.Cinderella (gorgeously voiced by Ilene Woods) is a strong-willed, optimistic and independent young woman who you'll be rooting for the whole time as she manages to get all of the work her evil stepmother mercilessly piles on her without a complaint.Her mouse friends (voiced by James MacDonald, who also voiced Mickey Mouse) unfortunately get a lot of hate as many say that they take up too much screen time. However, I think that they are given just enough so that they do not overshadow the main heroine. Plus, with all the ways that they help Cinderella, I'd say that they are more likable and much better integrated into the plot than some of the comic-relief in today's Disney films (e.g. Olaf from Frozen, the Gargoyles from Hunchback.)The only thing that I would change about this film is the amount of screen time given to the Prince. Instead of having another scene where the King/Duke argue following the Ball, there should've been a scene where the Prince discusses his feelings for the girl he met.Other than that, Disney's 1950 adaptation of Cinderella is one that delights me as much as it did movie-going audiences of the 20th- century and will continue to have a special place in my heart for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very good movie that the current public ignores.,"One of the great classics of Disney Studios, this film adapts to the film one of the most famous tales of Charles Perrault: Cinderella, the girl who lives on the shadow of a cruel stepmother and her two sisters. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, the film was produced by Walt Disney himself and has an experienced cast of voice actors, animators and a great soundtrack, created by Mack David, that earned three appointments for the Oscars in the categories of Best Sound, Best Soundtrack and Best Original Song (for the song ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"").Personally, I consider this one of the best films that Disney Studio presented before converting to digital animation. The film managed to capture the magic of the story and present it in the same way that we do for our children. The film exudes charm, largely thanks to the way the animals become active characters, assuming very human attitudes and characteristics, something that wasn't usual in the movies that time. Nevertheless, some characters were poorly designed, and the King is the most obvious case: he only cares about the need to have many grandchildren quickly, in a caricature of the importance that royalty give to the dynastic stability. This is the most negative review I do to this movie, that can easily make forget this little flaws at a glance.Currently, this film has been criticized due to the glamorous and very stereotypical way that presents the story. However, I consider this kind of criticism quite unfair. The mentalities has changed a lot since this film was shot. In fact, the story in which the film is based is also the honest but passive girl, far from pleasing the current feminism's of our culture of ""woman-warriors"", independent and sexualized. People cannot see this movie with the eyes of this time, but it does not remove merit to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One Of The Finest Animation Techniques  I Have Ever Seen, Make This My All Time Favorite Disney Film.","Simply put: a masterpiece that will endure the tides of time. A fitting tribute to children all over the world by the hard-working animators that brought life to the colorful characters in the film.Even adults will enjoy this film. Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper (Italian: Cenerentola, French: Cendrillon ou La Petite Pantoufle de verre, German: Aschenputtel), is an Italian folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression. The first written version was published in Napoli (Naples) by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). The story itself was based in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later reprised, along with other Basile's tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812).One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of glass slippers.Plot: In a far away, long ago kingdom, Cinderella is living happily with her mother and father until her mother dies. Cinderella's father remarries a cold, cruel woman who has two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. When the father dies, Cinderella's wicked stepmother turns her into a virtual servant in her own house. Meanwhile, across town in the castle, the King determines that his son the Prince should find a suitable bride and provide him with a required number of grandchildren. So the King invites every eligible maiden in the kingdom to a fancy dress ball, where his son will be able to choose his bride. Cinderella has no suitable party dress for a ball, but her friends the mice, led by Jaques and Gus, and the birds lend a hand in making her one, a dress the evil stepsisters immediately tear apart on the evening of the ball. As they depart for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. She goes outside and starts to weep, when suddenly a soft hand caresses her shoulder and she looks behind. She sees an elderly woman with a kind face who professes to be her fairy godmother. She immediately began to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turned a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turned Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother told her to enjoy the ball, but warned that she had to return before midnight, when the spells would be broken.Watch this timeless classic to see what happens next...This animated film is based on Perrault's version of the tale. You immediately notice that the animation is very pleasant for the eyes, and the colors are rich and vibrant. The backgrounds and attention to detail is meticulous. The plot and script is well polished and perfectly adapted from Perrault's tale. Then we move on to the sound effects of the animated film. Again, excellence in the voice-acting, background themes and the few songs that occur in the film are very melodious.

The last of Disney's golden era,"Walt Disney's Cinderella, directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, reinvigorated the House of Mouse's box- office power after the devastation of World War II, while at the same time marking the end of their 'golden era'. This was, critically, their final 'classic' film (although fans of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) may disagree), and some of the art on display here is some of the finest animation Disney has ever produced. It also helped Walt Disney's huge ambitions, which was to take Disney to the new medium of television, bring children's dreams vividly to life by opening Disney World in 1971, and for Disney to become a global franchise in its own right.Cinderella (voiced by Ilene Woods) spends her days and nights tending to the many needs of her two bitter stepsisters, Drizella (Rhoda Williams) and Anastasia (Lucille Bliss), and her wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine (the wonderful Eleanor Audley, who would later voice Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty nine years later). When it is announced that the King (Luis Van Rooten) has organised a ball, inviting every maiden in the land to attend in a search to find a bride for his son Prince Charming (William Phipps and Mike Douglas), Lady Tremaine gives her blessing for Cinderella to attend. However, on the night of the ball, Cinderella's stepsisters destroy her dress, leaving her distraught and humiliated. But with the help of her Fairy Godmother (Verna Felton), she gets to attend the ball with the help of a pumpkin carriage, some mice-turned-horses, and a pair of glass slippers.The main draw of Cinderella, apart from the gorgeous animation, is the lead character herself, who is a truly sympathetic character and far less annoying that the usual Disney princesses. Tremaine and her daughters are truly ghastly creations, and their cat Lucifer - responsible for many laugh-out-loud moments as he tumbles with the mischievous residing mice - is no better. It's the plight of Cinderella that gives the film its backbone and emotional edge, rather than relying on musical numbers (though there are a few catchy tunes) and scenes of soppy romance, In fact, Prince Charming barely appears, but when he does it is short and all the more magical for it. It's also very funny, with the ensemble of animals on show providing many inspired comic set-pieces. Deserving of respect from both fans of animation and fans of classical film- making.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinderella is strong and morally principled,"My perception of Cinderella in this presentation is that she is strong willed and holding the moral high ground, rather than being weak and passive as alleged by some pundits, and it is gratifying to see so many fellow reviewers with similar opinions. Some naysayers say she should have run away, but in that era what could she have done other than be a prostitute? She would not have had the benefit of strong advocates for women's rights such as we have now. If she had tried to defy her tormentors she would have been outnumbered 3 to 1 and they could have forcibly evicted her or physically beaten her. She held the moral high ground by always being courteous to her tormentors rather than stooping to their level, and she got needed respite by dreaming about better things to come and holding out hope for it to happen.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinderella,"Walt Disney takes the fairy tale ""Cinderella"" and makes it into a nice movie.The movie sees the young pretty girl Cinderella who is used as a slave by her evil Stepmother and two ugly step sisters.It's enjoyable, funny, even thrilling for young children with the touch of little mice being Cinderella's only friends, who help her survive her terrors. ***",,Anonymous,Animation
A pleasant Disney effort,"Cinderella is widely seen as an iconic film. Not only did its success help save Disney from financial collapse, but it also crafted some memorable imagery and established themes that would reoccur in Disney's fairy tales. Most people know the story. Cinderella is effectively a slave to her cruel stepmother and her chance to escape appears when every maiden in the land is invited to the Prince's ball in order to find him a wife. She attends, with help from her Fairy Godmother, and falls in love with the Prince, but leaves only a glass slipper behind for him to find her. I think the simplicity of the story is what appeals to people, while its themes of perseverance and triumphing over adversity are also used effectively.Cinderella herself is not the most interesting of characters, she's pleasant and sweet but she's also a little boring. Yet her kindness is what wins you over, the fact she's always so upbeat and optimistic in the face of such hardship makes her a very likable lead. Some people might have problems with how passive she seems at times, but it adds to the characters sensitivity for me. I also think Ilene Woods has a very gentle voice that matches the character flawlessly. Sadly the Prince gets even less development and comes off as a total bore. He only has a few lines of dialogue and we never know how he feels, he appears disinterested in the ball and as a result the romance with Cinderella just feels weak.The animation is excellent and softer which calls back to the likes of 'Snow White'. However, the most impressive thing about the film visually is its size. This is one big film with every castle and every mansion looking massive, in fact the scenes at the Prince's ball are amazing in scope considering the films ages. The colours are bright and bring a lot of warmth to proceedings, with lots of blue and pink that blend together beautifully with the background. The music is good for the most part and there are plenty of pleasant melodies that suit the films tone, while songs like 'Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo' are bouncy and enjoyable.Possibly the best element for me is the stepmother Lady Tremaine. She is comfortably one of Disney's best villains and it all comes from her having control over Cinderella. She comes across as calculating and spiteful, always looking to make Cinderella's life miserable with an icy glare and air of superiority. Eleanor Audley also deserves praise for providing her calmly sinister voice. The stepsisters are suitably annoying, though much time isn't devoted to them. The dress ripping scene is the perfect display of Tremaine's subtle cruelty and has a real emotion heft to it given Cinderella's reaction. Disney regular Verna Felton deserves credit for making the Fairy Godmother a caring and motherly figure for Cinderella.The biggest issue with the film for me is that there are far too many 'cute' moments, most of which involve the mice that help Cinderella. They aren't overly important to the story yet the film gives them ample screen time and all they do is slow down the main plot. They do provide some amusing comic relief at times, but there is simply too much time spent with them when it really should have been spend developing characters like the Prince. Lack of development is something of a general issue with the film, we never really know the true motivations of any of the characters outside of our main character and it does mean you struggle to get engaged in the story at times.On the whole Cinderella is a charming and enjoyable fantasy, yet despite its acclaim and iconic status I certainly don't think it's amongst Disney's best. The animation is spectacular in every sense, Lady Tremaine is a wonderfully evil villain and despite some flaws Cinderella is a pleasant lead. The voice actors all do fantastic jobs and the music is enjoyable as you'd expect from Disney. With that said it certainly suffers from a lack of character development, a flimsy romance and far too much concentration on the animal sidekicks which both harm the story. The memorable moments are worthy, but it just lacks something to be considered as one of Disney best.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A staple Disney classic,"It goes without saying Cinderella is one of the most famous Disney movies, with the iconic Disneyland castle and numerous remakes. The movie is a thoughtful tale about making the most with what you have.At times it feels a lot like Snow White, with the mice having small segments devoted to their shenanigans, scenes mostly focusing on the title character cleaning and an evil stepmother. The execution however is much better than Snow White. The music is very pretty and the lead actress has a wonderful voice. The movie has its share of jokes as well, with the cat chase scenes and stepsisters being highlights. Romance is the weakest part of the movie, it moves extremely fast and we don't get to hear any conversation to get us to really cheer for the relationship. But you get attached to Cinderella and that makes the romance mean more because it will make her happy.Overall this is classic Disney with all the charm, laughs, happiness, seriousness, stellar art and magic you would expect. If you had to watch one classic Disney movie this should be it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Anyone remember the time on ""Gilligan's Island"" when Mrs. Howell dreamed that she was Cinderella and Gilligan was her Fairy Godfather?","OK, everyone knows what ""Cinderella"" is about, so I'll just talk about some things. I saw it 3 days ago for a class. As a 21st century 22-year-old guy, I'm not tempted to just watch such a movie and get transfixed. So, I threw out ""MST3K""-style comments. For example, when the birds wake her up at the beginning, I said ""Hey Cinderella! O.J. Simpson got acquitted!"".Now, whenever a book gets turned into a movie, there's bound to be some changes. And boy were there here! The Grimms' version of the story has the stepsisters mutilate their feet to try and fit them into the slipper. Charles Perrault's original story didn't have a Fairy Godmother; Cinderella planted a twig on her mother's grave and the tree granted her wishes.I like the ""Gilligan's Island"" episode where Mrs. Howell dreams she's Cinderella and Gilligan her Fairy Godfather. Speaking of the Fairy Godmother, would Cinderella's Fairy ""Godfather"" make offers you can't refuse? And of course, what of Cinderella herself? I assume that any heterosexual man's hormones would go wild just thinking about her, and any gay man would idolize her. And if her stepmother and stepsisters deprive her of everything, why does she always look like Grace Kelly? But this is Disney: the fact that she's so beautiful means she's 100% good, while the homely stepsisters are 100% bad. And there are Cinderella's mice friends. Maybe her friendship with mice affirms her isolation from society: people keep her locked up, she befriends animals. And let's face it, the mice are the underdogs the same way she is. The cat reminded me of Stewie on ""Family Guy"". I would call the king a cross between Archie Bunker and the characters whom Jack Nicholson plays in movies. The grand duke reminded me of Darrin on ""Bewitched"".Considering that ""Cinderella"" is the ultimate fairy tale, we need to think about the idea of a fairy tale. Fairy tales involve someone trying to make it (the American Dream). Not just economic success, but also the idea of going out and making the most of oneself. Thus, Hunter S. Thompson's life was a fairy tale! One more thing. The name Cinderella comes from the Latin word for ""ash"", because she's rising up from the ashes. I have to admit: when I hear ""ash"", I think of the ""Evil Dead"" movies. So, thinking of Cinderella's name, I picture Ash telling the ""primitive screw-heads"" about his boom-stick! Last but not least, I bet when the movie came out, the teenage boys really liked the scene where Cinderella's taking a shower (we see her backside). I will admit that she is pretty hot.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thoroughly enjoyable and enchanting,"During animation class today, our teacher decided to inspire us by screening Cinderella. Needless to say it backfired, because we were so entranced by the movie we stopped animating to watch it... And what a movie it is! Perhaps people who haven't animated before wouldn't be able to fully appreciate what a masterpiece of animation this is. While other studios were stuck on lifeless in-betweening and line moving, Disney animators have already worked out what gave animations the illusion of life. Even by today's standards, this is superb animation, and the beautiful thing is that you hardly notice! That's the hallmark of great animation- it feels so natural you don't notice it.I voted an 8 because, honestly, it's got a rather weak story, with little character development etc. But nevertheless, I can't say that it's a major flaw, the other aspects of the movie more than make up for this. The characters are charming, and the story felt as magical and timeless as I first saw it as a little kid all those years ago. The colors are perfect, the songs are very memorable and the voice actors fit their roles very very well.Overall I love this film, and I'm damned sure that kids are still gonna be watching this in the generations to come.",,Anonymous,Animation
Very comforting watch,"I'm giving this movie two reviews, one for the parents who want to know if the lessons hold up in modern times, and another for the adults who want to relive this nostalgic classic.For the parents:
The overall lesson in this film is that staying kind through your troubles is rewarded, and selfishness is not. However, when I was a child I definitely focused more on the prince and how he magically came in and saved the day, rescuing her from her situation.If you have any little girls you want to watch this with, I'd suggest just explaining to them that a lot of people can be mean in real life just like the evil stepmother etc. But Cinderella didn't let them break her spirit, and she stayed kind.You can explain how the prince loved her and chose her because he could see how special she was, and that she chose him too because he was a kind man. Just as long as they don't leave the experience thinking that they'll magically have a happy ever after someday and be rescued by love.Besides all that, it's a magical experience for any little girl, it has some of the prettiest songs. It's a great movie for before bed too, very slow paced and calm.For the nostalgia watchers:
Cinderella was one of my favourites as a young girl, so I wanted to rewatch it now and see if it holds up. I'm very picky with my comfort films, and I was pleasantly surprised by this.For reference, it's not as good as something newer like Frozen, but it has a completely different vibe to it. The beginning is a little slow but if you push through that, by the end you'll be reminded of the classic Disney magic that you probably haven't felt in years. I personally like it more than The Little Mermaid, or Beauty and The Beast. And it's more romantic than lots of the others in my opinion.Watching this during a hard time, or even before bed feels like a giant hug. If you need comfort I highly suggest it. It's also not nearly as dark as some of the other Disney films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good film,"Unlike Snow White and Aurora, she does not dream about love. She dreams indeed about her life getting better, but romantic love is not necessary for her. She wanted to go to the ball to have fun and because that was her right, not to marry the prince. In fact, she didn't even knew it was the prince the one with whom she had fallen in love.She is not as passive as some people believes she is. Some people complain that she never ran away, but seriously, what chances had a woman in the 18th century alone and without money? Running away wasn't an option. But she won't let her stepmother to take away her few rights. She demands Lady Tremaine to let her go to the ball, and doesn't hesitate to sass out Anastasia and Drizella. She works hard in order to fulfill the conditions her stepmother put to her, and is quite resourceful (no dress? I'll make one). She is just a victim of her circumstances. Lady Tremaine, without any magical powers nor musical number, is still one of Disney's best villains. Her cold, calculating, almost twisted personality is an effective menace to Cinderella. The King steals the show, provides comic relief without being over the top or annoying, and is a memorable and likable character. Same with the Grand Duke and the Fairy Godmother.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never Gets Old!!! Nostalgic,Classic Disney movie and one of my absolute favorites hands down!!! It never gets old and always brings me back to my childhood. Magical!,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Most Enchaning One of All,"Cinderella is my favorite Disney movie of all time. The music is great, the animation, and lets not forget the characters, I like Cinderella most of all, because Cinderella is like a drama. The setting is beautiful, and the music just makes it even better. My favorite sequence is the Nightengale sequence when she's cleaning the floor, although short that sequence takes the viewer inside Cinderellas mind, even for asceond. Until Lucifer starts trouble and Cinderella is brung back to reality (which she faces everyday). Another thing, although these parts only happen once in the movie, Cinderella coming down in the morning, the viewer gets the idea of what her life really is. She comes down, and starts the day off dreaming into her own fantasy world. Thats why Cinderella is so special. Sleeping Beauty has Aurora dancing in the forest, but thats all we would know about her, the viewer doesn't know what her life is like living in a cottage in a great forest, Cinderella reveals all these things, and thats what really gets the audience, captivation, mystery, and drama(the stepmother scene) Expecially the stepmother scene. I mean other scenes have the villain look terrifying by making them look grotesque or ugly like Snow Whites witch, but Cinderella has the stepmother be scary by her attitude toward things, shes strict and I dont know about anyone else but when I used to watch that part of the movie I was really into it, I mean all attention was captured by that scene. Cinderella is I think one of the best Disney movies.",,Anonymous,Animation
Funny but also moving,"Part of the genius of this movie is telling Cinderella's story indirectly. To focus on Cinderella's life would be too depressing and dark. Instead, we watch slapstick comedy with mice, birds, a cat and a dog for most of the movie, only observing Cinderella in the background. The details are easy to miss for a child as I usually did - I was too busy engaged, smiling and laughing. But now I see the way she is treated, like she's not even a human being.Eventually, Cinderella breaks down. I found that very moving because it's not just about her dress or going to a ball. She's given up hope. As she sobs, she says: ""It's just no use. No use at all. I can't believe. Not any more. There's nothing left to believe in."" It's heartbreaking. Not even the animals can cheer her up - they don't know what to do. It's a place most of us don't want to be but I think most of us have been there.And only then does it hit you how positive and strong she's been. She took everything in her stride, happily singing, smiling and dancing while basically living as a slave. All that happiness suddenly disappears and we feel the true despair she is facing. Of course, the movie turns magical after that, which makes us feel good, but we know that it's pure fantasy.Cinderella's innocence and joy are what make her special. The prince is bored by an endless slew of suitresses, but is immediately drawn to Cinderella. She experiences true happiness for once as she dances with him. But in a way she'd always been this happy because she's always dreamed about this and completely believed in it. We don't have to dream of meeting prince charming, but I think it's good to dream about something and aim for it. The dream can help us focus and endure hardships. Afterwards, she's in a trance - that deep kind of satisfied happiness which can last for days or weeks.There are a lot of hilarious double-takes. The dog runs in his sleep, bites the rug and awakens. Cinderella asks if the dog has been dreaming. He nods. She asks if he was chasing the cat. He smiles and keeps nodding. She asks if he caught him this time. The smiling and nodding intensifies. Suddenly she says ""that's bad"" with an abrupt change in the music and it's like he's been whacked on the head. He is utterly confused as to why this could be ""bad"". There are many moments like this which are perfectly executed and make me laugh out loud.Later, the cat is ferociously looking under cups to find a mouse. Eventually, he's so excited that he doesn't even notice the mouse under the first cup he checks. Once he realises, he's bursting with excitement to eat the mouse but it's too late because Cinderella's coming back. He nearly dies from frustration as he slinks back under the table. I find these subtle details hilarious. And the final climax of the movie has real excitement with a mix of comedy and tension.Cinderella is a classic. The story is simple but it works on every level. It's heartwarming and entertaining - among the best Disney films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"All Politics aside, It's still a beautiful masterpiece.","The Moral of Cinderella, however you put it, isn't the most realistic moral.""No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true"".Cute, but that's not going to do Anne Frank any good.But I believe It's more about being optimistic; not so much, you get what you want because of Karma.The film is beautiful, exciting with interesting characters (I'm dead serious, Cinderella is a very interesting character).I don't care how many movies you've seen.That Climax is one of the most exciting of any Disney film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The word ""if"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence","Another of the classic animated Disney adaptations of fairy tales.The animation is excellent, with strong use of colour, effective visual communication and significant personality, not to mention impossibly smooth movements to all the characters. The music is catchy, the script shows a firm grasp on the crucial concepts of set up and pay off, there's humour, cuteness, tension and action, all of it works well - a gag where Lucifer, the hungry cat, looks for a mouse in three teacups that are placed upside down combines all of these. It's no wonder this has been re-watched countless times over the decades.What this has brought to pop culture has gone over a few reassessments over the 73 years since it premiered. Originally, it was seen as a positive depiction of how young ladies should behave. Cinderella herself is passive and largely accepts her bad situation. She does all the hard work that she's forced to do, despite it being clear from the start that it is extremely unfair. She doesn't seek out political power or try to subvert the situation in which she finds herself, like the suffragettes did. More than anything, she wants romance and other positive social experiences. It's seen as perfectly good that the king wants for his son to marry, and it doesn't really matter for him to who, as long as she is upper class. Love is presented as purely the honeymoon phase, with none of the complicated aspects that come later. By today's standards, this all feels very limiting, and mired in respectability politics.However, as has more recently been pointed out, part of why she is a good role model is the fact that she refuses to let her bullies turn her into an abuser herself. She has the power to be cruel to the small animals that frequent her room, but instead treats them with the kind of compassion and empathy that they and she deserve. She's a good communicator and lives in happy communion with the parts of nature that she is able to, tending to their needs. She is kind, patient and shows gratitude when others do help her. Before things get better, the first step is her truly imagining things could improve, rather than giving up all hope. These are stereotypes about women common to patriarchal systems, and absolutely should not be seen as the only thing that they are able to do, or allowed to do, much less that it is a problem if they do not adhere to these. On the other hand, these are not actually negative like many misogynist tropes about the nature of the fairer sex, that paint them as terrible, demands that they behave a certain way, punishing them *whether they do or not*, and then these man children will turn around and scream about how it doesn't make any sense that they can't find someone who can stand being around them. Crisis of masculinity? Largely self-inflicted. Anyway. These traits could easily be emulated by gals today if they so choose.The step family is entirely made up of females making the point that sometimes they can be awful to their own, and that this is behaviour that should be avoided. Heck, they are basically a trio of girlbosses. It is of course really messed up that among the stuff that's bad about them is they aren't conventionally attractive and show no musical talents. They are by far the most selfish, though at least they aren't the only foolish and shallow people in this. It is very cis hetero, for example in an early bit where the idea that a boy couldn't wear a dress is treated as the most obvious thing in the world. Still, it does present a world where both parts of the gender binary, at least if they're birds and mice, can work together even on something like making a dress, rather than encouraging separating them, and insisting that they are too different to peacefully coexist.This features some disturbing content. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not quite a full-blown classic, but still one of Disney's better efforts...","Personally, CINDERELLA seems a tad redundant... there's simply a few too many Disney features that concern a female title character who is ""saved"" at the end by some sort of Prince.  SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) had already come before CINDERELLA (1950), and SLEEPING BEAUTY (1959) seemed like a ""greatest hits"" version of both movies.  And in the grand scheme of all things Disney, CINDERELLA, overall, is probably not one of the greatest features Walt oversaw (props should rightfully go to other efforts such as FANTASIA, SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, BAMBI and DUMBO).  But before I get too stuffy about all this...CINDERELLA is still funny, charming and loaded with fun songs and absolutely superb animation.  If I only have one minor quibble, it's that the business between the mice and Lucifer the cat seem to take up a little too much time of the film.  If you have children, or are simply a fan of old movies or animation in general, no collection is complete without this.  It may not be perfect, but it comes closer than most animated films of today and is still a minor classic at the very least.",,Anonymous,Animation

Give me Jaq and Gus over any outspoken Disney hero any day.,"When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Disney has made up to that point,"This was the film that saved Disney's Studios and enabled it to be a cultural institution. It made so much money that Disney was able to pay off their debt, finance most of their productions in the 1950s, and start to build Disney World. Despite a few artistic successes, most of the films released in the previous decade by the company had been both commercial and artistic flops. What makes this film so good? The first striking thing is that Cinderella is actually a real, believable character who makes choices and has wants and desires. This is in contrast to Snow White, who was just singing with birds all day. And while she sings about wanting her dreams to come true, it's clear that she wants to escape her situation and not necessarily find a Prince. The prince in this story is the one who lacks any agency. He's just introduced by this huge and quite funny portrait, and then he falls in love with her. Another fun part about the movie is that there's this whole subplot of the conflict between Lucifer and the mice, which adds nothing to the story of the film but is entertaining nevertheless. Apart from the character of Cinderella, the best part about the movie is the animation. While it lacks the Baroque details of Pinocchio, it is full of brilliant moments. First, the colors really pop out of the screen like it's a watercolor painting but more vibrant. There are these great sequences - for example, one where Cinderella is singing, and you can see her reflection in the bubbles - and yet another where her evil stepmother is in the darkness, and she opens her eyes, and they're this evil shade of green. Great one thing that might be a little bit better is the way that the faces of Cinderella and the prince are drawn when they're dancing together, to try and emulate the styles of actors and actresses at the time the movie was made, and it feels a little bit strange. I am trying to watch all the Disney films in chronological order and I have to say I really like this one and that was a surprise. It's no doubt my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wrong emphasis, good only for little kids","It may seem blasphemous to say that Disney didn't properly handle a classic fairy tale, but I think it's true in this case. The emphasis on the cute talking animals is all wrong. This is supposed to be a story about Cinderella, not talking mice, etc. Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo is a cute song, and A Dream Is A Wish is nice (it doesn't mention love at all), but they do not convey the true romantic element that is crucial to the story. The prince is given practically no character development. She's supposed to fall in love with him because he dances and is a prince? That's it? What really made up my mind about the Disney effort is watching the 1965 TV version with Lesley Ann Warren. The Rodgers and Hammerstein songs in it are magnificent, truly conveying the romantic passion, desire and love of a man and a woman for each other, as well as the romantic idealism of the story. The Disney songs can't hold a candle to them. The prince is given good character development. We see HIS loneliness and desire to find his true love. We see that he is kind and gracious and thoughtful and gentle. He is given a scene where he expresses a desire not to be seen as a ""prize"" to be won, but a man to be loved. The 1965 version is the timeless classic for all hopeless romantics. The Disney version is for the little kiddies wanting to see something cute.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another example of animated boredom from Walt Disney Pictures,"The truly best years of animation production at Walt Disney Pictures were while Walt Disney was alive but the horribly dismal results of this film gives an indication of how really bad it is over there today. There's just not much to keep ""Cinderella"" going in levels of interest as it is just an animated rehash of a story that has been filmed and written way too many times. This film's only highlight and mild levels of amusement comes from Gus and Jaq, Cinderella's two pet mice (these Walt Disney Pictures fairy tale adaptations usually add a couple of new characters in an effort to be more interesting and original).

Disney's 1950 comeback success builds upon the fairy tale success Snow White without re-inventing the core appeal,"Cinderella having lost her father at a young age grows up under the abuse her stepmother and stepsisters who delight in berating her and treating her like a scullery maid. When the King grows weary of his son, The Prince, putting off a proper wife, the king has his Grand Duke arrange for a ball to be held celebrating the Prince's return and inviting all the kingdom's eligible maidens in the hopes that at least one will catch his interests. Cinderella's friends, the mice and birds of her home, help refurbish a dress belonging to Cinderella's mother using abandoned articles around the home. When Cinderella prepares to go to the Ball her stepsisters violently destroy her dress and cruelly leave her behind. While initially despondent, Cinderella's spirits are lifted with the visit of her Fairy Godmother who performs a spell that will give her all she needs to attend the ball until midnight when the magic ends. Upon arrival to the ball, Cinderella immediately catches the attentions of the Prince which invokes the delight of the king and the Ire of Cinderella's stepmother who is taken aback by this seemingly familiar mystery woman.Released in 1950, Cinderella marked the first feature length single narrative from Walt Disney Animation since 1943s Bambi. The failure of Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi due to the market cutoffs of World War II was a strenuous time for the studio that resorted to making ""package films"" out of necessity not only to wartime resource scarcity, but also creditors who dissuaded more ambitious projects during this time. With Disney studio debts significantly reduced the company was given the leeway it needed to produce a film of the same scope and ambition of its earlier films which resulted in Cinderella which became Disney's highest grossing film since Snow White in 1937 and helped to keep the company afloat and allow Walt Disney to pursue more projects including Disneyland, film distribution as well as production, and even enter into television. While Cinderella's credit in keeping Disney afloat cannot be overlooked, it also helps that the movie is just really charming with a strong story and likable characters.Cinderella takes everything originated in Snow White and expands and refines it while keeping that same emotional core that resonated in 1937. Cinderella is much like Snow White a good hearted person who's lorded over by a cold and bitter stepmother who spoils her own daughters rotten. While the film follows the similar beats to Snow White in terms of its arc and structure, the movie engages the audience by expanding the scale of the story with a more grand scale than seen in Snow White by making the kingdom and environment feel more alive and tangible than they were in Snow White which went for a more scaled down approach. The scenes in Cinderella's home, the grand scale scenes in the ball at the castle, or even scenes done from the point of view of Cinderella's mouse and bird friends give a larger than life feeling to this kingdom that can't help but draw you in.Outside the technical the film is amazing with a large set of memorable characters who are beautifully animated and given personalities and identities just as big and imposing as the scenes they inhabit. Cinderella while still a very basic good natured, kind hearted Disney princess is a welcome step in building upon what was established with Snow White as she's a much more active protagonist here in her plans for attending the ball (even if they're ultimately undone by the stepsisters cruelty) and conveying a level of subdued humor to herself at the expense of her step sisters and Lucifer the cat that she uses to keep her spirits up. Much of Cinderella's appeal is not only due to her great design and animation, but also to some terrific voice work by her actress , Ilene Woods.The rest of the supporting cast are equally good with Eleanor Audley wonderfully cast as the wicked stepmother, Lady Tremaine whose voice oozes with cold hearted contempt and makes a great villain we love to hate. Likewise the two stepsisters are appropriately obnoxious and harsh and walk the line of being hateful but also allowing us to laugh at their spoiled vanity. The interplay between The King and The Grand Duke is also quite impressive and leads to some great comic back and forth between the two characters, made all the more impressive by the fact they're played by the same voice actor, Luis Van Rooten, who gives them two distinctive voices that are perfectly synchronized. The weakest element of Cinderella is, like in Snow White, the Prince himself. The Prince when he meets Cinderella it's done from a distance focusing on the discussion between the Grand Duke and the King while we don't hear the exchange between Cinderella and the Prince before they dance the waltz. We do get some very basic information about the Prince in one scene where he expresses surprise that Cinderella danced with him not knowing he was the Prince in contrast to the other women at the ball, but it's possible I'm reading WAY more into that than the filmmakers ever intended. This is admittedly a minor criticism all things considered, but still worth addressing as it's the one element taken from Snow White that feels like it wasn't elaborated upon while everything else was.Cinderella is fine escapist entertainment for pretty much anyone. It's the definition of correctly done wish fulfillment with a simple plot populated by larger than life characters and an emotional core that resonates in all the right ways. The animation par for the course is still top notch, building upon the elegance and grace seen in Snow White and refined with the 13 years of experimentation and advancement since. Some elements such as the Prince's lack of defined character don't match the other advances seen in the film, but taken as a whole Cinderella is one of those movies that's guaranteed to end with you feeling happy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolute masterpiece.,"It is a masterpiece of the best animation from the Disney house. A magnificently embodied story on the screen where the characters, rhythm, music, story and beautiful ending are masterfully raised to become an immortal delight. For those of us who grew up watching the reruns of the great Disney films, this movie is one of the favorites.

A true Disney classic,There have been so many versions of the Cinderella story that you may be surprised to find that some of the elements that you think are a part of the story are missing. Gone are Buttons and Barron Hardup figures that we see in Pantomime and instead we have a selection of cute animals (this is Disney after all) that will either warm your heart or annoy you badly.Cinderella herself is a typical Disney princess but the film moves along at a quick pace after quite a slow first 20 minutes. For it's age it looks stunning and the humour does not date.Although it probably appeal more to girls than boys there is a lot of fun for them to enjoy in the film as well what with the bumbling king and his servant.Overall a classic Disney film that is well worth seeing to bring back some childhood memories.,4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Editions)! What are you going to do next? You're going to Disney World!!!!!"" Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle!!!!!)Anyways, Disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film ""Cinderella,"" the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying ""Bippity- boppity-boo!,"" and of course, trying to head home by midnight!What I like about this film: It's a grand old fairy tale that children like, now in a movie form (as well as on DVD as well)!!!!!""Cinderella"" - thank you, Disney!!!!! 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful.,"For quite a long time in my life, I either did not like this film, or I liked this film but not as much as many more. I watched it recently (at a sleepover, funnily enough) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something. I now appreciate it more, as I do with a few other Disney classics that I have watched recently (including ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Pinnochio"" or however you spell it).I now very much appreciate the animation, the clever ""Disney"" plot turns, the humour from the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such as the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story, but with this I am not overly bothered. I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film. Often I do not think Disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films).You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper...This is a film very much to be watched with other people. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-) ).I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little bit, people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-BEAUTIFUL!,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated ""Sleeping Beauty"" which made it's debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: ""Cinderella"" (1950). Of the three films, ""Cinderella"" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike ""Snow White"", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. ""Cinderella"" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like ""Snow White"", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting.A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale"" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"") her own show-stopper.Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great Movie!,"I hadn't watched Cinderella when I was younger but recently I did and I loved it! I think its so different from the ordinary Disney film...well i heard it's not even Disney so I guess that's a given. But the characters looked different and it has some really nice songs. Especially the first one ""This is my idea"" which speeds things up from when they're kids to when they're older...its really cute and the song itself is nice. Also its not the typical old animated films where the guy and girl fall in love straight away since they kinda dislike each other when they were young. But after that they just have this beautiful love which is both happy and sad and perfect!! Other than that, far longer than forever is a great song, along with many others. Tons of funny characters - Cindrella's friends, who are good funny friends are hilarious as well as the shoes's adviser and his friend. Anyway love it!! A must see classic.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bravo to Disney,"As a young boy, I always sort of hated ""Cinderella,"" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy. I wanted ""Dumbo,"" but my sisters won out, and we got ""Cinderella."" They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched ""Cinderella"" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched ""Cinderella"" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like ""Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo"" and ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While ""Cinderella"" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids. I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinderella is pure excellence of all Princess magic,"The reason why I say this is because: this is one of the most legendary films to ever exist. Cinderella is the first Disney Princess film in 13 years since Snow White in 1937 out of all films that saved Disney, four of them are all Princess films:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937): Walt Disney had to sell his house in order to create this movie and the film was a box office success and made enough money for Walt to get back his house.Cinderella (1950): Walt Disney went bankrupt during WW2 and had to make package films to make ends meet, he put in 3 fairytales in production and went with the riches to rags story. Suprisingly, the film was a hit in the 1950s, and became known as the film that saved Disney.The Little Mermaid (1989): After Walt Disney succumbed to a battle of lung cancer, the studio was struggling severely after the founder's death and almost again went bankrupt, waiting only 3-4 years to make another film but then, they decided to make another fairytale story which was The Little Mermaid. After the film's release, the film was a massive success and paved the ways to one of the greatest eras in film history the Disney Renaissance.The Princess and the Frog (2009): Due to the influence of the Disney Renaissance, more animation studios were born and were very competitive with Disney and their films were financially struggling but then they decided to bring back the Princess formula and went on to create another story. When they released the film, the film was a huge critical success but financially underperformed Disney's previous filmsCharacters:
Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest princesses and basically 90% of the films she appears in are considered well-written, Lady Tremaine is one of many examples of how to create a non-powerful but well-written villain, her presence is so menacing. And all I can say is that all the characters are great in this filmStory:
I hate how people criticise Cinderella's personality as weak and submissive to feed her own ambition but girly literally survived abuse and was emotionally mature about the situation she was going through. The story is great is considered Walt Disney's favourite story. Because of the rags to riches theme.Overall, It's still crazy to think an excellent film like this is 75 years old and it made us of what we are today. I thank this film for teaching us how to be loyal with our dreams for over 7 decades.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Disney but not perfect,"A staple entry in the Disney catalogue, Cinderella is a name that everyone knows, most likely because of Disney.It's THE dream-come-true story that ruined generations of girls, as it created the idea that there is a Prince Charming out there waiting for you. Interestingly enough, this prince has barely any characterization in this movie, he is almost completely silent. The prince might be a prick, but hey, he's a prince and he's charming!However, we can't help but cheer for Cinderella after all the gratuitous abuse endured in the household. But then again, the ending is way too rushed, leaving no time for retribution or gloating, while so much time is wasted at the beginning of the movie where things go very slowly.The biggest strength of the movie is probably the music, as admittedly almost every song is easily recognizable and remembered. All in all it is a pleasant watch, worth revisiting if only to hum along.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Little Faith, a Little Magic, and a Timeless Classic","If there's one fairy tale that perfectly captures the classic Disney spirit, it's ""Cinderella."" Released in 1950, the film marked a triumphant comeback for the studio after the tough years of World War II, establishing itself as a landmark in animation and securing the company's financial survival. But more than just a commercial success, ""Cinderella"" is a masterclass in cinematic storytelling, striking the perfect balance between emotion, humor, and visual enchantment. It follows a traditional fairy tale structure, sure, but what makes it special is the sheer sophistication of its execution.The story is simple but effective: Cinderella lives under the rule of her cruel stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and her spoiled stepsisters, Drizella and Anastasia. Despite the daily mistreatment, she remains kind and hopeful, finding comfort in the friendship of the household animals. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the King wants his son to find a wife, so he throws a royal ball where every eligible young woman in the kingdom must attend. Naturally, Cinderella wants to go, but her family sabotages her. Enter the Fairy Godmother, who turns a night of despair into a magical event that will change Cinderella's life forever.The film truly shines in how it builds its protagonist. Contrary to what some might think, Cinderella isn't a passive character. Within the limits of her reality, she resists in the only way she can-by holding onto her dignity and hope. The scene where her first chance at happiness is brutally taken away-the dress ripped to shreds-is one of the most emotionally devastating moments in classic animation. And this is where Cinderella's strength really comes through: her journey isn't just about finding the prince, but about proving that her kindness and resilience are more powerful than the cruelty surrounding her.Lady Tremaine is a formidable villain. Unlike the witches and sorceresses of other fairy tales, she doesn't need magic to exert control. Her power comes from psychological manipulation, from the cold, calculated way she crushes any trace of happiness in her stepdaughter's life. Eleanor Audley voices her with chilling subtlety, making her one of Disney's most memorable antagonists. Meanwhile, Drizella and Anastasia serve as comic relief, leaning into their arrogance and stupidity while still maintaining a mean streak.The film's humor is another one of its biggest strengths. The constant battle between the mice-especially Jaq and Gus-and the cat Lucifer adds an energetic dynamic that balances out the darker parts of the story. These scenes, with a vibe reminiscent of ""Tom & Jerry,"" work not just as comic relief but also as a way to strengthen Cinderella's bond with her little allies.Visually, ""Cinderella"" is breathtaking. Even with the limitations of the 4:3 format of the time, the film creates a grand sense of scale, whether through the imposing set designs or the fluidity of the animation. The character designs are flawless, with each one standing out visually and personality-wise. The transformation scene, where the Fairy Godmother gives Cinderella her iconic sparkling blue gown, remains one of the most magical moments ever animated-a true testament to the brilliance of Disney's legendary ""Nine Old Men.""The soundtrack is another standout element. From ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" to ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" the songs aren't just incredibly memorable-they play an essential role in shaping the film's atmosphere. The sweet melodies and hopeful lyrics reinforce the movie's enchanting tone, while Oliver Wallace's instrumental score adds both grandeur and tension in all the right moments.If there's one thing that could've been fleshed out more, it's the Prince. Much like in ""Snow White,"" he functions more as a symbol of the happy ending than a fully developed character. His presence in the story is minimal, and a little more interaction between him and Cinderella could have made their romance more engaging. Likewise, the fact that the glass slipper doesn't turn back to normal after midnight could be seen as a plot convenience-but within the logic of a fairy tale, it's one of those magical details that just work.Overall, ""Cinderella"" isn't just a well-told fairy tale-it's a timeless film. Its impact on pop culture is undeniable, inspiring countless adaptations and sequels. But more importantly, its message about hope and perseverance remains just as powerful today. It's the ultimate proof that sometimes, all you need is a little faith and a touch of magic to turn even the darkest moments into something extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A FOREVER CLASSIC,"Nothing will ever beat this original from the earlier years of cinema. From the animation to the cinematography, this was considered ahead of its time. Its almost flawless execution was considered a cinematic marvel by movie fans from the past until today. My only problem was its too premature and fundamental to consider a really ""great"" movie.

Greatest Disney movie ever?,"Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Disney magic,"Supposedly, Cinderella was the film released in Walt Disney's lifetime he was most proud of. While it's far from the best film released in those days, there's no denying what a delightful, charming film it is. Most of the problems can be found in the plot, which is thin and unfocused, though relatively well paced regardless. The mice get just as much screentime as the human characters; in fact, similar to the Good Fairies in Sleeping Beauty nine years later, an argument could be made for them being the true heroes of the film. With that said, despite all the padding in their scenes, they have likeable personalities, and the scenes with them and the family's cat have a certain Tom and Jerry-esque quality to them that gets a ton of laughs.While the mice are the most consistently entertaining part of the movie, the human characters are, for the most part, still entertaining in their own right. Cinderella is a massive step up from the previous Disney Princess, Snow White, as she actually has a personality outside of just being nice. She isn't that way all the time; she has her limits and knows when to stand up for herself. With that said, she's still very charming and held up by Ilene Woods' excellent voice acting. The Stepmother meanwhile is an enjoyably despicable villain, managing to wield absolute control over our heroine with little else than a hard voice and a cold stare. The stepsisters are funny side villains, and the King, Grand Duke, and Fairy Godmother are great too. The only weak character is, of course, the Prince. He has no personality, almost no dialogue, and the romance with the lead is so rushed it's practically an afterthought. He might as well not even be in the film, he leaves so little impact.Some errors aside (watch the Stepmother's eyes; they switch between having pupils and not throughout), this is classic Disney animation that is sorely missed. The character designs are charming and fitting for their personalities. And for the small story, there's a decent amount of size and scope to the film. This is especially noticeable during the scenes with the mice, as we see the house from their POV, making everything seem huge and grand. The scenes at the palace are impressive too, especially during the ball, where the colors are allowed to go crazy and really pop. And of course, the film has a plethora of classic songs that we all know and love, my personal favorite being ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"". There is a lyric in the mice's song that hasn't aged well, though, and Cinderella's main song gets one too many reprises.Overall, Cinderella does have its flaws, but most of them are minor and, to be honest, I barely notice them while watching it. I'm too busy being engrossed and enjoying myself. Yes, I still maintain that the remake is better, but that doesn't diminish how wonderful the original is.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tremendous comeback,"In 1950 Disney finally returned to full feature animations with Cinderella, one of their greatest comebacks to date. A film that quite literally saved Walt Disney Animation Studios and allowed them to continue shaping our childhoods.It's also the first fairytale film Disney had produced in a long time, featuring only the second Disney princess at the time of its release. A film of many returns and a film that helped to solidify what a Disney film was to mean.And it's a fantastic film in its own right. The animation is once again some of the best ever made, which must have been a true treat for the audiences at the time after a full half of a decade of nothing but shorts of varying quality. Here the quality is topnotch, though we still have a few films to go before Disney would once again start to push the medium forward with Sleeping Beauty.The story is of course a classic, and nowadays the version almost all think of when they hear the name Cinderella. Disney has always been at its best when it's doing adaptations, this being no exception. The best parts of the original fairytale are transformed into the silver screen experience we've all come to love.If I had to name one problem, I have to admit that the mice are a bit annoying now that I'm an adult. As a child I don't remember minding them at all, but now... Oh well, it's no like they ruin the film, so it's a minor flaw.Cinderella is an important film in Disney canon.

Nice film,"May contain spoilers I never even saw the Disney version of Cinderella before so when I heard that they were releasing it from the Disney Valut I had to get it as I wanted to see what it was like.Cinderella tells the story of a young girl named Cinderella who lives with her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine and her ugly stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia. Cinderella has to do everything in the house from cleaning floors,to getting their dinner ready etc etc. One night Cinderella gets an invitation for the ball which is for the whole household. With the help of some (irritating rats that sound like the rodents in Alvin & the Chipmunks) help her get ready for the ball by designing a dress but the dress gets ruined by Cinderella's evil stepsisters and her mother. But that doesn't stop Cinderella as her fairy godmother transforms Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown and she goes off to the ball and a prince is enchanted by her beauty.You can probably figure the rest for yourselves but personally I may be 19 years old going on 20 but I am a sucker for fairy tales and animated movies(depending on what they are about). The story of Cinderella is very old-fashioned yet its a very romantic movie. This film is strictly for little girls aged 4 years of age who love dressing up as princesses and daydreaming about romance.Cinderella is a very enchanting flick. Check it out doesn't matter if you are a child or not watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Every woman and little girl's dream come true.,"This is one of Disney's second film with Disney princesses, Cinderella, every women's dream come true. The characters I like is the mice, there're funny and that mouse that has my name. Jack. The human characters are funny too. The songs are beautiful, the only songs I like is all of them. There're have A dream is a wish, The work song sung by mice and everyone's favourite song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. The music is just gorgeous, there're many Disney films that have many lovely music and animation. Oh wait, I almost forgot. The prince and Cinderella are dancing while singing ''So this is love'' and Oh boy it's beautiful even though it is kind of short. And that's all I gotta say about it. What beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good as you can get from early Disney Princess thingy,"What can I say about this certified 100% classic of animation that hasn't already been said? Alice in Wonderland was very good, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves was a Masterpiece, Pinocchio was good the same, Bambi was less good than Snow White and Pinocchio but still leaps and bounds better than CGI movies of today (really, the only dud was the boring waste of celluloid known as Fantasia), and here we're getting another Masterpiece in the Shoujo Genre (I use the Japanese cathegorization because this, like Snow White and Disney in general, had clearly neverending influence on the Shoujo field of japanese production, in particular in the likes of Mahou Tsukai Sally and Candy Candy) which is fun, engaging, well animated, it is a real tearjerker I can tell you that. Oh, and like Snow White, Cinderella has no mary suish element to speak of, not one bit. So, if you're happen to be a Moonie like me myself and I, you will certainly reminded of the treatment of characters in another Masterpiece with a capital M (the 90's Sailor Moon), which is great! Recommended with no qualms whatosever.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Makes you a child again,"I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella was when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney child in a good way. The animation now seems childish and old fashioned, but that is part of its charm now. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney movies. Thankfully I was born before that so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back into that five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family Classic Is Fun to Watch Over and Over,"This animated version of the classic rags-to-riches story features the delightful """"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" as the fairy godmother magically prepares Cinderella for the ball that will change her life. A family classic that is fun to watch over and over. This is Disney film making at its best. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanting.,"Walter Disney was not a great animator himself, but a great innovator and caterer to what people loved most about life, and the good things life has to offer. He made his films always with this regard at the forefront. From Snow White, to Bambi, Dumbo and all of the other classic tales that he lifted from folklore and history, and, like a deity of animation, breathed life into characters that were once trapped on pages in library books.""Cinderella"" is no different, and we see a gentle and simple tale of honesty come forth as the young girl who means no harm to anyone must overcome adversity aimed at her in the form of jealousy. An active attempt to keep her down and in her place as we see a contest of power among sisters in name only. There is almost a kind of Jane Goodall quality as we see the new matriarch push aside the offspring of the father's previous love so that her brood can benefit from the resources created by the previous marriage.Cinderella, the once much loved daughter of the household, is now relegated to servitude. But even here her spirit cannot be quelled. For in her labor lies love, and her friends, the various fauna that populate the household grounds and walls, keep her spirits up. She is isolated from people and society, but soldiers on.It is a basic story telling of how seeking consolence from another object of affection can adversely effect that which one loves; i.e. the father remarrying someone whose motives are less than altruistic. But, in the end, it is the stalwartness of the royal seneschel who knows only that his duty must be performed at the behest of the crown, for therein lies honor. And it is thus that Cinderella sees that her one moment to shine has been rewarded through an artifact of military etiquette.It's a lovely film to watch and see. There're no real deep messages, but the story reminds us that delving hastily into new relations where matters of the heart are concerned, can be perilous if the previous party has been wounded. But, it also shows us that it is trusting your heart that brings about, for lack of a better term, good things. It is a story that reminds us that opportunists may crush that which we hold dear, and unless a miracle is forth coming, the likes of which Cinderella experienced, bad things may continue to persist.Technical notes; lots of inbetweens to show us animation so smooth that nothing has been rendered like since CGI, and even CGI comes across as highly mechanical and precision oriented, a raw juxtaposition from the innate intuition of the artists who animate with gentle feeling. This is what makes Cinderella such a beautiful visual for us to sit, watch and absorb.I feel like I should have more to say, but, other than the fact that it's a wonderful film, I'm at a loss for words. Watch it, and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stays very true to the original story,"An other reviewer says that Disney's Cinderella stays very close to the original story and I have to agree with that. I don't think any other Disney fairy tale stays that true to their origins. What Disney does is merely elaborating on the story and adding some helpful animals (especially mice) so Cinderella is not that alone in her duty to face the evil stepmother and stepsisters. I remember reading a Cinderella version where she did get help from birds, so maybe that idea wasn't fully copied from Snow White. The whole story is executed as it should be with a few extras but I must say the movie is kind of lacking in the humor department. It only becomes a bit funny when the mice are in it. The rest of the movie is serious and dramatic. But that's just how the real fairy tale is, pretty dark and dramatic. That doesn't take away the animation is splendid and the magic when the fairy godmother shows up is fantastic. Long had I waited to see this movie for the first time (over 12 years old), not because I disliked the Cinderella story (in fact I love it) but I could not think a fairy tale with so little action (most takes place in the house) could actually make a good movie. I was wrong there. Even if I liked its sequels more I think this one deserves an 8, my only complaint that it lacks humor but I cannot find any faults in the storyline or its execution. I might not have liked it that much first time around but this one needed re-watching to make it grow on me and it did.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, sure.  Great film?  Hardly.","""Cinderella"" was one of the breakthrough films of its time, with some great animation work.  However, I hardly see it as a ""classic fairy tale"".  It's certainly not a very inspiring story.  What lesson does it teach?  Stick around through suffering which you have no right to suffer, and your fairy godmother will come and save you.  If you're going to show it to your kids, try waiting it out a bit until he, she, or they are old enough to distinguish between fantasy and reality.  That, or hope that you're a darn good parent.",,Anonymous,Animation
