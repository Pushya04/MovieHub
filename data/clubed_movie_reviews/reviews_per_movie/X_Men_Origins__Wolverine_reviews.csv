"Wolverine isn't Bad, but it's not as good as it could've been","I'll state my credentials up front: I'm a chick. I have read X-Men comics in my past, but it's been years. I don't remember every detail of every relationship and back story, so I'm not a huge X-men expert. I LOVED the original X-Men movie and X2.I was so excited when I heard they were making a Wolverine movie. He and Gambit were my two favorite characters from the comics, and Wolverine was by far the best written and one of the best acted characters in the X-Men franchise. I thought, ""This should be good!"" I counted down the days until it came out. And I went to the theatre, and came out not disappointed, but not excited either. It was a middle-of-the-road movie, which seemed to not know what it wanted to be. But I would say go see it if you're an X-Men or Hugh Jackman fan.The main crime committed in Wolverine is in the writing. I always say writers don't get enough credit on a good movie. But no amount of good acting (pretty much everyone in Wolverine does well with what they're given) and okay directing can cover up crappy writing like this. The script was all over the place. It didn't have any of the jaunty yet edgy feel of the first two X-Men movies. Wolverine's wisecracks and smart wit were all but forgotten. That would've maybe been okay if they had chosen to make Wolverine the dark, nearly evil character that he was supposed to have been before he lost his memory. But they didn't. He was neither good nor evil. This was ambivalent Wolverine. Kind of Emo Wolverine. Not above doing bad, but not really into it because it made him Feel Bad. No really interesting lines or plot points either way. The writers didn't seem to even know how to develop the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. And was the love story put in by the studio just to satisfy us chicks who wouldn't go a see a comic-book movie without it? If so, the studio did us a great disservice, because if you wanted to make a story about Wolverine the lover (which, hey, I would go see), this movie wasn't that either.And when I saw in the trailer that Gambit was in the movie, too, I was thrilled! Gambit in a movie, at last! But here he is, the underdeveloped and kind of confusing Gambit. Couldn't he at least have had his New Orleans accent? The cards were cool, but he was mostly underutilized and didn't feel like Gambit that much.The movie does have some good moments in it where you actually say, ""Yes!"" I'm not putting spoilers, so I won't tell you what they are, but for me, they made the movie worth seeing. While I wouldn't put it anywhere on my worst-movie list, I wouldn't rank it with X-Men and X2 on my favorites list, either.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Much better than the reviews, actions packed FUN","Forget the reviews that focus on dialogue (it's a comic book character, of course it's clich√©d) or other types of thing you may look for in movies like a Room With A View. In this movie you want to see cool action, cool use of superpowers, great fights with CGI that is not obvious and some tension about what happens next. This movie has it all. Academy awards? No. Amazing plot? No, but enough to keep it very interesting, with answers like where Adamantium comes from, Sabretooth and Wolverine relationship, introduction of Deadpool, early view of Cyclops, and much more that keeps the movie going along just fine. This is a solid action film, better than most.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Awesome - why are people complaining?!,"I have no idea as to why people bash Wolverine. I think its an extremely well made, highly entertaining movie with great acting and a fitting storyline. Its also pretty dark and uncompromising in many scenes.The fight scenes are brutal and intense which makes them really awesome.I was actually surprised by some of the plot twists. Great.The opening title sequence should win some kind of award. Gave me goose bumps. The editing is perfect.Only complaint is the few plot holes towards the X-men trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than expected,"Wolverine is a decent movie. It is worth the price of admission and the 2 hours of screen time. The movie works well as a prequel of the events of the X-Men movies. However, to enjoy the movie, one must suspend knowledge of the comic book material. The movie was made for the average movie-goer and a little for the ultra hardcore X-Men comic book reader. The story has everything anyone could want: family, a little romance, love, comedy, revenge and plenty of action.I was pleased with most of the acting. I will admit that some dialogue seems forced from the minor cast, but the main characters - Wolverine, Sabretooth, etc. - all work well together. The story did seem a little rushed and choppy at times, however. The 1:45 time goes by quickly enough to feel like maybe the movie could have - and should have - been closer to 2:00.The movie is as good as the first X-Men movie, and better than X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand. I am actually looking forward to seeing how they handle the Magneto origins movie that's being made. And I am really hoping that all of this work brings it together for a possible X-Men 4. I know you agree with me because after all, I know everyone is dying to see Apocalypse as the bad guy.My only real complaint of the movie is that Gambit (my favorite X-Men character) did not have as much screen time as I'd hoped. He better either get his own movie, or make an appearance in a later Marvel movie.Ignore the syndicated critics and the negativity surrounding this movie. I'm glad I did. Go see it. Don't let people scare you away from spending your money on this movie. Form your own opinions. Oh, and if you go, stay after the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unnecessary film,"The plot of the movie was interesting, because we would have the chance to get to know more about wolverine's past. However, it was kinda unnecessary. The storyline was just okay, nothing really interesting. Actually, it was kinda complicated. There were many new characters and some of them were well-developed, but it was kinda chaotic. In my opinion, we didn't needed that prequel, it was unnecessary. However, it was very intense and there were many battle scenes. The casting was probably the worst one, out of all the X-Men movies. The opening scene was kinda uninteresting and very boring. Actually, I have to admit that it was probably the most boring X-Men movie. The ending scene, was unexpected and it was well explained, because we could kinda understand what was going on..",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not a bad film by all means, but Wolverine did deserve a better origin story","The first X-Men film was fun and well-made though with a beginning-of-the-franchise-not-yet-properly-finding-its-feet feel; X-Men 2 was very, very good indeed and an example of a bigger and darker sequel better than the original(even if it wasn't quite perfect either) and X-Men 3 The Last Stand while nowhere near as bad as its reputation was disappointing(after being so impressed by the previous two) and a step-back in the franchise. X-Men Origins: Wolverine had much going for it but while it is nowhere near a bad film it could have delivered more, considering that this was an origins prequel story. X-Men Origins: Wolverine does have good things, it's well shot and edited(if a little rapid in a couple of the fighting sequences), the special effects are nicely executed and not used too much and the dark, gritty style of the previous three films is wisely maintained, nothing overblown or static here. The opening sequence is robust and exciting and gives you the sense of ""looks like we're in for a treat here"", most of the action sequences have tension and thrills especially at the end(which also makes a real effort to tie up loose ends), Sabretooth/Victor and Stryker are well-realised and there are a few good performances. Wolverine may be too ambivalent character-development-wise but Hugh Jackman's charisma and grizzled demeanour is pitched perfectly, Liev Schreiber brings real meat, toughness and menace to Victor/Sabretooth and Danny Huston as the villain Stryker is both classy and ruthless and does them very effectively, Stryker avoids being too one-dimensional. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch do what they can and are quite good.X-Men Origins: Wolverine does suffer however from a lot of the same things that X-Men The Last Stand had. The script is very contrived and in a worse way than X-Men The Last Stand, emotional moments are forced, exposition and any explanations are underdeveloped and any bits of humour are on the broad side(X-Men 2 especially avoided this and had a much more even balance). The story has some good atmosphere and good scenes and has some tension, but it does try to cram in too much and things feel rushed and not as developed as they ought. Gavin Hood does reasonably admirably in the action but very like Brett Ratner he is surprisingly not as comfortable in the non-action scenes, in a way that the writing and story, that should give the film depth, are sacrificed by the action(again mostly very good, apart from ones that did lag and you couldn't always tell who was who). Apart from Sabretooth and Stryker (Wolverine was written much better in the first two films but Jackman's presence did make up for things), the characters are disappointingly written, especially Deadpool who had a lot of potential but disappears just like that and appears even more abruptly much later at a stage where you think they've forgotten all about him. Gambit was also treated fairly insignificantly, and other characters like Blob and Kayla(Lynn Collins' acting is wooden in this part) are pretty useless. It doesn't have the too many characters problem like The Last Stand did but it like that film doesn't develop or write the characters well but not as insultingly. On a side note one positive review said that they couldn't understand why The Last Stand and this got criticised for the characters and the first two get a free pass; actually the first two films have been criticised for under-utilising characters and bad acting in them, namely Cyclops and Storm, but at least they tried to respect the characters and not distort them or deprive them of personality like this and Last Stand did(and this is NOT coming from a comic-book purist, far from it, you don't even need to have read an X-Men comic to have this criticism). Harry Gregson-Williams' score has some excitement and induces some suspense but at other points it's too over-bearing and strident, of the X-Men films this film had the least effective score in my opinion. Will.i.Am being cast in an X-Men film would cause alarm bells and his performance is not any better, it felt out of place.To conclude, could have been better but it's not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cool but average,"I was worried when i heard that they were making this movie. A prequel to a series that i liked a lot. I wasn't worried so much about Hugh Jackman as i was worried about the rest of the cast. After watching it i came out with mixed feelings. The Action and special effects, were awesome and Hugh Jackman was funny and cool. But the overall acting in the film was very average. The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, it seemed they wanted to get to the middle very quickly. The middle of the movie was cool but somewhat confusing if you arnt Knowledgebale about X-Men. The ending was the best part, i don't want to give anything away but there is a pretty epic battle at the end. And the ending bridges this movie with the others quite well. I liked this better than X-Men 3 Last Stand, but this wasn't a great movie. It's a gap filler nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The film missed the point of the character,"This film reminds me of Phantom Menace. You probably like it more when you're younger, but as you get older, the flaws are more apparent. The movie is weak and although it's not awful, it's so mediocre and on that fine line, that you might as well say it's bad. It's the weakest of all the Xmen movies and then X3 after that.The previous movies alluded to the idea that Wolverine was barely holding back his more intense rages. That struggle is what makes him so compelling - that with just one slip up he'd be more animal than man. So what I wanted from Origins was that crazy Wolverine that the current day guy was afraid of. Instead they presented a pretty levelheaded guy who just liked to fight, but not that much.Also, they totally botched the purpose of the Weapon X stuff. Namelythe purpose of the program is to subjugate mutants by treating them like objects, not people. So even if they wanted to go with the whole ""level headed Canadian"" for the first part of the movie, he should have been turned into that crazy, out-of-control animal after Weapon X. This way I could see his humanity stripped away, revealing the animal inside, and thus showing me why he's afraid that it'll get out again.Alas, his response to volunteering for the program is more of a casual confusion at his new, sharper claws. Basically, they missed the point of the character.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best There Is At What He Does! Exactly the Wolverine I wanted to see!,"Forget tedious expose and pointless set up, the movie delivers a crisp story and exactly the Wolverine I wanted to see. This is a pure meat and potatoes movie. Stick with me on the food analogy. I've seen some complain about subsidiary characters but when the main course is this good and this filling, who cares? Whining about Gambit, Wade Wilson and company is like whining that the mushrooms aren't as good as they should be when the steak is juicy and remarkably tasty. Great kick-ass action, remarkable visuals, a coherent plot, this is definitely the highlight of the year so far. As I like to note, a must see event film if there ever was one. Anyone that says otherwise isn't telling the truth. I can't think of a truly weak moment in the film because the pace is near perfect. It's strong from start to finish. The powerful moments resonate throughout the film, both the tremendous action and the heartfelt moments. The confrontations are simply incredible, best of the series.Wonderful film for fan and non-fan alike. Highly Recommended.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Rushed, silly and all-around disappointing","Despite the unoriginality of the title, X-Men Origins: Wolverine accomplishes what few titles do: it acknowledges the main character in the film (as played again by Hugh Jackman), and tells the audience exactly what it is going to be about ‚Äì the origin of Wolverine. Crisscrossing around timelines before settling on one undisclosed period before the first X-Men film, Wolverine chronicles how James Logan got his adamantium skeletal frame, how his relationship with Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) began, and everything in-between.While my small amount of knowledge in regards to X-Men lore is not as vast as others, I had an idea of what to expect from the film story-wise. And while it deviates from the comics in some rather large areas, other parts are fairly true to them.But in adapting this story to film, the filmmakers stumble right out of the gate. The storyline, as fantastical as it is, descends into silliness and absurdity faster than Wolverine can bring out his claws. I understand the material is based off of a comic franchise, but the filmmakers take this for granted. Instead of fleshing out a jumpy origin story, the film rushes from one point to the next, throwing dialogue and characters at the audience that people will either understand or be completely thrown off by. It takes the time to really make you understand the bond between Wolverine and Sabretooth, but then never makes any of the motivations of anyone else clear. There is so much going on here, and so little explanation that it is a miracle any of this came together at all. The whole film hinges on explaining Wolverine's origins, and what lead him to the gang in X-Men, but the film feels incomplete ‚Äì like something integral is missing.The X-Men series has always been about a group of people, and this film is no different. But whereas the other films had strong supporting casts backing up the main individuals, this film lacks any good supporting characters. Characters played by Dominic Monaghan, Kevin Durand, Will i Am and Daniel Henney are given so little to do that they could have been played by special effects. Each is given something to do, but so little is done to make them more than one-note that it is a wonder why they are even here in the first place. Other characters, played by the likes of Lynn Collins, the horrendously miscast Taylor Kitsch (who needs accent lessons) and Ryan Reynolds (in another stereotypical wise-ass role) are integral to the film, but have no time to really prove themselves as being useful to the film. They merely stand as plot devices, and items that the like of Jackman and Schreiber use to move from point A to point B. They have a point, but the filmmakers care less in giving them any real motivations or emotions. If they do not care, then why should an audience?If the story and the acting were a bit out of touch, the CGI fares even worse. In some scenes, it looks just fantastic and smoothly developed. In others, it looks fake and rushed. The bootleg copy of the film that circulated online before the movie opened apparently had very little special effects in place. That came out a month ago. Was that the working version of the film at that point, and everything else has been added in since? It would make sense for how patchy of a job some scenes look and how incredibly horrendous others look. Even simple scenes involving Wolverine's claws, which should look quite realistic by this point four films in, look horrible. Even the makeup effects (especially for one key character) are laughably bad. I know the film had its problems on-set and in post-production, but there is no excuse anyone could make for how bad some scenes look. When dated films from years past look better than something current, I think there is a problem.The villains played by Schreiber and Danny Huston are the most interesting part of the film. While not as key to the film as Wolverine himself, both deliver excellent performances that belong in better movies. Huston is deliciously evil as always, using his face to hint at ulterior motives while saying something else entirely. Schreiber gives a level of depth and ferocity that was totally missing from Tyler Mane's original performance in the first film. The animal of a man Schreiber becomes is nothing short of excellent. Both actors take the film seriously, even at its most ridiculous moments, and they make something of their roles that none of the supporting cast really attempts. Perhaps their scenes were not as cut up as others, but watching them act alongside anyone is proof that there is some form of a good movie buried deep within X-Men Origins: Wolverine.But the real strength of the film belongs to Jackman. He nails everything about Wolverine from his attitudes, to his mannerisms, to his behaviours. This is his most physical portrayal of the character, and it works the best because of how concrete and involved Jackman is. He knows this character, and never once does he leave him. He never falters. He dives headfirst into every scene he is in, and he gives it every single one the same amount of depth and complexity to make the character a real entity. This is not just a simple comic book character. We can see the layers of emotion, and the scarring this character goes through.I was not expecting a lot from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but I got even less than I wanted. The film feels too rushed, too silly to truly be what was originally envisioned for this film. Jackman, Schreiber and Huston all make it work, and make it watchable because they genuinely try; even with the often horrendous material they are given. I just hope this is not the beginning of a lousy summer.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Far better than I expected,"To tell you the truth I'm pretty surprised by all the negative reviews I've been reading on the IMDb and elsewhere on the net (AICN for example). I thought X-Men 1 and 2 came close to being masterpieces and that X-Men 3 sucked big time. The Wolverine movie however is well made, exciting and surprisingly effective. But that's an opinion from somebody who doesn't know anything about the comics. To me Wolverine is mainly a movie hero and maybe that can make a big difference.Two elements make this movie really work. Liev Schreiber - a very underestimated actor - does a great job as Wolverine's brother Victor/Sabretooth. It's their love/hate relationship that is the main subject in this story and that really keeps it interesting. In the first minutes of the movie this is well established. The opening credits are really beautiful.Second: the story. I really love the story. It has romance, betrayal, vengeance, action, a touch of immortality... All the good elements are there in the right doses.Yes, I really love this movie. I hope to see more of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the future, because there are a lot more adventures he can and should have. Maybe director Gavin Hood can repair some of the damage that Brett Ratner did with a X-Men 3. Because an X-Men 4 - with hopefully Josh Halloway as Gambit - would be a great spectacle indeed.There's only one big thing that really puzzled me. So the Liev Schreiber character is actually the same Sabretooth we see in X-Men 1? Because the two characters really don't seem the same in the two movies. Everything they have ""experienced together in the past"" (in the prequel) seems forgotten in X-Men 1 (when they only fight each other).Anyway, go see this!8,5 / 10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be,"This is the origins story of the mutant known as Wolverine and how he was attached to the weapon x project.When I first heard they were going to make this flick, I thought that the series was going to go into a nosedive. The third film in the X-men franchise lacked everything that made the first two films enjoyable. Now a spin-off? I wasn't having it and the fact that they seemed to ruin one of my favourite x-men characters in the trailers didn't seem to help either. Well, I can say this, the film is not that bad. It's actually decent and a step up from the horrid Last Stand. Although they do miss a few steps that really hurt the film as a whole.First off Hugh Jackman was born to play this character, here he is given more room to dive deeper into the animal and he does a great job. Mixing both comedic and dramatic elements, there is nothing new here to the character, just more of the same. More of the same though is fun and kick ass. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed, aka Sabretooth. His look is different from the first time we see him and he actually has some speaking lines here. Excellent casting choice, Liev really lets go here and you can see the fun he is having with the character.Now, onto the two things that are ruined, from a ""fan"" perspective. Deadpool and Gambit. Many fans knew going in that these two guys were both kick ass and that the film was not going to do them justice. Well, it's true. These two guys lacked the screen time and the badass personas that people have come to love. Ryan Reynold has 5 minutes of screen time, he does he usual jokey bits like in Blade Trinity, but here it fits for the character. We see one scene in which he uses his blades to deflect bullets, quite cool. Then he is gone for the rest of the film. Gambit shows up 3/4 of the way through and is horribly underused. Why is he in here again? His scenes lacked a lot of punch it seems that his character was only used to draw in fans. The character in the film could have been anybody else and it wouldn't effect the story, but they chose Gambit cause fans wanted to see him. You will be disappointed.The final fight sequences is interesting, I don't want to go into details cause that would give away certain plot points, specifically who the final fight scene is with and why he is fighting him. I have to raise another complaint though, as for the explanation for Wolverine's so called memory loss. They don't explain it very well in the film, they just say that this will make him not remember. Why? I don't know. Fighting fire with fire just doesn't make sense to me. The explanation for his memory loss is truly pathetic and doesn't make any sense.There are cameos from a lot of mutants, cyclops as a kid is one and another one at the end that fans will enjoy. I thought that they could have trimmed the running time down a bit, currently 1hr46min. Subplots don't really work in this film, I'm talking about his love interest. A lazy way to try and drive the plot forward.The action sequences range from enjoyable to laughable. The opening credit sequences is neat and mirrors what Watchmen did.Fans will most likely be disappointed by the lack of respect this ""origin"" story deserved. It's leaps and bounds over the last film, but that's not really saying much. The special effects are the worst in the entire series, which is a huge let knock against it because it's almost ten years after the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Wolverine"" 's journey is more about the visuals than the character","The superhero genre reached a higher echelon in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" and considering the success of 2/3 of the X-Men franchise so far, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" can certainly be held to those standards, especially a movie whose title alone suggests getting right down to its hero's adamantium core.But ""Wolverine"" plays more like a spin-off, defining ""origins"" as the back story and not the psychological workings of the character. It's weak on themes, but loaded on more new mutants with new powers, explosions and plenty of subplots. Basically, it fails where ""X-Men 3"" did, trying to do too much at once, rushing the plot along and sacrificing the deeper reason audiences are drawn to Hugh Jackman's character other than he's cool and has a crude, sarcastic sense of humor. However, it succeeds much of the same way X3 did and beyond: more explosive action and creative use of an immense visual effects budget. Although director Gavin Hood doesn't bring more insight into the film with his work, he certainly has as good of an eye for the stylish as anyone.The first sign that you know this movie isn't going to be top tier for superhero flicks is the number of mutants/villains. For a story about one, singular X-man, there are way too many other characters to follow: Col. Stryker is their ringleader, but Sabretooth (Schriber), Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Reynolds), Bolt (Monaghan), Gambit (Kitsch), Wraith (will.i.am), Agent Zero, the Blob and young Cyclops (not to mention a slough of extras) make the film dizzying. Especially at the beginning, we need to see more Wolverine -- it's his movie.To the film's credit, its quick movement makes it easy to watch and entertaining and there's some surprisingly good comedic timing on Jackman's part for an action movie. Seriously though, it must have been a blast (no pun intended) on the set during action sequences because they actually destroyed everything they possibly could: CGI, real and both. This film is the beginning of what will surely be mind-blowing visual effects at the movies this summer. Hood gives new visual strength to the franchise and provides a much more epic feel to this film -- it's clearly about this grand journey for Wolverine, even if it's more spectacle than introspective.Surprisingly, the ending was the most satisfying part of the film. All the subplots converge, it makes sense and the loose ends that fans of the first three films will notice get tied up fittingly at the end. For the whole first hour of the film you're juggling Wolverine and Sabretooth's rivalry, Stryker's team of guys with powers, Wolverine's romance with Kayla out in the wilderness, what's happening to the team of guys with powers ... why the heck kid Cyclops is in the movie ... it's not overwhelming, it's just not as enjoyable when you can't focus on one thing or character as much as you'd like. Still, the ending justifies the strange means, at least in terms of the epic battle that ensues.""Wolverine"" is not a travesty for the genre, but it certainly doesn't meet the expectations for a thorough superhero movie experience. You get amped up action and style over meaning and that makes it entertainment more than catharsis. Expect to be entertained and little else and ""Wolverine"" will satisfy your itch for the summer movie season.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Great action, sex appeal, a powerful and emotional script, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? See This Gem","The first real blockbuster of 2009 and deservingly so.

"Okay movie, not the most memorable of them all though","I am a huge fan of the X-Men movies. That being said, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was not as great as it could have been. Here, we have a classic modern hero story where the main character, the Wolverine, is angsty and struggling with personal image, that of which many people today identify with. He fits perfectly into today's society's image of a hero because he has overcome pain and suffering, gone through a heartbreak, and now fights for what he believes in. Even though it is clear that the Wolverine is a superhero, he is on the verge of a tragic hero. Hugh Jackman's acting adds significantly to the plot, drawing emotions from the audience perfectly; however, his acting still couldn't hide the fact that all the parts of the story were too much for the movie to handle.Although the back story was told well, there were many components that the directors unsuccessfully told. In this movie, there is quite a number of tragic heroes. Some might think this is good because it adds drama to the story and is pretty interesting in general, but there were too many characters that came and went, making the story too hard for me to imagine and follow along with. The directors try almost too hard to incorporate all of the original characters, and it turns out pretty sloppy. Still, the movie is enjoyable because it has the ending that viewers will be satisfied with and can easily take away. It has a moral that aligns with all of the modern hero movies: that the things you perceive are not always true to nature, but it's the way you deal with that situation that makes you worthy of success in the end. Overall, this adequately addresses the struggles in the Wolverine's life and fulfilled my neutral expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not quite the movie fans deserve.,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is basically a soulless movie. I found almost all of the performances to be good, Hugh Jackman was great as always. The visual effects were good, the stunts were good, etc.The movie falls apart due to the writing. All the relationships between characters feel like they were just thrown together randomly because it was convenient. Wolverines past ( pre-adamantium ) takes up about the first 5 minutes of the movie, with some creative writing that 100ish years of his life could have been very interesting.Basically this movie is an excuse to get as many mutants on stage as they can. Wolverine's back story takes second place to this and suffers due to that.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Surprising ""Wolverine""","Hugh Jackman is powerful in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". ""Wolverine"" is the fourth ""X-Men"" movie. Jackman as ""Wolverine"" may have made the transition to crossover box office movie star. ""Wolverine"" works as the modern telling of the classic hero story with Jackman as the tragic hero Logan/Wolverine. In the scene of ultimate betrayal, Logan regrets, ""I ignored my instincts. I ignored who I am. I won't ever let that happen again¬Ö"" For a visually stunning action tale ""Wolverine"" has surprising pathos. Director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") and writers David Benioff (""Troy"") and Skip Woods convey a mesmerizing and compelling story for the first hour. I think the ""Wolverine"" narrative falters a bit at the last 10 minutes, because of the comic book mythology constraint. However, in retrospect this is actually fine.Despite this, ""Wolverine"" evokes a visceral vengeance tale in the fierce conflict between Logan (Jackman) and his deadly rival Victor Creed (commanding Liev Schreiber), Logan's half-brother. Under the direction of Hood, their battles are bloody and full of rage. At a story arc during a vicious claw wielding struggle Creed commands Logan, ""Do it!"" The hero Logan must choose his fate.Hugh Jackman, already anointed ""Sexiest Man Alive 2008"", looks incredible, his body is totally shredded. More impressive than his physicality, Jackman awes in his riveting performance as Logan, a man who suffers great tragedy and consumed by tremendous rage. Jackman never tames the animal in Logan, but he manages to humanize him with honor and compassion.""Wolverine"" tells the back story of the most captivating character of the ""X-Men"" mythology. Logan is a mutant with unheard of regenerative and healing powers, which makes him virtually ageless. He possesses great strength, animal-like reflexes and senses, and claws that retract from his hands. Logan is a killing machine without equal.We learn that Jimmy (Logan) and his half brother Victor are forced to leave their home in 1845 following a family tragedy surrounding Jimmy's discovery of his mutant powers. Logan and Victor fight in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Vietnam War. Recognizing their deadly gifts shadowy William Stryker (deceptively evil Danny Huston) asks Logan and Victor to join his ""special team"". Members include other powerful mutants like Wade Wilson (charming and charismatic Ryan Reynolds) who can split bullets with a katana, and strongman Dukes (good Kevin Durand). During a ruthless mission in Africa, Logan realizes what he may become as he witnesses Victor's fall into the dark abyss. Logan declares, ""I'm done!""Logan finds peace in Canada with the love of his life Kayla (stunningly beautiful and strong Lynn Collins). However, the world can not let Logan be. Col. Stryker and Agent Zero (silently charismatic Daniel Henny) track Logan down. Apparently, someone is brutally killing members of his former team. Grave tragedy soon befalls Logan, and he is consumed by vengeance, ""I'm coming for blood, no code of conduct, no law!"" Stryker obliges, ""You will have your revenge."" Logan agrees to become the virtually indestructible Weapon X having Adamantium fused to his skeleton. Discerning certain betrayal by Stryker, Logan now wielding Adamantium claws goes rogue in an electrifying display of berserk rage. However, Logan soon unveils the depth of his betrayal.Writers Benioff and Woods introduce perhaps one too many mutants. Although, some of the characters are engaging, like ally Gambit (strong wise guy Taylor Kitsch). Perhaps, the story's profound strength is Lynn Collins's Kayla. Here Benioff and Woods amaze as Kayla tells Logan the Indian legend of the Moon and the Wolverine. Jackman and Collins have a touching chemistry. We truly believe that Kayla's love calms the beast in Logan. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has great story telling and heart pounding action throughout the first half. I think Hood kind of rushes his narrative toward the end which may be more an artifact of the comic book mythology. In the end ""Wolverine"" satisfies as the classic hero story, and Hugh Jackman compels as the story's awesome hero.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I'm the best there is at what I do"" could hardly be further from the truth","Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen, Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However, unlike Watchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine's inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive and horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe, familiar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion scenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story.While further focus on the Wolverine/Sabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger, the film continually broadens its scope, seemingly attempting to bank on the in-jokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But while their fan nods were tasteful and enjoyable, Wolverine's attempts at matching them appear to be building up to an almost sinister bid for Fox's superhero franchises to compete. Recognizable X-Men characters are continually shoehorned into minuscule parts (fans of Deadpool, Blob, Gambit or, *groan*, Cyclops don't go in expecting much but disappointment) for seemingly the sole purpose of leapfrogging off Wolverine's story into their own spin-offs. However, such an overflowing mass of secondary characters only serves the dual purpose of both derailing Wolverine's story and not even serving to satisfy comic fans clamouring to see their favourite characters on screen, as the fleeting, shallow depictions hardly prove satisfying character development by any stretch of the imagination. If the filmmakers choose to tackle established characters to appease fan expectations, doing nothing with the characters (let alone doing them far from 'properly') hardly seems a suitable way to satisfy a demanding audience.Director Gavin Hood (known for excellent African drama Tsotsi of all things) has been vocal about his clashes with the studio over the film, and one can only assume, given his excellent credentials, that most of his proposed changes would have been for the better. As it is, Hood demonstrates a shaky directorial presence at best, masking his action scenes in whirling cameras making it near impossible to see, and complimenting most tense or dramatic scenes with a cascade of Harry Gregson-Williams' tiresomely banal and clich√©d musical score. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality, but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments (sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes, a promising African raid plot point, and an undeniably gripping if under-explored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program). But, like the irritatingly freeze-frame beset but otherwise clever opening montage (showcasing Wolverine's progression through numerous world wars) such quality is often overshadowed by cringe-worthy prevailing flaws making it all the more difficult to appreciate.Ironically for the film situating him most justifiably in the lead role, Hugh Jackman gives his weakest performance in his foundational role as Wolverine. While Jackman's natural charisma and steely credibility still make him a far more sturdy enough lead than his film deserved, his under-exploring of Wolverine's feral ferocity and darkness still leaves an ultimately unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Despite initial skepticism of miscasting, Liev Schreiber proves far more resonant as Wolverine's animalistic adversary Sabretooth, providing a savagely threatening yet controlled performance, which, despite falling short of the true animalistic frenzy Sabretooth should have been, proves one of the more successful attributes of the film. Similarly, Danny Huston provides a welcome dash of class as Machiavellian military official William Stryker, managing to overcome the shortcomings of an underwritten character with an impressively realized, wonderful presence. Ryan Reynolds also proves perfectly cast as twisted mercenary Deadpool, thankfully managing to suppress star showiness in favour of suitably manic humour - nonetheless, Reynolds is criminally wasted in a far too brief and insultingly warped butchering of his comics incarnation. Taylor Kitsch, conversely, gives a bland, dopily flat take on fan favourite Gambit, the character's legendary suave charisma as nonexistent as Kitsch's Cajun accent, doing little to justify his character's near pointless addition.While it may function suitably as mindless summer entertainment, the inherent complexity in Wolverine's backstory makes its reduction to such a near outright insult to fans of the comic source material. If left as a standalone film, Wolverine might have been dismissible as a mostly harmless disappointment, but with such blatant spin off begging, it evolves into something far more objectionable. While the film has its moments, as a cohesive unit it can be considered nothing less than a tragic waste of potential, floundering any inherent quality in gaping plot holes and unnecessary obvious comedy or ""tearjerking"" scenes. Wolverine's adage of him being ""the best I am at what I do"" could hardly be farther than the truth when applied to his film.-4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
THE best prequel movie of all-time.  A+,"It has a very good storyline, the non-stop forward-moving pace works well and gives it a tone that works better then other, longer movies. It's very well directed and the acting (small, medium, and large roles) is PERFECT. I would have loved to have seen more of Gambit and Wilson even though that might have screwed with the pace that I just mentioned. The very best movie of 2009 regardless of genera. This is so gritty, real, and heartfelt that it even craps on the last film (Last Stand) and I actually enjoyed that film. Overall this movie was the best that I've seen this year.There is not one wasted line, visual, camera angle or development in this entire movie. Everything serves to advance the plot. It was tight and lean and superbly done. I truly think that this is the best prequel movie of all-time. How could you not like it? From the new mutants to all of the special effects to the crisp pace¬Ö I loved it. I loved the ending. You can obviously see the attempt to tie this film to events from the trilogy but it all works neatly and tightly. Wolverine is the first movie this year that I want to see again. It's one heck of an entertaining movie.10/10 superb!!! I can't wait for the DVD...

"As good as expected, but no better","This is a solid, action-packed movie about the origins of ""the Wolverine"", one of the more intriguing characters among the X-men. It manages to both hold its own as a movie outside of the X-men universe and also offer a strong introduction to the character of Wolverine in the X-men movies. The background story, for those not as familiar with the comics, is a well portrayed version of one of the darker character stories in the comic book world, and shows why the character from the X-men movies is one of the more emotionally complex. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is mainly an action movie without pretending to be much more, but a relatively enjoyable one overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Missed Opportunity,"*X-Men Origins: Wolverine* promised a deep dive into the iconic character's past but ultimately fell short of expectations. While the film boasts a talented cast and impressive action sequences, it suffers from a convoluted plot, questionable character choices, and a disregard for established X-Men lore.Hugh Jackman delivers another solid performance as Wolverine, capturing the character's gruff exterior and inner turmoil. Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth is a worthy adversary, bringing a menacing presence to the screen. However, the film's attempt to cram in numerous X-Men characters, including a rather disappointing Deadpool, feels rushed and undermines the focus on Wolverine's story.The action sequences are undeniably thrilling, showcasing Wolverine's formidable abilities in brutal fashion. However, the film's pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition interrupting the momentum. The decision to give Wolverine a plethora of powers, including optic blasts, felt like a misguided attempt to create a superhero amalgam rather than a character-driven exploration.While *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* offers some entertaining moments, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential. The film's disregard for established continuity and its focus on spectacle over character development leave a sour taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely could have been much better,"The Wolverine character was first introduced - cinematically - in Bryan Singer's first X-Men movie. There, he was presented as a tough, violent individual who knew very little about his past, and even less about how he got his awesome powers. That was part of the film's charm - that one of its main characters was a complete mystery, and the way this mystery was treated was very effective. The purpose of Origins is to reveal this mystery, but I'm not sure if it was a very good idea in the first place.Unless you know nothing about he movie, you probably know that it eventually shows Logan taking part of the Weapon X program - it shows how he gets his adamantium skeleton and claws. The thing is, this part of the movie should have been treated as more important. There's no suspense towards this very significant transformation. No anticipation. The sequence itself last little more than 15 minutes, and ends up with Logan escaping - quite easily - from Stryker's grasp. And then, I also thought his lack of memory had to do with the experiment itself, but it doesn't. The way his amnesia - which is a very important aspect of the original X-Men flicks - is explained is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film - a very idiotic and ultimately senseless explanation indeed.If there's one level I thought the movie worked beautifully, it's action-wise. There are quite a few action set pieces, and every one of them work on their own right. Granted, I'm not saying there's anything particularly groundbreaking in here - actually, movies like the aforementioned Iron Man and The Dark Knight and even The Incredible Hulk were more successful because they were actually capable of gathering suspense - but it all looks pretty cool. The thing is, I actually never though any of this characters were in danger - although that's maybe because both Wolverine and Victor are almost immortal beings. Visually, there's nothing particularly striking - the CGI is at times competent and at times a little too attention-calling (the final set piece in the nuclear reactor comes to mind), and the physical effects, including make up for a particular nemesis, aren't bad.Hugh Jackman is, as always, excellent in the role which gave him fame. He knows the character, and maybe that's why the film works more than it should considering its mediocre screenplay. Liev Schreiber is surprisingly good as Victor - the man's made a career playing more cerebral, less physical characters, but in here he proves he's really excellent at playing ruthless villains. Danny Huston doesn't exactly channel Brian Cox's ""version"" of Stryker, but he's good nevertheless. Taylor Kitsch is lame as Gambit, and Ryan Reynolds (who's actually really good) is wasted as Wade Wilson. Considering both their characters were some of the most anticipated by the fans, their limited screen time is a really bad move by the filmmakers.I was really entertained by X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mainly because Hugh Jackman is so damned good at playing the titular character and because, although the action sequences were pretty ordinary, they looked awesome. Compared to some of the comic book films I mentioned earlier in this review, though, it's a pretty big disappointment. Considering everything that has been told in comic books about this character, much more could have been done with an origins motion picture, but the filmmakers decided to focus on action and violence... so there you go. The funny things is, director Gavin Hood is not an action director, so why bring him? And to think that I thought his presence could make the film focus more on character than on fights, explosions and CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fox makes another ""Not Bad"" movie","I saw this movie over the weekend. When it was over, I kind of sighed, shrugged and said it was okay.I gave the movie a 5 which I think is pretty darn generous. Here's the positives of the movie. The actors are very good. Hugh Jackman, Liev, Ryan Reynolds are all very good actors, and each of them play their roles well. There was action, action, explosions, and more explosions. There certainly wasn't any shortage of eye candy. I think most Wolverine fans would probably like this movie.Here's the negatives. We all learned the hard way when X-Men 3 came out, that Fox could seem to care less about the source material. They just want to make action moves with lots of special effects. Wolverine is a testament to that same disappointing philosophy. While Wolverine fans may like the movie, ""Marvel"" fans will probably feel a little ill.I'm surprised that they haven't figured out yet why Marvel's movies are blockbusters (Iron Man, The Hulk), and thiers are always sub-par. Marvel uses good stories, acting, and smart witty scripts to keep us interested. Every half baked, killed off for the movie, or completely ruined character Fox throws in there just ruins the experience for a fan somewhere. Marvel may modernize the stories, but they respect the source material. Not only does that make comic fans happy, but the stories tend to make more sense, and have more relatable characters.On a side note, the fact that Fox apparently has the rights to Deadpool makes me want to cry. Give it back to Marvel so we can get a decent movie, without blades coming out of his arms and lasers out his eyes.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Pure X-Men experience !!!,"To tell you the truth, i never expected this movie to take me to that point.I felt like I was 13 again. it was excellent. By far this is the best X men movie made, that brought out the real Marvel X men experience which i loved. Obviously from the first X men movie it self we knew that Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine, and he has turned out to e a legend. i don't think anybody else in this world could bring out the animal and portrait Logans sensitive side both at the same time. It was brilliant. And it would be a crime if i don't mention the spectacular performance by Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth AKA Victor Creed. My god he was the Villain of the story, but his reflection of sabertooth made all X men fans to fall in love with him. I fell in love with that character. it was like the true cartoon sabertooth from the 1980's was brought to life. I hated the sabertooth that was in X Men 1. it was like a bad soft toy. Finally what made this movie the best X men movie is not the graphics or the effects, or sound, It was the Strong Story which happen to be the true story of Wolverine. Don't get me wrong though the graphics effects, sounds were excellent. Then as every Critic i have a few Criticism's as well. The main thing what i don't like in this move is what they did to dead pool at the end. That never happened!! they made that awesome mutant a freak!! I loved his performance (could've done better) and i love that Character Dead Pool. They could've used him Differently. Having said That overall it was a brilliant movie. All true Old marvel comic X men lovers would worship this movie. I can't wait till they create the next movie and i really really love to see my all time favorite one of the most powerful Mutants, APOCALYPSE!!!! in it...

Shiny noisy and pointless. The Paris Hilton of films.,"WOW! A film about a character out of the three X-Men movies, none of which I cared for, how can I pass that up?Another example of the American hard-on for prequels, Wolverine jumps straight into the action with young Wolvie killing his pop after discovering his new talent, and he and his brother run off, never to return.(I remember when I was Wolvie's age, hair was growing in various new and exciting places - especially my sideburns! - my hair grew naturally into all sorts of weird gravity defying configurations, and hardened steel grew out of my hands, it is a beautiful time when you are 12 years old.)Hugh and Liev Schreiber at least throw themselves into the action with the early goings on, turns out that in 1845 they were both young kids and as they grew up over the next 150 years they decided to do what they were best suited, and fight in any and every war over the period.In one of the latter battles they are approached to join a newly created group of mercenaries, kind of a special ops sort of deal with a bunch of similarly gifted men, (read: mutants).The unit is lead by Stryker, and Logan and Victor, as the boys are still known at this time are initially in their element. However after a time they are given orders that go beyond your ordinary garden variety ""soldiering"" and Logan objects, to the point that he leaves the unit, Victor decides that this is the life for me and stays on.It is obvious that the guys in the unit are the guys that we will be spending the rest of the film with, and it was at this point in the film that I became very concerned with how the next 70 minutes would progress. We have members of the all 2000s B-Team: Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan and Will.I.Am.Let me just say when you stock your cast with three guys of that calibre, you are aiming too low, and yes I am aware that one of them was a hobbit at one time.I was never going into Wolverine expecting ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Iron Man"", but putting pretty boys and not character actors in these roles gives me the impression that the film-makers are more worried with name recognition than they are their product.Ryan Reynolds further ruined the (already ordinary) Blade:Trinity, and hasn't made a single thing of substance in a mediocre career. Will.I.Am cannot act and Dominic Monaghan's career hasn't soared since LOTR, though personally I blame the talking trees.So where were we? Oh yeah, I guess what I am saying is that Hugh Jackman is a good looking boy, with a fairly formidable physique in this film. After he decides he disagrees with the unit's genocide policy and leaves we move to 6 Years Later mode.Logan is now working hard for his cash as you would expect, and has shacked up with a chick who looks like the offspring of Renee Zelleweger and Catherine Keener, and if that is even possible I want an immediate stop to all genetic engineering, as it was badly misused in this case.It becomes evident to us (in a scene where Dominic Monaghan just straight-out slaughters an American accent) that someone is hunting down former members of the unit, and Stryker visits Logan and his laydee to warn them.Unfortunately Logan ignores the warning and (backhanded) offers of help, and finds the crumpled body of his girly. In the defense of the killer, a few minutes previous she gave Logan a crappy ""moon spirit world"" story that had me hoping she would die. For that alone Hugh Jackman gets my nomination as Best Actor, as any guy knows how hard it is to appear interested when their partner recounts a dream or spreads a 2 minute anecdote into a four hour saga.So Wolvie is understandably p****d and goes back to Stryker to get souped up, in a scene designed specifically to enable Jackman to Rooooaaaaarrrrr out of the water, which admittedly does look pretty cool.Once again Jackman is the handsome loner and decides he'd rather go it alone, and after a brief respite to find a leather jacket and a motorcycle the final half an hour is a snail trail of chase scenes and fight scenes, with only pause for the introduction of some new characters who were ""so cool"" I have already forgotten them.The one scene I did like - 99% thanks to CGI - was a motorcycle chase which features a pretty literal source to the term ""handbraking"". The finale occurs on ""The Island of Dr Stryker"", where the Doc has amassed an impressive collection of mutants in handy cages, including a guy with laser rays that come from his eyes who never thinks to use them on the bars.In keeping with the glossy, shiny, just-do-enough adequacy policy that describes most Hollywood tripe, X-Men blah blah blah is OK without wowing anyone older than 12, there ain't much to it.To those who say it could have been worse, I say that perhaps you should reevaluate your standards and aim higher. There are enough good movies out there that you shouldn't have to watch stuff like this.Final Rating ‚Äì 6.5 / 10.

Aw...Come on everybody....!,"I'll admit...I never read the comic, I basically knew who Wolverine and Sabertooth were and based on that it is an ... okay flick.It seemed to try to tie itself to the other three X-Men Flicks out there as not to disrupt what is already on celluloid. Maybe that is why I could follow it more than the fans who know the comic book bell, book and cradle.Hugh Jackman is always nice to see as Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth was okay as well. Not as bloodthirsty as I believe he could have been though. The first part of the movie really gets your attention - and how Wolverine becomes Wolverine is...interesting. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is doing a fine piece of work here...and then there's Taylor Kitsch as Gambit. I really wanted to know more about Gambit, and what they showed of him was interesting enough, but not in depth enough, as with Deadpool. Focusing on those 4 would have been fine enough of a story...the rest of the folks seemed awfully padded with an awfully padded storyline.And...I was a big fan of Brian Cox (X2) as Stryker - he was cold, chilling kind of man, and this Stryker wasn't quite up to that - or made me believe that years from this story he would turn into the devious/coldness of Brian Cox as Stryker.

Too Many Sour Notes,"My son got me involved in these movies and, having not grown up reading the X-men, I am frequently forced to ask questions of him to clarify the events. That being said, I have enjoyed the movies mostly and have picked up on some of the ethos. This one is interesting in that it explains some things, disappointing in that there are so many unexplained phenomena in it. I do like Hugh Jackman, the angst ridden protagonist, but the story is so over the top that it leaves me with more questions than when I entered the theater. I also have trouble with the powers that characters have and which are more powerful than others and what their weaknesses are. Are they indeed incapable of being destroyed one time and vulnerable the next. Yes, I know the comic books explain these things but with all their sophisticated abilities, they still spend most of their time pounding on each other.

Tends to entertain,"I'll start by saying that I honestly have not read any of the source material about at least half of who appears in this. I cannot comment on how those were done. I haven't watched the leaked version. This is a mixed bag, and it definitely could have been better. The very beginning is unclear and muddled, and (what describes much else in this) a disappointing waste of potential. I'll go over the positive first. Jackman basically *is* Wolverine. Schreiber does the attitude and sadism of Creed well, and he did bulk up for this. Reynolds is spot-on, when he's there. This is more raw than the X-Men films, and the tone is darker, whilst following the realism-based approach of them. The term ""badass"" fits well. The action is almost invariably awesome, enjoyable and exciting. The fights are well-done. The bone claws, as far as I know and could tell, were done right. The CGI is marvelous. This doesn't overstay its welcome. It ties into the other reasonably well. Now... this manages to have the same problem as the trilogy it's sort of a spin-off of. They try to fit in too many characters and powered people, and most get little to no personality, screen time or stuff to do. However, unlike that series, here, they aren't written around as much, you'll know what they do instead, if you have seen it, and you shouldn't if you haven't. Abilities are shoehorned in some, and the script, at times, feels like it was put together around the showdowns and such that they wanted in there, trying to include every mutant that they wanted, or that they felt the audience would wish to see in there. The nods at the comics range somewhat. The pace is uneven, rushing at points. The drama is actually effective, at its best, and captures some of the core of the anti-hero. It's sad that there are typical clich√©s and that, at the worst times, this feels like a lame revenge flick. It does hold nice twists, and there are excellent moments in this... what they do with the ""procedure"" in this is nice and well-done. It's all shot well, cinematography and editing are great. The acting is... not all quite good. Several depictions leave something to be desired. There is violence and disturbing content in this, if bloodless. There is infrequent, moderately strong language. I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels, the movie franchise and those who helped make this. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underdeveloped and Overproduced,"This film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.Many viewers, myself included, will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered, but that only makes the film a poor adaptation, not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes, as is Sabertooth, though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.The ""final boss"" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is.

Surprisingly Great!,"This is something rare of me saying that a movie featuring a hero is THAT good. I know the characters, although almost haven't watched the cartoons or read the comic books, but I watched the 3 other X-Men films and they're great. With this one I loved everything. The action scenes were incredibly well made, breathtaking, no shaky camera and all of it was involving (my favorite was the last one). And even more rare than my opinion is the dramatic scenes, who were very good too. Everything was balanced here and the result is not disappointing despite some exaggerations.Logan/Wolverine returns (or better, forget everything this movie is about his past) played by the great Hugh Jackman. His story is told since he was a child and then it evolves in his fighting on many wars. He and his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by a group of mercenaries conducted by William Straker (Danny Huston in the role given to Brian Cox in ""X2""), when something goes wrong and Logan decides to leave the team, while his brother stays with them. The story jumps again, he mets a girlfriend and he's happy until Victor and Stryker reapers trying to convince Logan join a new experiment involving transformation of the mutants power. And then the fights begin...The transformation of Wolverine might have countless clich√©s but still makes this movie worth watching. The visual effects were right on the target, very well made. The casting was fabulous (even Will.I.Am was great playing a mutant, sort of like the same powers of Nightcrawler). Director Gavin Hood made a terrific job here and I sincerely hope that Hollywood calls him again to make a similar movie or perhaps the X-Men Origins of another member of the team. What else can I say? I really loved it and I wasn't bored at all which is something that happens in some pictures of the genre. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Nearly As Bad As Its Reputation,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)** 1/2 (out of 4)It seems that this prequel has gotten mostly negative reviews and those who didn't have a mixed reaction to it either downright hated every second of it or simply wished that they had never viewed it. I personally don't see why the film has so much venom aimed at it because even though it's flawed there's still enough here to make it worth watching. What we've basically got is a film that gives us the backstory to how Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) came to be who he is. You'd think that with a plot like this you'd get some character development or at least really learn a lot about him but in fact you don't. Perhaps this is where some of the hatred comes from because you really don't get to learn too much about Wolverine other than a sequence in front of the credits. The credit sequence features Wolverine and Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) going through various wars in American history and I must admit that this here was the best part of the film. It actually made me wish the entire film dealt with the way these two men were involved in these real life events. However, that's not the case and what we're left with is the two of them constantly battling one another while various others around them get involved, get killed or reveal some sort of secret. For the most part I thought the film was entertaining enough to make it worth sitting through and there's certainly no doubt that Jackman owns the role by this point. I also thought Schreiber was extremely good as was Danny Huston and Ryan Reynolds. I do wonder why Wolverine and the Wade Wilson character are constantly stabbing people yet their blades contain no blood.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining,This is an entertaining movie but far from one of the best Superhero movies. I wish this movie would have been more of the quality of Logan but of Wolverines origins. Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed and Jackman were great together.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A joke, but a good one","Here's a movie that deserved every criticism it got, and is still pretty good. Yes, the script is horrible, and the story worse. Yes, the characters do things that make no sense just to push the movie along. No, it's certainly not a movie that does any justice to its titular character. But it's still kind of fun.Let me explain. You take three issues of any comic book, read them in order, a lot of the time, it's not gonna make much sense. But the word bubbles are so small, the pictures are so big, you don't really care. The characters do some crazy things, and it looks good. That's this movie all over. It starts with Wolverine, hero of the ""X-Men"" trilogy, as a child in pre-Canada Canada. He and his older brother go through some incomprehensible family trouble; Wolverine sprouts his bone claws, shouts ""NO!"" up into the air and the opening credits montage starts. That's what kind of movie this is.Wolvie and his brother grow up, his brother becomes Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), and they fight through every major American war together, simply to do it I guess. Maybe the film's director, the artistically higher-minded Gavin Hood, wanted to portray Wolvie and his brother as salt of the Earth, regular Men-type characters. It works good enough I guess, but all we get is a couple neutered fight scenes and a lot of snarling for the camera. They come off more like figures in the opening sequence of a video game, where you're waiting for the game to start.So Wolvie and Creed join this covert group of mutant spies/soldiers, one of them is Ryan Reynolds, one of them is Will.i.am, they each have powers, and so on. They go to another country and we get some impossible (but still aesthetically-pleasing) action scenes where some of them get to demonstrate their powers. Something happens, they get split up. Wolvie ends up living with a schoolteacher who is strangely good at ""persuasion"" (a bizarre attempt at subtle foreshadowing in a movie about people with superhuman powers).The woman, her character, is the glue that ties the whole movie together and the underlying joke beneath everything. She's given a couple lines in the beginning to create some sort of totally misguided Native American mystical past for her, but all we're thinking is, ""Who is she, and why is she in the movie?"" Wolvie's in love with her, or at least acts like he is, which is to say Hugh Jackman tries his best to act like he is, but there's absolutely nothing there and everyone seems to know it. She's a shameless, walking Plot Device, and the final bit of fate dealt to her character, and Jackman's final moment with her, is like a hilarious punchline to the idiocy of the whole story.Everything else has Wolvie running around, sprouting his claws, meeting some semi-to-actually-kinda-interesting characters like Blob and Gambit, and running in slow motion to do battle with his brother, Creed. Schreiber plays this role with real commitment and gusto, and an apparent lack of interest in how he looks. He comes off so crazy and ruthless he achieves that insane cartoon level of acting you see sometimes from Johnny Depp or, say, Danny DeVito in ""Batman Returns."" This movie really made me like Schreiber; I want him to take more roles like this one in the future.Listen, it's not great. But it is funny ‚Äì be that intentionally or not ‚Äì and it has some beautiful action scenes, particularly one atop a giant smoke stack at the end. They're not beautiful in concept or execution, just in the childish innocence of it all. See it once, or a couple times, for a few laughs.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should be sharper,"With the X Men trilogy done. 20th Century Fox did not want to let their franchise sit on its laurels and took an opportunity with their most popular character, Wolverine to have its own spin off film.Now all they needed was a story.They go for the Wolverine/Sabretooth rivalry but from the beginning it seems to be all too predictable with a big red hand pointing to any twists in the plot.Even the music gives you a nod as to what will happen next. I love a dumb action film, but this was just too dumb.Jackman is comfortable in the role of Wolverine, helped by a big pay cheque. Schreiber is animalistic enough as the vengeful Sabretooth and you have enough star cameos here there to keep things moving.Danny Huston, plays the younger version of Stryker and he is suitably chilling.Keep a look out for Wade Wilson, I think he will be back.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I Give Up!!!,"What can I say? Another disappointing Hollywood movie; this has only reinforced the fact that Hollywood is all about the big bucks & exploiting anything & everything that already has an established fan base; dumbing it down because they believe it makes the film more appealing to wider audience (In their mind this means more $). Whats next? 'The Crow' vs 'Watchmen', 'The Matrix' vs 'Star Wars' vs 'Star Trek' ? ? ?I was looking forward to seeing 'Wolverine'. I'll admit I was pumped; I wanted to learn more about the character (what makes him tick?) & where he came from. What happened? I get a 2hour CGI/FX sm√∂rg√•sbord, a predictable plot that goes nowhere, weaker than weak acting, a Deadpool fiasco & I learn't nothing that I didn't already know about Wolverine. What a disaster. The visuals are meant to be the icing on the cake; there is nothing holding this cake together.Why couldn't I get a proper dark serious R rated 'Wolverine', low budget, gritty, sex & violence, real drama, real characters. True to the source material; Wolverine is a complex character & his origin isn't exactly 'Butterflies & Faires'.Is Hollywood morbidly afraid to release a film that actually makes people think? A film that lets the audience use a bit of imagination to fill in the gaps & let them have their own interpretation, something that engages & stimulates them. Is it too much to ask for an interesting story & character development? All I know for sure is that I wont be seeing any new Marvel related films; I can make a better movie in my film class.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X marks the spot -- Great Film.,"This film was amazing because I liked the action but I also managed to squeeze a plot out of it, a humanistic, exciting plot at that. The first X-Men was good, X-Men 2 was beyond that, X-Men 3 may have lost ground but Wolverine picked up that ground and then some. It's a sequel that not only surpassed X3 but is intriguing and well structured.I've used this colloquialism before but ""X marks the spot"" and there are plenty of big action scenes throughout this amazing movie that it has to be called spectacular. Wolverine goes ballistic in a good way and the introduction to newcomers Gambit, Wraith and even Wade makes for an intriguing watch. It's action with a nice mix of smarts and fun. I don't understand how anyone can complain about that awesome ending. I guess I don't subscribe to the strict adherence to the source material as law. It more then works as a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Origins: Wolverine - a good addition to series,"I am a big fan of the original trilogy of X-Men films. Wolverine is my favourite character so I was really looking forward to watching this.I think the idea to learn more about his early life was a good idea. There was plenty of good over the top action and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is superb as usual but the story just wasn't as interesting as it could have been. It was just the kind of film where after 20 minutes it became very predictable.Overall I would still recommend this film, whether you have seen the original trilogy or not it should be quite easy to follow. It was decent viewing, a good addition to the series but not as good as the others.7/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All testosterone no fun,"This movie starts with Victor and his sick younger brother James in 1845 Canada. James kills the man who claims to be his father. The brothers fight together from one war to the next. In Vietnam, the brothers are supposed to be executed but end up recruited by Stryker (Danny Huston) joining a group of other mutants. James aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) quits the group leaving Victor (Liev Schreiber) for a life of a lumberjack with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Victor is hunting down the old team, and Stryker comes by to try to bring Logan back in. When Victor kills Kayla, Logan wants revenge and he's willing to get back in with Stryker who infuses him with adamantium.It's a lot of growling testosterone without the lighter moments. It's all about Logan's anger without any fun or comedy. Liev is fine and I would like to dig more into his character. They've put quite a few X-Men in this movie. It is probably trying to cover too much origins in this movie. This should be more Cain and Abel. Victor should be as important in this movie. This movie needs a good storyteller and not just somebody to check off a checklist. I'm not sure director Gavin Hood is the man for the job. The movie becomes overloaded.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Taming the wolf,"Even the extended version of this movie (which I watched to prepare myself for the upcoming sequel) seems to have all its teeth and claws pulled. But puns aside and if you don't care that much about this being made PG-13 (the new Wolverine will have an R or unrated version released after its theatrical run), than you might be able to enjoy this Origin story.This comes down to Hugh Jackmans passion and drive. While he does act in musicals and plays too, he is able to be convincing in his action roles. The game based on this movie has much more blood in it. The story is not overwhelming, but it does do the trick. I hope the next one can be better though. It's also a shame that they did recast (L. Schreiber is the new player) for a role that has already been played (by Tyler Mane). But I guess they needed a better known ""name"" for that role (it is not mentioned in the directors commentary btw.).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A lesson on why you should revisit movies, even ones you disliked: this was a lot of fun.","I remember back in 2009 how hated X-Men Origins: Wolverine was; I think it was largely a victim of the changing times. A year prior was the summer of The Dark Knight and Iron Man. It's hard not to understand why, in comparison, this film felt really dated (and, let's be honest, the Last Stand was so bad, I think it eroded a lot of audience good will)Would a gritty, dark Wolverine origin story resonate more with audiences? Maybe, but even I think there's a reason Logan came out in 2017 and not 2007, ya know? I think expectations doomed this movie, because honestly...I kinda liked this. More than I expected I would.Yes, there are problems. The editing, for one, is that quick and impatient style that feels cheap and almost TV-show like at times. The dialog is quite bad and some of the performances are as well. (The fact that the Will.i.am is in this movie is really funny and with his, slipping accent and robotic line delivery, he's as bad as you'd imagine) The visual effects also leave quite a lot to be desired. (I remember seeing the leaked version of this movie about a week before actually seeing it with my friends and...we weren't impressed by the end product)And of course, let's get this out of the way: Deadpool. The film does that 2000s superhero movie thing where they want to give you fan service (oh, look, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool!) but at the same time, don't want to commit properly out of insecurity (turn him into a voiceless, personality devoid husk). It was a terrible decision. Yet, given that we have two (and soon to be three) Deadpool movies featuring Ryan Reynolds, it's obviously not as bad as it was when this was only live action depiction of the character.Remember how I said The Last Stand felt like a dumbed down version of X-Men from the 1990s? Well this does too, but it feels way more appropriate here. Wolverine is an popcorn action movie through and through, and while the action focus and generic storyline put a ceiling on how good it could be, I think it does a fine job at what it's trying to do.Hugh Jackman continues to prove that regardless of the script, he's just electric as this character. He's so fun to watch and so likeable, yet the movie does a good job at showing how much more powerful he becomes as it goes on. The entire sequence with him getting the iconic adamantium skeleton was AWESOME, and the shot of him emerging from the water legitimately gave me chills.I'm also not usually a fan of Wolverine-as-happy-boyfriend, but I gotta say...I completely bought his relationship with Lynn Collins' s Silver Fox. She's so beautiful and has this aura about her where you can buy even a man as hardened as Logan would fall for her.Liev Schrieber was also great as Sabretooth, even if I wish he looked more comic (and even movie series) accurate. He had this playful intimidation to him and was a perfect foil to Logan. I even grew to like the idea that he was Wolverine's brother. Danny Huston is a really good William Stryker, not Brian Cox good, but definitely nothing to complain about.And then there are the fun side characters. I wish we could've gotten Wolverine and co. As special forces in random missions around the world and understood the dynamics of the characters more, but I'm happy we got it at all. The highlight for me is Gambit. Again, wish we saw more of him, but Taylor Kitsch did a really good job with him.The action scenes are also pretty fun. The opening scene is fun, the fight between Blob and Wolverine is fun, and the Gambit fight is incredible.About 30 minutes into this movie, again, completely expecting to hate it and move on, I found myself struggling to remember why I disliked it so much. Divorced from the context of 2009, with so many more X-Men movies out there (some obviously much better, some much worse), Wolverine actually feels like one of the better entries in the franchise. Colour me surprised.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best of the X,"""I'm the best at what I do and what I do ain't pretty"" This film surprisingly stays fairly true to what we know about Wolverine and the ""Weapon X"" program through the comic books. The film is largely based in Barry Windsor-Smythe's ""weAponX"" which was run as a serial in the ""Marvel Comics Presents"" comic book line and later released in Trade Paperback form.There is a lot here for fans of Wolverine, certain aspects of this story were taken right from the Wolverine series of 1988 - Wolverine's relationship with ""Silver Fox"" uses a lot of elements straight from the books and that ""chapter"" of the wolverine story is actually fairly close to the source material. The only dramatic license I did not like was that Sabretooth and Wolverine are shown as brothers.Since the weAponX story by BWS was drawn in a cinematic style, a lot of the imagery from that book survives translation to Film format just as well as any Frank Miller book.While a lot of creative license was taken with some characters and some of the events that occur, much of the dialogue is taken straight from the books and the overall concept is maintained.Regarding the look of the film, I can use one example, when ""Gambit"" reveals his powers, the image we are given matches the iconic profile of Gambit- From the comic books and the 1992-96 Cartoon.Since ""Victor Creed/Sabretooth"" was a major part of this film, I was semi-disappointed that they did not get Tyler Mane to reprise his earlier 2000 role (Or, pre-prise, whatever the word would be) - The original X-Men film had perfectly cast Sabretooth. I wish they had cast Liev Schreiber for that original film, as he gives more to the character than occasional grunts and snarls that Tyler Mane used for language. Schreiber actually gives the character valid depth and darkness and is less of a cardboard cutout. My only real gripe about using a new actor for this role is that they did not try to match the image from the books, as the 2000 film did perfectly. And so the popular image of Wolverine engaged in mortal combat with Sabretooth- As painted by former Wolverine artist Mark Texiera and reproduced as a huge poster - That image was damaged and I do not know if other Wolverine fans are a forgiving as I am.Regardless of if the reason ""James Logan"" becomes part of the Weapon X program is the same reason as the comic books (In The comic books Logan is abducted) - The Process of Wolverine accepting the ""Adamantium"" metal to his bones is the centerpiece of this film, it is the most important part of the film, and as far as I am concerned you can toss the whole film and leave the process.The filmmaker needed to take the threads that had been woven in the first 3 X-Men films and give us a start point... Where did the Adamantium metal come from, what Stryker wanted to do with it, and why, all of these questions are explored in this film and as a fan of the comic book series, and also a fan of films in general, I accept the questions, answers and the way it was filmed unequivocally.I know I enjoyed this film highly, and so did the large amount of people I saw this with, this film got a lot of crown response.And so, I say the critics and paid shills that are panning this film can go to blazes and I hope that someone does to them what Wolverine does to ""Deadpool/Wade Wilson"" at the end of the film - And you'll have to go see it to find out what he does. Oh, look the shills popped up and marked my post as ""not helpful"" - Which means nothing except that someone is using a bunch of fake IDs",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mutant Wolverine,"Gavin Hood directed this fourth entry in the series, a prequel focusing on the origins of Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) which begins with him and his half-brother Victor Creed(played by Live Schreiber) as children, both mutants who are forced to leave home and rely on each other as they live vicariously through every subsequent human war, as their healing abilities make them perfect soldiers. After a failed firing squad during Vietnam brings them to the attention of a young William Stryker(played by Danny Huston) who builds an elite team of mutants to do special ops missions, but Wolverine becomes fed up, and leaves. Six years later, his past catches up with him, as Logan/Wolverine must confront his past if he is to have a future, but events will conspire against him in many ways, even though he remains a true survivor. Exciting film with Hugh Jackman more than capable of keeping this back story to Wolverine interesting though tragic, filling in many holes of his past.

"What happened, this was suppose to be awesome and it's just ...not.","This film just feels like the studio threw it together quickly to try and appease the fans. As a fan of all things Marvel I have to say, this attitude to just rushing a film to screen and throwing in a few fan favourites is simply not good enough. Basically what should have been a deep story about a man struggling to control the animal within turned into a series of fight sequences punctuated by a bit of exposition here and there to say who Wolverine is fighting and it's supposed to be cool because they are loved characters from the comics, but when you give said beloved character (Such as Gambit) all of ten seconds of back story and about five or six actual lines it tends to annoy fans more than placate them (This goes for Deadpool as well). When I was eight or nine a friend lent me street fighter 2 on the snes, just the cartridge so no box or instruction booklet, I played through it and it was fun, I taught myself all the cool moves and tried to open up all the characters. This film is a little like that game except you don't have the controller the game just plays itself - what's the point. X-men Origins: Magneto better be awesome because this film is seriously lacking in quality.P.S. Gambit's southern accent should be stronger - even though he hardly has any thing to say with it.Liev Schreiber was great as SabretoothHugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine - even though he didn't have a lot to work with, with this poor script.Deadpool is seriously awesome but again should have had more screen time than the three minutes he was given.BRING BACK BRYAN SINGER!!! or at least someone who actually cares about the comics.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome chapter in the X-Men Saga!,"I have to admit that I went into this movie, just yesterday, expecting to be disappointed. I mean, what could they do with Wolverine that hadn't been done in the X-Men movies; but I was really awed by this movie, and recommend it to any X-men fan! Without giving away anything, I thought this movie was an excellent addition to the X-men saga and fit perfectly with what they were trying to do in the first 3 movies. Yes, it is centered around Wolverine and his ""origins"", but they do give some screen time to other mutants (some we know, some we don't).We get a lot of information about Wolverine, his past, and how he ended up in the condition in which we find him in X-Men. We also get a look into the beginnings of the Human vs Mutant storyline, without really rehashing old ideas and concepts from the first movies. That being said, remember that we're talking about a Comic Book Universe, so anyone going into this movie expecting Oscar-worthy dialogue and plot lines should rethink their movie choice. All-in-all a good story, well-acted, excellent special effects, and a must-see for X-Men/Wolverine fans. Thanks for reading!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Terribly Awful,"Hugh Jackman's interpretation of Wolverine is one of the best in comic film history. The concept of diving into Logan's past was intriguing, but the execution was flawed.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"I have always struggled to engage with the ""X-Men"" franchise, but had higher hopes that this - featuring the most charismatic of them - might change that. Sadly not! ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) has a healthy rivalry with his brother ""Creed"" (Liev Schreiber) honed after their birth in the middle of the 19th century. Many years later, though, and somewhat battle weary, they are offered the opportunity by ""Stryker"" (Danny Huston) to join his elite team of mutant commandos. Disillusioned with this, ""Logan"" drops out and tries to live a normal life with his new found love. ""Stryker"" is having none of this and so after the inevitable tragedy, battle lines are drawn as the angry ""Wolverine"" sets out for revenge. Some of the other ""X-Men"" characters feature as this meanders along, and there are a few very well-made up appearances from Ryan Reynolds (""Wade Wilson"") but for the most part this a weakly constructed and dreary action drama with an over-reliance on CGI as the combat scenes recycle themselves all too often. Jackman tries hard, and he does impose himself on the story - but there is little sense of jeopardy and the nature of his ""quirk"" ensures that the acton scenes, though frequently at close quarters, are all rather repetitively predictable. The production standards are high, but the rest of this is immediately forgettable. Sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Also they touched upon other characters within the Weapon X Project and then quickly skipped over, as soon as they came in they quickly left (trying not to give anything away).

Enjoyable...,"I've watched the 2009 movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", but must admit that I had forgotten about the storyline and script in the movie. And thus, as I had the opportunity to revisit it here in 2024, I opted to do so. Though I do remember as enjoying the movie back in the day.And actually I still do enjoy it today. Writers David Benioff and Skip Woods put together a good, entertaining and enjoyable narrative. Sure, I have no idea what the origin story of Wolverine actually is, as I haven't read the X-Men comic books. But I was definitely entertained here by watching the movie, and the storyline that told the backstory for Logan/Wolverine and Victor was enjoyable.They had a great cast ensemble in the movie. And while I am not overly keen on superheroes in general, then I will admit that Hugh Jackman does a great job in portraying Logan/Wolverine, as does Liev Schreiber with the Victor character. There are also some other great performances on the screen, from the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Danny Huston, Kevin Durand, Dominic Monaghan and Taylor Kitsch. It was good to see Ryan Reynolds as Wade/Deadpool here, though personally I don't like the way the writers portrayed the character with the change of the character towards the end of the movie.With ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" being a superhero action movie, of course you have a fair share of action sequences throughout the course of the 107 minutes that the movie ran for. The action sequences are nicely choreographed and executed, and they look good on the screen, adding a lot of enjoyment to the movie.However, I have to say that ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was troubled by a bit questionable CGI, especially the claws of Wolverine. And some of the scenes were just cringeworthy given the lousy CGI effects, but at least they brought a chuckle with them.All in all an enjoyable movie, as it is a superhero-themed movie after all, so you're not exactly in for an evening of Shakespearian theater.My rating of director Gavin Hood's 2009 movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
First film focusing on Logan,"It included some pretty decent facts about how Wolverine came to be, but some of the movie's jump cuts were not too well put together which especially includes most of the action scenes making them look a little more like obnoxious blurs. While the acting was clean, especially coming from Hugh Jackman himself, the film may have needed some subtlety. Bits of the plot/dialogue didn't catch me much either. I don't really know what movie effects were like much in 2009, but some of it did seem rather on the dull side when it comes to looks. Other than that the movie certainly didn't feel all that bad overall. Most of the action sequences, especially him fighting after the barn raid, were rather good. While it may have been a rather disappointing release after the first fine trilogy, this one is a solid step-up to the X-Men series film-wise.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ryan Reynolds hates this movie?,"Maybe he's right when it comes to Deadpool. No matter how bad Deadpool's performance is, this is a compelling origin story for the X-Men, including Wolverine and Deadpool. There are some funny scenes like the beginning of the movie: Logan saves the lives of the villagers by stopping Victor, but then he leaves the villagers behind. The movie focuses on action scenes and twists, forgetting the fact that characters need time to develop and affect the viewer's emotions. The music is also nothing special. Because of the above, the movie still doesn't have enough emotional impact despite having an interesting story. But anyway, this movie isn't too bad, especially the action scenes. I liked the opening scene about Logan's childhood.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Origins Of Wolverine,"X Men Origins Wolverine follows the backstory and early years of the character, with Hugh Jackman again playing the lead. Jackman is very good in this and he really has a grip on the Wolverine character. Even better though is Liev Schreiber as Wolverine's brother and he provides the standout performance in the film. Ryan Reynolds has a small role and there is also a bizarre role for Will. I. Am. The opening credits are fantastic with the two brothers going through various wars throughout history together and it really gives the film a strong start. Action scenes are a bit too quickly edited at times and some of the CGI is a little ropey but nothing too offensive that it takes away any enjoyment in the film. There are emotional scenes scattered throughout the duration of the film and these all add weight to the story. I for one do not understand the hate this film gets as i found it a very enjoyable solid addition to the X Men series. Well worth a revisit if you havn't seen this in a while.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, Fast Paced Movie","Well maybe I am just to easy going of a guy, I am not like the rest of the world wanting the moon and the stars when it comes to a movie. All I ask for in an action movie is a story that I can understand even if it maybe a bit exaggerated and good action. X-Men Origins delivers on both accounts, the movie sticks to what it says, Origins. The action was fast paced and exhilarating. The story moved, and was told with, I believe, basic simplicity. All of the reviews of this movie by our so called movie critics, and by the way who elected these people as representatives to the movie community, I don't remember casting a vote or seeing any campaign material, but I digress. For any simple and sane comic book fan or even your fly by night action movie buff will enjoy the newest X-Men movie, this summers first big blockbuster.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"I had high expectations...And my god, were they fulfilled...","I was lucky enough to have visited the set of Wolverine whilst it was in production. Believe me, I'll never forget the thrill of watching Logan elbow Gambit in the face in person, or myself shaking hands with Liev Schreiber...with his super-long fingernails on. Hell, I got to advise the editor, Nicholas De Toth, on which take should be used in the final cut. I consider myself super lucky, and admittedly might be a little biased towards the movie. But holy hell. I thought it would be incredible, but I wasn't prepared for the unstoppable onslaught of action my eyes beheld the night of the premiere.To be fair, I wanted a little more Gambit and Deadpool. They're great characters (and Taylor Kitsch is a really cool guy), and they had the chance to use them a lot more. They didn't, but that's fine - Freddy Krueger was best in the first Nightmare, and he isn't around for much. It made me appreciate the screen time they had. Being a feature film, it's obvious that they can't explain, explore and probe every single moment in Wolverine's life as depicted in the comics, and some die-hard X-Men fans seem to think it's blasphemy to leave out a few details. Well, more than a few. But do you expect to see the tale of Wolverine told exactly the same as it was? I didn't. It's a movie, not a comic, another issue isn't going to be on newstands next week so the story can continue. They have to squish down to 2 hours or so, and with that, the screenwriters did really well.In case I haven't said so, the action sequences totally blew my mind. Any person who has fantasies of running with a cool jacket on with explosions firing off everywhere, and you must to something super-cool and uber-dangerous to save yourself (I know I have) will find their dreams coming to life on the screen (the helicopter bit is the best example). True, a lot of CGI is used. I usually don't care for CGI, really. For example in Diary of the Dead. Decent movie, CGI was completely unnecessary. I was pining for Tom Savini to return. But in Wolverine's case, there's really no alternative. It fits. It works. It looks great.All in all, a smashingly entertaining movie that's going to have a place in my collection as soon as a 2-Disc Edition hits the stores. Oh, and for the people who downloaded the unfinished work print...Why? Why would you do that, what is the bloody point? It was missing some special effects, a lot of the music... I didn't see this but I've been told that's how it was. I mean...I don't know what the hell was running through your mind. This is a movie that has to be seen on a big movie screen. And you ruined it for yourself. You may have saved your money but I assure you, you didn't gain anything.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A so so movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) is a poor installment in the franchise if you will compare it to movies which came till 2015 now. The story is the weakest component in this movie. Directing is also so so, acting was OK, even very nice actually. I won't go into details, but the movie kinda shows us the origins of Wolverine, ""kinda"" because it is not very interestingly or memorably done. Special effects were just OK, nothing special.Overall, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is probably the weakest entry in the franchise. I'm not the fan of the series, but saw all ""X-Men"" movies and this one is still my least favorite. If you are a die hard fan of ""X-Men"" you should check it out, if not, you won't loose anything if skip this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Adamantium Solid,"I'm a pretty big comic buff and although the film took a lot of liberties with certain characters I still thought it was a pretty decent.Positives 1. First Half was awesome, the origins were well done if a little bit light on the depth of the characterizations 2. Hugh Jackman is a fantastic Wolverine 3. Action sequences were great 4. Gambit was done some form of justice 5. The casting was on point, I didn't think anyone was miscast in their roles.Negatives 1. Second Half pretty much fell flat on its face (plot twists do not automatically make a movie more interesting or better) 2. Too many bad ass characters introduced for one movie. They each deserved to get more screen time. 3. I didn't care for the way they handled Deadpool 4. Overuse of wire works and CGIOrigins was much better then Last Stand and although thats not saying much I think the film redeemed a good amount of Last Stands failures. I thought the first half of the film was great but the second half of the movie was where it started to fall apart for me, ironically with the introduction of the fan favorite Gambit (Always liked him but still don't know what all the hoop-la is about). As much as people complain about what was done with Deadpool, I honestly didn't mind it. I actually had an even bigger problem with the blatant disregard of common sense (mutants especially) towards the end of the film. The action sequences were awesome though and I feel thats what made the movie work on more levels then it should have. (I would talk more about my opinions on the plot but I want to respect people who haven't seen it yet) For me it was a damn solid action blockbuster. Its not going to be super memorable but it served its purpose to start off the summer movie season. If your going into the movie with super high expectations you'll be disappointed. As a comic fan I wasn't completely satisfied but I'm not going to be a total hater like some people are and just look for things to rag on for no damn reason. Overall I'd give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I actually liked this, and I'm not an X-men Fan","For a movie based upon a comic book, it's good fun. I wasn't expecting much, since most critics panned the story (what there was) but gave Jackman and Schreiber high marks for their respective acting skills, as do I. The big surprise was that this was actually good. My kids had a good time and enjoyed the action sequences and could follow the movie's plot easily. Their ages ranged from 6 to 11. Not that it was that simple, but there weren't a lot of silly complicated story sub plots to follow. Some films suffer from too many details. We learned why Wolverine is the way he is in the previous X-Men films (which take place later in the time-line of events). Fight sequences are well done, the cast does a great job with their parts, and the one-liners are funny. It's a good example of why it past the time to use mediocre actors and instead use good and capable actors in an action film. These actors, from Jackman and Schreiber to the others, brought this film up a few levels so I gave it an 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
MORE Gambit please!,"I love Gambit! He's the coolest. He doesn't appear until the final scenes of the movie, but he's a scene stealer alright. Cards - Check. Pole - Check.

I hope he gets his own movie or at least appears in another Origins.I am a fan of Wolverine too and while waiting for Gambit, I enjoyed watching him. And Sabretooth. Lots of character cameos.

If you want to see a good action flick with a superhero appeal go see WOLVERINE!!!,"First,let me tell you this was a great movie!! It is worth seeing! Don't believe the bad hype of others who say other wise.Wolverine is a fast paced fun action flick! The intro itself will take you through about 5 wars giving you a glimpse of who Sabertooth and wolverine are. I don't want to give to much away so I will just say . . . Hugh Jackman and Leiv have great scene presence. If you are a fan of the x movies or /and the comics they do a great job of bringing those characters to life! Liev Schreiber's is Sabertooth is very intimidating! Jackman gives the tortured furious Wolverine a heart! You get the big verbal and physical fights between the two character!! The supporting characters are fun!! You get the big verbal and physical brawls between the two character!!Deadpool steals a few scenes, Will i am gets a fight scene, the Blob is actually pretty funny, Gambit kicks butt, and . . . GO SEE THE MOVIEThe only draw back of the film is the SFX are not on par with the other X films.Why people are harping negative remarks on this film is not valid. They compare it to the Dark Knight and Iron man! I understand that they are all "" super hero movies"" but the former mention movies are action dramas not ""action movies""! You can't compare Lion King to Akira-its a different style ( or Blade to Twilight). Both are animated but one is a drama with action and the other action movie with character depth. Every film can not/should not follow the same formula as the next movie ( no matter how successful ); where would the diversity be?Wolverine has a western feel to it. Wolverine wants to stop killing and live a normal life but his old posse pulls him back into that world.

I've already scene the origin of wolverine in X2. This was just an extended version of it.,"X-men origins is not a fantastic movie. It's not a bad movie either. The problem with prequels is that there usually predictable and poorly written. This film had both. The film is a fast paced action movie with great fight scenes and explosions. If that's all you care about, you'll love this film. I need a good story with the fight scenes and explosions. If you know anything about wolverine or the characters in this film from the comics, then you'll be disappointed. I was excited to know that my favorite x-man, Gambit, would be in the film. They ruined this character. The filmmakers had no idea who these characters are. I gave this film 7 stars because I felt it was an average film that was still watchable and still exciting for the most part. I do think they should rethink this whole origin idea and ax it. Continue with the original x-men storyline. I know they can think of something fresh and new. There's plenty of story arcs from the comics that I would love to see.

The movie wasn't that bad...Actually thought it was pretty good,"The movie did feel rushed but there were many things I liked.The credits sequence at the beginning. It was very quickly rounding up to meeting William Stryker which I thought was well done.I think the escaping from the actual facility should have been longer but the action sequences that followed immediately after it made up for it.It was darker than previous x-men films.I did like the brothers storyline between Wolverine and Sabretooth. It did seem kind of like how brothers would act. Only I can kick your ass but when you need help I am there for you but don't expect me to stick around after. They still don't get along but it was well done.I thought Gambit was great. So his eyes turn red when he is doing his powers instead of all the time. Oh well. That wasn't so bad. I didn't like his accent changing back and forth to where partly Cajun to nothing. But the way Taylor Kitsh portrayed him otherwise was spot on. I don't know where people were saying they gave him telekinesis and running on walls. He ran up the walls and kicked off them. So what? A Gambit solo movie with this actor portraying him would be awesome.My major gripe is the ending about how Wolverine loses his memory. If you have a 300+ person in midair coming at you, a shot from a gun isn't going to make him go head over heels. If anything Wolverine would have landed on him. It would have probably been better to go with the original idea for him losing him memory.Sabretooth...done great as well. I honestly would like to see his origin story too.Overall the movie was good. It was rushed. But good.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's been a while since I've seen an action-packed movie...,"Wolverine Origins is one badass comic book movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a comic book movie that was all about action and wasn't about caped-crusader morals or sophisticated plots. If you're going to see this, don't expect a Watchmen or Dark Knight, or even an X-Men. Expect a non-stop-explosion-fest of a movie. And what's really amazing about this movie is that it's fast paced - when it finished I was surprised at how fast it went by.The only negatives about the movie was the acting, (especially by Lynn Collins. She's a bloody robot in this movie and the lines sound so forced.) and the camera angles- most of the shots were too close up and we rarely got shots that were wide - some scenes felt too compressed.Other than that, I was really satisfied with this movie.

Spectacular superhero fun.,"I'm no expert on Marvel Comics characters and have only seen two of the X-Men movies so far, but I'm pretty confident in saying that if you enjoy super-hero films in general, then X-Men Origins: Wolverine will provide 107 minutes of solid entertainment.Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine makes for a very charismatic hero, and the character's back-story is more than worthy of its own movie‚Äîa compelling tale of sibling rivalry, betrayal, revenge and self-discovery. The film also boasts some great secondary characters in the form of his fellow mutants who display an impressive array of incredible supernatural talents, allowing for some really impressive action set-pieces.If I was going to be picky, some of the digital effects are not quite up to the standard that I have come to expect from such fare‚ÄîWolverine's claws in particular looking pretty dodgy from time to time‚Äîand the final battle is perhaps taking things a step too far, even for a comic-book based movie, but I won't let that stop me from rounding up my rating of 7.5 to an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not good.,"I saw this movie with two friends the day it came out. We thought it would be packed, but to our surprise the theater only yielded about 50% of its capacity. Was this a sign of things to come?The whole thing with the Civil War/WW1/WW2/Vietnam War was pretty cool... until I realized that Logan was Canadian and probably wouldn't have been involved in any of those conflicts. I became concerned almost immediately afterwards when I saw Logan, Victor, and their tight little ""squad"" running up on an African diamond king, and their Asian homie jumps over a fence, spins around like 30 times, shoots about 15 guards and lands like a Dragonball Z character. I then proceed to become VERY concerned when I see RYAN REYNOLDS (you know, the loser from Van Wilder) running around and deflecting... bullets... with his swords. WTF? I tried to stay positive, but so many things about this movie prompted laughter from our camp.Possibly the most ridiculous scene was when Logan sparked his claws on the ground, started a perfect gasoline fire in a straight line that led to a crashed helicopter, and walked away somehow not noticing the massive explosion behind him. CORNY. There are countless action scenes like this that go so far beyond ever making sense.The action is pretty cool, and there are some sweet mutant powers like teleportation, diamond skin, and the tight stuff pulled by Creole swindler Remy LeBeau - a.k.a. Gambit. But what was with the CGI? They used it about as much as Star Wars Episode I. Why do lumberjacks need to be computer animated? Why do Wolverine's claws look straight out of a N64 game from 1997?There are just too many glaring holes to respect this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, believe me... unfortunately, Van Wilder and the N64 claws made that impossible.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Perfectly Augments  X2.... Wolverine Unleashed!,"After the release of the original X-Men film, I couldn't wait for the sequel to come out. Being a fan of the comic books and old cartoons, my expectations for the sequel were very high. X2 didn't let me down, passing all the expectations I had for it. It did exactly what the original film did, but made everything bigger and better. Then, X3 happened. Now, Wolverine takes the franchise back to more solid ground and adds to the legend by perfectly augmenting X2. It tops X2 in action because the fight scenes are larger and much better filmed. Overall, any X-Men fan should be pleased with this movie. If they're not, they were expecting too much Gambit or the Deadpool from the books. I wasn't.

A feral heartless beast clawing frantically at  its enemies and searching in vain for something missing...,"No, by my summary/title i am not describing the character of Wolverine but the very movie itself. It is action packed, it is fun to watch but it is also a huge disappointment if you are expecting an honest to goodness ""origin"" story.I could not quite put my finger on what was wrong the first time i watched this, but now with the DVD i can re-watch it as many time i like. First off, for a movie entitled ""X-men origins: Wolverine"" one would expect a more character centered narrative that delves deep into the core of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character; his motives, his personality etc. What we are given instead is a generic action movie with the whole ""origin"" bit as merely a backdrop for introducing more ""cool"" mutant characters.That is the main flaw of this movie as a whole: giving in too much to the demands of the typical summer blockbuster audience and sidelining everything else. No doubt that people will be impressed with the many wanton destruction scenes and fast paced fights this movie delivers. Vehicles are blown up, buildings are demolished; heck even a school is practically blasted in two. There are so many moments of ""wow!"" that even the brain-dead can just sit back and enjoy.Sadly the characters themselves, though played well by some very professional actors, are not enough to drive the movie. I am guessing that we are supposed to see the tragic side of this hero's past that drove him toward his decision to graft adamantium to his bones. However, the character interactions are not strong enough for the audience to have much of an emotional connection to any of the characters. Wolverine's falling out with his brother, the death of his love interest, the betrayals etc, they never really convey much of an emotional impact. Instead they come across very ""matter-of-fact-ly""; those events just happened so that the plot could advance. Even Wolverine's portrayal of a cool kick-butt hero with a sarcastic sense of humor may incite a giggle or two with his crass jokes but anyone looking for a deeper emotional understanding of the character, look elsewhere.(this flaw i blame more on the script as the actors themselves are quite good)Once you look past all the visual effects and this whole grand scale epic journey, there really isn't much ""heart"" in this movie. Comic book fans would no doubt cry bloody murder at the liberties this movie takes with Wolverine's comic book origins and fans of the Bryan Singer X-men movies would agree that there was more emotional character development for Wolverine in 1 hour of X-men2 than there was in the entire 107 minutes of this film. The only audience i can foresee enjoying this are the superficial adrenaline pumped teens looking for a quick action fix. Honestly i would not even have gotten the DVD had it not been for its relatively cheap price and its wide array of extras.Like its titular character, X-men Origins: Wolverine is cool, funny, and pack to the gills with heart pumping action. It slices and dices its way from one grand special-effects laden battle to the next leaving behind a thin plot and a core without ""heart"". Emotionally disappointing as a tragic origin story, this movie is never really able to find the balance that made other superhero movies like Batman Begins and Iron Man such hits.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine Is A Decent Movie With Flaws,"X-Men Origins Wolverine is a decent comic book movie brought to the big screen its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly no Elektra or most recently Punisher War Zone. The film follows the story of James Howlett and his transformation into Logan also known as Wolverine. The movie answers a lot of questions about his character and is an entertaining action adventure with some flaws. But fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The director Gavin Hood does a good job of keeping Logans character at the center and well choreographed action sequences at a steady pace. As far as the acting goes everyone pretty much did a solid job of bringing these characters to life. Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan/Wolverine and he does a great job with the character. He's a man who's sick of fighting and just wants a normal life. Jackman's Wolverine is a man conflicted with feelings of anger, rage, guilt, regret, and revenge. Equally impressive is Liev Shreiber as Wolverines half brother Victor Creed/Sabretooth. He brings a lot to the role of a man who feels betrayed and abandoned by his brother. Creed is a mirror image of what Logan could be if he fully embraced his dark side. Tyler Mane who played the character in the first X-Men film by Bryan Singer did a good job with that role. But his character felt more like a henchmen and he didn't have much dialogue. He wasn't in it that much either because the focus seemed more on Mangeto and Mystique than him. Besides two fights with Wolverine his character was a bit disappointing in the first one. Shreiber makes for a menacing Sabretooth just like Mane but fortunately in this one he gets a lot more screen time and is much more developed. Danny Huston also does a solid job as Striker taking over for Brian Cox. He's man who always has a secret agenda and can never be fully trusted. Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox is strikingly beautiful yet mysterious woman with a secret of her own. Out of all the supporting characters the only one to leave an impression was Gambit. In his first big screen appearance Taylor Kistch a relatively unknown does a good job as the Cajun thief Remy Lebleau also known as Gambit. He doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but he does leave an impression and his brawl with Wolverine is a very impressive fight sequence. Gambit gets about 10 to 15 minutes of screen time but his appearance isn't as nearly as disappointing as Venom's was in Spider-man 3. Maybe he might get his own origin story one day. Mostly everything works from the pace to the action that become more frenetic as the movie goes on. There were however a few things I was disappointed one thing was Ryan Reynolds character Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He gets at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time no lie. He shows up early on and then his character disappears until the final third act. With news of a possible spin off of his character in the works maybe it can do justice to his character because this one doesn't unfortunately because Reynolds is great in the small role he does have in the movie. The same can go for Dominic Monaghans character Chris Bradley/Bolt who can control electricity. His role in the movie seems sort of pointless and is nothing more than a brief extended cameo. The rest of the supporting cast do an admirable job in their roles including Will.i.am in his acting debut as teleporter John Wraith, Danny Henney as expert marksman Agent Zero, and Kevin Durand as Fred Dukes/The Blob, but unfortunately none of them aren't as fully developed as Wolverine and Sabretooth. The movie at least to me also felt a bit rushed even with a running time of 107 minutes. If the film had been longer and focused a little more on Deadpool or Gambit to name a few giving their characters more screen time instead of giving them brief cameos the movie would've been a better. Besides it's flaws X-Men Origins is still an entertaining comic book film plenty of action, fist fights, explosions, chases, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Of The Few Genuinely Good Superhero Movies Which Aptly Translates The Comic Book!!,"I was fortunate to catch a special screening of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' a few days ago and I must admit that, it way exceeded my expectations. So much so, that I was stimulated into writing this review, something that I don't often practise.First let me clarify that this isn't one of your run of the mill, blown-up SFX in your face, unrealistic action-oriented, plot less superhero movies that's thrashed out nowadays('Spiderman 2&3', 'Hulks', 'Fantastic Four 1&2', the intolerably over-hyped 'Ironman', and more...). It might be no 'Dark Knight' or 'Batman', but its definitely worth your movie ticket.The movie begins just like the 'Wolverine Origins: Super Special' comic book - which I'm might proud to have in my possession - and Wolverine being one of my favourite superheroes since my teenage years, the initial sequences itself gladdened me immensely. From hereon, the movie just keeps escalating.The script is spot-on, the narration flows smoothly, 'Gavin Hood's' direction without being brilliant, is noteworthy, and the action is mind-blowing with a rustic feel. The SFX might not be the best in recent years(which might be a blessing in disguise, considering some of the inane SFX extravaganzas released in recent years), though certain FX, animation and compositing amalgamations are still astounding. Fact in the matter being the climax, which rivets you to the edge of your seat and lingers in your mind for a considerable period.As far as the acting goes, most of the cast turn in decent performances, especially 'Leiv Schrieber' as Sabertooth is exceptional, but its undoubtedly 'Hugh Jackman' who steals the show. This guy was just born to play Wolverine, its like he emerges from the comic book pages on to the big screen. Add to this, his superlative physique and fleeting nudity, and there's eye candy for the ladies too.The X-men franchise without being the best around(Star Wars, Indiana Jones), has always strived for entertainment and sensibility simultaneously. This movie is no exception, with it being on par with the first of the series.A great summer blockbuster after a long time.My Rating: 8/10..........Go for it guys!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid continuation of the franchise,"After watching X-men 3 The Last Stand, (a film that i felt was definitely the weakest of the X Trilogy) I went to see X-Men Origins Wolverine with very low expectations. I thought it would be a film filled with action, bad dialogue and slow fragmented story, rather like The Watchmen.How very wrong i was, I found the film to be totally engaging all the way through, it was satisfying to watch and unpredictable which is quite rare these days, especially with this type of movie. The story is well executed and ties in nicely with X-2. Overall i left the theatre pleasantly surprised. On balance this film is a good all rounder. The heroism of Wolverine is well defined and also so is his motivation to avenge certain deeds done upon him.The film's weakness however lie in some clich√©d moments which could of been executed better i think. Also a rather creepy digitally enhanced cameo from a well known English actor towards the end, was not convincing and again could of been executed better. These however and very forgivable.Lastly, I don't think this film has had a fair press. It does have a different feel to the other X-men films, and perhaps that is why fans of the series found this to be a disappointment. But make no mistake, this is a good film well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Heartbraking and excellent,"I read some of the reviews made by fans of the comic book complaining about the perversion of Wolverine's story line prior to his loss of memory. They are probably right to be disappointed. I my self do not have enough background knowledge of the characters from the comic books and as others have pointed out, due to these circumstances this movie appeals to audiences that are not acquainted with the source material. And boy does it appeal.The story line is energetic, full with action scenes worthy of an X-men prequel. But as I mention in the title it is also a heartbreaking love story (apart from one or two clich√©s) it does make it worth your while if you can make it past all the twists and turns.I give it a 9 only because of what happens to Ryan Reynolds character. It's a real shame not to be able to see more of his witty remarks, when you see the movie you'll know what I mean.So all in all I my self, walked away a satisfied man from the theater tonight and I encourage you to give it a try and watch it. And, oh yeah, apart from some other opinions here, Hugh Jackman is extraordinary as Wolverine once again, as well as heartbreaking.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Rushed and not well thought out, but it has some good points","Overall, X-Men origins Wolverine moves too fast and never establishes a main theme. THe story is overridden with many mutants, but other then Wolverine himself, we don't learn much about any of the other characters. Even Wolverine's story, the main character of the film, felt like it was missing a lot of information. I guess I could've accepted some of that if the action sequences were better, but even they seemed to not carry enough weight for the movie.I can't say I really disliked the movie. I enjoyed watching both WOlverine (Jackman) and Saber TOoth (Schreiber) chew up the scenery with one liners and some of their scenes, but this film could've been oh so much better. THe action scenes should've been more exciting, and the special effects weren't that great either. I know this movie cost a lot to make, and I found myself wondering where they spent the money at.My grade will be a 6 out of 10, and I think maybe I'm being a little easy on the film. For all those who liked the X-Men, X-2 is still the best of all four films. I even go as far as saying that X-Men Last Stand was better than Wolverine because the action scenes were much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine is neutered,"Going into this movie like everyone else my expectations were huge and rightfully so. Wolverine is hands down the most popular and interesting character of all the X-men and to preserve this reputation the producers had too deliver with no excuses.After the successes of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight I was praying they would inspire the writers to go along those lines with multi layered personalities, shades of grey when it came to good and evil with a dark overtone of doom throughout.What we got was the exact opposite, god awful one dimensional acting, glossy Hollywood action sequences and as much depth as a shallow swimming pool.I've read that this movie despite its wooden acting and script is a 'mindless fun action film', the thing is I didn't find that either. The action sequences were all rather uninspiring, I don't expect too much logic but most of the scenes were nonsensical and forgettable.If you're a popcorn flick fan and aren't to interested in the comic book history then I guess it is a passable watch at the very best. However even if you're not a comic nerd but you're expecting the same level of X-men 1 or 2 you're going to be left rather disappointed.My advice wait to rent the DVD or just avoid altogether.Andrew Barbarash",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Forget the ratings...,"...I REALLY liked this movie.Aside from being head, shoulders and other body parts above the deeply awful X-3, it was fast, fun and furious. The opening credits sequence alone was so well done and completely fascinating.Despite this being live-action, it was delightful to see that so many of the posturings for stills and stop-actions retained the feel of the comics through the facial expressions and physical postures of the characters.The loathsome characters--Stryker, Agent Zero, and, especially, the utterly frightening Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth--were so well done that a genuine ""Yes!"" when, for example, the helicopter exploded, was completely satisfying.I don't know what Jackman's workout regimen was (Ryan Reynolds says Hugh was pressing cattle rather than mere iron), but I have never seen anyone, of any age, in that good shape in my life. Very nice, indeed.Forget the critics, elitists and poseurs: see it!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"On May 1st, I admit, I was the moron...","I wrote a post a couple weeks ago titled ""On May 1st, you will all look like morons"" or something to that effect. I did so because I had faith, mainly in Hugh and the supporting cast, and the director (and I refused to see the leaked version). The real tragedy of this movie, no doubt, is not only that some of the cast managed to squeak out solid performances -you could see them trying- but the audience is allowed to intuitively observe how much MORE they could have offered. Sadly, something fell apart along the way- be it the direction, editing, or screen writing.The editing and direction was so shabby, I literally felt as though I was watching an extended trailer- I might say that I've never experienced this before in the theater (maybe this is some sort of cinematic achievement on its own). Every time something was developing positivity (i.e. when Logan finds himself under the care of farmers, some development of Victor' character, or the initial encounter with Gambit) it just, well, fell apart.Why this movie is getting such poor reviews is not because its inherently bad- its actually pretty entertaining as a movie. Hugh Jackman IS wolverine, and he has a powerful and charismatic presence as the tormented logan (minus the awkward looking to the sky and screaming). Some surprises, action scenes (Wade and his blades), and dry humor along the way were well played. Its not that. Its not even because the fanboys are let down from a Hollywood egotistical departure from the rich comic characters (They are already developed- USE THEM!). Its because the average movie goer figures out along the way how great this movie should have been, how many missed opportunities there were, and how much more the characters could have been developed- we feel an implicit insult in the way this movie was packaged and delivered.Hopefully they do better next time around, Keep Hugh (and even Ryan Reynolds, I think if given the chance he would be great), get rid of the whole editing/direction/screen writing team (they may work well for other genres, just not this franchise), and go to Japan.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action-packed thrill ride!,"Just got back from an advance screening of Wolverine, and I have to say it was pretty darn good! Visually its spectacular, and the acting is top notch. Liev Schrieber does a really great job as Sabretooth, and both Taylor Kitsch and Will.i.am were good as Gambit and Wraith respectively. Also good to see that Dominic Monaghan's character ended up being Bolt instead of Beak as originally rumoured! Die-hard comic fans may need to beware, as there's a few characters that are changed somewhat from the comics. Some subtly (like Agent Zero), some vastly (like Deadpool), but ultimately not so much that it detracts from the film's story (it is, after all, a different continuity to the comics - X-Men fans would do well to remember this going into this movie!). There's also lots of character cameos, with one near the end of the film being icing on the cinematic cake!

Worst Superhero Movie to Date,"What do you get when you take unimaginative storytelling, overdone special effects, and yawn-able fight scenes?It is not hyperbole to call X-Men Origins: Wolverine the worst superhero movie ever made. Worst than Batman and Robin. Worst than Daredevil. I hated every single soul sucking, vacant, boring, trite, overplayed, clich√© minute of this movie. I could not find one redeemable minute is the entire Hollywood mangling of what could have been a decently entertaining movie.In sum, X-Men Origins Wolverine involves an unmotivated cast of characters defined by their powers and not their absent personalities. Some reviewers have highlighted Ryan Reynolds's performance as being notable. Well it is, because Reynolds overacts well beyond his supporting cast as wise-cracking cardboard cutout. Unfortunately even Hugh Jackman looks bored as Wolverine, and his performance is the least interesting rendition of Wolverine seen thus far.If you want a superhero movie involving paint by the number fight scenes, fake looking cgi, a predictable and boring romance, and a climax that will leave you wanting to turn the movie off, I would recommend X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I will warn you though, it is not ""so bad its good"" its just so horribly below par it will leave you unsatisfied and wanting your time back even more than your money.Not a single redeemable moment in the entire movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of best comic book origin movie ever!,This movie is the perfect blend of origin story with showing moments and places you are familiar with in the first X-Men trilogy.

A fitting origin,"I have read many reviews that have blasted this origin film from the X-men franchise. Frankly, I don't see all the fuss. Jackman once again owns the character and he is surrounded by other folks having a blast. What more do you want? I am not an X-men expert. I have never read any of the comics. I grew up on the 1980's cartoon series. So I don't bring any fan-boy expectations to these film. In all honesty, I felt this film was better than the first X-men movie. X-men 2 still stands as the best of the franchise, but Wolverine and Last Stand are equal 2nd's in my book followed by the first film.There are many new characters thrown at us in the film. I think that is what folks have an issue with that have seen fit to moan and groan about this film. I need only point out the fact that this is called ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". My favorite X-men is finally introduced here, Gambit. He has little screen time, yet as much as I would have loved to see more of him (what we get is great), I came to see Wolverine's origin, not anyone else's. To that, we are actually given the origins of Sabertooth, though one that differs from the classic mythos (he is Logan's brother). The opening credits sequence quickly and efficiently catches us up on the brothers as they go through time taking part in all of the large wars fought this side of the equator.The effects are, in some places, marginal, yet in others blow you away (Gambit's card and stick effects are fantastic). Acting across the board is spot on. Ryan Reynolds makes you wish for more from his Dead Pool character (which I hear is pretty close to happening as a stand-alone film). All others bring their A-game and help make this an enjoyable film.The complaints are small; all in all, a worthy addition to the franchise. Enough with this Magneto origins talk, give us a Gambit origin!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Even worse than X-Men 3, despite a few decent scenes","I just recently saw this, and was very disappointed. Since I won't post spoilers, I'll make this short.There are only a few decent scenes, and the performances from Jackman and Schrieber are decent enough, but that can't fix the film's problems.Bad pacing. Bad writing. Terrible action and overly CG FX. Characters appearing from nowhere (all of Stryker's team) with little to no characterization. An overly invincible Logan/Jimmy before he has the adamantium, which seems a bit unrealistic for his character at that point. Too little screen time for both Logan/Jimmy/Wolverine and Victor. Bland music and mostly bland cinematography minus one scene of a waterfall.No tension and bad to average editing. Also, how Wade turns out is silly IMO, and there's a twist at the end that wasn't pulled off well.The acting from Huston as Stryker is one of the weaker performances in the movie, and they should have had Cox return.There's only ONE pretty good scene in the movie that happens in the middle of the movie, but on a whole, 85% of the movie is AWFUL, with 15% being just average. Also, the final version is only 1hr 47mns which felt very rushed.**",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even though there are clich√© scenes that make one or two in the crowd chuckle, it still fulfills what anyone would expect from an X-Men motion picture.

"Jackman has claws, but the movie doesn't","It was a lackluster and underwhelming movie year when suddenly ""Wolverine"" injected some life into it, a full month before anybody actually thought he would. A fan boy wet dream came true as the movie, in perfect quality, appeared on the internet absolutely free of charge leading to new debate over piracy and manic containment control by Twentieth Century Fox. A Fox columnist was fired, the FBI was brought in to investigate, an Australian visual effects company was implicated but nothing was ever proved. What a way to start off publicity for the clawed super hero, definitely the most charismatic of the ""X-Men"". He finally gets to show off his chops without all the extra baggage but the result is surprisingly tame and standard, both in terms of plot and action.It's a prequel so were starting all the way back in 1845 with Logan as a young boy. After some complicated Daddy issues, he mistakenly kills his biological father and runs off with his brother Victor. Both know they're special, Logan with his claws and Victor with his sharp nails and fangs. They will grow up together, Hugh Jackman playing adult Logan, a.k.a Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber playing adult Victor, a.k.a Sabretooth, and stand side by side for every war from Civil to Vietnam, not aging a day in that time span. They are eventually recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), running a Special Forces team of mutants to do secret missions around the world. Victor sinks his teeth into it but Logan soon tires of the violence and splits to become a logger and takes up with a schoolteacher girlfriend. Just it isn't going to be that easy. Victor kills his girlfriend and Stryker tricks him into an experiment involving having his skeleton bonded with the metal, adamantium. Just what he doesn't know is that Stryker wants to harness his DNA afterwards and erase his memory. Logan manages to escape and sets out for revenge, finding that what happened to him is just the tip of Stryker's plans.The execution is oddly flat. Much of the movie is based around encounters Wolverine has with characters with different special abilities. Some are very cool. I really enjoyed Deadpool, a character who can deflect bullets with his swords, and Gambit, who can manipulate kinetic energy. Sadly the screenplay by Skip Woods and David Benioff reduces these roles to brief cameos so it can shoe-horn in a lot of other unnecessary characters, campiest of all is the Blob, a Fat Bastard clone if I ever saw one. No one makes much of an impression, perhaps because their only given a few lines before being tossed into underwhelming fight sequences with a lot of aimless swinging, thrashing, clawing, hand-waving, and beating. In the entire movie there is only one action sequence that even deserves the right to be called Blockbuster and that one involves a motorcycle, some military hummers, and a helicopter. Some of the special effects are good. Wolvie showing off the claws is cool, as is Sabre-Tooths 4-legged speed but for the most part the special effects don't add much.Jackman is perfect for this role though. In the ""X-Men"" movies, Wolverine has really found more of a following than any other character and all of that lays right at Hugh Jackman's feet. Wolverine fits him like a glove. He's got an awesome physique complete with rugged good looks and total grit. Another notable here is Liev Schreiber, who really finds the menace in this reckless, hot-tempered character. And Danny Huston is at his slimy best as the evil William Stryker.Just ""Wolverine"" is pretty tepid and that's unfortunate. The backstory is really your average revenege flick. We don't find out a lot about what Wolverine stands for or how he got his claws in the first place. I also wondered how Wolverine ages since Jackman seems to cover 100+ years of the characters life. And what surprises me even more is that the action is a little on the lite side, being less about inspiration than about just random fights. Summer is about bringing the A-game and despite being a watchable movie with a good sense of humor and an ending that sets up the Bryan Singer X-Mens very well, it just doesn't live up to expectations, coming up short in quite a few categories.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

it was pretty good,"Before watching this movie, i didn't have much high expectations like other people. I expected it to be alright, I didn't think it was going to be better than the first 2 xmen movies, and i was right. This movie is pretty decent, not as bad as people say, but not as good. All of X-men movies are pretty enjoyable and entertaining. The recent movie, X-men 3 is loud and entertaining at best. Now comes X-men origins: Wolverine is a prequel. It does its job to entertain people with its brutal and intense fight/action scenes and people will be engaged in the warped and mixed feelings of the mutants especially Wolverine. He has a tragic past that makes people feel sorry for him. We get the ruthless Victor Creed, who is known as Sabretooth, not being as cold-hearted as I thought.The story: Everything has its own past. Logan known as Wolverine is happy living his life working as a lumberjack and seeing his girlfriend everyday. Until then, William Stryker comes and destroy their lives. Wolverine becomes revengeful. I can't spoil the twists and turns or major story plot to those who are not familiarized with the story. The pace moves briskly. It is action-packed with some explosive action and also packed with mutants like well-know Gambit and Deadpool. Although the characters were kind of underused. They didn't show much of Gambit until near the end of the movie. But i guess that's why its called Xmen origins: Wolverine, because its about Wolverine's past and life. Some parts were confusing though.Overall: IMO Xmen origins: Wolverine is somewhere in the middle where you can enjoy watching it. Those who are not familiarized with the Wolverine's origins and want to know should catch this. Those who cannot get enough of X-men movies should be able to enjoy this or not. It is not the best or the worst marvel comic movie. As a rewatch (09/24/17') opinions remain same as this film does what is it supposed to. Decent and solid action superhero movie with an interesting story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
2nd-rate CGI and lots of plot-holes... but an OK movie overall,"This movie has some pretty measly CGI tbh, ESPECIALLY when you take into account that the movie cost an astounding $150million in 2009 (which is $180million in 2020). The CGI honestly is a let down, and in a superhero movie like this (X-Men, or Marvel, or DC), it's very important to have believable CGI otherwise the audience will be snapped back to reality and remember that there's not ACTUALLY anything like a 'superhero' in real life... and you don't want that... you want the audience to actually believe the story that you're portraying on screen.Apart from the 2nd-rate CGI, the movie also has several plot-holes as well as continuity paradoxes with other Marvel movies such as Deadpool (2016) (although the continuity paradoxes are the follow-up films' fault, and not this film's fault, because this film preceded the follow-up films). The plot-holes are numerous and frequent, honestly too many to go into in this review.Overall, the movie had a lot of action, and very little believable plot/story. Only watch it if you're looking for 1hr40mins of action, and NOT if you're looking for a good Marvel movie comparable to Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool..",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine Rising,"Watching Hugh Jackman play Wolverine again is like watching Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal again; no matter how bad the movie is, it's still great to watch them play their iconic, and #1 career roles. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' unfortunately starts off slow, and despite some good action sequences, really never picks up. The major problem with prequels is you already know what's going to happen, and in 'Wolverine' you hear him say I'm going to kill Sabretooth and Stryker probably a dozen times. Well, unless they're asking us to forget the original 'X-Men' films, it's kinda like someone saying in Star Wars 1-3: ""I'm going to kill Anakin"" or someone actually attempting the murder of the Anti-Christ in 'Left Behind.' And speaking of the original movies, didn't they already give the origins of Wolverine throughout all three films? At very least you learned a lot more about Hannibal Lector in 'Hannibal Rising,' though an equally bad film. In this one, you learn he's about 150 or more years old, he once was in love and his original claws were made of bone, which, by the way was hard to watch ‚Äì I wanted to see the steel ones throughout. That's about all the extras you'll get as you watch him grow & fight with or against his brother, Sabretooth, from the mid-1800s to present. And as mentioned, though some of the action sequences were well shot, a lot of the CGI, or effects were almost downright laughable. As was the unoriginal dialogue, the extremely predictable ""mystery"" (and I'm not referring to the fact it's a prequel; solving what this movie presents takes the mind of a four-year-old) and unnecessary and unoriginal origin story that's already been told. One word of advice, despite the ""shocking surprise"" after the credits, it's NOT WORTH IT.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
9.5/10,"I saw this movie about two or three weeks ago. Although giving it 9.5/10 is respectable enough, a 6.8 rating on IMDb isn't. I found this movie to have a respectful length, however, some parts did lack depth: For example, Wolverine ages throughout the movie, however, why does he stop aging at around 35-40 years old? However, while the special effects could be a lot better, the action sequences were breathtaking and just...awesome! The acting was also pretty good. Hugh Jackman again proves that HE is Wolverine, but Liev Schreiber proves also that HE could be Sabretooth in an upcoming X-Men movie. Seriously, he was excellent. But there were parts that, it seemed to me, were rushed or either had additional material that were probably cut from the finished movie. For instance, it seems that whenever Wolverine searches for information, he finds it too quickly, whether it be an article from the newspaper or his good buddy Will.I.Am. Also, once you've played the Uncaged edition of the video game, it feels as if the movie was extremely censored. I hope they release an Unrated/Extended cut when it comes out on DVD, but for now, this movie is an excellent piece of amusement.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The noise and effects may distract but otherwise it is a fairly empty blockbuster that doesn't really engage on any level,"If you remember a week or so before this film was released anywhere, the news outlets were reporting that a work print of the film was being downloaded by tens of thousands of internet users around the world. This copy was only partially finished and was missing a lot of music and finalised special effects, with safety lines etc still being clearly visible. The usual talking heads bemoaned internet piracy, Hugh Jackman said he was disappointed that people would watch a film that was not yet what the makers wanted it to be and the FBI were supposedly involved in the investigation of this leaked copy. Having finally seen Wolverine for myself I have to look back on all this fuss and wonder why so many people bothered downloading an unfinished version of this film (other than to make a point that they could do so) because given how average the completed film is, I cannot think of much worth seeing if the effects are unfinished.Wolverine is a summer blockbuster and a film that you could fairly expect to be heavily reliant on action and special effects and you would be right, because there is not a lot else here for the viewer. The plot has its moments but generally there is no atmosphere to it. The brother relationship leads only to two hairy men running at one another ‚Äì there isn't any real tension or drama between the characters beyond the superficial level needed to trigger the action sequences. Surprisingly, considering how loved Wolverine is by fans and casual viewers alike, there is very little in the way of excitement about seeing this character develop and become the weapon that he is when most of us met him for the first time. What we do get though is a straightforward narrative which produces lots of action sequences and parades a lot of comic-book characters in and out for those that care about such things (which, although I recognise many of them with ease, I don't care if they are just there for the sake of saying they are there). As such it does enough to be passable and set up the action sequences which are, after all, the only reason the majority of us are here.Shame then that these too feel very average in the whole. Technically I'm sure it is all impressive but none of it really has much in the way of excitement or immediacy, leaving me watching things explode etc without ever being emotionally involved. It is definitely a film from the Mummy Returns school of action film-making in this regard and like this franchise, one never forgets that the visual effects are just that ‚Äì computer creations that aren't real and pose no threat. It is not that they are ""bad"" effects but just that the use of visual effects is across the entire film to the point where green screen sections are so apparently green screen creations that it does hurt the film and act as another barrier in how one gets into the action. Like I say, given this is the deal with the final film I wondered why anyone would have stuck with the film in an unfinished state.The cast and characters are varied. Jackman does his usual stuff as Wolverine; grizzled expression, tough stare, toned and muscular stance. The film gives him a few moments of emotion beyond the basic rage used in action sequences but he cannot do anything of real interest. Schreiber has a better time of it because he does have an evil glint to his performance that makes him more interesting and dangerous. Huston plays Striker reasonably well and offers up a solid bad guy. The addition of the other characters/cast is where the problem comes from. I am not a real comic fan but I can understand why those that are would object to the treatment of some of their characters here. Not only are some of the characters wheeled in for almost no reason (Gambit, Cyclops) but some characters are changed for the worse (Deadpool) and others are simply played by bad actors (Will.i.am is not a name I want to see on the credits of another film any time soon).Overall Wolverine stands as the film that it appears to be a first glance ‚Äì a blockbuster with plenty of spectacle but not a lot else, which of course feeds back into the action as it detaches the viewer, thus making it feel even more like empty spectacle. It isn't as bad as some say but there isn't a great deal to recommend it for once you take it out of its home turf of ""heavily promoted summer global release"", where the scale, newness and noise may have done enough to impress.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"While it does not live up to Singer's X-Men film, it is much better than the last X-Men film","As with Terminator Salvation, I heard and read a lot of negative things about X-Men Origins: Wolverine but having watched the film it surprised me in how entertaining it was. The action was always enjoyable to watch and the characters always kept me interested. Sure this is not as good as X2 but this succeeds in keeping the audience entertained.As the film began I had a bad feeling that this would be terrible as the script was awful where we are introduced to Wolverine and Sabertooth when they were younger. The scene was really bad but thankfully the credits sequence begins where we see the two brothers fighting in various wars before they then meet General Stryker.Hugh Jackman always puts himself into his roles and he does it again here. While the script could have provided him with more to do, what he does do, he does well. The supporting cast are also good to watch including Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston. However it is Ryan Reynolds who steels the film as Deadpool despite having a very limited screen time.What makes this film better than X-Men 3 was that this never becomes dull; there is always something happening such as an action sequence or a new character being introduced.The script may not be perfect and what the film does with some of the characters will anger fans but this does improve over the last X-Men film. I can only hope that X-Men: First Class has a better script.

With the background of Wolverine, it is almost an art form of it's own to produce a movie that isn't even remotely interesting, exciting or even entertaining. Or a movie with a story that would fit on a post-it. And - with a main character like Wolverine, mind you - not one funny line in the dialog. But all that was accomplished fabulously. You created a rather boring movie with no story and some of the worst dialog I've ever heard. The whole movie feels like a rather random sequence of scenes where assorted mutants and wolverine show of their powers. Now one might say that it's a comic book movie and effects and colorful lights really are the main point of interest in such a movie. And while I don't agree with that myself, this statement has a point. But Wolverine also fails on that ground. Some of the SFX and CGI are quite good, but for the most part the range is from mediocre to really bad. And that is inexcusable.I could go on for a long time stating the failings of this movie, but I have wasted enough time on this horrible mess. One question is still to be answered for those who like the X-Men and have have seen the other three. Is it worse than the third one? Oh yes! Much, much worse.Take this as a friendly warning. Don't waste your time. It sucks. Bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
""" We're immortals, created for destruction, what makes you think otherwise?  ""","Out of the incredible world of Marvel comics, arrives this fantastic movie called "" X-men Origins: Wolverine. "" It is basically the foundation film which introduces the Character and his brother. Born over a hundred years ago, the two discover they are somewhat immortal as we see them participate in nearly every war America has been in. Yet it is only during the Viet-Nam conflict they are openly discovered to be impervious to death. The two young men Logan and Victor (Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber) are given an opportunity to join an elite team created by William Stryker (Danny Huston). It is during their travels and their original purpose they further discover their job is funded by the government and therefore clandestine, secretive and murderous. Discovering this, Logan resigns and walks out on the gathered mutants. Fearing he might prove disloyal to their cause, Stryker ordered the rest of the team to seek out and destroy 'Wolverine' as he is now known. The entire film mutates into a battlefield of violent conflicts and cross purposes as former friends now become adversaries. The movie magic of this film is superbly dramatic, exciting and together with the assembled cast, have create a masterpiece. The story of Wolverine is laced with sympathetic memories, rational purpose and a comic-book flare which will enthrall any viewer seeking an exciting two hours. A Classic in this making. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Origins Wolverine Review,"Wolverine still stands as one of the most prolific, most popular, and most badass superheroes of Marvel lore. The man is literally immortal: he heals instantly, even from mortal wounds, and thanks to that he was grafted with an invincible metal skeleton, complete with retracting adamantium claws. Wolverine kicked plenty of butt in the three main X-Men films, but a stand-alone Wolverine film has always been in the cards, to give fans another chance to see this awesome character in action. So, they made X-Men Origins: Wolverine, in what would be the first in a line of stand-alone prequel movies for each X-Men character.In hindsight, this proved to be a futile move; despite the film's commercial success, it is easily one of the worst films of the series, and plans to make more Origins films fell through. The film is one hot mess: a haphazard blend of rip-roaring action and plot contrivances.The good news is that the film is still very tight, highly entertaining, and it does have some great moments. It is really cool to watch Wolverine rampaging through whole hoards of bad guys, taking out hum-vees and helicopters on a motorbike, and fighting mutants around a nuclear reactor plant. The film moves fast and is never skimpy on the action or style.The story involved in inherently compelling, thanks entirely to the allure of the title character. It is a tragic tale of love, betrayal, and vengeance that helps shape Wolverine into the berserker we all know and love. The plot covers some of the same ground we've seen before in the original X-Men films, but this time you get to see the full background on how Wolverine got suckered into Colonel Stryker's plans. There are a few major twists, which will seem contrived at first glance, but do hold up on repeat viewings. The plot suffers the most with a number of scenes that don't really contribute; many of the action scenes are frivolous, and scenes involving a young Cyclops seem to the thrown in just for the hell of it.A lot of the film's biggest issues rests with the editing, which is extremely choppy and screwy. A lot of shots are cheaply-cut to cover up deficiencies in the action. Worst yet, most scenes do not transition well from one to another, causing characters to appear at seemingly random places (such as Gambit suddenly appearing on a rooftop, or Victor appearing at the final fight out of nowhere). It is clear that the conflicts between the studio and the director have contributed to a film that's at conflict with itself, unable to find a balance between the heartfelt drama and the hardcore action.On the plus side, photography is mostly-solid. Performances are a bit of a mixed bag: Hugh Jackman continues to excel at playing his iconic character, and Liev Schreiber is superb as Victor Creed. I enjoyed Danny Huston's and Lynn Collins' performances. Most of the other actors playing the side characters are pretty weak. The writing is pretty weak. This production uses okay sets, props, and costumes. Special effects vary from good to terrible. Music seems uninspired as well.Wolverine's stand-alone film is not an inherently bad story; in fact, its potential is more effectively conveyed in the film's corresponding video game. Somewhere along the line it got mucked-up, and I blame it mostly on too much post-production tinkering. I still value the film as a guilty pleasure, and it does make for a satisfying stand-alone action flick. In an X-Men marathon, however, it doesn't fit as smoothly with the other films (especially since events in X-Men: First Class contradict this one). Die-hard fans will probably want to check this out once, but for casual audiences, you can do better.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Extremely disappointing,"There is absolutely no excuse for not using the rich history of Wolverine from the Marvel Comics archives. If Marvel Entertainment (Avi Arad / Stan Lee) is going to be involved in the production of their titles, they should insist on using the story lines from their comics with as little modification as possible. All of the actors brought life to their characters. But, the story just disappointed. I was especially surprised by Gambit. I like the actor who played him. He's from the TV show on NBC, ""Friday Night Lights"". Hugh Jackman brought Wolverine to life as he's done in the previous X-men movies.

"OK for Hugh Jackman fan, rubbish for everyone else","This film is not good. The script is awful, I wrote better stories when I was 4, Apart from one or two one liners the dialogue is sub par, the story ridiculous, character building is pretty much forgotten, the story clunks along form one fight scene to the next (more about the fight stuff later. The directing and cinematography is uninspired and pretty amateurish. The action scenes are about as exciting as watching socks dry. I have seen it all done before and better in count;ess other film. I hate fast cutting anyway especially in action scene (it can work in some films Bourne being a good example) but here it is done badly and combined with the ropey wire work and below standard special effects.Due to the script most of the actors are given very little to work with. I can only think of one good one liner and that comes from Liev Schreiber Creed character. Hugh Jackman may look good but isn't given anything decent to say and isn't given a chance to develop the character. Ryan Reynolds is given nothing to do with Deadpool and the he just isn't funny. I must admit to being a big deadpool fan and really hated that they did to him (why do movies have to change successful characters so much and turn them into dog droppings). Taylor Kitsch is OK as Gambit but it feels as if he has just been added in for the sake of getting another popular character on screen The music for the film was OK but kept getting over melodramatic, which isn't helped by the complete disinterest in the charactrs, which means the score is wasted and became annoying after a while This film is a huge mess. I don't think a film should be made badly just because it is a action or comic book film, I like good action films but this film fails in almost every respect. If you want a good x men film go and watch X2 which is much better. If you want a good Marvel film watch Blade 2 or Iron man. If you want to see a good superhero film go and watch the matrix or last 2 batman films which is superior in every way.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

X-men origins: Wolverine review,"How much can i say? Great cool action, a furious ride. But yet the movie is average. My expectations were never to high about this one, it was pretty much what i expected, so yes it definitely exceeded my expectation. And have me very pleased after watching. I loved the slick action, very cool and had a ""Wanted"" feeling. It had me wanting more and more scenes of it. No special plot but still average and that is enough because the action covered for it.Isn't it always nice to have a explosive fun start, that gives you a slight tip of the ice cream to let you know what you should expect for the rest of the movie. Wolverine did just that, it surely kicked off very well. A nice simple fast first few minutes that had me buzzing. Very well done there. And it did just that, it's cool action packed begging remained for the rest of the film. It's not much more to say. The acting was brilliant, Hugh Jackman was excellent along with the rest of the cast. The plot was slanging, but it doesn't matter. A complete different type of ""X-men"" and better then the others. It's more fun this time around just focusing on Wolverine. It takes you back from the original X-men. All in all a fun action adventure, mediocre script, plain simple plot but furious cool action. Very worth your time and a great one to watch. But don't expect something real special.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good as an action film, not so good as a character story","This film was not as much of character story as I thought it would be but it certainly wasn't a bad film, if seen as an action film its very entertaining, the action sequences feature big budget effects that for a change wasn't overdone, the effects added to the action without trying to be an overly spectacular visual effects feast which was actually really refreshing.The character story is not as deep or complex as I expected, everything was kept very simple such as where the film portrays Wolverine and Sabertooth as brothers but it doesn't really broaden out the relationship and the back story of wolverine is only about events that happen to him and doesn't really expand on the character story.However, this was good as an action film but disappointing for not really being much of a character story, I recommend it mainly for its entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cool.,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine or X-Men 4, is in fact a prequel to the X-Men Trilogy. It tells the story of the life of Logan, or Wolverine, and how he came to be what he is in X-Men one and through out.Though not the best of X-Men movies, this one certainly left a mark. The beginning is a bit drama-ish, but it just gets better as it goes on. The action is fast, and the graphics and animation is quite-close-to-real types. The cinematography is brilliant, hand-in-hand with the editing. The flow of the movie is smooth, courtesy the direction. Sound effects - good, performances were OK, nothing great. X-Men is one of those movies that really aren't the ""can't miss it ones"" but definitely the ""must see"" types.I only gave it a 7/10 because it's not as good as X-Men 1, or 2. A good movie sets a bar for its sequel, and if the sequel falls below the bar, then the person may not be disappointed, but definitely would notice the difference.Go watch it.

Decent flick if you are not looking for accurate Comic book fare,"Saw the movie last night expecting to see a total train wreck from the reviews I was reading on here by the fan boys royally slagging the film and I was pretty surprised to see it was actually a decent flick with good acting, action and special effects. There was a couple of parts that conflicted with the other movies but no world ending cataclysms. Basically if your are a serious fan of the comics you are going to be bummed at the changes made to the Wolverine character story and other character's stories in the movie. If you are a movie fan with a little exposure to the comics you aren't going to care and will most likely enjoy the movie.The bottom line is if you like action movies you'll like X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it is real obvious that the movie makers didn't really care about pleasing the comic book fan boys on this one and their money would be better spent elsewhere.Thanx for reading, Robert",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hugh Jackman has delivered a knock-out performance, so has the rest of the cast, especially Liev Schreiber.Hats off to the action director of this movie for making beautiful action sequences.

The Sexiest Money Alive,"A movie is good when there are parts of it that you desire to see over again. There must be touching moments, funny moments, action, deep thoughtful scenes or just plain ole lump in the throat cinematography. Iron Man had many scenes of action, dialogue, and informative set-up as to who and how Iron Man came to be.Wolverine-Xmen Origins shined in the first 20 minutes, particularly with the montage of world wars Wolverine fought in. Also, the elite team of mutants that Wolverine fought with during the movies first half hour were a better story line and plot, as opposed to where they eventually segued with the script. I would have rather seen Wolverine and his X-Patriots take on rival and relevant comic-book favorites, than to have them formulaicly turn on each other.It was a modern day Cain and Able! Wolverine and Saber-tooth, battling over who has the best looking press-on nails in scene after scene of scratching and clawing which left us scratching our heads in the end. These Battling Blade Brother's feud never made much sense to the audience and the origin of their Ginsu gripe with each other became so shuffled that even Gambit couldn't deal with it! Hugh Jackman(Wolverine) was voted one of the Sexiest Men Alive, and I have to suspect that the Marvel Movie Machine knew just where to oil and lubricate the screeching lust of female fans, making their gears and pulleys turn for this Box Office Boytoy.It is fine to have a great looking star in a movie, but in days of old, handsome leading men, accompanied a leading script. And please keep in mind that a good script, a good premise and care for telling a good story is what the audience desires more than anything. Tony Soprano(James Gandolfini) wasn't trim and muscled, yet his character and the story was so well developed that we loved the ride.There are movies that we can watch over and over again: Goodfellows, Ironman, Scarface, Godfather, Back To The Future, etc....because they are filled with memorable moments that we like to see and hear.I can look at Iron over and over again. I would not care to sit through Wolverine: Xmen Origins again.Here is my message to the folks at Marvel and the studios and Producers. Make us a memorable movie Marvel! Wolverine: Xmen Origins is nothing more than the capitalization and commercialization of a The Sexiest Man Alive! It is a disappointment to movie goers who pay to see big screen dialogue, scenery, scripts, action and an engaging story.Just from the long anticipated debut of this movie, you will make plenty at the Box Office, and I suspect that that is all you really aimed for. You have our money, now give us a movie! Malik Jubal",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply entertaining.,"This movie was never as great and awesome as people had hoped it to be but simple fact is that this is some quality entertainment nevertheless.This is the first spin-off movie from the popular X-Men movie series, with Wolverine in the lead. It at the same time is also a prequel to all of the X-men movies. Wolverine has always been one of the most popular and rich characters, not only in the movie but also with the comic book fans and those who watched one of the many cartoons based on the X-Men on TV. So it's no big surprise really that Wolverine was the first of the X-Men to get a movie of his own.It's also the movie role that Hugh Jackman seems to be born for. It's the perfect part for him and was also the character that launched him to stardom with the first X-Men movie of 2000. No wonder that he was eager to jump on to this project and even became a producer himself for it.Expectations were always quite high for this movie but those expectations got never really met for anyone. It was an highly anticipated movie because it featured the popular character of Wolverine and promised to feature plenty of action in it.The movie never really becomes as great as you would had hoped. Reason for this is that the story feels quite rushed and messy. The story really seems like an excuse to let Wolverine battle as many different mutants as possible, without letting those moments ever make sense for the story. It's pretty pointless all how this movie its story is often progressing and doesn't really seem to go anywhere in terms of telling something new. I mean, this is an origins story but we pretty much knew already how Wolverine came to be Wolverine in ""X2"".So all of the actions seems pretty random and pointless for the story, it still keeps the movie going and is what makes it still interesting and entertaining to watch. It's a big budget movie and that shows with its action moments. There are plenty of effects here that most of the time are pretty good looking.By no means a great movie but there is basically no way that you'll not enjoy watching it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Origens of eXcellence...,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine For those who waited for this prequel to X-Men, it was worth every moment, every day of anticipation. For those who have never seen X-Men, well, this is a great place to start. In the grand tradition of the comic book, this edition features the origins of The Wolverine, the mutant who is at the core of the storyline. Let's remember this fact. It's not about the development of your other favorite mutants, this is Wolverine's story. I do not like to get into plot or storyline too heavily. I despise trailers with their 'let's show them the entire movie in split-second sequencing'. It's designed to monetize (ie: the all important first three days of release). The trailer is not for the viewer's benefit. You'll not get that in my reviews either.There have been some excellent renditions of the 'Batman', 'Spider-man', and 'Watchmen' series' in recent years. With just the right mix of CGI, storytelling, and acting, we have reached new levels in the way comic books are depicted on film. Director, Gavin Hood, has taken these tools and designed an outstanding issue in this, the third installment of the series. The bar now rests at a higher level for those who follow. I enjoy director's who compete with their peers. When they get it right, amazing results are often achieved.Like the original comic book series, a tale can be told with the flourish of great graphics, coupled with minimal, but carefully selected text, to achieve a creative and comprehensible story line. The great artist, Jack Kirby (Captain America, Fantastic Four), was the initial artist in the X-Men series. While not the creator of the 'Wolverine' character, I believe he would have approved of the camera work in 'Wolverine'. There is great stop action framing, perhaps homage to King Kirby. I also love the angles used in shooting. In many cases, the distant view of the entire scene is shown, much like in the comic books.Hugh Jackman stars as 'Logan/Wolverine'. He is perfect in every frame. The effort that Jackman has put into this portrayal is clear. He has turned himself into a physical specimen rarely seen in a starring role since Bruce Lee in 'Enter The Dragon'. Add to this his powerful ability to project dialog in any manner and its clear Jackman is far beyond the coveted 'triple threat' that most entertainers aspire to be. His turns on-stage as 'Curly' in Oklahoma, 'Peter Allen' on Broadway, and film roles in 'Van Helsing' and ' The Prestige' solidify that fact. For good measure, he was the song and dance, comedic host of the 2008 Academy Awards show.There is excellent supporting talent at every turn in this production. Liev Schreiber is particularly nasty as the 'hell bent' Victor Creed. Musician, Will.i.Am, Kevin Durand and Taylor Kitsch all lend nice supporting roles as well. I particularly liked Lynn Collins, as Logan's love interest Kayla.Dominic Monaghan (Lost) lit the way as mutant 'Bolt'. He was joined by and 'A-Team' group of mutants that put on an excellent display of their superpowers. Rounding out the team was Tim Pocock, Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan/The Green Lantern' in production), and Daniel Henney. Their scenes epitomize what many comic readers love to see in the pages, action packed, and jaw dropping abilities. They did not disappoint here.Technical The Blu-ray edition is vibrant and exceptional at 1924 X 1080p, 120Hz. The sound is fine on all levels at 5.1, dts-HD. The special features are many. They include the customary commentary with the director (Gavin Hood), a great feature with Stan Lee and former writer Len Wein. The back and forth banter is pure gold for fans. So many tidbits of fascinating information are thrown at you, seemingly as afterthoughts. Also included are 'Ultimate X-mode' (ability to sit in the director's chair, pre-visualize Wolverine and X-Facts), a helicopter scene, insight segment, and an alternate ending. The language options are English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The subtitles available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Cantonese.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Maybe a bit better than ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", but not a great prequel","After a trilogy of live action ""X-Men"" films, based on the Marvel Comics series, the third one turning out to be a disappointment to many fans, they made this prequel. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" obviously focuses on the origins of Wolverine, one of the famous characters in the series, once again portrayed by Hugh Jackman. Unfortunately, this also disappointed a lot of viewers. I went to see this ""X-Men"" prequel on the silver screen this year in May, and did not have a good time. However, it didn't help that I had a headache, which obviously had nothing to do with the quality of the film, so I decided I would try it again on the small screen when it became available. That was just what I did after renting it a couple days ago, and it was better for me this time than it was in the theatre, unsurprisingly, but there were still significant problems.In 1845, a young boy named James Howlett lives in North-Western Territory, British North America (not yet Canada). His father, John, is killed by Thomas Logan, the father of James' friend, Victor Creed, and as revenge, the boy stabs the killer with the bone claws from his hand! Before Logan dies, he tells James that he is his real father. James then runs away, and is joined by Victor, who tells him, ""brothers protect each other."" As the decades go by, the brothers stay together, fighting alongside each other in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. Eventually, Major William Stryker offers them to join Team X, a group of military mutants. They take the offer, but James is soon disgusted by this group's actions and leaves, finally parting ways with his brother after more than a century. He retreats to civilian life in Canada, starts going by the name Logan, and lives with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox. One day, he finds his girlfriend murdered by Victor, and thus begins a mission against his brother, and soon against Stryker as well, after he tries to erase Logan's memory!It's been a few months since this ""X-Men"" prequel's theatrical release, and I probably can't find anything critical to say about it that hasn't been said at some point since then, but I'm not as sure of what brings it down in entertainment value as much as many others seem to be. It may have more than one thing in common with the third film in the original trilogy. For example, it's not as deep as it could have been, and probably could have been more focused. You can also say there are characters who aren't properly introduced, something else it has in common with ""The Last Stand"". I didn't find it as interesting without the other famous characters from the series (some of which appear VERY briefly here), especially Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, and without the X-Mansion. I'm not sure what else to say about this polarizing prequel to further criticize it, except for the fact that I was fairly bored at times, especially early in the film.Unlike many disappointed fans, I can't exactly consider ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" bad. There are some good action sequences, it may get more exciting as it goes along, and Hugh Jackman is still great as Wolverine. There's also some humour in the film, such as Logan (yet to become Wolverine) referring to Kuekuatsu as ""Coo Coo Ca Choo,"" an elderly couple seeing Wolverine running naked into their barn, and parts of the main character's meeting with Fred Dukes in the ring. These things are enough for me to consider this movie slightly above average, but no more than that, with the flaws the film suffers from. Some people might even think I'm crazy for thinking it's any better than ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", and I'm sure there are people who were not disappointed by that third installment in the trilogy, but were with this first prequel. Since it's been over a year since I last saw the three ""X-Men films"", it's not as easy to make comparisons. Anyway, neither the 2006 nor the 2009 film can match Bryan Singer's two efforts, and I don't know if this movie's sequel, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2"", is a good idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"'We're going to make you indestructible - but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.'","'We're going to make you indestructible - but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.' Gavin Hood directs this 2009 cinematic version of the origins (read 'explanation') or the X-Men series of comic book heroes based on a screenplay by David Benioff ('Game of Thrones' etc) and Skip Woods ('Hitman', 'Swordfish', 'The A Team' etc). The team manages to pull of the credibility-testing feat with aplomb ‚Äì just the right amount of humanistic emphasis on the early ears of Wolverine and a flair for the impossible feats and countless deaths of the latter half of this film. It is a look at Wolverine's early life, in particular his time with the government squad Team X and the impact it will have on his later years.Leading up to the events of X-Men, X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. Two mutant brothers, Logan (Hugh Jackman) who will become Wolverine of the retractable claws and Victor (Liev Schreiber), born 200 years ago, suffer childhood trauma and have only each other to depend on. Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker (Danny Huston), recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher (Lynn Collins). When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. Along the way, Wolverine encounters many mutants, both familiar and new, including surprise appearances by several legends of the X-Men universe (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, et al) whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated.The first half of the film is sensitive and humanistic (Ryan Reynolds manages to insert his expected spot-on one liners to keep the story light) ‚Äì the second half is pure CGI tricks (though according to the featurettes Hugh Jackman performed all his own choreographic fights).

This Movie is a Total Waste of Time and Money,"Three years is a long time to wait. For some, it is a wait for redemption after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" relentlessly assaulted what made the X-Men so appealing in the first place and grandly blasphemed two of its most beloved characters. For those who enjoyed the movie, it is the anticipation of seeing another story in the unique world of mutants. Shame on Marvel Enterprises and Fox Studios for violating the hope of the first group and the trust of the second.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has five major problems. First, it has too many mutants to develop. I am familiar with each character and still felt overwhelmed. Second, there is too little substance to the story. Third, the action has too much glitz and too little entertainment. Fourth, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods mangle already established fact. Finally, a great many mutants are altered from their original form. That final error, while not noticeable to some viewers, is possibly the deadliest offense to fans of the X-Men cannon.There are 11 significant mutants in the story, and that does not count minor characters. The original ""X-Men"" has ten total. The most well-known mutants are included in those ten. That is one difference. Also, ""X-Men"" has at most half as much action as this movie. Less character time is needed in ""X-Men,"" yet more is given. That focus adds importance to both the story and the violence. Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), the Blob (Kevin Durand), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney, giving one of the movie's coolest and most focused performances), and especially Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), are most gypped by ""Wolverine.""As Roger Ebert has often pointed out, Wolverine, also called Logan (Hugh Jackman), possesses powers that are mundane compared to those of Storm, who can control the weather, or Magneto, who can rip a train car in two with the power of his will alone, or even this movie's Emma Frost (exceedingly beautiful Tahyna Tozzi), who can turn her skin into diamonds. Wolverine's appeal arises from his aggression and his struggle to remember his past and its unknown hurts. The movie never really investigates what formed Logan into the one of the most unique personalities in Marvel Comics. His motivations, the emotional impact of his decisions, the exploration of his nature, and later-forgotten trauma are insufficiently explored. Of the four X-Men stories released to date, this one should be the slowest and most thoughtful. It is the fastest and least thoughtful.Like Marc Forster in ""Quantum of Solace,"" director Gavin Hood looks totally lost trying to choreograph action. Imagine watching a baseball game where the camera appears so close to the baseball that we cannot see the hitter until the very last instant. Without a good view of the baseball's position in the environment around it, it is difficult to see how it travels from the pitcher's hand to home plate. That is similar to the effect created by zooming the camera in too far during action. The action in ""Wolverine"" is mostly close-quarters involving unnaturally fast moving people. Hood also uses way too much fancy trash. I lost count of how many double-sideways flips someone performs during a fight. One of them involves teleportation, but falls way short of the Riddick vs. Lord Marshal battle from ""The Chronicles of Riddick.""One of the high points of ""X2"" is Logan's discovery of the room where his memories were lost and his metal claws gained. His flashbacks, combined with a later conversation with Colonel Stryker, provide an outline of what occurred. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" clearly establishes itself as a prequel, not a separate movie. Therefore, it should not ignore what we learned in ""X2.""""Wolverine"" not only does that, its replacement story far less compelling. Logan's signature personality is neutered even after his breaking point. He was never supposed to be a peaceful man. Whatever happened to ""You were always an animal, all I did was give you claws""? William Stryker's (Danny Huston in a role previously manned by Brian Cox) behavior when threatened and the later consequences make his status in ""X2"" impossible to believe. The timeline places ""X-Men"" far earlier than it claims to be. Even the story behind Logan's amnesia is cringe-worthy. What previous movies establish needs to be honored.Another problem is Logan's self-healing abilities. As in ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" he has become too invincible. Judging by his rate of healing in the first two X-Men movies, he survives at least two traumas that should be enough to kill him. Agent Zero of the comic books can nullify Logan's healing factor and absorb damage to his own body. His only skill here is good aim. Jason Bourne has good aim. Police snipers have good aim. That is not a superhuman ability. Deadpool spends so little time on screen that including him in the promotional material borders on false advertising. Logan's final battle is against an enemy whose signature weapon rips off both Optimus Prime and ""Castlevania: Curse of Darkness."" The second may sound ho-hum, but many comic book nerds love gaming too.This movie simply has far too many problems and too few redeeming factors. It proves that the X-Men series has not merely had a bad day. It has completely jumped the shark and is all but certainly beyond redemption. Taking Marvel's most popular character and making a dead-on-arrival movie shows serious incompetence from the creative team. The ending answers all questions, but those answers are not worth a free ticket to see the movie. My only wish is that I could forget the entire movie, except for the fact that it is despicable.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Answer some questions relating the series!,"That is a nice movie for its type: Action | Fantasy | Sci-Fi. Somehow, this part will explain some questions about the characters from the series, for example why Wolverine has his metal claws, how did they gather under Professor Charles Xavier's school. There is no denying that the sound and the visual effects are stunning. But, the content is so vague. I did not find a big impression from it. Just see it without much feeling about it. The movie goes as the way it is as I can guess some events will happen. However, this part is one of the best parts in comparison with the others. It is more enjoyable than X-Men: The last stand.

"I'm gonna cut off your head, see if that works.","When I went to see 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I just wanted to be entertained. Afterwards, I was blown away. It's by no mean as good as 'The Dark Knight', but Wolverine is still kicking ass and taking names. The script is pretty cheesy at times, but the action makes up for it. Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine we all love, but Liev Schrieber's performance as Victor Creed, to me, is the best performance in this movie. He is ruthless, but there is this whole other side to him. I won't spoil anything, but Schrieber did do a great job as Creed.We all know this isn't an Academy Award film, so we need to accept it for what it really is... a good, fight for your life, action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An origin-story, an action spectacle, and a critique of age-old philosophy","I'm not sure mainstream audiences realize how massive the X-Men library of characters really is. I am informed by my close friends, many of whom are enthusiasts in early comic books, that the X-Men character roster stretches a mile wide and one cannot watch a few films of the X-Men franchise and expect to know all the characters of the series, let alone a select few in great detail.It is precisely this reason why I feel that the idea of an X-Men Origins series being made is not such a bad idea, although with the middling reception and box office returns that Wolverine managed to recoup, I feel the studios are thinking differently. The X-Men film franchise has a sizable job of introducing a variety of new characters and villains along with giving them some sort of identification past their superpowers and throwing a conflict at them that they need to solve (or attempt to, at least) in the course of a film. Just the latter obligation is so heavy that it distracts from the other two points. Giving several X-Men characters their own film showing their beginnings and their development on a more personal basis would allow for more character resonation and depth, but also allow the films to spend more time developing stories and villains rather than trying to cram (or completely disregard) the film's core heroes last minute.Gavin Hood's X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a few missteps in terms of CGI, but on a story basis, it is wholly interesting and easy to sink into. Opening in 1845, it tells the story of Wolverine's beginnings as James Howlett, a young boy who sees his father killed right before his eyes. These combined feelings of anger and sadness that wash over him activate his mutation of having long, metal claws that extend out of his knuckles, killing the man who killed his father only to realize that the man he killed was his father.James flees his home with the man's son Victor Creed who grows up to be Liev Schreiber, while James grows up to be Hugh Jackman. The two wind up being dedicated soldiers for the next century, fighting in the American Civil War, both World War I and II, and the Vietnam War, before killing their senior officer and being sentenced to death, which they both survive. Together, they are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) to work for Team X, a mutant organization, to which they both accept before James leaves after six years being disillusioned with the entire process.To go on ruins the fun of watching Wolverine's life unfold, which is interesting in itself. Jackman has gone from embodying the aura of Wolverine to quickly becoming the character, portraying him in many different lights, from emotional, to strong-willed, to violent, to uncontrollable, to vulnerable, and so forth. Jackman is assisted here by Schreiber, who manages to work with him to create an entertaining partnership that is less about buddy-buddy charisma but more about two men stuck together and bound by what seems to be a curse.X-Men Origins: Wolverine lacks the clear love and affection for the material that director Bryan Singer delivered, along with being burdened by some poor CGI/green-screen work here and there, but the film is also missing the downright awful dialog that was present in X-Men: The Last Stand. Writers David Benioff (who wrote Troy and went on to write several episodes for HBO's breakout hit Game of Thrones) and Skip Woods forgo the abundance of useless one-liners for drama, and director Gavin Hood changes pace from directing South African dramas (including the incredible Tsotsi) to a film that allegedly has more depth than one initially would think.Hood comments on X-Men Origins: Wolverine's possible political side by saying, ""Any movie that is simply about good versus evil...is in my view putting out into the world and certainly into a mass audience and young audience's mind a rather dangerous philosophy, which is that there is good and evil in the simplistic and easily defined way. I think that for the last eight years, we've had that philosophy very much prevalent in the Bush administration that if you're on the side of good, at least as you perceive it, then you can do no evil. That's what's so great about this character or about this movie for me and why I wanted to do it. This is a guy who recognizes his own capacity for evil and I think that's exciting in a sort of popular culture kind of way."" Because Hood recognizes Wolverine's deeper side and delivers it in a way that is critiquing of age-old philosophy, we get a film that subsequently gives us a more enriching endeavor than your average superhero film.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Dominic Monaghan, and Ryan Reynolds. Directed by: Gavin Hood.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Completely misses the mark on every level.,"Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Wolverine and was just dying to see this film with high expectations. Well, after coming out of the theater, I stress wholeheartedly they should've been lowered to the lowest degree.Throughout the course of the film, Wolverine and Sabertooth get thirty minutes of character development and that's fine because they are my favorite Marvel characters which I thought everything would go smoothly from that point. But imagine my surprise when Gambit shows up on the scene and guess what: he's reduced to a freaking 4 MINUTE CAMEO!!! Gambit (who should've been in the first two films) along with EVERYONE ELSE gets reduced to second billing. I mean, this is SUPPOSED to be his movie, not some Marvel Superhero Reunion. Save that for the damn Avengers movie for crying out loud.There are other things from the comics this film virtually ignores: The rivalry between Wolverine and Sabertooth, the inner workings of the Weapon X project, his relationship with Yuriko Oyama (known as Lady Deathstrike) and the nature of Wolverine's character. In the comics, Wolverine is very violent and berserk; here ""they"" sugarcoat his animal-like fury into a generic, uninteresting, carbon-copy Death Wish type that lacks any tension or suspense whatsoever. At least Sabertooth was the only character that's close to his comic book version. And I can never understand why the hell is CYCLOPS in this movie? In the comics, he never was involved with Wolverine until later on. Special effects and action are good but time and time again they STILL keep using the quick editing, shaky camera technique that's as clich√© in so many action movies it's not even funny; it's painful.Overall this film had the potential to be another successful Marvel adaptation like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk released last year. Instead, it amounts to nothing more than a spectacle over substance with no cohesion or originality. Like so many brainless action films, this film completely misses the mark completely and judging by the film itself, was probably a victim of studio tampering.Avoid like the plague.X-Men 1 and 2 are MUCH better choices.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Bad,"I like going to those types of films because they are fun and makes you just forget about the world. And this film, like any other superhero film is the same. The typical message with some clich√©s, although you can see they tried not to put any clich√© in the film. Some characters were annoying, like Ryan Reynold's character Wade. Other than that the film was action packed and fun. Noisy and action scenes are nothing without the typical explosions, screaming and running. Hugh Jackman of coarse is an accomplished actor so he did good. Others did okay too. The film shows the many sides of Wolverine.I don't take these types of movies seriously, this is no exception.

Maybe this film should have been titled: X-men orgins:Sabertooth. :-) Fyi, do Wolvie and Sabe have the same mom but different dad, or visa versa?

Amazing........!,"Just saw the premiere in my hometown Arnhem (Netherlands) yesterday. Frankly I was a little worried about the early reviews, the leak and the fact that there was no press screening.....but I had a hell of a good time......with goosebumps.What Worked?Jackman, Jackman, Jackman..... The guy is an amazing actor and captures the essence of wolverine. This is his define moment.Liev Schreiber was promising in the trailers and truly was great in his performance.The Story. Even though it was sometimes a bit rushed (the part where Logan hides with the elderly couple) it really surprised me...in a good way. The way Logan and Victor grow up as brothers is really the essence of the story and also the inner conflict that Logan has...this IS the story.....the rest is just to fill up space....but later more on that.Taylor Kitsch Great addition to the Marvel Universe and great casting. Even if it is a secondary character, he gets enough screen time to make a lasting impression....think of him as the way they handled Cyclops in the X-men movies. Let's not forget.....It's a Wolverine movie....not a Gambit movie. But nevertheless.....really good.Action. Oh My......WOW.What didn't work (so much)?Deadpool I've never been a great fan of the character so basically I couldn't care less about the lack of screen time.....however that is also the reason that I really wouldn't have mind that an unknown character would play the part. So people.....get over it......IT'S A WOLVERINE MOVIE!Some CGI Yes, there is some CGI that makes me wonder.....what if. For instance Agent Zero Jumping in to a freaking helicopter....not so good. There are a few of those moments.Closing thoughts. I'm definitely seeing this one again. It's better than X3, maybe on the same level as X1....not so much as X2. The combination of action and humor is great. Basically it makes me wonder why so many people gave it a bad review. Everybody was enjoying the movie.I don't care about politics, early leaks, lack of screen time of a side character, Mr. Rothman or killing a franchise.....Mr Jackman produces a great action flick and shows Wolverine like he never did before and hopefully will do again. They only REAL complaint I have is that I probably have to wait another 3 years before we will see Logan back in action against the Silver Samurai in Japan.Rainman Out.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't go in with high expectations; good but not great,"Well... I love X-Men and have been looking forward to this for a long time. Then I started hearing that it wasn't very good and my expectations dropped, thus when i saw it i wasn't absurdly disappointed.The main problem with this movie was its lazy script. It possessed none of the dry humor of Wolverine from the other movies and some dialog was just too dry and simple when it could have been more finely suited to the characters.Some characters were good ad did not get enough screen time, such as Wade Wilson and Gambit. While others who should not have been too extremely accentuated were. Overall I would just say there were too many characters and some should have had their screen time cut down.Perhaps it was the budget or something else but some of the CGI was just terrible, such as his animated claws... I mean, what the neck was that? Just stick with the real stuff like the other movies, also when hacking at the fire escape to trap Gambit, that was sickening it was so cheesy... Though some was very good, like the cyclopes eye blast, the wraith teleporting, and Gambit's awesome stunts.I liked it, it was fun, I might even buy it just to complete my collection. It's not the gem of Marvel as it could have been, and I would put it as Marvel middle ground, above things like Fantastic 4, Daredevil, Ghost Rider... But not as good as Marvel's best; Iron Man, X-Men 2, Spiderman 2 and The Incredible Hulk.See it if you want to have some fun, but don't go looking for something amazing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another superhero movie? Yes! nothing more.,"I have been reading marvel comics throughout my children and teenage years. But I like this movie. Yes, it does not follow the marvel script. Admittedly, the wolverine in marvel comics has usually a darker personae, full of mystery about his past. I say usually, because it is not always the case. The writers of marvel comics have got their own style and I have seen many different attributes given to wolverine down the years in the comics, some radically different to each other. It is only understandable that the director and obviously the production (more suited for family films) of this movie elected to cast their own light to the character. The Batman films have been mostly family film in the past and some utter rubbish, until recently Christopher Nolan was given the task of revamping the bat character. I suppose and hope that this will be the case for wolverine. For now, we have an entertaining sci-fi action film with a few glitches. Not the best story line, but it is action packed. The reason why I liked it must be because it was good to see wolverine given the prominent role in an xmen movie, just because im a fan. To watch without high expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the year's best films.,"It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. (I'm sure Transformers 2 will give us plenty of that later in the summer.) But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action are just plain spectacular.One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't ""talk down"" to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine. People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it. I saw it with two people that have never seen any X-Men stuff and they loved it. One of the year's best.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More X-Men than Wolverine, actually","From the moment Hugh Jackman first appeared as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men, it was obvious his character would be the first choice for a spin-off film: brooding, tormented and totally bad-ass, he's one of the coolest creations in superhero comics. And so here it is, his own movie. Well, at least that's what it was meant to be.Taking advantage of the fact that Wolverine's origins have finally been unveiled in the comics as well, the film starts with a family tragedy which leads to the shaky alliance between two young stepbrothers in 19th century Canada. Both are gifted with heightened senses, and healing abilities that slow down the aging process, which is why, a hundred years and four wars later, Logan (Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) still look like they're pushing 40. At this point they're recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), a military scientist who uses mutants to do the government's dirty work. Unfortunately, Logan is disgusted by all the violence, despite being the most lethal member of the team (what with his retractable claws and all), and seeks a peaceful life. Due to fate - and Victor - that isn't possible, and thanks once again to Stryker, he is given the chance to get back at those who have wronged him. Thus begins a new chapter of Logan's life, one that is best summed up by the new name he has chosen for himself: Wolverine.As it happens, said new chapter is also the point where the film starts getting it kind of wrong: gone is the introspection and careful look at a conflicted, lonely (super)human being, replaced by state-of-the-art action scenes and a truckload of new characters. Okay, so the showdown between Logan and a helicopter is admittedly a very cool moment, but why the sudden shift in tone, given Jackman (who's also the movie's producer) was lucky enough to get David Benioff (25th Hour) as the screenwriter (but hey, Hit-man writer Skip Woods was also involved) and Oscar-winner Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) as the director? The answer is disheartening and not very unexpected: fan demands. The film's title isn't simply Wolverine, it's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, meaning that once the origin bit was explained, it was perceived as no big deal to randomly insert popular characters from the comics who couldn't be included in the previous X-movies: some of them (Taylor Kitsch's Gambit) work to a certain degree, others (a pre-X-Men Scott Summers) appear at the expense of people who actually fit into the story, like the hilarious Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), whose presence is basically reduced to a teaser for his own spin-off (assuming it gets made, obviously).Make no mistake: Hood is a skilled director, and the first hour of the film stands out as a very good introduction to one of Marvel's most loved ""heroes"", but much like Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man 3, he finds himself dealing with a second half that loses its focus while trying to please fan-boys (as well as providing a nonsensical explanation for the protagonist's memory loss). On the plus-side, a quick pace means the lesser parts are over quickly, and Jackman, now playing the Canadian mutant for the fourth time, is as charismatic as ever, brilliantly aided by Schreiber and Huston (and the shamefully underused Reynolds).X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not exactly a bad film (it has good action, a terrific first half and a solid cast), but it's painfully obvious this could have been something completely different had it been handed to original X-director Bryan Singer. The post-credits scene seems to suggest a sequel can be expected: fine, but could it focus solely on Wolverine, please?6,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Has ""rushed"" written on it's forehead.","X-Men Origins: Wolverine - We see Logan (Hugh Jackman)'s past, or a summary of it in the opening credits, and then flash forward to...either the 70's or 80's. I'm not sure. It's not very clear. In any case, the film follows Wolverine and Sabretooth and *sigh* another too long list of mutants through various shenanigans. There are some decent fights and a few funny and/or awesome moments, but it's unsatisfying overall.I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with what should have been better than X-men3 and probably X2 as well. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber do their best and bring their A-game. Ryan Reynolds should have had far more to do in this film as he was great. Unfortunately writers Skip Woods (Hitman. ugh) and David Benioff cannot claim the same. The story is rushed and there are multiple points one just cannot get their head around. Why is Sabretooth doing the things he does? What is Stryker's ultimate goal and why does he get an entire sect of the American military to go along with essentially stupid ideas, in Canada no less? Why does it take a plane trip to get to a place we later see has bridge access to it?What is apparent from these X-Men films is that two hours cannot support the number of characters they cram in. The fact that this was a Wolverine movie should have cued the writers into the notion that we want more Wolverine. It did not. The script is not awful, but offers little room for Wolverine to actually brood or have character moments or do anything but go from point A to point B. No one is really allowed to do much but confer plot, which is bad, because the writers gave little thought to the plot or the character treatments. Deadpool is more or less tarnished and Gambit's part is pretty insignificant.What we have here is an unfinished feeling film due to a poor story. Admittedly, the X-Men comics were never as much about story as they were about cool looking characters dealing with isolation and whining about their pathetic lives inspite of their awesome powers. Nevertheless, Jackman and Schreiber deserved a better movie to be built around them. It's not bad, but I'll always wonder how much better a film this would have been if David Hayter has scripted it.

It fulfilled all my expectations,"X-Men origins: Wolverine the first spin-off/prequel of the X-Men saga and maybe the most anticipated of all. The film has a very good adaptation, even if you're not into the Wolverine story, you will understand perfectly. Its a movie full of action from the very first minute, a little of drama, some very good moments of humor and even a little bit of romance and the special effects are excellent. It has a fast paced rhythm making the movie interesting and never tiresome. The cast is really good, Hugh Jackman for the 4th time in the role of Wolverine/Logan, he already dominates this character, it just looks so natural on him. Liv Schreiber was excellent as Sabretooth/Victor, he manages the character to the perfection.

X-Men Origins rates right behind X-Men 1,"Count me as a fan. Wolverine/X-Men Origins is an engrossing movie. I found this to be a treat for the senses. All the emotions are tested and hope was restored in my mind's eye for the X-Men franchise which X-Men 3 had almost destroyed.Not only is superhero sensationalism satisfactory, but romance and mystery played an important part. Nothing is to be taken for granted. Deny denial if you dare.Acting was well done by everyone, well, maybe most. Characterizations were fine for the most part if you are not a die-hard X-Men fanatic. I understand why the die-hard may be disappointed but if you, the reader, are not expecting canon fare, you should enjoy the movie a lot. The action and wit were as fast and furious as anyone should hope for in comic book style. But then again, remember this is not a comicbook rendition of Wolverine's origin. You may find the beginning to be somewhat like a video snapshot of events preceding the so called present, but it was understandable and well played out. Take it as it was apparently intended - artistic stylism and not fan gratification. This is definitely one of those movies that is trying to please both the die-hard and the novice X-Men fan.There are more than a couple surprises, so again, don't give up hope. Oh, and stick around for post-credit gratification.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Things haven't improved...,"Hugh Jackman's Logan (better known as ""Wolverine"") was easily one of the most endearing characters of the original X-Men trilogy, what with his gruff and occasionally witty candor, impetuous hot-headed disposition, yet ultimately caring tendencies. He had all the bad-ass of any iconic anti-hero, and we loved him. Plus, sterling casting sought to it that the perfect actor, Jackman, would embody him to his fullest potential, and since the trilogy was pretty much The Wolverine Show, all these aspects equaled a great success.Basically, this spin off had a lot to live up to. Not only did it have to continue to capture the vivid appeal of the beloved character, it also had to redeem the franchise after the embarrassing hiccup of Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand, the last installment in the otherwise impressive trilogy. Was it successful in doing so? Sadly, unfortunately, tragically, X-Men Origins: Wolverine doesn't achieve either.I'll admit that Gavin Hood's prequel is better than X-Men 3, but it's still a messy and gormless piece of eye candy-filter (much like The Last Stand was), that damn-near tarnishes the integrity of the Wolverine character.Now, that's a lot of criticism for one sentence. But, in all honesty, Wolverine doesn't really deserve an in-depth analysis; it's straightforward action mediocrity. It's, very simply, a victim of the common ailment of unimaginative direction.The main source of the problem is Wolverine's drastic mistreatment; the character is neutered, all of his integrity diluted, now only a milquetoast shadow of his old self; not once does he showcase the ass-kicking brilliance that is paramount to his iconic stature. It's a bit of a boyish peeve, but even the moody, gloomy Watchmen indulge their rough-housing sides in Zack Snyder's adaptation (which, for the record, though only genre-related, is a lot better, I might add). Even his surly parlance is softened, ne'er a memorable candid remark in sight.You'd assume such an immense fault in the movie would be its greatest flaw. But, oh no, Wolverine is far too risible for that. The movie's biggest crime is that the film is bereft of any distinguishable plot. The narrative is scatter-shot beyond coherence, with little or no continuity, the story following a very apparent and laughable format: Wolverine meets a character, fights briefly, than, following dialog usually a long the lines of ""okay, listen, pal, you're gonna *insert task here*, or I'm gonna *insert threatening remark here*"", he sets off with a new purpose, and repeats the same.What's tragic is that the first fifteen to twenty minutes or so are very captivating, from the assaulting opening credits to the action-packed mission sequence. It's a movie that inevitably promises greatness, but has bitten off far more than it can chew.Worse still, the inclusion of characters like Deadpool and Gambit is completely pointless, their screen time unmemorable and disappointingly fleeting, their crow-barred appearances nothing more than a ridiculous advertising scheme, it would seem. Which is a serious shame, because Ryan Reynolds mini-performance is pitch-perfect. Of course, I can't really say the same for Taylor Kitsch, who (and truer words have never been spoken) is undoubtedly not Cajun.The acting on the villain's part is a lot more impressive: The movie's only concrete redeemable feature is Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth, who makes a diverting, albeit clich√©, villain, his brooding presence a welcome contrast to Jackman's kitty Wolverine. Danny Huston, here playing the part of William Stryker, a role originally taken by national treasure Brian Cox (whom Huston looks nothing like!), is also on form, despite a script that serves him the cheesiest of dialog and most OTT of Machiavellian agendas.But things don't stay positive for long; even the editing is hopeless. Each fight scene is probably jaw-dropping, but it's impossible to notice due to the horribly erratic editing. Should it not be bad enough that the CGI is painful (two words: ""claws"" and ""bathroom"")? To be honest, it's a wonderful depiction of self-parody. I mean, each moment is dripping with cheese, and each character seems to be recycled from other superhero movies (the old couple didn't give Wolverine their son's stuff; it was their nephew's, because he's probably freaking' Spider-Man!).Okay, so I probably haven't been of very sound mind writing this review. The movie isn't the worst thing that's happened ever, but it's still pretty bad. It's baffling, really; how did it turn out so bad? Gavin Hood directed it, and he's got a reasonably adequate filmography. It had a simple story. It had a very simple demographic to pander to (action-loving jocks and fan-boys). So how? Who knows? All I know is that only a decent Deadpool spin off will revive this fan-boy's belief in a now near-dead franchise.In conclusion: not unbearable, but definitely forgettable.

What did you expect?  That will answer your questions.,"Being an X-Men fan since the early 1980's, I was bound to see this movie. Hearing about the generally terrible reviews, my expectations were sufficiently low coming in. What did I expect -- not Tolstoy, not Kurosawa. What I got was a pleasant surprise.Film reviews are becoming less and less critical (pardon the pun) to a film's success, especially when you consider those for genre films. There are plenty of people who will always review a horror film as terrible, for example. And most critics are not fans of the superhero genre, save those they grew up with, perhaps Christopher Reeve's first couple. Are they going to like ""Wolverine""? Not likely, and not important to anyone else's enjoyment of the movie.This is a summer blockbuster, and it works just fine. It does not, in fact, have gaping plot holes, terrible inconsistencies or many of the other easy targets that we're hearing about. Did these people see the first three (if we include the Brett Ratner misfire)? People are going to see this movie mostly for the action and the actors, but there is actually quite a good deal going on beneath the surface -- for the genre fans.If you don't like superheroes, why would you bother going to see something like this in the first place? Don't. If you're an X-Men/Wolverine fan, it doesn't matter what other people think, you're going to see it. But for anyone else in between, just temper your expectations within the genre, perhaps do some background reading on who the characters are (you should know who Gambit, Deadpool and The Blob are, for example), and maybe even try to find some friends to go with who are genre fans.Within the genre, it's honestly not bad. A step up from X-Men 3, a good deal better than Daredevil and Punisher, but really not close to X-Men 2 or The Dark Knight.Finally, if you haven't seen the original three of the series, it's quite fine to see this one first, you won't get any spoilers from Wolverine.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Horrible Special Effects!!!,"The thing that bothered me the most about this movie was how horrible the special effects were, every time when we got to see Wolverine's claws, it was so damn obvious how CGI they were, I STILL CANT BELIEVE IT.

They f*cked up Deadpool so bad!! I just wanted to cry. The first time we got to see Gambit I was like, He's freakin cool!!!! And it looked like a good casting job to me, but when the movie continued he was actually pretty.........DUMB, after the scene with the cards he didn't feel like Gambit anymore!!!Even though i expected a lot from this movie, i always had this feeling somewhere deep inside that it was going to disappoint a lot of people, and i think it did!It surely disappointed me.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best X-Men film by far. Period.,"Earlier this week, my wife and I caught an early press screening for the upcoming X-Men Origins: Wolverine and we both went absolutely bananas. The screening was held in Ramat Gan, Israel, on an enormous screen, and it was a real delight. The surround sound system and the huge screen gave it all an epic feel, and helped emphasize the magnitude of the movie. At the end of the day, I found it to be on par with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, X2 and other successful comic book films from the wonderful universe of Marvel.Truth be told, I went into the film without any big expectations, since I don't carry much knowledge about the character's background - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised both by Hugh Jackman's engaging portrayal of the character and the light shed not only on Wolverine's origins - but on many of the other members of the X-Men as well... Back when the original trilogy was released (in 2000, 2003 & 2006) I managed to catch them all, and after reaching the new installment to the series, i'm happy to report that X-Men Origins: Wolverine corresponds successfully with the series, while still managing to rise and shine on it's own merit. Wolverine's story was a gripping tale of revenge and knowing one's boundaries, and served as a successful prequel to the whole X-Men series.The way I see it, All people involved in this spectacular summer hit deserve a great big kudos. I really hope the fact that a work-print version was leaked to the internet a month before the theatrical release won't hurt this film's truly deserved chances at box office glory come early May. In my opinion, this is a movie meant to be seen on a big screen if i've ever seen one. If this thing flops because of the leak, more quality products of it's ilk won't get a cinematic release, and we'll all be sorry...All in all, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was real cinematic fun, and an excellent set-up for (what seems like) a truly spectacular Summer of films. Keep up the good work, folks!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wolverine,"I tried to watch one of the first two X Men films, I don't know what one it was, and it bored me to death, but despite that when I heard they were making a Wolverine film I was curious. As a teenager I went through an X Men phase, it didn't last long, but what I really liked was the Wolverine character. I even spent a small fortune (for a teenager) buying all the original Wolverine comics. This film did not disappoint (much). Dumb muscle bound fun. It's not intelligent and it doesn't try to be.

Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Way to start the summer, Marvel. This is a prequel to a series of mostly decent comic book movies - I'd rank the second one, X2, as maybe the second or third best comic book movie ever. It concerns the origin of the series' most popular character, Wolverine. Well, that's kind of a lie. It's not really that concerned with anything. It's an indifferently created action movie that goes through the clich√© plot line ploddingly. Dialogue is flat, as is the acting. The film is overly violent but completely bloodless - I hate when they edit an R-rated movie into a PG-13 rated movie. At least it's sometimes laughable. Try not to giggle every time Wolverine is on his knees, hands (and claws) spread, screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" That happens four times in the story, and the movie flashes back to one of those times at least once, as well. There's hardly a good thing I can say about it. It's a stinker, probably the worst summer blockbuster since Van Helsing. Sorry, Mr. Jackman. I have nothing against you, but these two movies are beyond abysmal.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Talk about slicing and dicing!,"*SNIKT!* This feral mutant gets his own movie, how neat! Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) aka James Howlett, aka Logan gets to know more about himself in this movie. Born in the 1800's, this mutant has the claws to tear through his enemies like a hot knife through butter. He gets to join the armed forces with his ""brother"" Victor Creed(Liev Schrieber), aka ""Sabertooth"". These berserkers have fought side-by side and against each other. I liked the part where Wolverine gets his bones laced with the ultra-hard metal called Adamantium. It makes his bones ultra-durable and his claws ultra-deadly. The other characters were great: Wade Wilson aka ""Deadpool""(Ryan Reynolds), Fred J. Dukes aka ""The Blob""(Kevin Durand), and several others in there too long long to remember. Berserker barrages, feral impulses gives the movie an edge that the other ones didn't have, and since the movie is based on Logan's questionable past, knowing who's who is a mystery to anyone. Gambit(Taylor Kitsch) is just a s resourceful as Kayla Silverfox was. His kinetic cards has plenty of impact to the situation. This movie has plenty to go on; plot, humor, action, and intrigue. I enjoyed the movie very well. If you don't like it, you'll be dealing with Wolverine, BUB! *SNIKT!* 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just made 7 Stars,"I just finished watching The first three XMen movies and followed with Wolverine.There is a lot to like about this movie. They got Victor Creed so right. I much prefer this character portrayal than the one written for the original XMen movie. 
Hugh Jackman is also great in this - I don't think he's ever been bad as the character, he's just improved since the first movie. 
The story was great. Lots of great characters involved that we hadn't seen up to this point.What they got wrong was Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool). Ryan Reynolds did a great job, it's just the portrayal was written so wrong. 
But, with the events of XMen: Days Of Future Past, this version of Deadpool can still stand in the old/original timeline. Anyway, glad they did a better version of Wade/Deadpool later. 
Also some of the CGI in this is a little hard to swallow. Logan's claws are drawn on way too much - especially for close up shots. They look like cartoons over live action (like Roger Rabbit).So I liked the story and the movie as a whole but, it did seem to be edited strangely. Like a minute or 2 of some scenes were missing.If you're an XMen fan then you will like this but, also be disappointed by some of the places they dropped the ball a little. 
Otherwise it is still a decent action sci-fi movie. 
It's probably the weakest of the XMen movies but still worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Idiotic, but things do blow up","Despite the great efforts of Hugh Jackman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is dead on arrival, combining an illogical plot with a raft of clich√©s that would embarrass the worst porn writer ever. There are too many characters to keep track of, and the action seems to be intentionally frantic, the better to distract you from the fact that little of the story makes a whit of sense.We get to see the actual origins of Wolverine (that is, as a young child) when he discovers that the man he just killed with his bare, uh, claws was his real dad and that the guy he thought was just a good pal is actually his brother Victor, aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Later we see Wolverine (known then as Logan) and Sabretooth fighting in four different American wars (Civil, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam), and then he and his brother are eventually brought in as part of a mutant team called Weapon X by a sinister military guy, Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston). The mutants proceed to kick everyone's ass until Wolverine has a bout with decency and quits.Fast forward six years later and Wolverine's living a placid life as a lumberjack in Canada with his hot girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox, and Stryker finds him and tells him someone's picking off the old team members (oh no!). Can Wolverine help? Who's responsible for these deaths? I bet Stryker knows more than he's telling. He's sinister, you know.If I had to sum up this movie's plot in one word, it'd be ""revenge."" Wolverine is constantly avenging someone or something. Sometimes he's just mad in general, but usually he's going after Sabretooth for something or going after Stryker for something or going after unnamed goons in helicopters and tanks for something. Another recurring motif is Wolverine's angst. The guy's like 140 years old, but he has the angst of a cuckolded teenager on prom night. At least twice he looks up to the heavens, arms spread, crying ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" Yes, in this day and age of highfalutin gizmodery we still have mopey superheroes.The movie tries so damn hard to be loved that it forgets it's supposed to be sort of a superhero comic-book movie. There's endless backstory about the two brothers, and it feels like it's shoehorned in, almost as if the makers thought they had to explain themselves. Is it important to know that Wolverine's dad was a gardener? Probably not. Did he have to visit so many of the former members of Weapon X? I'm gonna say no.Even so, the final villain ‚Äì Deadpool, who has all the strengths of the other mutants on the team and none of their weaknesses ‚Äì is pretty damn scary and convincing. Trouble is, they make him so tough to kill that it's difficult to get closure on him. If you know what I mean. I mean, he has all of the strengths of these superhuman dudes without having those namby-pamby weaknesses! What's the point? At least the setting's appropriate for this movie: Three Mile Island, which for you youngsters out there we should note was the scene of a major nuclear-power-plant accident in 1979, which might be when this movie's denouement is set.Anyway, because there's so much exposition, there's little room for character ‚Äì either character development or an actual character OF the film. It's bland, the porridge of comic-book movies. There's no cleverness, no wit, nothing more than snide asides and bon mots, as if we were in a faceless Stallone movie circa 1984. Jackman's game, of course, but he's now played Wolverine in four movies, so this wasn't exactly a stretch for him. I'd like to think that this clunker will put to rest any plans for future Origins installments, but I got a feeling we'll be seeing Magneto and Storm get their tales told someday as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Missed the Mark... Big Time.,"It's just a shame that the most famous Marvel character was treated this way in Xmen Origins: Wolverine. The cast did a good job and the visuals seemed to be in line with the other Xmen movies of this series, but I hate to say it, the directing was just not that good. The over-stylized use of Wolverine cutting things was obviously abused and every time he extended his claws he ""posed"" which really hurt me being able to emotionally connect with his character. It was the equivalent of seeing the outline of earlier green screen special effects in films in the 80s and 90s. Also, the story (not Gavin's fault) ended up in a really bad place; far from the actual history of Deadpool. I get it, creative license, and that's fine to a degree (like making Juggernaut a ""mutant"" in Xmen: The Last Stand when he's actually not one), but Deadpool's finishing end character seemed like it was ripped from the television show ""Heroes"" and stolen from the character ""Sylar"". C'mon Marvel!! You don't need to pull from that storyline, because you're... well... MARVEL!!! You've got an infinite supply of good story lines and the histories of your characters are solid. They had to be in order to sell enough books to the point where you are making movies about them. Lastly, I wasn't able to really emotionally connect to the entire storyline and the characters. Maybe the acting was a bit off, maybe the story didn't help, but in the end THAT comes down to the director and his ability to pull some really good content out of his actors. Example: George Lucas screwed up Star Wars Episodes 1, 2 and 3 because he didn't allow the actors to ""act"" and perform their craft. Instead he tried to make them EXACTLY like the original three films (4, 5 and 6) and it turned out very poorly. The same thing started happening here. Bryan Singer started something great and introduced a new style of time to this comic book/graphic novel genre of films, then Brett Ratner took it further and more emotionally deeper, then Gavin Hood tried to copy that. Gavin might have a career in directing, but I don't think he should take on such a big project again until he gets more experience directing under his belt. On the flip side, the studios shouldn't take on a newb when filming a movie of this magnitude and shell out the bucks for some very experienced talent. Better luck next time Gavin and FOX. Maybe Disney's acquisition will be a good thing... we'll see.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid but Not Spectacular,"2 May 2009. Perhaps its the medium of film, but oddly enough, X-Men Origins: Wolverine just can't compete with the newer medium of television. Take the television series ""Heros"" which can extend any plot or character by multiple times over a number of years and a single movie even if its a prequel, it can't compete except supposedly for the special effects and big budget expenditures. The action is decent, the plot commendable if not perhaps falling trap to its own devices. Wolverine leaves some questions unanswered, uses plot twists to manipulate the audience's emotions from laughter to anger and back to sympathy. The problem with this movie is that in its effort to surprise the audience, keep it off-balanced, the plot itself becomes part of the problem as the twists and turns become themselves unlikely and unreasonable, if not emotional surprising and gyrating. This action-adventure feels derivative, with a lot of the action just a rehash of the same, some of special effects even seeming to be over to top and not comfortably believable even in the realm of big blockbuster movies. The effort in inject emotional intimacy, connections is also commendable, but not always successful. The brother relationship always felt awkward. Those innocent bystanders who get killed also seem more or less token plot devices. Overall, this is an enjoyable blockbuster, if not superbly accomplished or establishing any sort of classic status. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great action, formulaic story","This movie started out pretty great, but then seemed to be losing some steam by last 1/3 of the movie. Hugh Jackman was great as were his enemies (esp. Liev Schreiber who plays his brother) - all were believably villainous and intense, but somehow the story stopped being engaging. Things became so formulaic that I realized I've seen this plot line one too many times.Basically, the story tells us the background story about X-Men character Wolverine's childhood through adulthood. He doesn't have a memory of his past and this movie tells us the story of why.There's a great revenge-themed plot involved, but it just doesn't have a great crescendo. Wolverine/Logan's vengeance quest ramps up great in the beginning and middle, but seems somewhat empty or hollow afterwards. All the classic elements were there (hateful enemies, explosions, good people in jeopardy ... etc.) - but that's the problem - it's too formulaic ... to the point of being utterly predictable.If you're an X-Men's fan, you've probably already seen this film (or nothing's going to stop you!), for everyone else - it's got some great action and F/X scenes that make a solid first half, but it delivers a story you've already seen a 100 times before.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Just about passable,"Just about passable.I never felt bored while watching 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which is why I can't give it a lower rating.

Fun movie has nothing to do with Wolverine,"Alpha Flight, Bullseye, The Hulk, Mariko Yashida, Stick, Yukio These names are familiar to anyone who grew up reading the X-Men comics. Specifically they all related directly to Wolverine's back story. They are also all completely absent from the movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Wolverine was always a mystery man. That's what I liked about him. That's what *everybody* liked about him. So, I was more than a little skeptical when I heard they were going to be making a movie about his origin story. Instead of the Canadian mountain man who was experimented on to make a Canadian version of Captain America, who survived the procedure due to a mutant healing power, but wwe are served up a guy named ""James"" who has bone claws and is some kind of Casca-esquire immortal mercenary who's fought in every American war from the Civil War to Vietnam, with his brother (presumably Sabretooth though called ""Victor"" and played by Liev Schreiber rather than Tyler Mane). The Canadian government seems totally out of the picture, and William Stryker (the anti-mutant televangelist from the Graphic novel 'God Loves Man Kills') who is now some sort of U.S. military/government type who is doing mad scientist experiments on mutants for military purposes sort of like the character Henry Peter Gyrich in the X-Men comics (Gyrich you remember was killed in the first X-Men movie by Sabretooth). I can't actually say the film is unenjoyable - it actually is worth it for some fans. Just know that it isn't quite up to the standards of earlier X-Men movies, nor the classic comics. One almost wishes that the creators had spent more time reading Frank Miller's ""Wolverine"" mini-series, and less time watching Hong Kong wire work.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

7.1/10,"Unlike previous Marvel movies- Iron Man, The Hulk, Spiderman, yada yada, I enjoyed this one (as much as I did X-Men and X2) While not equal to the greatness of the first 2 X-Men movies, this one is definitely better by a mile than X-Men 3- The Last Stand.My only quarm with it, is that some of the action sequences are poorly constructed in places, and the final battle is far fetched, over CGI'd, and not very believable.There have not been many decent superhero movies in the 19 years. The first 2 Batman movies, the first 2 Blade movies, and the first 2 X-Men movies stand out as the only decent ones to date, in terms of original dynamic direction, production, style, and characterization; and while this movie isn't AS GOOD AS the aforementioned movies, it is pretty close. In terms of what one should expect from a decent superhero movie, this movie does just that- hell of a lot better than the lame family friendly mediocre fun of Spiderman and Iron Man.

Not bad,"X-Men movies probably have the best casting for a superhero movies. For the amount they had to cast, they kept the quality up pretty well, which is disappointing since they enjoy ruining the characters.Anyways, this movie isn't that bad actuality. It's got some clich√© bits, but overall it's not too shabby and was better than I was expecting, though to some extent it takes a while to get going; the scene in the intro is something that I thought was just so retarded that I initially wanted to leave the theater. The film also suffered from lazy writing. Yes, I know I am not watching an Academy Award winner, but still, wasn't anyone paying attention during the production of this film? Though, I was pretty happy with Deadpool's portrayal, especially in the beginning with Ryan Reynold's DP part.I also felt that Gambit wasn't really necessary in this movie, it's like they just threw him in there for the fans. The movie had a cheesy part or two, but in the end you gotta remember that it's an action flick; some of the best have cheesy parts.The finale sequence was in the movie was great, though too bad about the crappy fight and I loved how OTT cyclops powers are in this (tearing apart the school + reactor).Also, this movie takes the cake for ""Most awkward screaming moments toward camera""; the movie jumps off with Wolverine Jr screaming at the camera!

X-Men Origins,"X-Men Origins Wolverine is the story of how Wolverine became Wolverine within Fox's X-Men universe. It has the debut of Wade Wilson aka Deadpool. It doesn't do Deadpool well and the Deadpool movies did Deadpool way better. I do feel like it's a pretty average film. There's definitely better in the X-Men franchise but at the same time, seems to be worse (Dark Phoenix). It does seem to be a little more on action than story than a mixture of the two at times. This is one of the pillars of the creation of the Deadpool movies alongside Blade Trinity and Green Lantern (as well the leaked footage of the first Deadpool). As well, we probably wouldn't have Deadpool & Wolverine without X-Men Origins. We wouldn't have this without the very first X-Men in 2000 but still. There's no denying that we wouldn't have future X-Men stuff without this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing stuff up,"There's one thing that has always struck a good note with me about Hugh Jackman in movies¬Ö the man seems to actually care about his performance. He seems to do his homework, assumes his role and bring across a genuine performance whenever he is working. It is this type of actor that can make a mediocre movie great. When Hugh is happy, you want to laugh with him, when he is ticked you feel the intensity. It is this type of acting that made the Wolverine such a likable character in this film.Bang-up special effects, blades slicing through inanimate and animate objects and enough fire and ice to make you feel as if you had just experienced Ragnarok. X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing sh-t up. Shot from the angle of a gnat on the hairy back of Logan the Wolverine, we get to see why he is one ticked off dude and also why his bones are metal. Along with that, this movie shows a glimpse of how the Mutant School that Professor Xavier ran in the first three X-Men movies started.My favorite scenes from a cinematography standpoint depicts Wolverine and Sabretooth in all of our popular wars, Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam. These were shot beautifully and the look of it all felt genuine. My first paragraph may mislead you into believing that Jackman was the only top performer but you will be hard pressed to fine a Sabretooth more perfect than Liev Schreiber. Intense fighting scenes, very human emotions and supernatural powers are only sobered by the dull landscape that is the home of Wolverine during the movie. There were times I wished the big man would travel around the city a bit more just to liven up the background, it made me feel as if I was watching Legends of The Fall (great movie) with mutants in it. Fans will love the slick talking Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool sans red/black getup and also Taylor Kisch's Gambit who did some very Gambit things the brief time he was on camera.Of Course any more headliner mutants and this film would have fallen into the cluster f‚Äî that was the first three X-Men (X2 was awesome though) so it was kept at a minimum and all the portrayals were equally well done. Upon leaving the theater I listened to the comments of the comic book die-hards; What I got was that aside from the writers taking a few liberties with the characters well to be honest Deadpool (I liked him) they seemed genuinely pleased with the movie. For me that is enough to validate X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I mean it was solid, so check it out and make sure you sit through the credits. Oh ya and go see it on the big screen, even if you are one of the pirates who ganked the unfinished screener prior.More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid prequel with pace and flair,"The long-awaited and much hyped ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a solid addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise, taking on the challenging role of looking at the early days of one James Logan, aka Wolverine.Hugh Jackman has always been a convincing Wolverine, despite his towering presence. His cigar chewing, wise-cracking mutant is a joy to watch and he is joined by a true ensemble cast.The movie manages to cover a lot of ground in its 107 minutes and contains one or two surprises that should please the faithful viewer of the series. Even before the opening credits have ended, director Gavin Hood has managed to give us an overview of a significant time period and an insight into the tense relationship of Logan and Victor Creed.Don't forget to stay until the end credits have finished running, Fox have a pleasant tradition of treating the patient viewer! 9 out of 10.

Bad Movie,"This movie was not good.

Throughout the whole movie it felt like I was watching a video game, travel this level, beat this boss, next stage, travel a bit, beat this boss, next stage, travel around a bit, etc.I do commend Liev for his portrayal of Sabertooth, which was very good and a fresh feel to the character, which is not only animalistic in nature but also intelligent.

Wowzers,"Action is never too much if there's a buildup & thats what this movie provides just that @ every turn. Even though I knew what would happen usually, the dialogue was better than expected.

Revenge it seems is the basis for last big action movies & idk if thats a reflection o the people wanting 2 take back our country but I have a sense it is. Hugh Jackman wants his normal life back & does everything he can to keep his mutant life & friends behind. He wants peace & little to do with the nagging government. Only negative is the little use of Jackmans wife, though you still got 2 see her sincerity when you didn't expect it. Love that movie didn't really neel 2 much on character development but we still saw Wolverines simple life slip away. All in all, good cameo with Patrick Stewart just when they need him.

"no matter how hard it tries, this is soulless, bloodless, unnecessary storytelling","X-Men Origins: Wolverine could be a prime example for what is superbly wrong with Hollywood film-making. There is a director credited here, Gavin Hood, who has made good movies such as Tsotsi. Perhaps they hired him for that, or for his previous film (unseen by me) Rendition. Or, further perhaps, they knew he could be pushed around for a good paycheck. Maybe he does love the Wolverine character and the X-Men franchise, but from a standpoint of only seeing the film as evidence, it doesn't look that way. This looks more to be a case of film-making-by-committee, where a whole gaggle of producers and studio heads (not least of which Tom Rothman) called the shots on what would happen in this story. Which, ultimately, wasn't really necessary in context of the other movies (or at least the first two).Wolverine, as a character, is captivating and a bad-ass in the comics. In the first two films it's Jackman's performance, and some clever ambiguity, that make him worth watching and a pivotal character, of actually not knowing a whole lot about his past (save for some exposition and the character Stryker, then played by Brian Cox). By delving into this character's back-story, who from what I've heard and been told has one of the most convoluted and complicated backstories in the history of the comic-book medium, there's a whole lot of noise and whistles but not any depth. I didn't learn or gain anything about Wolverine/Logan/Jimmy(?) in the entire running time, except that if you possibly kill the love of his life then, well, he'll get revenge. And, really, if you had claws that could retract and lived over 150 years and was basically indestructible *before* Adamantium, you'd be ticked too.Basically, it's a story that holds very little water to start with and has to work hard to give us something, anything, to care about what will happen to an indestructible man-beast like Wolverine. Jackman is game, but what about the other actors? Liev Schieber grunts and barely acts his way through his Sabretooth, while Ryan Reynolds, who may someday give us something as a version of Deadpool, only acts like that for all of five minutes before he's yanked off only to return late in the film (as apparently a very funny and witty self-conscious comic character in print) without any dialog to speak of! Others like Will.I.Am (yes, that's how his name is spelled) don't bring much at all, while there's some other room for thankless cameos - my favorite (by that I mean the one I was equally mortified and ironically amused by) was Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, appearing before some lost mutants before disaster strikes, his face super-smooth and looking so CGI you'd swear Brandon Routh was neo-realist in comparison.There's simply no invention, nothing that stands out even as a fun bad choice; this is more akin to Fantastic Four than something that is really *fun* bad like The Spirit or Ghost Rider. You have to keep your eyelids open by force just from not being bored by the films generic tendencies, most prominent when it tries to give some sense of humor (totally dulled or with the lowest common denominator of gag, i.e. ""oh, my claws broke your sink, um, ha?), but especially when delving into the action sequences. No personality, nothing to make it stand out from probably much superior video games, and whatever inanities present can't even give rise to unintentional laughter. It's hack work through and through.And the same goes with the story itself, and its super-duper-holy-s*** contrivances. Adamantium is one thing, that's a given, even if one wonders why Wolverine would need or want it thanks to his already near indestructible nature (sorry to harp on it again, it appears vaguely important to me given Wolverine's attitude towards it and Stryker). But the Amnesia-bullets... do I need to go on?",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A review from a Marvel fanboy AND film intellectual.,"For a person that is what my title suggest, I had mixed feeling about the movie. The movie overall was okay as a film AND comic adaptation, but didn't try hard enough to mirror Logan's storyline. It seemed to water down the important elements yet add unnecessary ones to take Logan's origin in a different direction, and I can't think of any logical reason for doing so. It puzzles me that virtually every character from the Weapon X storyline (including John Wraith, who the average comic fan won't be familiar with) is included yet the most important elements of those characters are butchered (especially Zero's), watered down and practically made a mockery of. I won't spoil anything, but what as a comic fanboy I have to say that what the film did towards the end with one of Marvel's most popular characters is unforgivable and is truly the lowest point of the movie for Marvel fans and in my opinion was the one big mistake that the movie might have been more favorably reviewed by fans without.So what about the movie is good? first and foremost is the acting by the main characters. Jackman shines as Wolverine. His acting is generally impressive and especially so in being true to his character; even better so is Shrieber as Sabretooth. The man perfectly captures the humorously vicious personality of Sabretooth. The bar fight scene between he and Jackman is shining proof of this. Reynolds is perfect as Wade Wilson; it's a shame his screen time is so limited. The special effects are fairly impressive, the action is filled with suspense, and certain parts of Logan's story are captured perfectly; it's a shame it's not like that for every element. Even Danny Huston was particularly interesting as Stryker; accurately depicting the actual character's subtle greed and manipulation.Not the worst comic-to-movie, but not the brightest. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't take the path to making this movie as story-accurate as it should have been, but any fan of the comics should still see it for the things it does correctly; it's still worth it. Non-comic readers may like it for its action alone, but I strongly encourage anyone seeing the movie to familiarize themselves with the characters' storyline somewhat to fully appreciate the things this film does right. I give it a 6 overall, because it's just good enough to make fans appreciate the few good things and try to remember the film by those things.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Entertaining for Those Who Are Not Comic Book Purists,"I went in with low expectations because,until recently, a movie has never been made based on a comic book that did not dumb the plot and characterizations down. Therefore, this did not disappoint. The characters and the story may not be as complex as the comic books from which they are derived, but for the uneducated moviegoer, this is a very visual film with great action sequences and unexpected plot twists. For those of us who already know the story, the movie is not all that it could be based on the source material. However, 95% (Yes, I pulled that number out of the air.) of the time in art, the source material is the original inspiration and is always better. If a person goes in expecting to get a better connection with the source material, that person will be sorely disappointed. If, however, a person goes in expecting to see a violent story about a mutant with claws and an attitude who is seeking revenge, the movie delivers. Hugh Jackman plays a great Wolverine. Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth is also very well delivered.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Unfinished, rushed, or poor quality control???","I saw the film yesterday and am still feeling that dull ache of disappointment. I am not concerned with any lack in staying true to the character/history etc, as really I just wanted to see something enjoyable, to really be swept up in what was on the screen.Alas, I was not so swept away with what I saw. I haven't seen the bootleg copy, but I feel the finished product was closer to an unfinished edit than should have been released. I felt the effects were unconvincing and very hit-and-miss, dare I say even sloppy in places? The product just didn't feel well executed from a production standpoint. Then again maybe we have been spoiled with the likes of Watchmen/Dark Knight etc. which have had a very strong aesthetic. This dynamic approach to the aesthetic of the film was lacking in X Men Origins. A Crime when your source material is as visual as the comic/graphic novel format. A real pity as this needed style to bring the beast to life. It will remain on life support I guess until the possibility of a sequel is mooted.

X-men Origins: Wolverine-ish....,"So yet another comic-book-based film has arrived this time in the form of everyones favourite mutant, Wolverine! So once again, opinions for the film seem to differ somewhat from viewer to viewer as is normal with this type of film. The bottom line is quite simple. You can't please everyone. ESPECIALLY die-hard fans who all have their ideal version of the specific character or characters portrayed on film and of course all thoughs people that reckon if they had the huge budget supplied to them that they could in return make a better film!!! ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" is by far no masterpiece but that being said it is still a very enjoyable action movie! i.e. low on plot and big on action and cheese....but in a tasteful way.Hugh Jackman was fine in the role of Wolverine (the cinematic version) but didn't particularly bring anything new to the role. The film flowed pretty well too with enough dialogue (though substance lacking) between the much anticipated action scenes. One of my major problems which seems to be a reacurring one of late is that they show too much in the trailers for these films, as in all the coolest parts of the action scenes I had already seen and there was very little left to surprise me! The best thing to do I guess is to stop watching trailers all together....yeah right!!!The cameos of new (to live-action film) characters were good but sadly some of the cameos were either too short or pretty irrelevant! More screen time needed to go to ""Deadpool"" (the funny one not the later on one)and definitely Gambit who only seemed added in the last minute due to high demand from fans wanting him in the original trilogy! Taylor Kitch was alright as Gambit though his Cajun accent seemed to come and go which was very inconsistent.I don't want to harp on about plot details etc. so I'll just say that ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" will NOT please everyone and will probably offend people who are perfectionists or are just that way inclined. It seems too many people go to movies to look for their flaws and of course end up not enjoying the movie because they never intended too!!!This film is probably the closest resemblance to a live-action version of the character of ""Wolverine"" because at the end of the day we all know that if there was going to be a live-action film adaption of the comic book version of Wolverine...it would be rated - R, which means less people will see it and Hollywood won't make enough profit!It's sad but true.So ignore all the bad things you've heard about this film and just go and see it for yourself and make your own opinion on it as only you can decide whether you like it or not.As for my opinion, it was definitely a lot better than the disappointing ""X-men 3"" but inferior to the first two films though I do think this film is a great lead-in or prologue to ""X-men 2"" and recommend watching ""X-men 2"" straight after ""X-men origins: Wolverine"" as it's almost a direct sequel: )",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Huge Jackman did a great job as did the rest of the cast and although comic book purists might complain, to me it is still a darn good film that I enjoyed very much. I suppose I have the advantage of not reading all the comics so had no pre-conceived ideas about it all, but if you like action or fantasy films I don't see how you can fail to enjoy this movie?

Eviscerating.,"I just saw ""Wolverine"" in theatres. For the most part I thought it was exciting, action packed, and a great comic book movie for the most part. I was not the biggest fan of the X Men films, but I loved this film.Basically the film is about Wolverine(go figure). It shows how he gave up a life of violence to try to live a normal life, only to have to go back to what he wanted to get away from.A lot of credit should be given to Hugh Jackman. He really does an outstanding job as Wolverine in this film. You do not see many performances better than his in a comic book style film.The story is pretty good in this film. There are some flaws though. I think they may have jumped to Wolverine as an adult too quickly, they really did not even scratch the surface of what his childhood was about. But I think that helps the film to get going fast, basically most of the back story is shown in the opening credits. It jumps to the main story right away. I do not think that choosing to not show much of his childhood is necessarily a bad thing, like I said, it helps the film to get going.The action is legendary in this film. Wolverine gets in a lot of action as do many of the other characters. It is a spectacle to behold and some of the better action scenes in a film in a while. Better than anything that was in the other X Men films.I also liked the villains. Sabertooth was great, great background and motives as well as just being a scary guy. I was looking forward to seeing Deadpool and I thought he was portrayed in a unique and interesting way. Also agent Striker was great as the backstabbing U.S. Agent type.Gambit I was looking forward to as well. He was OK, but it seemed that he was there to serve only one purpose and did not do enough. Also I do not understand why Cyclops was in the film.So I liked this film, this is the new best Marvel film in my opinion. I hope that there are more great Origin Films to come.

"I expected something more, but it's still good enough to be worth it.","I am not very used to films about comic book characters, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with prequels, in order to better understand what I was seeing. Thus, this film was not one of the first to be released but it is one of those that focuses on the origins of the group and one of its most striking characters: Wolverine.In this film, the origin of the character is revealed, who would have been born centuries ago, still at the time of the American Civil War where he fought alongside his brother. Being a mutant particularly apt for physical conflict, with extraordinary resistance, unbreakable retractable claws and an extraordinary capacity for physical regeneration, Logan was the ideal soldier and fought in all wars in which the United States participated until Vietnam, where he disagreed with his brother, increasingly bloodthirsty. Aware that one day he would have to face it, Logan agrees to undergo a scientific experiment in which his skeleton was reinforced with adamantium, an extraordinarily hard and resistant metal that made him virtually unstoppable.Well, I'm not the best person to judge the way the film is linked to the rest of the franchise since I haven't seen them yet. But I have seen some opinions that have harshly criticized the way the film contradicts some points in the fictional story of the characters and creates some paradoxes and contradictions with previous films. I am sure that connoisseurs of the Marvel universe will have a more grounded opinion than mine about this but, to give credit to these criticisms, this is a very unfavorable point for this film. One thing that I was able to verify for myself, and that is more easily assessed, is the fragility of the script when the subject is not action: all the explanations and contextualization seem summarized and done in a hurry, so that we can come up with another beating. The dialogues are also weak and uninteresting and, apart from the main character, the rest of the characters were not very developed, and some characters seem to appear only by a kind of moral obligation to later disappear or be relegated to an ""honorable figuration"".As for the cast, the film abounds in quality, although the protagonist role is easily grasped by the talented Hugh Jackman, who is an excellent actor and has been very successful with his participation in the X-Men films. I also really liked the performance of Liev Schreiber, in the role of Logan's cruel brother, Victor / Sabretooth. Danny Huston also did a good job in the role of the villain, Stryker. The film also features very successful appearances by Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan and Taylor Kitsch. But there is no doubt: the film belongs to Jackman and he steals the spotlight when he appears.Technically, it is a film that stands out in several points, especially for the high quality of the visual effects and CGI, and for the intensity and grandeur of the action and fight scenes, which are the strong plate of the whole film. Its clearly visible where the budget money was spent. The problem with this is that unpleasant feeling that we are watching a video game and not something that could have happened. Lack of verisimilitude and realism, despite the technical brilliance. The rest is much more average: the film has good cinematography and makes good use of color, light and shadow, but that was required in a film like this. There are some truly remarkable scenes and sequences, like the opening and the final climax. The film still has good sets and costumes, and I think it's fair to also commend the makeup department for their work with the physical appearance of the characters. Finally, a word of appreciation to Harry Gregson-Williams, who signs the soundtrack, which is not in the ear nor is remarkable but fulfills its role quite well.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Substantive story.,"The negative critiques of this movie notwithstanding, this is definitely one of the better movies of the science fiction genre. For this movie to work one must judge this movie for what it is: science fiction. Otherwise this movie will be barely watchable. Hugh Jackman gives a strong performance as Wolverine and the supporting cast led by L. Schreiber are equally good as the movie takes the audience on a wild ride through war and sibling conflict. Although based on a comic book story, the plot is sufficiently complex to actually maintain audience interest and that combined with excellent special effects raises this movie to a level that is somewhere between good and very good, and for a movie that features characters who are, to put it mildly, strange, this is saying a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

His accent was barely audible with the guy they chose, and the costume was horrid. And Deadpool... you have GOT to be kidding me. He was one of my favorite characters, witty, cool swords, his powers. But they messed him up in ways you can't even imagine. Not to mention the screen time the two characters were given was pathetic. Besides those two characters, the special effects were not up to par.

Slightly Better Than I Thought,"Why this movie was made as opposed to another film which brought the X-Men team back together again, I don't know. What I do know is that while I had my reservations about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, overall it turned out to be an O.K. movie. I'm not saying that this film is as impressive as Iron Man or the previous three X-Men films, but it still gets the summer movie season kicked off on a fairly decent note.While I was entertained, the movie was not without its problems. Firstly the special effects were really bad by today's standards, as well the story never seemed to build up to anything; it's comparable to an orchestra playing a symphonic piece and playing it as loud as possible for the entire time. Still, with these few minor gripes aside the film still managed to satisfy the audience.The action was entertaining to watch unfold and also the dialogue in many spots was quite clever. Overall I'd recommend seeing this film. While it is a far cry from any of its predecessors, it still packs enough punch to let the audiences know that summer is finally here.I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine a 6 out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Insulting.,"This movie's biggest crime is that it's boring. It takes what is normally one of the most exciting characters in the Marvel Universe and makes this milquetoast soap opera with sub-Lost level of CGI effects.Staring at the talent behind the camera and in front of it I have no idea what could have gone so wrong, but I hope rumors of the studio wrestling control from the director are true because this is a blot for all involved.This movie lives and dies by its script, and it's a truly dreadful script.It is a patchwork of bad ideas, grating dialog, action movie clich√©s, unconvincing romance, mishandled fan-service cameos, and downright insulting interpretations of beloved characters.This film has no respect for its source material. This is one of the worst Marvel films yet.It also seems convinced Will.I.Am can do something besides look stupid in a cowboy hat and fumble his ridiculous lines. His ""character"" also borrows his power from a fan-favorite character and doesn't even do it half as well as a movie made five years ago.I never thought an X-Men related movie could be worse than X-Men 3, but here we are.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best  X-men yet,"I went on IMDb right after i saw the movie, expecting great reviews and it only has a 6.9, and i asked my self how is that.i went into the movie with very high expectations, and by the end of the movie the movie lived up to the hype. X-men Wolverine Origins was one of the best movies I've seen in the past couple months. it had every great element a movie should have. Many people are saying it didn't have a good plot, i found the plot quite good, it tied in a lot of loose ends from the other movies. The story really showed who Logan(wolverine) really is.Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber did and amazing acting job in this movie. two thumbs up for both performances. I guess if i had to pick one negative side to this movie is that Ryan Reynolds wasn't in it enough.but overall i give this movie 9/10 and its a must see, if your a X-men fan, also even if you not an X-men fan you still should see it because its just a great action flick to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wolverine was not really good, but not really bad either","If you read the comic of wolverine Origins you will see that the movie flew past it. It missed about 90% of the comic. The comic was really good, it had everything in it, love, hate, war, and much more. But this movie flew passed it all, and i don't know why. But Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and most of the cast had great acting, and some of the action scenes were cool. There was times when the special effects didn't seem right. So i think they should have spent more time on this film, made it based on the comic of ""Wolverine Origins,"" and longer than an hour and thirty minutes. Before i went into the movie i was excited but when i found out it was only an hour and a half i knew it was going to be different.

A Thrilling Adenum To The Exciting Film Set,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the first chapter in the X-Men saga, unites Wolverine with several other legends of the X-Men universe, in an epic revolution that pits the mutants against powerful forces determined to eliminate them.Hugh Jackman reprises the role that made him a superstar, as the fierce fighting machine who possesses amazing healing powers, adamantium claws, and a primal fury known as berserker rage. X-Men Origins: Wolverine stays true to the tone of the X-Men motion picture franchise, continuing the films' balance between spectacle and reality, while heightening the emotions and relationships.The film also introduces a team of mutants, including several whose appearances in the movie series have been long anticipated. Movie audiences will meet Team X, a covert military cadre comprised entirely of mutants. Its members are: Wolverine; his brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), aka Sabretooth, a feral being of unimaginable power; Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), later to be known as Deadpool, a high-tech mercenary skilled at swordplay; Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), an expert tracker and lethal marksman; Wraith (Will.i.am), a teleporter; Fred J. Dukes (Kevin Durand), also known as The Blob, a morbidly obese and super-strong behemoth; and Bradley (Dominic Monaghan), who can manipulate electricity. Leading them is William Stryker (Danny Huston), a figure introduced in X2: X-Men United, but whose origins and motives are now fully explored, for it is Stryker's complex relationship with Wolverine that defines much of Logan's past... and future.

Enjoyable Action Film,"I found this to be an enjoyable action film, with a bit of fantasy. I am not too familiar with these worlds, but I loved Deadpool and Wolverine. Not too sure how this fits in, although Wade Wilson is in the beginning. Hugh Jackman is very good in this role. Liev Schrieber is a good villain. Danny Huston is always engaging in every role. The action, adventure, and fight scenes are good, although a little over the top. This is designed to be an adult film, which is fine unless you expect a kids' comic book movie.

The definition of a great action film,"This origin story deliverers a film full of action, cool action sequences and fun characters. Hugh Jackman reprises the role of the tough Wolverine greatly and really brings to life the excitement of the story. Whilst being a great watch, it didn't have the exact amount of sophistication as the previous X-Men films because they felt like they really focused on the feelings of the characters and how they deal with the hatred against their kind. Even though this film does show how Wolverine goes on an amazing journey it relies mainly on the action, which isn't totally a bad thing but the X-Men films didn't have to mainly focus on the action.

This movie did a great job!,"This is a great movie! I don't care what the X-men hard core people say about it, it's a great movie. It delivers entertainment, and heap loads at that! Movies are made to entertain people, and that's exactly what this movie does, and wow, does this do a great job at it.If you've seen the previous X-men movies, then this will bring Wolverine back full circle, or if you haven't, then you can watch this and go back to the original series and appreciate them more than we did before when it first came around.This installment of the X-men franchise deals with wolverine, and I think it's a great idea to elongate the whole franchise and bring us loads of great action movies. (Like as I've heard the Magneto movie?)All I have to say is that X-men fanatics shouldn't be so upset about this, yes we know you've read EVERY episode, and yes, I know I don't fully understand the whole story, but why does that matter so much? There are so many movies out there that do a worse job at adaptations, and can't even deliver good entertainment at that. (Think Transformers, it sucked at adaptations, but it brought us loads of entertainment ... Michael Bay style, but still... Wolverine is better than that and you know it!)People hated ""The Da Vinci Code"", and I hope Ron Howard learned from that, because not only did it ignore the original pace of the book, but it sucked at being a decent movie as well. X-men might have ignored some parts of the original series, but at least it provided outstanding acting and action, and sometimes that's all that matters in a movie.Please, if you are looking through the reviews to make up your mind about this movie, then please, do yourself a favor, go watch this movie.

Hugh Jackman and Lieb Schrieber do quite well as their superpowered characters, but the rest of the film was a mess.

Pretty good. Not great. Better than X-men 3.,"I saw the midnight showing last night.Yes, the bootlegs been out - but it's missing several FX scenes as well as 20 minutes of story.

Better than X-men 3, but that's not saying much. Liev Schreiber (one of my favorite actors) pulled off Sabretooth nicely, and Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Wade Wilson. Will I Am did surprisingly well. The Blob was pathetic. Gambit was pretty cool, and there are some other cameos that played well.Hugh Jackman's earnestness in Wolverine really helps. He seems to really love being that character.A little disjointed at times (which often happens when you try to cram too many characters into a movie) and it looks like the money was cut off as some of the FX scenes toward the end are pretty weak.I'd give it about a 6.5",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The loss of humanity...,"When the X-Men series first premiered it was at the dawn of the new age of superheroes, and it was something of a revelation. For the first time, we were presented with mutants, heroes that were completely relatable. Instead of watching a campy B Movie, we were transported into an impossible world that seemed entirely plausible. While holding on to a great spirit of fun, the X-Men examined themes deeper than superhero movies; acceptance, identity, compassion, and forgiveness.It's clear from the very beginning that X-Men Origins: Wolverine contains none of that. From the early-America set opening to the special effects overload finale, we are treated to nothing more than skin-deep cheesy pop. Even the cast list confirms the film's empty notions.Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber lead the cast as mutant brothers without a place in the world. As the film rushes forward with little to no room for thought, they are approached by Col. William Stryker to join a top secret team of mutants going around the world on unclear missions. However, it's not long before the massive amount of killing being done becomes too much for our hero and he leaves the team to try and live life as a common man away from it all, which is, of course, impossible. You know where it goes from there.Unfortunately even the ample charms of Mr. Jackman can't save this unadmirable dud. Despite having the makings of a decent plot on their hands, the film dissolves into nothing more than actiony silliness. That would still be somewhat acceptable, if it weren't for the tint it leaves on the source material. Instead of finding ourselves transported back into the thought-provoking wonder world we came to expect from this series, this thoughtless money-maker feels nothing but shallow. And with the recent advances made by films like The Dark knight and Iron Man to turn the superhero genre into a form truly respectable, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a dark spot in the repertoire. Do yourself a favor: skip this one and stick to the great original series. 3/10 stars, and that's a compliment.Jay Addison",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If it was made in the 80s it would be considered a cheesy, cult classic","The origin story of Logan and events prior to the original 'X-Men' trilogy.Personally I do not dislike it as much as many other reviewers, but it has problems.I think the premise is fine, as there has always been intrigue about the missing pieces of Logan's memory. The opening scene kicks it off in a promising way. There are some satisfying moments that make sense for his journey and there is also one reasonably good twist in the tale.I like the character played by Liev Schreiber, mainly due to his performance and the dynamic he has with Hugh Jackman. I do not particularly care this is somewhat of a reboot of a character from the first 'X Men' movie, as it is a more interesting portrayal.Unfortunately, many creative decisions in the movie feel heavily geared towards the action spectacle more than the characters and this is where it suffers. Good ideas such as the scenes in Africa, that could have explored important themes, prioritise superpowers over decent character work. Likewise many other scenes where the focus is mainly effects-driven violence.Some parts are incredibly predictable and so much so you can picture exactly how they are going to look, sound, and play out due to the visuals and physical performance employed.It uses some of the cheesiest clich√©s. The eye-rolling moment when two characters fight each other just for sheer spectacle and then suddenly stop and become friends. Plus my personal bugbear: slow motion strutting. One even has the obligatory explosion in the background.Some critics said an action-thriller focussed on Logan does not work because he cannot die. Technically they have a point, but it is not a showstopper for me. I was a child of the 80s and enjoyed (for what they were) macho action movies with the likes of Arnie, Sly Stallone or Van Damme as muscle-bound, virtually indestructible leads who would smash the boundaries of plausibility as they sought revenge against moustache twirling baddies. This film has that basic feel.I have more of a gripe with how it functions as a superhero movie. With the exception of one character, the powers on display are virtually all centred around violent confrontation, mainly due to the characters involved. I much prefer movies that show powers being used for more than just slashing, stabbing, martial arts and explosions. In this sense, the variety offered by characters like Dr Xavier, Erik Lensherr, Jean Grey, and Ororo Munroe are badly missed.Jackman does a lot of screaming and muscle tensing with his claws out, but in between he show's talent by making the best out of the material.I will stretch to a 5.5/10 for this one because Jackman and Schreiber are both worth watching and when it is bad, it is so bad that it entertains.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty bad and the director sucks.,"This 4th film in the X-Men franchise should of been pretty good, the mistakes with the 3rd film are understandable considering the change of directors and writers.But the studio had a chance to take a fresh stab at it with a new crew for Wolverine's movie, the problem is that fox got a bad director and writers on this movie and the final product is nothing less of awful.The film has a cast that isn't really great but none of the actors are bad actors, Hugh Jackman has been fine as the main character before and the supporting players are all decent enough actors for a summer blockbuster but the problem isn't really the acting.But the writing of the characters and what the actors have to do with them, the cheesy moments and bad dialog that they have to say must of been hard for the actors and there is few really good scenes in the movie.The movie pretty much fails with it's opening and ending, the only decent thing about the film is Sabertooth and perhaps getting to see some other characters.But the really fault with this film isn't exactly the story itself or the producers, but I want to put the blame on director Gavin Hood who has pretty much no experience to make a high level blockbuster.It was a risk by the studio to hire him and sometimes that works, and it isn't like because he made this bad movie that he is going to make nothing but bad movies.David Fincher made alien 3, then went on to make nothing but good movies after that terrible film, perhaps Gavin just wasn't given enough to work with on Wolverine.The movie is poorly shot, edited and paced, the tone is wrong and it just isn't a very well made film from a technical or artistic standpoint but it also fails at being fun.A movie dosen't have to be well made to be enjoyable, it could have good special effects and action scenes to keep you enjoying the film and make it worth the time and money.Wolverine happens to be boring and terrible as a action film, every time something good is happening it ends up being pretty lame and the fights themselves are not very memorable or special.Remember the liberty island fights in x-men?Or the great night crawler whitehouse scene in x2?Nothing like that here, just a lot of cheap looking images and bad direction, save your money and time and just don't see this movie.Wolverine, I wish I could give you the claw middle finger.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Fair X-Men Prequel,Anyone who has seen any of the X-Men Films should enjoy watching this one. However die hard fans of certain characters (such as myself) might be disappointed by the various changes in the character biographies. The movie suffers a bit from the loss of action as most of the movie is about the biography of Wolverine and the mutants he called friends and lovers prior to suffering his memory loss. The only other drawback to the movie being a prequel is knowing which characters will survive. This adds to the loss of suspense during the action.

Talk about a Shaggy Dog story...,"Sharp claws, cheep cigars, cheesy one liners? Have I seen this movie before? Thought so! Its round four for the X-Men and with the mutant franchise over it's about time we check the personal files on our protagonists with ""X-Men Origins"" This origin story tells the tale of Wolverine, the most prominent of the X-Men, and also the one that headlines all three of the previous film. Which brings up the films biggest flaw. Relevance. The problem is that Wolverine is a character that, in layman's terms had been done to death. A fourth film in which he headlines is abnoxsiouse, repetitive and insanely dull. The only pleasure fans will get is from the vast array of new characters most interesting of which is the criminally underused Dead pool (Ryan Reynolds). Is it an awful movie? Not really. The phrase below par seems adequate here. Its feels rushed, undercooked yet overblown at the same time. The action scenes are admirable at best blending real backgrounds with some of the ugliest CGI I've ever laid my eves upo¬¨n. The gruff, steel-clawed Marvel superhero Wolverine strikes out on his own in this X-Men spin-off starring series regular Hugh Jackman. The film is set up as an origin tale for the character, and will find him sharing the screen with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), John Wraith (will.i.am), Victor Creed/Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber), and Col. William Stryker (Danny Huston). Academy Award-winning director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) films a screenplay penned by Troy scribe David Benioff. Daniel Henney and Lost's Dominic Monaghan round out the supporting cast.What works for the movie are twofold, it's simple structure is fool proof. There isn't a second where you'll get lost and it acts as an idiots guide to the series, obviously causing a problem for readers of the X-men comics. It's insanely undemanding leaving skipping key events and undermining characters that should play a pivotal role. None of which is going to matter to the passing movie goer. The acting is a step up for the series with bright spark Danny Huston taking over from Brian Cox as William Stryker. Liev Schreiber, a personal favourite of mine, plays Sabretooth with a veracious and cold nature and is only ever stumbles when he is stricken with poor dialogue. Here is where the film falls flat on its face, granted the series is well known for its campy dialogue - (anyone remember the Juggernaut) - here the dialogue is so underwritten and textbook that its almost uncomfortable to watch each character stagger over every line they deliver.It's a shame really, if anyone remembers director Gavin Hood's previous work (Rendition, Tsotsi) then you'll know he is capable of great things. With this it doesn't show. His direction is lost in a haze of special effects and poorly choreographed fight sequences. Never before have I wanted Bryan Singer to get behind the wheel. The film runs at approximately 107 minutes, which is at best 20 minutes too long. Granted this movie is aimed more at the younger children than it is at me. Maybe I'm just too old for this, but if old man Logan were watching this I'm pretty sure he'd have a thing or two to say. Which brings up the concluding point, this is a film designed to repel fans boys. It placates to those in the need for a mindless actioner without any complex narrative, if you've never picked up a comic in your life, by all means go have fun. The rest of us will have to wait until next time to get the origin story we deserve.Verdict: At best Wolverine is undemanding, placating to an audience too young to appreciate the comics it's based upon. The older audiences will only turn their nose at the poor fight choreography, drastically drab visuals and a story so effortless it for shames that of its video game counterpart. This clunky prequel doesn't even make an effort to maintain a semblance of balance between story and spectacle, characters and special effects. For my overall rating I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine an unenthusiastic 2/5.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What can I say, Jackman owns the character in it's entirety and the introduction of Reynold's as Deadpool made it all the more worth it despite some drastically minute screen time. The only major flaw, because the acting wasn't all that great (I never expected it to be) was casting Taylor Kitsch as Remy LaBeau/Gambit. I find it hard to believe that he pulled off the task of bringing Jim Le and Chris Claremont's version to life, especially since it was the first time the character graced the big screen.

No New Ground Broken for SuperHeroes,"In the middle of watching X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, I had this feeling like I'd seen it before. It was the 10:15am showing on opening day, so that wasn't right. But since the first X-MEN installment some 10 years ago, there have been quite a number of films in the superhero genre. Before that first X-MEN, it was pretty difficult to get it right; up until then, I wasn't sure anyone except director Richard Donner (SUPERMAN) had a clue what makes a hero super, or what makes a movie about that hero a good one.These days, I'd say that Hollywood's got it down cold. They can crank these superhero flicks out with quite a bit of money and not a lot of thought. It's a science. Which is kind of how it felt to watch WOLVERINE. Steely cold science. Impressive at times, sure, but not a surprise. Thrill ride? Sort of. Maybe more like building the roller coaster than riding it.Don't get me wrong, everything looked great. The score was another solid one from Harry Gregson-Williams. The sound design was crisp and in-your-face, like it should be with a modern action film. Plus, we actually had some acting from, you know, actors (I'm talking specifically about Liev Schreiber - and now I like him as an action guy too). There were even a couple of (small) surprises along the way. It was by no means unpleasant. It just wasn't SPIDER-MAN 2. Actually it reminded me at times of watching ""Heroes"" on TV. But with more money on the screen. Lots more.We're now at a point where the whole superhero movie genre has laid out one big formula for itself. Going beyond that for the screenwriters and directors doing new superhero movies is going to be a tough nut to crack. DARK KNIGHT showed us it was possible (although I'm not admitting it was entirely a break from formula as some have claimed - just that it did a better job at enhancing said formula). WOLVERINE does not, however, move us beyond what's already been done and said about heroes. It's just ""this year's model"".I still had fun. I didn't feel cheated. But another one like this, and maybe I will. Six out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bring back Bryan Singer,"This movie fails in the way other film adaptation of comic book heroes. The producers and the director has no clue as to what makes the characters and the actions work, and they just cut and paste few scenes and plots they liked skimming through past issues of the comic franchise. And they always put in tons of CG action to compensate for the lack of convincing story line.This didn't happen in the first two X men movie. Director Bryan Singer did a masterful job of telling an original story that didn't mess up the original plot or the characters of X-men, which attests to his talent as a story teller and a visual artist. His story telling was compelling, but none of that depth is seen on this movie. Maybe they don't care. They just want to make quick bucks.

Don't be so hard on the story... it's an action movie for god sake!,"I am finding this movie very entertaining, and I can't understand why the other ""reviewers"" don't feel the same.Firstly, this is an action movie, so what should we expect from the movie? We are going to expect action, and what did this movie gave us? Entertaining action! The storyline is always important in a movie, but we can't forget the genre in this movie, and it is the genre who decides what we are going to expect from that movie.But this movie has a storyline that actually works. The story line can't be so bad that we forget what kind of movie it is!? I absolutely do not think so. The storyline makes suddenly change-twists sometimes because it all is about Logan lose his look at the reality and how he lose the things that is most important to him, because of that he became the cruel killer he is ""today"".A movie can be good in many ways, one of them is when a movie have a great storyline. Another way is when a movie makes you laugh all the time. This movie entertains you with action, but thats not all the movie gives us. The actor (Hugh Jackman) is acting very good in this movie, and that is one of the most important things in a movie, specially in a Drama when the storyline is all that the movie have to entertain the audience.To all the storyline-freaks, believe it or not but I will give this movie a nine because of the special effects and action scenes that I enjoyed, the good acting from Hugh Jackman and a story that I think fits pretty good with the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good story, bad execution!","Origins is definitely a movie with quite alot of easily avoidable mistakes that shouldn'thave made ita way into the final cut, but in the end, its also a quite satisfying action movie that never gets boring, just dumb. So all in all you shouldnt watch it with the idea that this movie has to make sense, I would rather say that you should watch it like you would have watched the fast & furious movies where you sit down expecting crazy action and nothing more.(7/10) Not the best X-Men movie at all, but not the worst either!!Definitely give it a watch if you love the the character of Wolverine like i do!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great film, with great action sequences but lacks some character development","I saw this movie midnight opening and don't regret it at all. I can see why some people do not like this movie but from my perspective, i enjoyed it very much. Let me give my explanation without giving any spoilers....The people who didn't like this movie were probably die hard fans of the old comics with Deadpool, Agent Zero, and many of the other ""sub"" characters. I am a big fan of X-Men and the franchise but not a die hard comic-con type fan, nor have i read the comics so i enjoyed this movie based on the action sequences and explanation of Wolverine's past which leads up to the X-Men series. Hugh Jackman was great as usual, and the explanation about his Weapon X transformation and relationship with all the other characters is very clear. Only problem i had with this movie was that it was about 50% Wolverine(obviously hence the title which is stupid for people to complain about that) 20% Sabertooth, 20% William Stryker and 10% every other character combined.I think the trailer gave snippets of every character, leaving the audience to believe OMG Gambit, The Blob, even Cyclops are in the movie!!! and they are in it for about 5-10 minutes and left some people disappointed. I was very hyped to see Gambit and Deadpool in the movie but their screen time was extremely limited. All in all, i thought it was a good movie, mostly because Hugh Jackman pulls off Wolverine flawlessly and the action sequences were better than any other movie i have seen in a while. So i recommend this to anyone who isn't looking for The Dark Knight type movie but more of a wildly action epic with a great explanation of Wolverines characters past",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Analysis Based Rating,"10 Stars: 2 Based on Movie Genre, 2 Based on World of the Story, 2 Based on Acting, 2 Based on Story, 2 Based on Filming. We add math to subtract the fun.Genre: How does this movie rank compared to action movies. Well the fact is it was no Die Hard, so 2 stars is out the window. The action is constant, but repetitive. (If you jump at the last moment things work out.) I think if I was going to judge the battles on an artistic composition scale they'd do well, but all and all the movie only gets 1 star from me as an action movie.World: So how does this stick to the comics. Within reason I think this was admirable and gratuitous. Wolverine vs. Sabertooth basically saves the movie while the added element of Silver Fox and Deadpool don't hurt. What hurts the movie is adding characters poorly and for no reason. Why are these people in the movie? Blob and Wraith are important as members of Stryker's task force, but they are worthless additions when they re-appear. GAMBIT HAS NO POINT IN THIS MOVIE!!!. The time wasted in New Orleans should have been used on the original task force. Again they only got it half right, 1 star.Acting: So in action we will ignore all stupid scream at the camera moments. I don't think anyone's acting was bad, but I was a bit bothered by some casting choices. Gambit should have sounded Cajun and Stryker should have looked a lot more like Agamemnon from Troy.Story: Pre-Title... Howlett appears to be a good father but the relationship is glazed over and rather then focus on the ORIGIN we rush right to Wolverine killing his biological father. The credits were brilliant and were my favorite part of the whole movie. The task force was glazed over I don't think the writers cared about us understanding the plot points. They just hit them and moved on. Wolverine + Silverfox was a nice touch and a good nod to Wolverine's actual time in British Columbia. The story moves logically and inefficiently along following Wolverine as he tracks down Stryker and saves the day. Just for a bit of chronological fun. Xavier must be pretty old when he meets Magneto because he was walking at three mile island. 1.5 Stars.Filming: So this was filmed in an acceptable way but reminded me too heavily of Michael (can't direct) Bay. Yay! It sploded! 1.5 Stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie was so depressingly bad that.........,"Having read every X-Men comic, being a huge Wolverine and Gambit fan, and after enjoying the first 3 X-Men movies immensely, I have to say that this movie was so depressingly bad that I may go to Gavin Hood (the director) and tell him to never produce a film again and stick to the special effects, because it seems to me that that is what this movie was all about, the fluff and sugar coating. NO STRUCTURE WHATSOEVER! I recommend this movie to two types of audiences, those under 13, and to all of those over grown men who are still living in their mother's basements.Where or where is Christopher Nolan when you need him. The concept of this movie had so much potential.Please excuse me as I go jump off a cliff. That is, and future X-men movie cliff.:(",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I wish dead pool could been in this a tad longer, but then again, this is wolverine's origin movie, not dead pool the movie.and the new designs for the characters is actually to me pretty cool.

"Decent, just bad story","Just finished watching this while I'm going through watching all of the X-Men movies. This isn't terrible, in fact, it's less dated than most of the other ones. You can tell that it came out post-Iron Man compared to all of the previous that came out pre-Iron Man. However, the story is quite confusing and very boring. I think I can see where they were aiming, they just didn't hit the mark quite right. Worth a watch as it's fun to watch, but just don't expect it to have a super compelling story. Definitely just made so that Wolverine could have a stand-alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fine as an action flick, not as much as an origin story.","Since I loved the first two X-Men movies, I was rather disappointed with the third one. My expectations weren't that high after hearing the harsh reception X-Men: Wolverine had got, so maybe that's why I haven't been so hard on it.I actually enjoyed it a little more than The Last Stand which is kind of odd, because Wolverine is my favorite X-Man and he has an awesome origin story which sadly isn't really that well handled in here.There are some crucial things wrong which makes this less of an origin story and more like a handful of ideas never really fleshed out to its full potential. The opening scene establishes the brotherhood of Logan and Victor, but that is abandoned and only visited in the way we already know Logan. What origin story?Logan gets into some relationships which are important to his persona, but that aspect isn't used the way it should in AN ORIGIN STORY! You don't see him developing his well known self after being affected by episodes in his life, the writers just set up a lot of things and later paying them off in not very effective ways.I didn't find X-Men Origins: Wolverine insufferable as a movie, even though I know how many reviewers with more expieriance than me have stated the opposite, but I was sufficiently entertained by some of the performances like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston and that was a better waste of time than the mostly hollow performances from The Last Stand.All in all, as an origin story it falls flat, but as an action flick it's okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Meh,"My excitement slowly waned as the movie went on. Where was the tension? The mystery? Liev Schrieber was fantastic as Vincent/Sabertooth, Hugh Jackman was his usual good as Wolverine, but the rest of the characters just didn't seem to develop. I felt no connection to any of the mutants, nor could i muster much of an impulse to root for anyone's success. The tension between the members of Stryler's team made no sense. A little back-story to that would have been nice. I would have loved to have seen Gambit as a more integral part of the plot. He is, by far, my favorite mutant. Stryker was a disappointment. Perhaps it is hard to follow where Brian Cox has already trod? Ryan Reynolds was wasted on Deadpool. Why use such a strong and recognizable actor in such a minor roll? Yeah, it was fun, had a few chuckles. But, in the end, it was just another action movie that fails to live up to its trailer.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Love the start, but weak plot","The back story of X-Men's Wolverine and his origin with his mutant brother, Sabretooth. Stars Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber.The start is excellent but generally the plot & script are not that credible or great. It's far-fetched with some unbelievable mutant characters.

Poorly written and directed... the end of a character???,"Sad and very disappointed... thats how I got out of the teather. Lots of unused character and above all poor use of those with at least a line. The plot is weak, at least, and although I liked the actors for the parts, mot of them I have to admit, the characters where poorly interpreted. People, I'm not a hardcore fan but the fact that GAMBIT didn't said a single word in french or at least had a tone, well it really sucked. No explicit violence which is good for the families and characters for the families not WOLVERINE, we should have to see guts and blood all around.Sorry, but I'm very disappointed, they losed a perfect opportunity to make a master piece and box office hit.If you don't care anything of the things above go watch it and you might enjoy it.Best regards.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
have been waiting for something like this for ages,"I've been spending months sitting through hour after hour of film that tried so hard and achieved so little...or movies that tried hard not to try hard and ending up looking like crap...or movies where at the end I would say to myself ""I want those two hours of my life back"" (or in the case of Watchmen i want the 3 hours back!!!) Now don't get me wrong...Wolverine is not the greatest movie ever made...not even close...but its something for the popcorn eaters amongst us who look for an adventure...an escape..a fantasy.Movies don't have to be something that changes the world...and this one certainly doesn't. But seriously, if you're looking for a movie to make you question the goodness of humanity or any other truly important life shattering revelation are you really expecting to find it watching Wolverine?! This movie has something for most people...things that go kaboom for the guys...Hugh with his shirt of for the girls...a game of ""pick the Aussie actor in the background"" for us Australians...This was a good movie...full stop.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sporadically Good,"Wolverine certainly starts strong with an incredible opening credits sequence to rival that of Watchmen and we learn the sordid past between Sabretooth and Wolverine in a very short space of time without it feeling rushed.I must say, for the most part, the first half of the movie is pretty good, we see the morals Logan holds and Jackman portrays this very well, along with all the emotional angst in his life which is incredibly believable the whole way through. However lackluster performances from the other mutants that seem randomly thrown in detract from this in a major way. I do like how names and places aren't rubbed in the audience's face saying ""Look how many mutants are in this movie!!"" but they may as well have.Until the halfway mark, things are very well done, it's more story- driven than effects driven which makes for a competent film. About the point where Gambit is introduced is where it all goes to pot. Story elements are thrown pointlessly in left, right and center, special effects are throw in for the sake of having them (with some very, very dodgy, obviously green screen moments), the climax is a complete flop and it all takes, dare I say, the believability away from the movie.And I think that's my main point. The story was believable because Hugh Jackman does do an incredible job and you really feel for his character and his very sad past. But even his acting skills cannot save the sordid mess that was hastily pasted on top.Bottom line: Wolverine is an okay film. Not amazing but not horrific. It's better than X-men 3, but it turns into a very similar film near the end which nearly ruined everything good it had going for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Mutant Mess,"Greetings again from the darkness. While a logical attempt to capitalize on the highly entertaining and profitable X Men series, this prequel just doesn't have much to offer other than a couple of fun fight scenes.Hugh Jackman is in full glory and seems to be having fun playing Logan/Wolverine, but his ""brother"" Liev Schreiber is totally miscast and would have been better as Stryker ... though Danny Huston handles it just fine. Will i am, Tayor Kitsch (as Gambit) and Ryan Reynolds provide the only real characters of interest outside of the shiny the apparatus for wolverine.I guess it is a credit to the film series that we have come to expect more. Though it will be fine with true fans, this won't bring in many new ones.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not that bad, not that good either...","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not a bad film, that's a fact. I actually quite liked it. I mean, it has a decent story-line and some pretty cool action-packed sequences. The only big thing I did not like about this film is the character development for some of the characters. Of course this is a film about Wolverine and all that... but some of the supporting actors just come and go, like nothing ever happened.Hugh Jackman does, as usual, well as the emotionally damaged Logan and you really believe that the character has gone through much pain. The supporting actors also do well: Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed is not as good and by that I mean he went sometimes a little over the top.I do understand that many don't like this film, I really do. I have seen the film more than twice and I always feel the same about it. It's kind of like my opinion for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

"Go see if if you have a little extra cash, but don't spend your last 7 dollars on it.","I personally went into this movie not expecting something as good as the first two X-Men films, but I had high hopes for a decent film, and had heard a lot of good things about it from my friends. Many of my friends said it was awesome, they wanted to see it twice, etc. etc., so i figured, even if it's just flashy special effects it must be worth seeing.However, while I don't regret seeing it, I must say it did not even meet the expectations I had for it.It was far from being a horrible film. It was still a fun movie to watch, as it is part of the X-Men world, the character of Wolverine is still an interesting character and well acted as always by Hugh Jackman, and some parts of the dialog and some of the action was well done, but that is also partly the main problem of the movie: the good parts are scattered, rather than continuous throughout the movie.Most of the film's plot seemed to be put together very quickly and not very carefully. The plot seemed to move way too fast, without really develop anything properly, and the filmmakers did not get everything they could out of each scene of the movie. There is very little suspense or build-up to anything. Some of the little things in the film that should be paid more attention to, like Wolverine's claws for example, are not really presented in the movie with the care and creativity that they should be, and also many parts of the movie were not taken seriously. Several of the scenes in the film were farcical, which can be a good form of comedic relief, but with a character and plot-line as dark as wolverine and his past, it seemed a little ridiculous.This film also seemed to be used as a vehicle to throw other x-men characters onto the screen, perhaps just so that they could say they did. Most of these characters are given very little screen time and barely developed at all, and should either have been justified with a bigger part in the movie, or left out entirely.The action in the film was half a strong point and half another weakness. Some of the fight scenes were exciting and fun to watch, but some of the stunts were somewhat cheesy, and most of the action scenes could have been built up a little better. Still, the action scenes were pretty much what most of the movie-goers went to the film for, and they did make the film watchable at least.As far as dialog, the film contained both good dialog points and catchy one-liners as well as many parts where the dialog was dull...they could have definitely put a little more time into writing the script of the film but again it wasn't horrible. Just not nearly as good as the first two X-Men films.All in all, I gave the film six stars for being enjoyable and a decent popcorn flick, but Wolverine is a very deep, very dark character that deserved a more well-thought out (not to mention grittier) script and a much more careful and thorough director. I would say go ahead and see it in the theater if you have a little extra cash but don't spend your last 7 dollars on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable action but overall an uninspired and convoluted adaptation, sequel, prequel or whatever it wants to be.","Based on ""Wolverine,"" it's hard to get excited about the prospect. The film exhibits all the overly familiar hallmarks of the 21st-century comic book movie: an inflated sense of its own importance, turgid plotting and action sequences designed to showcase lavish CGI effects.In many ways, it was the first ""X-Men,"" back in 2000, that set the tone. On the one hand, director Bryan Singer embedded an earnest allegory about prejudice and minority rights; on the other, it was an FX geek's wet dream. Each mutant came with her or his own gimmick: One could shape shift; another could levitate; yet another had a bad case of wind.The mutants all shared the same nasty temper, but Logan/Wolverine (Jackman) had the shortest fuse -- and the silliest haircut, a '50s duck-tail with ferocious rockabilly sideburns. Predictably enough, ""Origins"" devotes more time to exploring the roots of his anger issues than his hair, but it doesn't worry about where his most distinctive genetic features might have come from: the retractable claws that spring from his knuckles when he's irked and his invulnerability to anything short of decapitation.In ""Wolverine,"" Logan has lost his taste for war in Vietnam after more than a century as a fighting man (or mutant) and finally walks away in disgust from the elite mutant unit put together by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston). But his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) has other ideas and knows how to get Wolverine to embrace his true, animalistic, nature.Borrowing wholesale from ""The Incredible Hulk,"" with Schreiber fairly effective in the Abomination part, ""Wolverine"" struggles to establish an identity of its own. The two brothers charge at each other like medieval knights jousting, and Victor -- also known as Sabretooth -- affects a dog-like, four-legged bound. But no matter how often he tries it, director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") never works out how to make a fight between indestructible foes tense or exciting.That's the trouble with CG-enhanced action: What you gain in spectacle, you lose in impact. Filmmakers today can engineer destruction on a scale that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago, but it's all so much collateral damage. It's rare, these days, for an American action movie to impart any genuine sense of pain or hurt or loss. Too much Wow, not enough Ow! In fairness, there are fleeting moments in ""Wolverine"" where we do feel Logan's emotional anguish. But they're only as a prelude to his anger, which is the only quality an audience is likely to find interesting about him.Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this ""Wolverine"" movie does just enough to keep the ""X-Men"" franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A lot of fun,"I enjoyed the three X-Men movies, but I still went into this one with moderate expectations, based on the trailers and reviews I'd read. I knew it was going to be mostly a special-effects action extravaganza, and it was. But I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would. I wanted fun and that's what I got. I found it to be pretty much along the same lines as the X-Men movies. Jackman was great as Wolverine, as always. Liev was incredible as Sabretooth. Taylor Kitch impressed me as Gambit, as I had not thought much of him in a previous film I'd seen him in. The rest of the cast was good, but not in a stand-out way.Overall, if you expect a fun, special-effects and explosions-laden film, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you liked the previous X-Men films, then you should know what to expect from this one. If you didn't like them, you should probably stay away.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Second... Physics? But lets leave that as characters have ""super-powers."" Third it bends X-Men over a barrel and violates it ways that any civilised society would reintroduce the death penalty to adequately punish.However the most important complaint is: its lame. Completely and totally unbelievable, ridiculous and lame. It actually got to the point where I didn't like Wolverine anymore (at least this incarnation), not to mention all the other characters. It had more action movie clich√©s than Schwarzenneger's Last Action Hero which tried to put as many as possible in so it could satire them.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine - When Logan Goes Rogue,"Alright, forget about those nice little superhero stories where they save the world in spandex. Here, Wolverine is off the leash, no holds barred. The guy's a wild beast with adamantium claws, and he's had enough of people trying to pull his strings. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. You can tell he's melted into the role like butter in a hot pan. His fight scenes aren't just some playful punches-they're pure, savage carnage.Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth? That's the big win here. The dude's as terrifying as your neighbor who steals your mail, but with a lot more violence. He nails it as a brutal, merciless force out to rip Wolverine apart. But you can tell there's more to their rivalry-it's more of a messed-up family drama than anything else, giving the film a depth you wouldn't expect from a flick where half the dialogue is grunts and growls.And action? Oh, you're more than covered. Explosions, chases, epic brawls-it's non-stop mayhem. It hits hard and fast, leaving you breathless. There are moments where you wonder how the editing room didn't just blow up from the overload. Sure, a few effects might look a little cheap here and there, but hey, they had to budget for all that beer money for the stunt team, right?Now, here's where it stumbles a bit. The story's alright, but it's missing that sharp edge. It feels like they took the original comics and threw them into a blender, hoping for a new recipe. You've got moments where you're scratching your head, like ""But... why?"" Wolverine's making some odd choices, characters pop up out of nowhere, and the villain? Well, he's got about as much charisma as a houseplant.But, despite the rough edges, the movie's still a visual blast. You're not here for deep storytelling-you're here to watch Wolverine tear things up, and that's exactly what you get. It's brutal, it's fun, and by the end, you'll want your own set of claws. So if you're looking for emotional depth, move along. But if you're here for the fights and explosions, you're in the right place.X-Men Origins: Wolverine is like a double cheeseburger. You know it's not gourmet, you know it's over the top, but man, you're gonna love it anyway. Logan's here to smash things up, and that's all we need from him.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a nice origins of one of the most beloved characters of superheroes world,"""X-Men the origins: Wolverine"" is simply a nice movie. Nothing special, a nice movie about the origins of one of the most beloved characters in the world of superheroes. Wolverine in this movie is told for what he is, that is a hero and not a villain, one who wants to do the right thing. In this film is shown, in my opinion, in a great way the superpower of Wolverine, his claws, all still in not even adolescence. He and his brother, Victor, in this film side with their country at war using their own abilities, as Victor also has powers. After the war, they are recruited into a team of mutants led by Stryker, the antagonist of this film who has convinced me in part, I have sometimes glimpsed a little indecision and repetition in some events. In fact, as already mentioned, this is not a perfect film. It has its strengths, but also weaknesses. After the death of Silver Fox carried by Sabretooth, Wolverine wants revenge and to do so he allies with Stryker, who implants in his body the so-called adamantio, the strength of Logan. From here, I think, the real Logan started. In my opinion the film's strengths are a compelling plot, the short duration that never bored me and the new characters introduced into the X-Men world, like Wade Wilson, that is Deadpool. In addition, the direction by Gavin Hood and the editing of the film are of good quality. I liked the love story between Logan and Silver Fox and loved the twist in the final stages of the film. I was not satisfied with some action scenes or a few lines too much, an obviously fluctuating CGI and special effects a bit banal and quite backward. The final fight satisfied me and the end of the film made me understand a lot about Wolverine that was then shown in the subsequent films of the timeline and its weak point.A good film that I would love to see again..

Pretty good...,"X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINEI am not a huge fan of the X-Men films... I do like them, but I think they could have been better.But this is a good film... this is the second time I have seen it now and I still really enjoyed it.Wolverine is such a cool character... he has an attitude about him that plays well on screen.The film is about the life of Wolverine before he joined the X-Men.You see him as a child and when he grows up. The rivalries and fights he gets in with a lot of people are good.The effects are good and the fighting scenes are impressive.There was a dodgy copy of this film going about when it first went into the cinema. It showed the film with the effects not finished.I only saw a little bit of it and it was weird seeing him jump around with wires attached... and seeing him slash things without any claws.It is so much better seeing the whole film completed.Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine. He does play the part well... It was good to see his character when he was young.Liev Schreiber plays his brother who has a similar power to Wolverines, but not quite the same.It also has got Ryan Reynolds in and Will I Am... It is quite funny really, because when Will I Am speaks in the movie, he sounds like he is doing a bad Mr. T impression. Haha!I have never read the comics so didn't know the background of Wolverines character... it was good to see how the blades got inside of him.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very enjoyable, and I would like to see the Origins of some of the other X-Men characters.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Some good special effects, not a very good story line but worth a watch with all those action stunts","I just watched the movie and it did look good to me. There was not a great punch in the story. In fact it didn't seem very original to me.The action stunts were quite good. I enjoyed watching them. Hugh Jackman looked perfect in the Role of Logan/Jimmy/Wolverine. His character is one that has immense strength and even before the transformation, his body looks so good that it doesn't make the viewer hard to believe that he can knock down several men on his own accord.The character of Victor played by Liev Screiber was commendable. He did seem to have a monster hidden in him which thirsted for blood. His evil desire to kill people didn't seem completely unreasonable.Colonel Stryker played by Danny Huston is another well played character. He seems intrigued by the mutations and then he does manifest an evil look right from the beginning. His expressions are always a mixture of good and bad and the viewer doubts his intentions from the beginning. This doesn't leave the audience surprised when they discover the truth about all the weapons he's creating.The special team that works with Colonel Stryker looked quite good to me.

what a mutant,"this film was one of the best x-men movies i had ever seen. the film really went into detail about wolverine's life. i had no idea that sabretooth was wolverines brother. until this film, i didn't know a lot of things about wolverine. i was angry about the negative reviews but i also agreed that the x-men trilogy along with this movie, were masterpieces. the action in the wolverine movie was amazing. all the stunts, explosions and fighting in the film were outstanding. i hear that they are beginning to use x-men origins on certain characters. the next character i hear is magneto. if you liked hugh jackman in the other x-men films than you will surely love him in x-men origins wolverine. this movie should easily be nominated for an Oscar. can't wait for the next x-men film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The tale worth telling, executed in a mild fashion","X-Men Origins: Wolverine explores what led Logan to the events of the original X-Men trilogy, with the story not always feeling tonally correct and making some wild decisions to favour the plot rather than fans of the comics.Hugh Jackman is no surprise as a great lead, able to play as Logan without even trying at this point. Everyone else are pretty good too, mostly able to be grounded but not too serious in an overall not-so-serious movie, especially Liev Schreiber as Victor. In the larger franchise puzzle, the film aligns very well with what the previous films establish, aside from Victor seemingly not recognising who Logan is in the events of ""X-Men (2000)"".This film is quick, really quick, with some points in the story feeling like they skipped being completely resolved in order to get to the next scene as quickly as possible, which works in some cases but more often feels like a cheap shortcut. Moreover, it flip-flops between fun and serious tones, but not always in a perfect fashion, with some moments better than others. The special effects range from really good to very iffy, and especially near the final fight of the film. Without giving too much away, fans of Deadpool will be very confused and some even disappointed, with the character so sidelined and nerfed he could've given James Marsden's Cyclops a run for his money. And Gambit felt like a fun inclusion yet in hindsight, wasted potential.Overall, this film is able to offer enough fun for many people to find entertaining, yet misses many marks to be that little bit better. It could have been more, but it's fine as it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A comic inspired let down,"Hollywood once again has bit its teeth down into something that could have been exceptional, but the horrible casting and the less than par writing leaves you with a nasty taste in your mouth. I'm a moderate collector of vintage silver/bronze age comics and i have to tell you that the casting for this movie would insult any comic reader, or anybody who has seen the cartoon. Deadpool is played by Ryan Reynolds, no offense Ryan your a funny guy but for god's sake if that doesn't give you an indication of the horrible casting i don't know what will. Sabretooth was slightly less disappointing even though he doesn't have his long lion's mane haircut, but Liev Schreiber brought some decent acting to the table. Hugh Jackman in my personal opinion was most certainly not the right man to play wolverine and his acting isn't exactly spot on at times. He seems too much like a pretty boy trying to play Rambo. The movie itself makes me sigh. I was most disappointed because almost every climax and major action sequence in the film the outcome can be predicted. Thank you 20th century fox for creating yet another piece of comic inspired trash, you would think they would have learned from Warner Brothers. Go do yourself a favor and rent the dark night or go see watchmen instead...",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

is this rating a joke?,"This movie was pretty awful with the exception of a few moments from Jackman and Reynolds in the opening sequence. Not as terrible as Daredevil but the worst of the series without a doubt. The origin story seems lame and kinda screwed up and I'm not really sure how close to the actual comic origin it is. not that it matters much what is on screen is silly. And the bad performances are just as bad as the lame charachterizations and ridiculous dialogue. take for instance Jackman's terrible love interest, the blob, Wil.i.am is this a joke and the much wasted character of Gambit which is lamely portrayed but some decent looking morn with a fluttering cajun accident.

Good and bad,"Wolverine is a name for epicness in sci-fi and fantasy movies, he is just an icon. If I didn't know that I would think this film represents someone else.Cliche scenes from the beginning to the end. Terrible fights, romantic moments, calming, rushing, very unrealistic moments and scenes. Predictable denouement. Some very disgusting moments with the character of Wade Wilson, who deserved much better and honestly, I think he created Deadpool just to revenge on the producers with what they did with his character.

"Not X-Men's Proudest Moment, Not Their Worst","After the massively disappointing (though box office success) X-Men: The Last Stand, Fox needed something to improve their franchise name. So they turned to the fan favorite hero who also happened to have just been featured in the massive Marvel crossover House of M and even had his own series, Wolverine. Logan was the center of the last three movies so they logically assumed a movie of his own would be just as successful. They thought wrong.X-Men and X2 were successful because they were intelligent and well made stories. Wolverine did have a major part in the stories, but he wasn't the only one. The Last Stand was over packed with characters and story so that no one, not even Wolverine, had a decent character arc. And honestly, he was only featured because most of the other main cast were killed off or unceremoniously pushed to the side. Now in the comics, Logan has had a lot of success in individual series. But the movie contained none of what made those comics good.The story is an abbreviated version of Logan's early life through Weapon X. Problem is, each and every phase of his life is so incredibly interesting that each could warrant a film of their own. Origins is, in my opinion, one of the best stories Marvel's ever put out and on equal level of DC's Batman: Year One. Here, it's paraphrased in the first five minutes, and all the mystery and intrigue of the comic series is bluntly stated. His time on Team X is also very interesting. Here, it's over in the first thirty minutes and only one mission is shown. Weapon X by Barry Windsor-Smith is, again, one of the best stories you'll read. Here, over with in the first half without anything that made that story engaging. The whole movie is like the CliffNotes version of the comics. You get the basics but none of the heart and soul of it.The explanation for how Logan loses his memory is atrociously bad. I won't spoil it, but it boggles the mind that the producers came up with something so dumb. It's factually inaccurate, especially within the universe the movies have set up, and just a hair beneath deus ex machina. Origins had a very appropriate explanation that revealed a lot about who he is. If the producers went with that this movie would have been much more Christopher Nolan-esque.Wolverine also has one major problem that The Last Stand did, far too many characters. And again, the more characters they add the less time to develop any so that basically all become stagnant. Logan has a story but doesn't really evolve. Nor can he since the previous movies established that he will be reset at some point. Stryker in X2 was one of the best villain in film and expertly shows the true enemy of the X- Men. Here, he's simply a maniacal bad guy and almost a mad scientist stereotype. The others (Blob, Maverick, Agent Zero, Gambit, even Silverfox) are simply there to move the plot forward. Fan favorite Deadpool is most disappointing. Like everything else, he's so briefly shown that can't have the time to be the anti-hero fans know and love. Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. But he only gets two scenes and nothing much to do besides be a guy with swords.On the other hand, I will say that they did a terrific job with Sabretooth. In X-Men he was simply a big thug who for whatever reason disliked Logan. This version was far more faithful to the comics as he and Logan were personally connected and actually got to play off each other. Liev Schreiber was terrific casting. If there's one good thing to take away from this movie, it's Sabretooth.Hugh Jackman gives another great performance. I still can't imagine any other actor in that part. If only he had a better story to work with. But besides the aforementioned Reynolds and Schreiber, no one else stands out. No one is particularly bad, but no one is more than just okay.Finally, this movie really should have been R. I understand all the stuff about studio marketing, the teen audience, etc. But Wolverine is Marvel's bloodiest superhero followed far behind by Blade and Punisher (both of which had R rated movies). This shouldn't be a Saturday morning cartoon show where Wolverine can only punch foes and uses his claws to open doors. This is supposed to be long before the X-Men where he still lets his anger get the best of him. Plenty of movies, much like Blade, have proved that R rated can be financially and critically successful.That being said, this film isn't the worst I've seen. Certainly Daredevil, Ghost Rider, The Last Stand for example are far less entertaining. The action is exciting. Seeing people use powers against each other is always cool. And it does open the gates for Wolverine's early history to those who don't know the comics.The film is tolerable. Nothing as good as X-Men, X2, or First Class but certainly a step up from The Last Stand. It could have, and should have, been better. I certainly hope the upcoming sequel (as I write this) is better. But being someone who grew up on the 90s X-Men series and the comics, I do say I enjoy watching this simply because I do like Wolverine.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Wolverine Saga: A Clawed, Chaotic Delight!","Alright, listen up, bub. If you're an X-Men fanatic like me, you've been waiting with bated breath for the Wolverine solo flick. And let me tell you, this movie is one wild ride.First off, let's address the elephant in the room - the writing. It's a bit of a mess, to be honest. The script is all over the place, like a drunk Wolverine after a night of heavy drinking and cigar-chomping. But you know what? That's kind of the charm of it. It's like they took the edgy, jaunty spirit of the first two X-Men movies and cranked it up to 11, with a healthy dose of emo Wolverine thrown in for good measure.But don't let that deter you, my mutant-loving friends. The acting is top-notch, with Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber absolutely killing it as the clawed brothers-in-arms, Wolverine and Sabretooth. Their on-screen chemistry is like a well-choreographed dance of adamantium and fangs, and it's a sight to behold.And let's not forget the introduction of some new mutant players, like the suave and smooth-talking Gambit, the merc-with-a-mouth Deadpool, and the ever-fabulous Cyclops and Emma Frost. It's like a mutant party, and you're invited (just don't forget to RSVP, or Wolverine might slice you in half).The action sequences are where this movie really shines, my friends. The fight scenes are brutal, intense, and will have you on the edge of your seat, wondering if Wolverine's healing factor is going to be enough to save his bacon. And the visual effects? Forget about it. It's like they took a bucket of CGI, mixed it with a dash of mutant magic, and created something truly spectacular.Sure, the movie may not be as polished as the first two X-Men flicks, but who cares? This is Wolverine we're talking about - the guy who's more metal than a junkyard and has a temper that could melt adamantium. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and get ready for a wild, clawed, and chaotic ride. This is one Wolverine movie you won't want to miss.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I loved the flashbacks of them during all the different world wars they fought in and their ultimate reliance on each other.There's a bit of a love story, and then the reasons behind Wolverine's metal claws.

'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' Character within the Characters Movie Trailer Review,"YOUR PAST CAN BE REDEMPTIVE.A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration through a story that shows not only where wolverine and some other characters have come from, but also how they got there.With this in mind, it can make one think how we are all called to me different and give the Misfists of the world an exemplar to walk with in the shoes of a character that relates with them the most. In fact, Pastor Chris Durso defines ""a misfit as someone who is uncomfortable with their surroundings and someone who is disturbingly different than others with the norms of culture."" As this movie will inspire you to be a peculiar in the real world.This trailer is imaginative and entertainingly engaging with shocking visual design, cinematography, and special visual effects that makes you feel like you're apart of the action.The trailer showcases performances that are vibrant, full of confidence, style and flair. Hugh Jackman and Lynn Collins were both phenomenal; truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters. Not to mention the other characters were believable as they showed hard work, technique, good direction, and loyalty to the original characters of the comic book. Putting on display
A wide variety of character strengths behind the characters. Like courage, justice, wisdom, knowledge, humanity, temperance, and transcendence - being that it's a superhero flick.In effect, the trailer pulls you in and brings you into the world of Wolverine as you travel through snippets of his backstory of Wolverine. Who is ""seeking solace from his dark past, Logan, better known as Wolverine, seems to have found love and contentment with Kayla Silverfox. Logan's peaceful existence is shattered when Victor Creed, his vicious brother, brutally murders Kayla. Logan's thirst for revenge propels him into the Weapon X program, where he undergoes a painful procedure to bond his bones with adamantium, making him virtually indestructible and more than a match for Victor"" (ref. Google).Although special effects can be striking and really enhance the movie, it made the appearance commercially attractive, more distinctive and memorable.Nevertheless the production quality was very impressive throughout; both visually and through the amusing sound effects as it made the production more creative in using less as more.Overall, the trailer is a blast from the past of Wolverine and the other legendary characters that gives your a well anticipated drive to want to see the move to experience their story from the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fox Botches Another Marvel Adaptation,"All right. Seriously, 20th Century Fox needs to throw in the towel and give up on comic book movies. The X-MEN trilogy had a decent run (and X2 is one of my favorite comic adaptations) but every other attempt has ended in mediocrity or failure. Their WOLVERINE spin-off is no different; it teeters on the edge of both. The movie attempts to fill in film audiences on the history of everyone's favorite member of the X-Men, including how he acquired his adamantium claws and his amnesia. Somehow, that equates to an uninteresting story with the usual Fox mutant cameo-fest. When will they learn? I've read a bit of Wolverine's origin story in the comics and was a bit upset that they crammed his childhood into a four-minute opening sequence. They've also taken some annoying creative license with the details of Weapon X and Wolverine's team members, about which I wasn't too thrilled. Lack of faith to the source material aside, I can still enjoy a comic book movie as long as it's entertaining enough. Sadly, this movie didn't fit the bill. The story was unimpressive and never really grabbed me and some of the plot devices were just ridiculous (adamantium bullets...really?!). As has become the norm, Fox included an abundance of unjustifiable character cameos, just for the sake of having them: Gambit, Cyclops, Blob, etc. None of these characters were necessary but they felt the need to include them anyway, which I feel detracts from the story.Performance-wise, the film is hit-or-miss. Jackman did a great job as usual in the title role; he really appears to have embraced the character and I wish they'd given him better material to work with. I absolutely LOVED Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed/Sabretooth! I feel as if he did a better job of making a solid character of him than Tyler Mane did in the original film. As pointless as I felt the character's inclusion was, I felt Taylor Kitsch did a good job in the role of Gambit and I'm hoping he gets some stronger material in the future and a chance to develop the role. Danny Huston was decent as General Styker though I still prefer Brian Cox. And, of course, there's Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool; he always would've been my first choice for the character and he does a great job for the measly 5 minutes we get of him.For a blockbuster movie that came out nine years since the original, I have to question the poor CGI. There are too many moments in this movie when it just looked terrible and pulled you out of the film. Come on now, Wolverine's been in three previous movies...we STILL haven't perfected his claws?! Honestly, the lame outweighs the good for the first X-Men spin-off and it doesn't bode well for the future. The 107 minute runtime feels as if it takes forever and the movie frequently grinds to a halt. With as much bank as the film pulled in, a sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope they learn from their mistakes and Wolverine's next solo outing does the character, and Marvel, justice.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Loved the trilogy, love this origin","Its not a perfect movie. The narrative is a bit clumsy.But that's all I have in terms of gripes. Otherwise, this is a blockbuster movie that delivers and deserves more episodes in this franchise. Cool actors playing cool characters, crazy action delivered with style and zest, and a storyline that nicely (not perfectly) fits the continuity of the universe that the 3 X Men movies established.Yes, there were many characters that didn't get enough screen time but no film can focus on so many, otherwise you lose focus on the main plot. The main focus was quite rightly on Wolverine, Sabretooth and the general. I must admit Sabretooth did steal every scene he was in, that guy has a cool way of delivering his basic lines.A tighter narrative would have made this movie up there with the best of the comic book adapted movies but as it stands, it doesn't.But what it offers is highly enjoyable, and it offers a heck of a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hugh Jackman being cast as the Wolverine certainly makes a huge difference. He is able to look fierce and intimidating while conveying all of the emotion perfectly.

It could have been so much better.,"'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' was highly anticipated, Wolverine was thought to be everyone's favourite in the X-Men series but this film disappointed a lot of people.Acting in this film varies from good (Hugh Jackman) to very bad. A surprising amount of this cast don't perform very well. Will.I.Am's character being one of the worst. Lynn Collins does not perform that well either, it can be quite embarrassing at times.The plot again varies, at some points it can be very well written such as the scene where Wolverine meets the elderly couple. But then in other scenes it can be cringe-worthy, like when Wolverine has a boxing match with a ludicrously over-weight person for no apparent reason.The dialogue is awful, it is so cheesy at some points you feel like turning the film off. The dialogue gets even more embarrassing as the film reaches the climax, where everyone decides to be friends momentarily. Another bad aspect of this film is where the director has decided to make Jackman look up and scream at the sky whilst the camera pans out, this happens at least three times in the film all with dramatic music playing behind it. You think they're doing this as a joke, but there is no tongue-in-cheek here whatsoever and they are being completely serious when they do this.Overall, if you really want to see this film then go ahead but be warned, you will almost certainly be disappointed if you are a huge fan of the X-Men series. It starts out really good and slowly gets worse and worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How could they....,"Let me first say that I am a person who doesn't read / writes reviews, I do not care about other people's opinion, nor do I believe that anyone should care for mine. Let me also state that I am a comic book fan, and that my viewpoint of the movie is from someone who had previously read years of material of the characters portrayed in this movie.First off, the movie is VERY different from the actual storyline, besides their names, most of the characters in this movie are have their powers/ story/ and relations completely made up.The story itself is hard to believe, and can't be taken seriously (Though this is a fantasy movie, simple logic such as ""why didn't he just do this..."" will be though more than enough.) The plot in the movie is stupid, in the comic the plot itself was confusing and hard to follow, but it still made sense. In this movie, it not only ignores the comic's storyline to make it simple, but instead makes it unrealistic and borderline retarded.It's hard to explain without actually spoiling the movie, but seeing that it's leaked on the internet, do yourself a favor and download it rather than spend your money to a company who rather milk the cash cow for all it's worth rather than give back to the people who supported them.Overall, if you know who Wolverine is, know the Marvel Universe, or have ANY idea of his story STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!

Had the same problem as Spiderman 3,"And that problem is way too many characters with way too little development time. If you're a big fan of the comics and a few choice characters you will be slightly disappointed at how little screen-time certain characters get.There were two characters I would've wanted to see more of: Gambit and Deadpool. Both characters have deep backgrounds to them and are both very interesting. However the movie treats them as throwaway characters with each getting less than ten minutes of screen time.And then there's Cyclops. Really? Why bother putting him in the posters if you'll give him such a small part. They practically threw him away in X3 and now they just used him as fodder. Does Hollywood really have that little respect for all the really deep and interesting characters? However, at least I got what I expected most of the movie: a not too complicated but still personal story of Wolverine, kick-ass action scenes, and a tying up of many of the loose ends from the original X-men trilogy. The script and screenplay were very good and the director did a good job putting this movie together.Despite its shortcomings, fans will find something to enjoy here.

Return Back to the winning Formula,"Like George Lucas wasting our time explaining the story of Darth Vader in the three ""Star Wars"" prequels (Episodes I-III)""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is just another excuse to make money off of a character the public has come to love.Ever since Bryan Singer abandoned X-Men fans after doing ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" no film has done this great comic book franchise justice. Brett Ratner gave us the fair - at - best ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and now we have been given ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". I'll admit there are a few good scenes in this movie, but when it was finished all I could think about was how unnecessary this film was. We don't need another movie to explain to us why Wolverine is cool. We know why he's awesome.Another reason I feel this movie is totally unnecessary is because it tells us who Wolverine was. When the whole purpose of X2 is that Wolverine has come to terms with the fact that he will never know who he is, but that it's OK because he has found his purpose with the X-Men. This film takes away the whole mystique (no pun intended) of the character.So ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" really isn't worth it if you want to remember X-Men the way I do. Awesome.

A solid action movie.,"It is a good action movie, but that's mostly all it is, just another action movie.If you switch your brain to ""off"" mode at the 20th Century Fox logo at the start of the movie you will probably enjoy it, whether you are a Marvel fan or not. But if you expect attention to detail, deep storyline with an intriguing plot and ocean deep dialog between the awesome action scenes, you will be disappointed. There are a few ""How the hell did he get there all of a sudden?!"" moments, as well as ""Why in Gods name is he doing that!?"" and ""That detail is so obviously OFF"", but the sight of Hugh Jackman roaring and tearing things apart kind of makes those moments easily forgiven.On the other hand the action scenes are great, the characters even more so. The animations are really nice and some scenes are so beautiful its almost breathtaking. The cast is pretty amazing and the characters they play complement with them nicely. There probably is no one better suited to play Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, as he already did in the X-Men Trilogy (2000, 2003, 2006) perfectly. He is definitely one of the best looking super action heroes on the big screen, and not only that, he is a half decent actor too.All and all I give the movie a 7/10. One grade down from 10 because of inattention to detail, another one down for the clich√© dialog and the lack of originality in story depth and another one down for failing to invoke the subjective feeling of immense and ultimate awesomeness I search for in movies. I got that from The Dark Knight and The Watchmen for example. Both films are excellent super hero movies that combine action and drama perfectly. X-Men Origins: Wolverine certainly tries its best in the drama department, but drops just a little short.So if you enjoyed the X-Men Trilogy you will definitely enjoy X-Men Origins: Wolverine and if you didn't see the X-Men Trilogy yet, watch Wolverine first, you probably wont regret it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Nobody gets to kill you but me!""","""Wolverine"" is a standard Marvel's blockbuster. Expensive, great effects and production, visually impressive and full of fast-paced action that is trying to divert your attention from an expectedly lousy scenario.

Characterization and motivation of other characters are nonexistent and they leave no impression, and the story is interesting but very poorly developed.

If you liked this from the start watch it again and you my be upset SPOILERS,"I'm upset. I was so jacked to see this and the first round I was pretty happy but I did have some fun laughing about it with my friends. After that, it got worse.Good: The opening montage was really sweet.Liev Shreiber rules. He was awesome in the first part with the killing and claws, but I was totally not feeling at the end when he save Wolverine. Wrong. ""We're brothers. Brothers stick together."" Not in X-men you don't.And that's about it.Bad:JesusThe CGI was miserable. The part when he was admiring the new claw in the mirror and the art where he is slicing the scaffolding, which makes no freaking sense, in particular.Hugh Jackman is not a good wolverine. I liked him at first but why would an unkillable monster be afraid of flying? His little snarky lines and feathered hair infuriate me. Wolverine is supposed to growl everything he says and inject whiskey in to his eyes to keep in shape, not throw his hair back as he walks in slow motion.The finally give Ryan Reynolds apart where he's allowed to be annoying and do pretty much exactly what Ryan Reynolds does in every flick he's in. Then they give him 3 lines then seal his mouth shut. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to seal his mouth shut, just not as Deadpool.Aside from that, there's the stuff that doesn't make sense.Why the hell was Gambit there? I know everyone wants to see him, but why? Wolverine convinces Gambit to fly him to the island so he can kill everyone that wronged him and by extension wronged Gambit. Then when Wolvie takes out the smoke stack Gambit inexplicably shows up and comments on how he thought Wolvie was kidding about killing everyone. WHO THE HELL DID HE KILL? He let Stryker and Sabretooth go!Deadpool uses his swords to deflect bullets in the beginning. Then they give him adimantium swords the poke out of his forearms. How is that better than giving him swords again? And even more, the swords were like four feet long... how the hell did they fit into his arms?Silver Fox tells Stryker after grabbing him to walk as far as he could until his feet bleed, then they show him in some field and his shoes are all destroyed, presumably from walking... they were on an island! How far could he have gotten and how the hell did he get into a field?This was entertaining but I was totally removed after all the stupid crap. It's not a good X-men flick.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Love this movie,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), a wild ride through Wolverine's tumultuous past that had me hooked from adamantium claws to dramatic revelations. Hugh Jackman brings his A-game to the iconic role, infusing Wolverine with a raw intensity that's hard to resist. The film editing skillfully weaves together Logan's origin story, creating a narrative that's both action-packed and emotionally resonant. The strength of Origins lies in its exploration of Wolverine's complex character and the relationships that shaped him. The music, while not as memorable as some other X-Men entries, complements the high-octane moments with a fitting pulse. The weakness, however, is the occasionally convoluted plot that may leave some scratching their heads. Cinematography captures the brutality of Wolverine's journey with visceral visuals, making every slash and snarl a cinematic spectacle. At 8/10, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a thrilling dive into the heart of one of Marvel's most beloved characters, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Logan's saga.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The only time it happens is when he fights saber tooth on that island and it isn't even a very long fight. The fight goes on for literally about 45 seconds and then it's all over. Overall this movie isn't the worst movie of all time but it's definitely the worst movie to have wolverine in it. I have to say the third x-men movie absolutely kills this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""This is the Greatest Show!!""","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) -I really can't see why this film only has a 6.5 rating on IMDB. Yeah there were a few issues for the die hard fans and a few production issues, but the story was great and the action exciting. And Hugh Jackman was born to play this role. Also, you get to see his bum!Of all the X-Men characters Wolverine has the most interesting origin story, so this was the right choice to start with.And it wasn't just a generic slice of his life, it was a proper delivery from when his mutation first manifested almost all the way through to when we first met him in 'X-Men' (2000).A montage over the beginning credits covered the periods that weren't necessarily as exciting or could be explored in more depth at another time, so that the story could kick start with a more mutant heavy period of his life.I got to see why he has such animosity towards Sabretooth (Liev Schrieber) which again took me right up to their meeting in the first X film.What followed was emotional and packed with great fights and tension and although some of the characters they introduced were not as strong as they should have been, those issues were later rectified in other films.One of those being Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) who was wrongly cast here, especially as Channing Tatum fit so perfectly in the role for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' (2024).One of the issues I did have with this one was the CGI which was not always that good and actually it was often used at times when a real shot would have worked far better too.In particular when Wolverine stares at his claws in the mirror, it was a bit like trying to put 'Roger Rabbit' (1988) in to the real life scenes with Bob Hoskins. It looked so much like a cartoon.But this is probably my favourite of the X-Men films. I'd always liked how they focussed on Wolvie even in the group efforts so a whole film dedicated to him was always going to tick my box.909.11/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hilarious Trash,"If you like movies like Gods of Egypt and Morbius, then X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an under-appreciated schlock masterpiece! While this movie may not be laugh-out-loud funny on a surface level, the sheer incompetence and overly serious tone brings it to levels of comedy matched only by some of Platinum games' best hits like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or Bayonetta. Seeing Liev Schreiber run on all-fours like a vicious saber tooth tiger may be one of the funniest visuals I've ever seen in a movie. Every character is ""super cool"" and totally the most badass version of themselves that they could be, and it's always embarrassing. I absolutely recommend this movie to 12-year old boys who like to pretend they are superheroes on the playground, as well as weird sociopaths who like to watch things fail.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Impressed,"If was happy to require some of the Wolverine origin comics when they came out. And when this movie came out it played out that what was explained in the comics very well. I love the first part of the movie from war to war and back to back and with frames made still like they where a comic page. Was speechless the first time I saw that and am still today. I don't know who shot that but you have my respect for making this. The whole movie is great untill they get up to the island and weapon XI appears. I went 'that's not right, he's Deadpool, WTF is going on here'. Could not enjoy that scene and I am happy it got errassed by Deadpool himself in his own movies. When the brothes did the back to back thing it was ok again to watch. The Kayla / Silver Fox thing did not work well because after she got killed twice I still got the 'she is HYDRA' and I don't trust this thing her beeing dead again. I think the Silver Fox / Logan love affair was very complicated in the comics also.Giving it -1 for Charles his appearance to help the captives out and you can see it is CGI. -1 for the Deadpool thing what is not Deadpool.

Now this was bad,While i thought the last stand was mid but this movie here was bad. The whole montage thing at the start of the movie was really cool but after that it got so bad. And as well as that the inclusion of gambit was really cool. First off and mainly whoever thought it was a good idea to give the merc with a mouth no mouth could not have been sober.Secondly aside from it just being a lame ass origin story it makes no sense in terms of the original trilogy. It might have worked as a standalone movie but like whatever way they did it was a mistake. Even small details like cyclops being here for no reason???? Because they didn't know each other in the original trilogy makes no sense. And is there two sabretooth because this one is in no way similar to the one in X men. 3/10.,3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Mess of A Movie,"I must admit I am somewhere at a loss of how to begin explaining my feelings of Wolverine's first solo outing in the X-Men series. It is the fourth installment and a prequel to the main trilogy that ended with The Last Stand. I always believed that the reason that prevented the first two from being the best of the superhero genre was the fact that there are too many characters to keep track of (don't even get me started on TLS). There are always characters who feel neglected and in need of more screen time. The fact is that to give all of them what they are due then the films would be in excess of three hours, and I for one do not want a superhero film of that length.It seemed that a film that would just have one main character and none of the other protagonists would be a qualified success, with a more focused film. Boy was I wrong. The film starts with Logan as a young child, he witnesses the death of his mother and through his anger and rage claws start to protrude from his skin, not made of metal but bone. This scene lacks any emotional impact (like many throughout the runtime of this film). The fact is we cannot form a bond with his mother ‚Äì it all happens too soon. Compare it to the death of Bruce Wayne's parents murdered in cold blood and it pales in comparison.There are many different and interesting paths that this film could take, yet Gavin Hood and screenwriter Skip Woods seem interested in giving a dull, limp, lifeless tale that goes nowhere and achieves nothing. Heck, the audience in the first five minutes must accept that Logan just gets claws because he is angry. How did he get these claws? No idea. The film never explains this and we just have to accept it, because the plot demands that he does. Instead we get to see how Wolverine gets his jacket. Yippee. I don't want to know how Wolverine obtained one piece of clothing. Wolverine eventually undergoes an operation which gives him adamantium injected into his body. Then he forms a relationship with the most clich√©d romantic interest in movie history. It is as if her character was given a list of check-boxes and the screenwriter ticked every one of them. Later, he faces one of the most dangerous villains in the X-Men series ‚Äì Deadpool. Just wait till you see what they have done to him¬Ö This is about as dreary as Origins of Superheroes get.However, the main problem of the film is that we never care about the main character! How can this be? They have made one of my favourite superheroes duller than ditch water. Wolverine has so much charisma, dry wit and good one liners yet the only reason he is here is for the purpose of action scenes. Within every single one of these pointless escapades, we feel strangely detached. The reason? Wolverine cannot die. In X-Men, Magneto could stop him and control the adamantium that runs through his entire body. In X2, Lady Deathstrike was made of adamantium and proved a powerful nemesis against him. But in Origins he is unstoppable. The one thing that we are told can kill him is a special bullet, which later Stryker changes his mind and somehow says it can only erase his memory which makes the entire film pointless. We already know that in X-Men; Wolverine remembers nothing, so what does this film achieve ‚Äì you guessed it.This is the rock bottom for the franchise. It is a complete cash grab and not an ounce of effort has gone into this production e.g. Will.i.am is present that tells you all you need to know. Hugh Jackman tries his best as Wolverine to redeem this god-awful tale but even he cannot save it. This is the equivalent of Batman and Robin for the 21st century. Maybe, some Origins were never meant to see the light of day. An unredeemable, noisy and monstrous piece of film, this is what Superheroes were never meant to be about.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Quite simply... a masterpiece,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is quite simply... a masterpiece. This isn't a movie that should be judged against other superhero/comic book movies. It's a movie that should be judged against such greats as The Godfather and Citizen Kane. Hugh Jackman's performance is as iconic as Brando's Vito Corleone. I can see some of his dialogue entering into the pop culture lexicon and recited for years to come. An Oscar win for Jackman and a Best Picture award is inevitable. The supporting cast is amazing as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Liev Schreiber, Taylor Kitsch, and Danny Huston all receive Best Supporting Actor nods. Liev Schrieber's performance is up there with Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Of course, Gavin Hood deserves Best Director and the screenplay should be honored too. Other Oscar wins will probably include Best Visual Effects, Costume Design, Cinematography, Sound Editing, Film Editing, Sound Mixing and Best Original Score. All in all, I will be seeing this film many times in theaters in order to boost its box office in hopes that it will break The Dark Knight's undeserved record. Better than Watchmen, too.

The best X-men yet,"What to expect from Gavin Hood as director of Wolverine?I'll tell you,A more hardcore version of wolverine, totally bad-ass and fresh, a good way to start a spin off franchise. There's several new mutants, and unexpected old faces.There's a better sense of grittiness and the baggage of Brian Singer's installment and the lack of realism Ratner had is gone and Hood sculpt a clear beautiful film.This was a fantastic film and I enjoyed it very much.A sequel already!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A big budget version of a direct-to-DVD spin-off,"Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history. I'm no Marvel expert, but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first X-Men, found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies, I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an ""origins""-movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies. If we concentrate on one character, I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure.The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no, it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try. To begin with, this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very, very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense, and when one event will make you predict the following five, it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie, imitating an action/adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before. Of course, nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody's talking clich√©s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard, you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough.But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and, by the way, that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean, ""Origins"". Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War, World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually, the brother (Sabertooth, played by Liev Shrieber) became evil. ""How?"" you ask. I don't know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. ""Yeah, but why?"" you still ask. I just said I don't know!! The movie doesn't explain. He's evil alright! ""Yeah, but... you know, 'origins'""... Yeah, well that's an origin! I mean, duh! Anyway, eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government, ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one, who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. ""Yeaaah... but... whyyyy?"" - Oh shut up! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped, cue X-Men the first movie.There. That's the origin. You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover. The actual movie won't tell you anything else. With no worthwhile scenes of action, no good heroes, villains or characters in general (lines from my couch audience: Fat suit! Token black guy! Oh, I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie.., That is supposed to be Gambit...? mmhm, yeah well... uh-huh, right), not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with, added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive...... well, that sounds pretty much like a waste of time, right? Fans will check this out, or have already. There's no stopping that. But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wolverine goes back to his roots.,"This movie was rather good, I have to say out of all the X-men movies though it was the weakest of the bunch. Not by a lot as I did give it a score of 8, I just found it had some story problems here and there and other issues that the other movies did not have. However, I was surprised the story was somewhat good and not disjointed as it looked like it might be from the trailers, by that I mean the time did not shift from one random scene to another. The story basically shows us how Wolverine became Wolverine and a bit how Sabretooth came about as well though he was never called that in the film. You go through the opening credits going through all the wars they participated in, to their time in a band of mutant mercenaries led by Stryker. After a mishap there Logan (Wolverine) goes to live a more normal life only to find it destroyed by Victor (Sabretooth). After a brutal battle where it is apparent Victor is just to powerful for Logan to fight in his current state, he accepts an offer to go through a procedure that gives him the metal skeleton and claws that we all know and love. The action is rather good in this film though I thought Wolverine had better fights in the previous movies as nothing in this one can really compare to the Lady Deathstrike fight in part II. I liked seeing other mutants from the comics as I thought they did the Blob very well. I was disappointed that Gambit was not in it more, and the one real fight scene he was in was a bit hard to follow, but it was nice just seeing him on film. Scott Summers also makes a brief appearance and they actually showcase his optic blast better in this movie that is mainly a Wolverine feature than they did the other X-men movies. It is not all perfect as Ryan Reynolds character was underused, I did not care for the reason Wolverine lost his memory in the other movies as it seemed to far fetched and kind of weak, and the last fight while cool was kind of a waste of one of the more interesting comic characters. I would rather have seen Omega Red as the final enemy as he would have been cool and you could have used the other character in later movies. Next up is X-men Origins Magneto, but truthfully I would rather see an X-men 4 movie as there were to many loose ends in the Last Stand.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Clumsy, unattractive, woesome","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is notorious for the wrong reasons. It is by far the most hated X-Men film and even an apologist of X-Men 3, such as yours truly, has no trouble seeing why it has earned its none too arousing rep.First of all, I believe this film is proof that it is possible to ""mis-cast"" a director. Gavin Hood, who knocked it out of the park with his Oscar-winning 2005 drama Tsotsi, was alien to the genre of action at the time he directed X-Men Origins. As of 2013's Ender's Game, he has become more comfortable with the genre and visibly capable of crafting a competent action film. X-Men Origins, I can assure you, is nothing of the sort.In it, we get to know the origins of adamantium-boned, immortal mutant Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). We see how he killed his own father after his real father killed his step-father whom he first thought was his real father. Are you still with me? Good. So, he runs away from home with his brother Victor ""Sabretooth"" Creed, played by Liev Schreiber as an adult and not remotely similar to Tyler Mane in the first X-Men. Together they use their immortality and healing factor - Sabretooth's got 'em too - to fight several wars and eventually attract the attention of one Major William Stryker (Danny Huston). Not sure if he looks much of anything like Brian Cox's version of the character in X-Men 2.Wolverine and Sabretooth fight more battles alongside Stryker's top secret team of super mutants, but Wolverine eventually ends up wanting no part in it. Hence why he moves into a cottage in the mountains with Lynn Collins and starts calling himself ""Logan"". But then Collins is killed by Sabretooth. Wolverine gets angry. Wolverine gets adamantium put in his bones by Stryker. Wolverine goes to a farmhouse and reinacts Superman's origin story with some old couple. Old couple gets killed by Stryker's agents. Wolverine tracks down his old friends from Stryker's team. Wolverine meets Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), a respectlessly shoehorned in mutant who charges everything he touches, especially his trusty deck of cards, into bombs. Gambit and Wolverine battle pointlessly. Gambit helps Wolverine track down Stryker. Again I ask: are you still with me?Wolverine's old team, besides Sabretooth, consists of Kevin Durand as some guy who later becomes The Blob for some reason, Dominic Monaghan as a walking battery, will.i.am as some rapper who thinks he can act, Daniel Henney as Agent Zero, and Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson, who later becomes Deadpool, at which point his trademark katanas are put inside (!) his arms and his mouth is stitched shut. If you're gonna make a film based on a character known for his fast mouth and your first instinct is to sew it shut, why are you even permitted to try?Many of these characters feel like they're present only for the sake of fanservice, but how much fanservice is it to give beloved X-Men characters like Gambit so little to do and to get Deadpool so breathtakingly wrong? Not even Wolverine's claws get much respect in that they in many shots look as though they were made in an hour using Adobe After Effects. The action scenes and accompanying visuals are often equally unwatchable.A late scene also involves the puzzling appearance of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. He is seen standing upright, something he, according to X-Men: First Class, lost the ability to do when he was as young as James McAvoy. For some reason, fans seem to point this plot hole out more commonly than they point out the one in X-Men 3, in which Xavier and Magneto are shown as friends in a flashback where they're still played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, in spite of them having become enemies when they were still James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender.I understand that the makers of X-Men Origins couldn't very well know in advance what the makers of First Class and Days of Future Past had in mind, but I do wish there was better consistency in-between films. How much do you wanna bet that if George Lucas made these movies, he would re-release X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins on Blu-Ray, having re-shot Xavier and Magneto's flashback scenes with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender? I strangely find myself welcoming it.But I agree with the fanboys and fangirls that the less we say about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the better. It is a clumsy, idiotic and unattractive film that makes me want to give Gambit a pat on the back and Deadpool a massive hug and a cigar. Wolverine, I think, will be fine.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But instead it's 'Hollywood-ized' regurgitated fish puke, Hugh Jackman must of had this film tied to his X-men contract otherwise I don't believe he would of even gotten past the first five pages of the script, on the flip side, well their is plenty of fighting, explosions, cool quotes just before people die stuff, but not enough and not cool enough to be in a Wolverine Film, if I was to compare this film to something like Die Hard it would end up looking like 'stop or my mom will shoot!'.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"First let me say, the film sucked.","Yeah, it sucked. Every shot felt illogical. The opening made no sense and served no purpose. Yes the montage was fun but at the same time you're left wondering, why? Bone claws. They were stupid in the comic book and they're stupid in a movie. Not to mention they're all knobby ugly for no good reason. They looked like three hobbit walking sticks coming out of each hand.Any surgeon watching the adamantium bonding sequence should be cringing at how ridiculously simple it was. And anyone with two IQ points to rub together should be wondering how Logan's claws came out all smooth and sharp when the originals were just pointy and knobby.The love story is lame and uninspired, sad considering the events surrounding it were the only motivation for any of the actions taken by the main character in the entire film.The introduction of Wade Wilson at the beginning of the film made me wish I was watching a Deadpool movie instead. At least he was fun to listen to.Gambit was a high point, though his mysteriously fading accent was annoying as was his lets-stick-a-popular-character-in-for-no-reason appearance.Sigh, I could nitpick the entire film and to avoid spoilers I can't complain about HOW STUPID THE END WAS. Yes, X3 is now the second worst mutant movie after XMO:W. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh! I give it 3 stars because that's what it deserves. Ma and Pa Kent were enjoyable. Some of the action was cool.

This is what we've been waiting for....,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not without its flaws and although some things are left unexplained, it is nowhere near as bad as critics are cracking it up to be. At the end of the day, it is a very fun roller coaster ride from beginning to end and personally, I enjoyed every second of it. Hugh Jackman did not disappoint, as I knew he would not as Wolverine and his true dark side is finally shown as in the films it was really dumbed down. I was very impressed by his performance. Liev Schreiber who plays Wolverine's half brother - Victor Creed - was far better than I expected. He was cruel, ruthless and merciless, just how you would expect Sabretooth to behave and act in say, the comics.Taylor Kitsch was very impressive as Gambit and did not disappoint at all which was a relief. His accent is there at times and although his red eyes are only shown once, I did not mind. It is great just to see Gambit in a movie! I would love to see Taylor reprise his role as Gambit again in future X-Men movies and sequels; the same goes for Deadpool who was also superb although I expect a lot of Deadpool fans will be disappointed due to his and Gambit's lack of screen time and characterisation. Deadpool does not don the classic red and black costume but hey, what can I say? This movie is called X-Men Origins: Wolverine for a reason, not X-Men Origins: Gambit or X-Men Origins: Deadpool!This film has plenty of action and plenty of explosions! You need not be bored! The CGI and special effects are not brilliant and for a film of this modern age, they could have certainly been better but don't let that put you off! It is loaded with action, drama and plenty of sexy men for us ladies to feast our eyes on! What more could a woman ask for? Surprisingly, there is no to barely any blood and the violence, although good, is very lighthearted and very much left to the imagination. The fight scenes between Wolverine and Sabretooth, although short, were very entertaining and are sure to please fans. Be prepared for plenty of roaring because they do a lot of it in this movie! May I say this film also has plenty of humour and laugh-out-loud moments that make you feel good. Some scenes, specifically the opening credits and adamantium-infusion scene totally took my breath away and were incredibly well done. Do yourself a favour and judge this film for yourself.

The average rating on IMDb proves that the movie is worthwhile seeing and then make up your own mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I remembered...,"Truth be told, I've never really hated X-Men Origins: Wolverine, yes it's horribly mundane and inescapably redundant but it's equally functional and generally competent for the most part. Violent, cruel and shrouded in darkness with plenty of brawn and brute force to go around, starting with a roar before sliding into a chaotic mess never quite overcoming the poorly served story. Gavin Hood's direction and general photography are to a much better standard than what we saw in The Last Stand and the action is certainly enjoyable with a lot of creative shot choices and transitions, however, there are plenty of major issues with the effects, ranging from impressive to embarrassing to the downright hideous. As stated before, I can't fault the cast of this film, they all do a stand-up job with genuinely exceptional performances, even if the characters (especially Deadpool) are often done a massive disservice. Everyone raves about Liev Schreiber's Sabertooth and Hugh Jackman's continually incredible portrayal of Wolverine and rightly so, but honestly, I feel the best performance of the film comes from the severely understated Taylor Kitsch as Gambit in what is the character's ONLY appearance in the live-action films to date! The dude just nails it even with his severely limited screen time. While Harry Gregson-Williams' music is ultimately fine, like John Powell, I know he's capable of so much better. Ultimately X-Men Origins: Wolverine is emphatically overblown, slightly underwhelming but can equally muster feelings of excitement and some genuinely impressive creativity despite the consistent rambling.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2009 Review,"Let me say, the only good thing in this film is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and they even almost ruin that. And while i'm on the topic of characters, I truly dreaded every time Liev Schreibers ""Sabretooth"" came on the screen, abysmal acting, and terrible script for his character.
The script is bad all around though, terrible one liners and dumb story directions that with a second watch will make absolutely no sense. The awful script combined with awful cinematography, storytelling, green screening, wire work, and CGI make this film really hard to watch.
And an unpopular opinion here, even though Deadpool is far from accurate in both his powers and his look; I did really enjoy his appearance. And the only reason for that is because he reminds me of Baraka from Mortal Kombat.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This film's potential was sliced in half.,"With the less than stellar end to the original X-Men trilogy, and a first film that hadn't aged well. X-Men Origins: Wolverine had the chance to do something new while also maintaining the old, and what could go wrong? Hugh Jackman returned as Wolverine, Sabertooth was back, Deadpool and Gambit we're getting their shot. Oh how we were so innocent. With visual effects that are exceedingly laughable and cheap, (especially compared to the originals) butchering classic characters, and giving us an unnecessary love story. X-Men Origins felt extremely watered down and off, and while it contains some redeeming moments, as a whole the film is pretty laughable.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why are people hating on this,"I have seen this movie many many times and always find it very enjoyable. I don't see why people hate it so much. I understand that the movie may not be identical to the comic but hey, look at it as a separate movie.From the first couple of minutes of the movie i wanted to see more. Its intense war scenes near the beginning were amazing to watch. I love the how they showed different wars. Extremely interesting. I also enjoyed how sabertooth was more than just a growling animal as they portrayed him in the first X-men movie. I wish they made more origin stories to do with other characters.

"if you Like Wolverine, you will love this film too","Like the headline suggest, if you are already a fan of Wolverine or Hugh or Comics, you will like this film This movie starts with Victor and his sick younger brother James in 1845 Canada. James kills the man who claims to be his father. The brothers fight together from one war to the next. In Vietnam, the brothers are supposed to be executed but end up recruited by Stryker (Danny Huston) joining a group of other mutants. James aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) quits the group leaving Victor (Liev Schreiber) for a life of a lumberjack with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Victor is hunting down the old team, and Stryker comes by to try to bring Logan back in. When Victor kills Kayla, Logan wants revenge and he's willing to get back in with Stryker who infuses him with adamantium.It's a lot of growling testosterone without the lighter moments. It's all about Logan's anger without any fun or comedy. Liev is fine and I would like to dig more into his character. They've put quite a few X-Men in this movie. It is probably trying to cover too much origins in this movie. This should be more Cain and Abel. Victor should be as important in this movie. This movie needs a good storyteller and not just somebody to check off a checklist. I'm not sure director Gavin Hood is the man for the job. The movie becomes overloaded.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One half of the now imfamous D&D does what he does best.,"As in, he has an ending first, then forces the charcter(s) through a bunch of convoluted plot points to reach that end, no matter the cost.

Claws that look bunny-esque and 2D. Making sabretooth his bro. A highly disturbing abuse of what Deadpool should be, and the cliche, murdered girlfriend shtick.It's amazing that he went on to make such a great adaptation of GOT's, well, at least until they rain out of material to adapt during season 6. Then we all got to watch as they did that reverse engineering, forced plot points, stuff making no sense thing; that one half of them had done previously, with this film.Poor, so poor.As poor as a church mouse, that's just had an enormous tax bill on the very day his wife ran off with another mouse, taking all the cheese.

Very good,"Let me start by saying that I love the X-Men series. However, i have not nor do I intend to read the comics. Comics aren't my thing, so I'm reviewing this strictly as a film fan, not a comic fan. I don't understand why this movie has a bad rap. It's got a good story, good acting, and great action sequences. It tells the backstory of Logan/Wolverine and his evil brother Victor, before Logan became part of the X-Men. This movie isn't perfect. But it's far better than X3, which has some pretty major flaws, but is good nonetheless. It's a close second to X2 and First Class, which to me are the best two in the series. I have not yet seen Days of Future Past so I can't compare it to that. This movie is worth a view, it's entertaining and fun, and Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine, they couldn't have picked anyone better to play him. Liev Schreiber is also very good in this, as Logan's half-brother and nemesis, Victor. 9/10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An over-hyped disappointment,"After the success of the Last Stand, I thought X-Men Origins: Wolverine would be a wrapping up of all the mysteries surrounding Logan. The movie trailer and the initial hype over the leaked release just made the wait harder.However, the movie is quite poorly made, and certainly places itself as a stumbling block in what could have been an amazing career for director Gavin Hood. Most of the scenes are made quite poorly, and end almost as soon as they begin. It's cheaper to just watch the movie trailer as there's little new in the movie.The final fight is good from a special effects point of view, but the movie leaves the gaping holes that it was supposed to fill. Logan's memory loss is barely explained. Gambit has almost a losers role throughout, and the future of Sabretooth isn't shown at all.The least that could have been done for this would be to make a decent one time watch with some amazing special effects and fight scenes, another area that is usually poorly handled.Only Schreiber's and Jackman's portrayals are worth watching in this film, and they both give stunning performances, which are sadly overshadowed by the poor quality of all other aspects of the film. It might actually be more interesting to download a copy of the unfinished version, to at least gain some insight into the making.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Brilliant Adaptation,"While being not-so-true to its original literary source (as well as historical and geographical facts), this movie is thoroughly enjoyable and is an excellent adaptation of 35 years worth of comic mythology compiled by a myriad of artists (some more confused and with less respect to the overall cohesiveness of the story universe than others).Fans of the comic will have to keep an opened mind to fully enjoy the brilliance of this new adapted-for-movie X-Men universe.

Acting is quite decent too.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lame.,"It's hard to dislike Hugh Jackman, which is why it's frustrating to witness him suffering through a number of films. He's a talented actor who's been stuck in a rut lately, and if anyone was hoping that Wolverine would be a return to form, those expectations may well be diminished within the first few minutes alone: this is just a shockingly messy film.When the much-publicized workprint edition (notably lacking many special effects) leaked last month, FOX Pictures was quick to offer that it was an ""inaccurate representation of the movie,"" and that over 15 additional minutes of footage were missing from the cut. And yet, based on comments I've read from other journalists and fans who saw both versions, it seems the final product is almost identical to the pirated version ‚Äî sloppy, awkwardly paced and wholly inconsistent in tone, style and purpose. One minute it's a dark, brooding attempt at Batman Begins-level reinvention; the next moment it's a campy, over-the-top action spectacle. The film never finds a balance, and it doesn't help that neither of its extremes are particularly effective in their own right: the ""dark"" moments feel vapid and the lighter moments just seem misplaced, like they're scenes being set up solely to be easily mocked by one of those Epic Movie spoofs. Wolvie loses his girlfriend and vows to avenge her death, and five minutes later he's having a comical boxing match with a fat superhero (Kevin Durand), whose obesity is the subject of jokes from both Wolverine and Wraith (will.i.am). I don't know about you, but if the love of my life was just brutally murdered by my own brother, the last thing I'd do is find room for cracking weight jokes. The movie tries to give Wolverine his humanity, but how can we sympathize with this character when it's hard for us to understand what, exactly, he's motivated by? His revenge seems more convenient than genuine, especially nearing the end, when a Shocking Revelation generates a hugely underwhelming emotional response.The film was directed by Gavin Hood, whose filmography begs the question: why the hell did Fox hire this guy? He has a single well-received film to his credit ‚Äî Tsotsi ‚Äî which was also a low-budget, independent foreign feature. He may well be a very talented independent director (that has yet to be determined), but he is clearly out of his element here, much in the same way that dramatic filmmaker Marc Forster didn't know how to handle the action choreography for Quantum of Solace last year. In both cases, the studios seemed to assume that an established indie director would be able to handle a multi-billion-dollar action franchise, and in both cases, the studios were wrong. This is further evidence of the fact that multi-genre directors are under-appreciated ‚Äî just because you're good at low-key character studies doesn't prove you know how to stage huge superhero fight sequences.Rumour has it that Richard Donner stepped in to perform re-shoots early this year, which is ironic given the movie's nod - of all things - towards Superman: Wolverine, on the run from General Stryker (Danny Huston), shows up at the home of an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere. The movie attempts to develop characterization and depth within the time frame of five minutes, which makes the ultra-dramatic outcome of the elderly couple unintentionally funny: it elicited uncomfortable ""should-I-be-laughing-at-this?"" reactions in the audience. The proceeding chase sequence ‚Äî which has been put forth as the film's biggest action highlight ‚Äî is actually rather unimpressive and, at worst, goofy. The special effects are not particularly awe-inspiring, either. Oh, and they manage to add another nod towards an old film: Steve McQueen in The Great Escape. I mean, really?I haven't even had time to address the movie's numerous plot holes. The biggest one I can't even specify, because the crux of the film rests on its revelation; suffice to say, it's the perfect example of a film being built around a singular idea than around a fully-developed story. And the movie's wide array of nerd-pandering character cameos just feels forced and distracting; Ryan Reynolds, as Wade Wilson, is on-screen just about long enough for us to start warming up to him, before he proceeds to rapidly disappear from (most of) the rest of the film. Huh? And what about Dominic Monaghan as Bolt? Talk about a thankless role. I may be proved wrong, but it's my impression that fans will be upset that their favourite characters are only getting five minutes of screen time, while, to someone like myself, who's unfamiliar with the comic books, these appearances lack reason altogether. Trimming the fat would have made a leaner, more efficient and realized vehicle.There are a few redeeming qualities ‚Äî Liev Schreiber works well when the movie is in campy mode, chewing the scenery as Sabretooth. But even this positive is variable, because when he pops up in the darker sequences, his over-the-top relishing is incongruent. It's like if Robert Downey Jr.'s acerbic, eccentric characterization of Tony Stark had showed up during one of the darkest moments of The Dark Knight: it just doesn't feel right.And that phony darkness is ultimately Wolverine's most prominent flaw: in the era of the brooding superheroes, this film seems like a relic of a bygone era, devoid of any actual intensity, commitment, realism or ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî the honesty of, say, Knight or even Iron Man. And the real crime is that it wouldn't feel so hokey, so dated and so desperately misplaced if the filmmakers hadn't tried to make it something it wasn't; by introducing artificial brood, the film draws instant comparison with its superiors, relegating it to a category shared only by the 2003 Hulk as a superhero movie that at once doesn't know whether to wink knowingly at the audience or Say Something Really Important.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Huge disappointment!,"For anyone who truly likes X-Men there are only 2 good things in it and they are both performances by Ryan Reynolds and the guy who plays Gambit (from Friday Night Lights the show). Other then that the scenes are stupid and it does not make any sense. Plus, it just makes up a lot of stuff that does not even make sense. They Hollywood it, and hard, by taking something and making it its own story. It doesn't even have anything to do with the other X-Men movies. If it did then Sabertooth would simply tell Wolverine why he does not remember anything rather then there just being a random hatred. And the bone claws?!? Where did that come from? Wolverine was made the mutant he is, not conceived it with everything but the adamantium bones. If you have half a brain for good movies then you won't like this movie. If you just like action with awful writing and overacting or underacting (no median), then you may just like this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wishing MY memory could be erased after that...,"This summer's supposed ""first big movie event of the year"" fell flat... right on top of Wolverine's claws.This is the fourth X-Men movie (although the first of the ""Origins"" movies), centering specifically on our favourite snide mutant, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Focusing on numerous amounts of different tie-in stories, this tries to fill in the origination of Wolverine--how he came to be, why he makes a ""PING"" sound when hit, and his rather strange love-hate relationship with his ""rival"", Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber).""X-Men Origins"" tries to play itself off as a solid, full-proof throw to all the fans with cameos and effects, whilst still holding itself high on a 'great' plot to please all movie-goers... unfortunately, it doesn't stand long.The special effects were visually stunning, but when a movie tries to be successful by ONLY that, there's a very, very big problem. The effects are nice--explosions, big fight scenes, mutant powers galore, destruction--but the plot can't seem to make up its own mind. Leaving plenty of plot holes and jumping all around to just move along, movie-goers are left with nothing but Wolverine continuously yelling and raging to be entertained by. And I can't go on without saying that the ending was really anti-climatic and seemed rushed.I, myself, personally hate when movies try to stuff a movie full with CGI, because it's ""new"" and it's ""cooler"". But this movie isn't shy at all to give us plenty, to which it grows old and boring.But as for pluses, the movie has its funny moments. Its fight scenes are wildly exciting (for the most part). Hugh and Liev have a very unique and appealing chemistry together on screen as opposing brethren. And the cameos of popular and loved characters, like Gambit and such were a nice throw to the fans and viewers (albeit the cameos were too short, even for ""main"" characters...).""X-Men Origins"" is a decent popcorn movie. It's worth at least 1 view at the theatres, if not just for a date or to go out with friends. But aside from that, it's not a movie worth owning or even recommending in all seriousness.

Shoddy Production and Smoking Hotness,"Forged in the heat of war and personal tragedy, claw wielding Wolverine was born. Shoddy production and inconsistent writing makes me wish that X-Men Origins: Wolverine could be retroactively aborted.After his life is turned upside down, the young James Logan - Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarks on a tragic journey with co-mutant Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) that spans four wars and endless killing. When the wars finally end, they are dispatched to be members of a special squad of men sent to commit unspeakable acts. Unable to stomach the discomfort of his orders, Logan splits to find newer, more unimaginable pain. All the while Hugh Jackman is hot.It surprises me that a movie with such a large budget and characters with a following as strong as the X-Men comics could not find a company to produce quality visuals. (Good thing Hugh Jackman didn't need help with his high quality visuals.) The computer generated effects are more than 20% of the movie, and are 80% of the problem. Lighting on the actors is a different color and are at a different angle than the green screen scenery behind. The generated backdrops lack an understanding of shadow and depth of field. This basic misunderstanding of lighting irons the visuals so flat, it's impossible to suspend disbelief.The frustration is further compounded by the unnecessary use of generated objects. (And the unnecessary use of clothing on Jackman.) Instead of using models to create locations too expensive to build fully, they are created using the same disappointing generations. When props could be used to save money on the film and create a better visual effect, director Gavin Hood still uses artificially spawned effects.The writing by David Benioff and Skip Woods does not come naturally either. Events that could prove Wolverine's humanity are sped through at a pace that makes them almost comedy. The love story is so rushed, it is hard to feel their connection. Characters multiply so quickly, it is hard to keep them straight. (Except Wolverine, it is hard to miss Jackman when he is burning a hole in the screen.) Some of the one liners are as clich√© as teenage angst.The audience is forced to languish in poorly lit fight scenes that drag on in near complete darkness. Those scenes that had enough light were poorly choreographed, and it is hard to get interested in what they are doing. Well, when they have their clothes on.X-Men Origins: Wolverine has an almost orgasmic amount of pretty. I admit it shamelessly: I am in complete and total lust with Hugh Jackman, and his special attention to his body for this movie did not go unnoticed, by me or any of the other people in the theater. Jackman wasn't alone in unbelievably, moist-worthy hotness. Live Schreiber's creepy character can't outshine his ha-cha-cha-cha gorgeousness. Lynn Collin, who plays Kayla ‚Äì the love interest in the film, made me want to fall in love with her.These actors did not just rest on their beauty. Hugh Jackman was completely handcuffed by an imprisoning script. Jackman and Collins have really beautiful chemistry. My only gripe about the acting was the complete lack of emotional connection between Jackman and Schreiber. Neither gave bad performances individually but they can't seem to really bond the characters tight enough to make enough to give the story the depth.All I wanted from X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a bit of ass kicking fun. Even accounting for the Yowza Factor, X-Men Origins: Wolverine fell short. The substandard visuals made even the best looking people (Hugh Jackman) look stupid.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Finally! A Superhero Flick That Gets It!,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a non-stop romp featuring improbable scenarios, ripping biceps, and a massive amount of CGI. It is action packed, exciting, and more than a little over-the-top. In essence, it is precisely what every superhero movie should aspire to be.Alright, so the movie isn't likely to win any Oscars. To be honest, it probably won't even curry a single nomination, unless the venerable Academy decides to throw it a bone with a nod for the spectacular CGI (cheesy rendering of Patrick Stewart notwithstanding).But unlike half of the so-called dramas that are released every year, this movie isn't chuck full of pretense. It doesn't even try to push some tremendous social statement into its length. It just aims to entertain. And whether you're in the cinema looking for a touch of drama, or some explosive action, or just the latest muscle-laden action/adventure outing, you'll probably leave the theatre with a smile on your face.Why? Because there's something supremely entertaining about watching a bunch of ridiculously pumped-up (or, in the case of the superb Kevin Durand, ridiculously 'chunked-up') guys smack each other around.The film takes liberties with a few story lines, but by this point in time any fan boy with a brain stem should understand that the latest comic book-to-cinema screen outing isn't going to follow the series directly (it'd be far too difficult to bring new blood into the fold that way, don't you think?). And Taylor Kitsch may not have been the best pick for the Gambit role. And they probably could've left some of those excess mutants (Emma Frost, for instance) out of the picture. And the storyline was a tad predictable. And there were a few tragically clich√©/corny moments. But overall, the film was solid, and well worth the money I dropped on it.Seriously, take off the critic's lenses and kick back. You might find yourself enjoying it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wolverine is bland, predictable and dull","Had X-Men Origins: Wolverine been the 1st X-Men film, the other 3 would not have seen the light of day at all. Wolverine is nothing but another revenge film about a superhero with powers that make him almost invincible. Director Gavin Hood could have made such a good film that would have revived the X-Men series but instead, he chose to benchmark films like Daredevil and the first Hulk movie and in the end, barely managed to better them. Wolverine is a disaster. The young boy witnesses the death of his father and along with his mutant powers and a friend, runs off into the night to explore his might. Thus, we see the duo fight through the civil war, the world wars and the Vietnam War but unlike Dr. Manhattan, their impact seems to be minimal even though their instant healing powers make them bullet-proof as well as age-proof. Thereafter, Colonel Stryker enrolls them into a black-ops unit of mutants who go on a killing spree in Lagos and much like in the Watchmen, Logan walks away from his team as his principles differ from the murderous intentions of the rest. Even after Logan finds solace in the Rockies with his girlfriend, his psychotic brother Victor and Colonel Stryker return in his life causing loss, tragedy and rage. His thirst for revenge forces him to take on Stryker's proposal of becoming a part of the Weapons-X program where his mutant abilities take a metallic twist. The battle is then between Stryker's forces and Logan as he realizes the manipulation of evil only too late.Thin as a wafer and redundant as a normal salted one at that, Wolverine does not compel with story, plot, twists or characterization. First of all, what is the super-strength of Logan that makes him 'Wolverine'?? Retractable Metal claws that can scrape through anything and instant healing abilities that make him bullet-proof? These powers are more convincingly depicted in the 3 X-Men movies than in his solo movie here. Wolverine is supposed to be an enraged super-hero with attitude and temper issues owing to his past but he's more like a sorrowful, boring, calm guy with claws that are not put to much effective use besides the occasional action. More interesting is his nemesis Victor, who is portrayed to be a more evil and vicious character than any in the movie with powers equaling that of Wolverine. None of the characters in the film stand out due to poor characterization, worse casting and dull performances. This could easily have been a great build up to the X-Men series with interesting focus on the other superheroes of whom we get only a glimpse. The fall-out of the black-ops unit, the Weapons-X program, Logan's horrific childhood and him coming to terms with his superpowers are important aspects of the film that have been rushed through. If that wasn't enough, we are stuck with Wolverine's revenge-seeking saga against two protagonists who easily stand out more than him in character. No witty one liners, no breakthrough action sequences and familiar computer graphics take out whatever we would expect from an action-packed superhero film.Where is the compelling story telling that re-defined and revived superhero franchises such as the Incredible Hulk and Batman Begins? Where is the depth in story and characterization? What about some revolutionary never-before-seen action sequences? It is just such a disappointment to watch a superhero movie fall so flat and turn out so bland as compared to some of the recent works that we have had the pleasure of watching. - 5.48 on a scale of 1-10.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ya gotta see it, bub!","Marvel and Twentieth Century Fox hit the ground running with the first installment of their new ""X-men Origins"" series of movies. As a fan of Wolverine since he first joined the X-men in 1975, I've already gone through several revisions of Logan's history and found those on the movie to be acceptable. Younger 'purists', however, may have a problem with changes to his back story. Hugh Jackman once again did a magnificent job as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber did a wonderful job of fleshing out Sabertooth and showing him as the sociopath Marvel created instead of the brainless animal from the first X-men movie, and Taylor Kitsch was fantastic as Remy ""Gambit"" LeBeau (though I would have liked to have heard more of a Cajun dialect from him!). Over all, I give it 6 Claws Up! A Definite Must See!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen,"The score that this movie currently has is way too high. As of writing this review it has a 6.5/10 which is much better than it deserves. First, I'll mention the only positive, which is the opening credits. The opening credits show Wolverine fighting through important wars, which is much more interesting and really should have been what the movie was about. Other than that, this movie is a complete joke. For one thing, the writers clearly didn't understand any of the characters. The best example of this is Deadpool. The character literally nicknamed ""the merc with a mouth"" gets his mouth sewn shut for the majority of his screen time. The action is bad, the effects are bad, the acting is bad, it all sucks. Don't watch it. It's not only one of the worst superhero movies of all time, I'd argue it's one of the worst blockbusters ever made.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
