The Better Half,"It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in ""Volume 1."" Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of ""Kill Bill,"" released only a few months before ""Vol. 2"" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. ""Vol. 1"" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.""Vol. 2"" is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from ""Vol. 1"" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in ""Vol. 2"" he doesn't go as overboard as he does in ""Vol. 1."" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its ""Vol. 1""-style comic-book treatment. Throughout ""Vol. 2"" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. ""Vol. 1"" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of ""Vol. 2.""This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of ""Vol. 2"" tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in ""Vol. 1"" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of ""Vol. 1"" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says ""Kiddo."" You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is slow-moving, and needs ""Vol. 1"" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their ""unfinished business"" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment. I am.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Not as good as the first Volume,"The second half to Tarantino's Kill Bill movie, Volume 2 gives us an adequate ending to The Bride's quest for vengeance. I'm not blown away by Vol. 2 and it feels like a weaker version of the first Volume. Gone is the caliber of character and flair that blessed the first volume. Gone is the sense of mystery carefully cultivated in the first volume, replaced by backstory that's wholly acceptable but ultimately uninspired. The dialogue is fine as well, it's Tarantino dialogue, but still not as good as the first volume. Soundtrack is fine, but definitely not as iconic as the soundtrack of Vol. 1.Volume 2 doesn't take itself seriously, a continuation of the same signature demeanor of the first Volume, but while Vol. 1 pulled it off in an irreverent manner, Vol. 2 comes across as goofy and slightly overdone, and not goofy in a positive way.It's an OK movie, my critique sounds overly negative but 7/10 really isn't a terrible film. I just don't think this lives up to the preceding volume. I'm sure there's some deep film-lover layers of meaning that flew over my head, I saw another review waxing poetic about how this was the best thing Tarantino's ever done and talked about all the homages to other film inspiration layered into the film that I very much did not pick up on. So if that's your demographic, this might be the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's Triumph: Volume Two,"Rarely 	known a movie I've been looking forward to so much than Q.T's resumption of the Kill Bill saga. I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of courseTarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking.The actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared film-projects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them! Over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Glad to see the split.,"When I first heard that this film was going to be split into two movies instead of being presented as one as originally planned, I was angry. I accused the powers that be of trying to squeeze two box office triumphs out of a single project. But after having seen both 'Kill Bill' and 'Kill Bill Vol.2', I am glad because both films are extremely different even though the stories are tied together with primarily the same actors and having the same director. Containing less action than 'Kill Bill', volume 2 is intelligent, bizarre and extremely engrossing. It absorbs all of its elements equally and David Carradine's performance as Bill is the best thing to happen in movie villain history since, well, I'll leave that up to individual interpretation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Tarantino Masterpiece,"Over the last 40 years, I've seen a lot of movies. All types. Some great, some good and some mostly inedible; most left my breath with a sour smell. Westerns, sci-fi, comedies, dramas, etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I, I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I, of course, was premature in my prediction. The movie was, by all means, a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich, he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone (subtly), Akira Kurosawa (very subtly) and, I'm stretching it here, Ridley Scott, to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great, almost forgotten actors (Daryl Hannah, Micheal Parks, and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich, but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife, who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality, actually liked the whole movie. That in itself is an endorsement. Well done. Mr. Tarantino, you will be hard placed to match this gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A masterpiece by Tarantino.,"I've been waiting to see this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it, I loved it! it was worth the wait.Vol.2 picks up pretty much where Vol.1 left, except for some flashbacks explaining what really happened with the characters.  Uma Thurman is back as The Bride, and we get to know her real name finally.  Also Daryl Hannah comes back as Elle Driver, the one-eyed killer, Michael Madsen plays Budd, Bill's baby/loser brother, and the infamous Bill is played by David Carradine.  The performances are just great, Uma Thurman delivers a great performance as The Bride, we finally get to know her character a little better and the true reasons why she wants to ""Kill Bill"".  I also have to say that David Carradine was perfect to play Bill.  He has great charisma and he's so smooth, it's impossible not to like him.  Daryl Hannah's performance was great too, and Michael Madsen's too.Once again the music plays a key factor in this movie, is very well selected and for every single scene the music fits perfectly.  And of course, the dialogue.  In this movie, we get a lot more dialogue than brutal fighting like in Vol.1, this movie is more centered in explaining what led Bill to do what he did, it pretty much focuses in the past, explaining the whole thing. I especially liked the dialogues between Bill (Carradine) and The Bride (Thurman), I thought they were clever and just great, like all Tarantino's dialogues.  Also the locations were excelent, I have no idea where they shot the film, but the landscaping was great, I truly enjoyed it.Well it would be better to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one movie, not different, because in the end, you must see them together to understand.  So I give this movie a 10/10, I loved it, it was great, great dialogues, great performances, great fighting sequences, everything was great! And I think that Uma Thurman and/or David Carradine (at least him) should be nominated for an Oscar, they were perfect and they deserve that international film makers acknowledge that.

Honestly better than the first,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is the astonishing follow-up to perhaps 2003's best film, Kill Bill Volume 1. Quentin Tarantino once again demonstrates a mastery of dialogue in this homage to the great western and kung fu movies that inspired him from his video clerk days.Simply, this film is as entertaining as hell. Tarantino unabashedly takes the viewer for a joyride, and the end result is a movie with intense action, tempered with some of the best dialogue I have ever heard.Some have pointed to this film as inferior to the first volume of Kill Bill: I disagree. Whereas Tarantino is a great action director (the scene in the first film with the crazy 88s is one of my top five favorite battle scenes of all time), he even surpasses this talent in his ability to write witty, intriguing dialogue: and this film really delivers it. One scene in particular, with David Carradine as Bill, near the end, speaking with Uma Thurman's The Bride while he makes a sandwich, is unforgettable and insightfully interesting. There are few points where the film drags, and the movie ultimately creates the impression of a visceral experience. 10/10.

Disappointing and Overrated Sequel,"After killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), The Bride chases Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hanna).

The reason and the massacre in the Texas church are finally presented and is the best part of this volume 2.

"Different Yes, Bad, No","This movie is completely different from the first. Unlike the first with fast paced action and extreme entertainingly super-stylish gore, Kill Bill vol. 2 is everything that was missing in th first.The Bride's revenge is burning strong and we can see it in her eyes. We discover the truth behind the wedding massacre and all questions from the 1st movie are answered. We discover why the Bride is the deadliest woman in the world. We discover why Elle is missing an eye. We discover who Bill really is. We discover the Brides name. And finally we discover the truth of the secret revealed at the end of Vol. 1.Her first target is Budd. The loser bum ex-deadly assassin living in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. The short confrontation ends with one of the most terrifyingly claustrophobia-inducing (sp?) scenes ever...specially if you watch it in the dark. Then we are taken to the journey of how the Bride became the deadliest person in the world. We see the story between her and her hard-hitting very mean master Pai-Mei.After a while there is the confrontation with Elle Driver...the Battle of the Blonde Gargantuants...as Uma Thurman referred to it in an interview. This one fight scene is almost as exciting as watching the Bride battling off tons of the Crazy 88s from Vol. 1.Then the battle we were all waiting for. For Uma Thurman to Kill Bill...well I won't spoil it for you. Basically vol. 1 was 95% style 5% substance while vol. 2 is 95% substance 5% style.

The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 5 - The temporary end of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 2,"The sentimental showdownKill Bill Vol. 2 deserves to be another film than Kill Bill Vol. 1, not only the fact that the film would then run 4 hours + if it had been shown in one piece, but more because showing both films in one run might come across somewhat odd. The reason I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. The first part was more anger driven and brutal, whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This does not mean that there is no brutality in this film, but rather that the tone of the film is totally different.I must admit that it took me some getting used to in the first 20 or so minutes of the film, because I'd expected the film to go on as brutally and furious as the first one finished. It didn't happen. What I got instead was a more story and character driven film, that was filled with emotion, explanations and some good and original fighting scenes.I have no negative comments on this film I guess. I think the acting was good to very good, with the extra kudos going to Daryl Hannah, who'd let some people to believe that she as just a tall blond who couldn't act in the last couple of years. With this film she manages to show us though, that she just has not been given the right offers. This I must say seems to be some kind of quality of Tarantino, to get discarded' actors and actresses and give them an opportunity to shine once again. Speaking of Tarantino, although I do realize that with Kill Bill he was an 'hommage' to many of his influences, I just have to say that he is a great director and screenwriter. I mean, the way he directs, the music he chooses to accompany the scenes and the dialog. It's just all top notch. This does not mean that this is the best film I've ever seen, but that it is a good film, which fulfilled it's promises. I mean let us ALL be honest. Who can pull off filming a revenge movie lasting more than 4 hours without it getting dull and boring? NOBODY but Tarantino. Hell, most people can't make complete a good 90 minute flick with this amount of story.7,5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the best sequel of all time.,"Kill Bill Volume 2 has to be in the sentence with Aliens, Terminator 2, Evil Dead, and The Godfather Part II. this has to be one of the greatest sequels of all time. Quentin Tarantino hits it out of the park with his great storytelling, especially his dialogue.The movie begins with a flashback of the wedding rehearsal. This is the first time we see Bill, who was wonderfully played by Bill Carradine. In volume 1 we only saw actually never saw his face.This just as Pulp Fiction is a movie full of homages, from spaghetti westerns to giallo films. I see this movie more as an spaghetti western more than anything else. First, the music which was full of Ennio Morricone, it felt like the Dollars Trilogy all over again.Just like any Quentin Tarantino film this movie has great acting, great dialogue, and great storytelling.

"""Revenge is a Dish Best Served with Style : Kill Bill Volume 2""","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is the mesmerizing conclusion to the Bride's epic quest for vengeance, masterfully blending heartbreak, philosophy, and relentless action into a seamless narrative that elevates the saga into the realm of legend. This installment peels back the layers from the adrenaline-soaked chaos of Volume 1, diving deeper into themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the intricacies of human relationships-all while maintaining the gritty edge that has made the series iconic.Uma Thurman returns as the Bride, also known as Beatrix Kiddo, with an intensity that captivates and compels. In this chapter, her journey is not just about retribution but also reflects a profound exploration of her own identity as she confronts the ghosts of her past. The film elegantly juxtaposes blood-soaked violence with moments of raw vulnerability, creating an emotionally resonant experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Tarantino's storytelling prowess shines through as he deftly balances the film's tone, oscillating between heart-pounding action and poignant character development. The showdown between the Bride and her former mentor, Pai Mei, played without restraint by the legendary Gordon Liu, is a highlight-an unforgettable clash rich with martial artistry that showcases Tarantino's ability to honor classic cinema while making it distinctly his own.""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" continues to enchant with its cinematic artistry. The stark landscapes, the grainy black-and-white flashbacks, and the final, unforgettable duel between the Bride and Bill (the remarkable David Carradine) are not just battles; they are emotional reckonings filled with tension and poignant reflections on love, loss, and sacrifice. The film is as much a meditation on the complexities of human connections as it is a tale of revenge.The film's score, curated with Tarantino's signature flair, serves as a powerful undercurrent to the unfolding drama, heightening every moment-whether it's the grim culmination of the Bride's journey or the quieter, reflective scenes that showcase the humanity within each character. The dialogue crackles with the wit and sharpness we've come to expect from Tarantino, making even the most mundane interactions feel laden with meaning.""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" ultimately transforms the narrative from a straightforward revenge saga into a deeply layered exploration of choices and consequences. It's a bold reminder that revenge often comes at a cost-one that the Bride must confront head-on. With this film, Tarantino masterfully wraps up his tribute to the heroes and villains of classic cinema, crafting a conclusion that is both satisfying and thought-provoking.In the end, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is not merely a sequel; it is a rich, compelling tapestry of storytelling that stands on its own. This is the film that embraces the full spectrum of the human experience-a blend of vengeance and healing, brutality and grace. Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster that is undeniably badass, leaving audiences in awe of the enduring power of the Bride and her unwavering resolve. This final chapter is a triumph that solidifies ""Kill Bill"" as a landmark in modern cinema and a testament to Tarantino's genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A bit of a slog.,"A bit of a slog really after the fast paced first film. Here things slow right down, almost until the story stops at times. We get weighed down in lengthy baggy exposition that somehow still manages to answer very few questions. There's about 10 minutes of probable brilliance in here, the rest is pretty average though. The film does have an inevitability about it we are more waiting now for our main character to arrive at the final destination.

Beyond the action,"For many, Tarantino can perceive as a director of action because of his usage blood -In special of this film they used 450 gallons of blood- or strong violent scenes. But because of his professional background, he is also cinephilé. In this movie we can see every elements of ""pure Tarantino"". In one hand, it's pure action movie -especially vol 1.- but on the other hand, It's combination and reinterpretation of B type movies. Especially we can see his homage to Sergieo Leone and Asian cinema or culture. However this movie to me interrogate more important point than revenge. It's motherhood. We can see behind every struggle Beatrix puts we see the protection of the child. To make sense of the movie, I prefer to attribute it to motherhood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Less  killing than the first but still nice.,"Kill Bill Volume 2 follows the Bride to its last target of her death list and although this movie lacks the killing spree of the first its dialogue and performance are great and we also learn here about her back story, why the Assassin Viper Squad tried to kill her and her relationship with Bill (it was more intimate than I though).In general the movie close all the lose ends than the previous had left as well as giving us with a good way the identity of the Bride ,which was a secret during the Volume 1. So when the movie ends the story is practically 100% finished and I believe that Tarantino tried to do just that, made a two part movie,now the why I don't have any idea, but as the third movie in a franchise is usually the worst and some times destroys the story of the previous two, see for instance Spiderman 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Matrix Revolution and X-men the Last Stand, I think he made a good choice.In the Volume 1 the love of Quentine for the Japanese culture and the samurai sword was obvious ,for Christ sake about 65% of the movie takes place in Japan! In this one we see his love for the martial ,but we also have some nit picks of western ,like a sunrise and some more (No spoilers!). I generally like the on equal measure this two flicks, for are really cool and tell a story ark of an kick ass female assassin ,which isn't the norm as we have see in leads role women in a handful of action films, like the Alien and Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Mad Max: Fury Road.

a shell of the first movie,"I was very disappointed in the sequel to kill bill.  I thought the first movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  However the 2nd was just an average movie. If I didn't know any better, I would bet that the 2nd kill bill was by a different director.  Not only wasn't the story told as well as the first one, but the story itself was also not as interesting.  Most of the dialogue was cheesy and the action scenes did not have that magnificent feel that they had in the first kill bill. There were so many things in the first movie that gave it an epic like feel that were foolishly left out of the 2nd movie.  One was the list kept by the bride on people that she had to kill.  You would think with the significance the list played in the first movie, that at least she would cross out bills name when she had done the job.  However the list was nowhere to be found. With the incredible battle scenes that were in the first movie, you would expect the final scene with bill to trump all them.  But again, it didnt even come close.  The final scene where she gets bill was as anticlimactic and boring as you can get.

The some sort of underrated volume,"I thought the first volume was great fun, and you can tell Quentin had fun making it too. But to me, Vol. 2 felt a lot more 'complete' and well-rounded than the first one, which was action- packed and quite messy in my honest opinion. Vol. 2, although not filled with action, it was the most enjoyable for me. It was dramatic, beautifully choreographed, and of course well-written. Every QT-movie is well-written, but because this relied less on the action, and more on the dialog, it felt like it was better written too.So what Mr. Tarantino has done here, is quite amazing. He has made two movies, which are one complete story, and belongs together as a whole - but still managed to make two movies in the complete opposite directions. So it all comes up to which mood you are in.

It transcends its genre and becomes Tarantino's most thoughtful and sophisticated work,"In my brief, initial review of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.' I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.But that's far from all.In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool', Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence. If anything, it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa's work. Remarkable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Vol 1 was more about action, with a massive fight scene towards the end.

It really is the 100% honest truth that I cannot differentiate these in terms of quality. But with how different they are, you'd think that it would be easy.Vol. 1 focuses on being a martial arts film homage, with tons of crazy action and violence to satisfy actions fans and provide so much incredible, visceral, extravagant entertainment. Vol. 2 is just as entertaining and engaging but for different reasons. There is violence, but it's certainly less frequent. Instead of extended scenes of action, we get a whole lot of extended dialogue exchanges, which if you go through Tarantino's filmography, is honestly what you get the most out of his films, by and large (despite his reputation for being a filmmaker who packs his films with violence, Kill Bill Vol. 1 in my eyes is his only true action film; that and maybe the second half of Death Proof). The dialogue is fantastically written, and even more impressively, likely wouldn't sound as great if this film wasn't so well cast and acted. This is Uma Thurman's greatest performance; as fantastic and cool as she is in the first volume, Vol. 2 is where she really gets to shine as an actress, as she goes through a whole host of emotions and commits entirely to a role that I'm sure a lesser performer would not take as seriously. David Carradine is also amazing here. I haven't seen much else with him in it, but he brings so much to what could otherwise be a very simple character, and for as terrible as Bill acted, and for as occasionally creepy as he can be, he really feels like a real person. You truly buy the chemistry between him and Thurman (despite the- again, slightly creepy- age difference), and he proves to be an oddly tragic villain. You want The Bride to indeed 'kill Bill,' but at the same time, perhaps you don't. Anytime Thurman and Carradine share the screen, time slips away and the film is utterly captivating.Despite having less action, many of the things that were fantastic about the first volume are just as fantastic here. The look of the film is breathtaking, with a greater focus on paying visual homage here to old westerns rather than the martial arts references found in the first volume- although there is an extended flashback dealing with The Bride's martial arts training that reproduces and pays loving homage to similar old martial arts movies brilliantly. All the music here is selected and used just as perfectly as the amazing soundtrack in the first part. And there are sequences here that while not as over-the-top as the climactic fight against The Crazy 88 in the first, prove just as memorable. Scenes like a one-on-one swordfight in such an enclosed space that one participant cannot even unsheathe their sword, and a painfully drawn-out sequence that will have you on edge, even if you don't think yourself usually susceptible to claustrophobia. And then there's the surprisingly hard-hitting emotion of the whole thing. Vol. 2 is where the characters left standing after Vol. 1 start to feel like real people, and the whole concept of revenge becomes something less simple and straightforward; something that is perhaps even critiqued. The movie gives its characters time to breathe and speak, not just fight, and that's when the surprisingly deep character traits and frequently relatable emotional dilemmas begin to make themselves apparent.I could understand Vol. 1 being seen by some as the better film, and honestly I have no ill will against anyone preferring one of the volumes over the other. For me, they'll always remain equal, proving unbelievably satisfying in their own unique ways while also blending together to create a perfect revenge epic that runs for about four blissfully cinematic hours. Vol. 2 has as much artistic merit as the first despite its different approach and focuses, and I believe as long as you're open to the story continuing in a matter you might not be expecting after the kinetic, violent, and relentless Vol. 1, you should come away satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Great ending to a brilliant epic,"Kill Bill Vol 2. is an awesome conclusion to a great movie double. If you liked the first one, you should definitely get a kick out of seeing the remaining members of the viper squad killed.This is more like a Tarantino of old, and has all of the witty dialog we have come to expect from the modern master. There's a great deal of it to, but that is not to say that there aren't any great fights in this. If anything, the battles are just as enjoyable here, though they are certainly more concise.Everything about this film is fantastic. The acting is great from everyone, particularly Madsen and Carradine. The characters have a load of depth, much more then the first part, and even the lesser known characters will be remembered. The score is up to the usual high standard, with some really cool references to some other classic films by a certain Western Director.If you are able, it is best to watch the two flicks back to back: both are easily some of the best to come out in modern times. An instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Stimulating and thrilling second part that closes the splendid volume,"In this incredible 2ª part by the great screenwriter and director Quentin Tarantino finishes the revenge executed by ¨the bride¨(Uma Thurman) started in Kill Bill vol. 1. After having deleted two names of her black list , the ¨Black Mamba¨(Uma) returns for the vengeance on Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hanna) , the sole survivors of the murderer commando that betrayed her four years ago . Black Mamba attempts to annihilate her enemies , and at the end she'll try to obtain her main objective : Kill Bill, the prior chief and lover and the man who ordered her execution .If you have seen the Volume 1, you know about unstopped action and black humor but without the Volume 2, you'll only know the halve history . Tarantino said that in Vol.1 tried the making a Kung-Fu film developed in Japan , while in the Vol.2 to make a Spaghetti Western . There are various homages to several movies , thus : Hong Kong films of the Shaw Brothers , Kung-Fu television series when David Carradine himself appears playing the flute , musical score and sets of the Italian Western or Spaghetti .
In the picture there are murders , frenetic action , chop-socky , tension , shootouts and a little bit of gore when the violent struggles happen . Uma Thurman is magnificent , her fights against the enemies are breathtaking , the hard training with the Kung-Fu master Yuen Woo Ping have created a exciting and very well choreography struggle scenes . David Carradine who in the first part makes an invisible intervention here is the starring and he's top-notch. And a moving musical score composed by director Robert Rodriguez who remades Spaghetti classy music and at the end there's a gorgeous song .

Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2,"At the time ""Kill Bill"" came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not pay any attention to ""details"". I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and ""fun"" is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a ""fanboy"". ""Kill Bill"" is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless. For movies like this one even ten is depreciation.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I feel so cheated SPOLIERS,"Kill Bill Volume 1 was a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that but this huge dissapointment Tarantino calls a second half does not do it justice. So many things make no sense and go against the whole style of the movie. Even the soundtrack sucks compared to the first. If you havent seen it yet dont read on SPOLIERS: The part when she is buried alive in the coffin and manages to not only break the coffin open, but she manages to get through all the hundreds of pounds of dirt that are coming in by what can only be described as flying through it to the top. So she can fly now, great. The whole scene with Elle is too short, and the sword fight doesnt last long at all. Another scene that was over promoted was the introductory chapel scene, Tarantino and others blew it out of proportion before its release saying that it was the whole scene of what really happened. In reality, they didnt even need to show it at all. All it shows of the actual ""massacre"" is a few seconds after the D.I.V.A.S. walk into the chapel (from behind no less), only to slowly back away from the chapel and only hear whats happening inside for about 10 seconds. And what the hell happened to Budd?? There's no big fight scene, theres no nothing with him and the bride, + he went from being one of the worlds most elite assassins to a poor alchaholic living in a trailer who's working as a bouncer at some strip club and it doesn't even say why. And he's randomly Bill's brother now and it barely mentions something about some kind of argument between them but nothing more. And Elle has him killed because she regrets that he killed The Bride when she told him to do it?!?! In Addition, the scene with the chinese assassin makes no sense, as assassins do not just leave their marks out of compassion or whatever you want to call it. Tarantino also cut the scene with the most potential which was Yuki's Revenge. The biggest injustice of all however, has to be the final scene between Bill and the Bride. Kill Bill is the title of the movie, and you'd think that The Bride's and Bill's fight would be some kind of epic battle, considering that the bride had such a hard time killing his assassins who don't even have half of the training or skills that he has. But no, the scene lasts for probably a little under a minute, and Bill puts up no kind of fight at all. I thought it was gonna be the climax of the movie! If their battle would have been longer I would have a much better opinion of the film. This movie does have some funny moments, and a few good scenes (especially the one with Pai Mei). I saw the first in theatres multiple times, and it remains one of my favorite movies, so me being so dissapointed with this one really says something about it. And it's not because it was ""slow"" because most of the best movies of all time are ""Slow"" and i've always been a fan of Tarantino's dialouge. And don't listen to any of this **** about it being complete now, this should have been one movie, it would have be much better and Tarantino would have had to cut some of the pointless and stupid crap making which would make the movie a great whole instead of a brilliant first half with a conclusion that pales in comparison.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Perfect sequel,"I wrote in my review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 that perhaps in the second film there would be an explanation as to how the Black Mamba became so skilled and what really was the root of her deep hatred and anger towards Bill. Well, in the first we can easily deduce that because Bill and his crew shot up the wedding and left Beatrix in a coma that she was more than entitled to her revenge.I found it profound how much we learned about Budd and how unworthy he is to be part of the DVAS. Honestly, I wonder how the hell he earned his place. What was his specialty other than being a greedy smart alec? I digress. Kill Bill Vol. 2 wraps everything up near-perfectly. The Bride already has a couple names checked off on her list as we come into the second film. Budd, Elle, and Bill are all that remain and let's just say Copperhead and Cottonmouth were like the warm-up laps before the race, the real competition. Each of the remaining DVAS members have unique challenges to offer Beatrix. I don't know how to put into words how perfect this film is. From beginning to end you're wondering what's going to happen next. And everything that does happen is so well thought out and fits the characters so perfectly that it adds so much more depth and appreciation for the movie.The ending may or not be what you're expecting. I'll just say it was both for me. It was a beautiful ending. These two films taught me a lot about honor. Obviously it's all fiction, but just like in Kill Bill Vol. 1 when Copperhead and Black Mamba are fighting in the house and the school bus pulls up, Black Mamba chooses not to fight in front of the little girl. She knew her beef was between the girls mother and that the little girl wasn't aware of how deadly and evil Copperhead truly was. That is just a very mild example of how, despite the overwhelming hatred Black Mamba harbors towards the rest of the squad, she still has the ability to be better than a mindless killing machine. Her enemies are highly-trained fighters. Each confrontation is like the beginning of a symphony and all you can do is sit back and let the melody of the swords carry you to the final heartbeat of either Beatrix or her foe.I look forward to a possible third installment!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Masterpiece Moviemaking from 'The Man'...,"Watching both volumes of this wonderfully energetic epic, one is reminded how much Quentin Tarantino adores movies.  His enthusiasm in paying homage to the westerns, kung-fu flicks and gangster thrillers that have shaped his life is infectious and tremendously welcome considering the vast sea of banality churned out each year by studios who are more infatuated with the bottom line than with the artistic merit.'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a more talkative conclusion than one would expect after having seen 'Volume 1'.  Oh sure, it has tons of action sequences and tension filled scenes, but there are signature Tarantino conversations littered throughout.  This film gives more weight to the first, explaining and giving dimension to the characters and their actions.The film picks up where the other left off, as The Bride (Thurman) is half way through her list of people to kill.  Budd (Madsen), Elle Driver (Hannah) and of course Bill (Carradine) are still to be found and disposed of in a gruesome manor.What makes Tarantino so wonderful is his layering of plot threads.  He is able to intersperse sequences so that we are given vital information which we are not immediately aware that we will need later in the storyline.  He has such complete control of his timing and rhythm as a filmmaker, and keeps us unaware of that directorial manipulation by using humor and wit and intelligence amidst a blur of action and violence.  This talent makes watching a Tarantino film an event.  I am already looking forward to his next film.The drudgery of having to slog through another special effects bonanza (yawn), or a teeny-bopper romance (puke), or an animated kiddie-flick (ugh), or a gross-out comedy (frown)... All of that nonsense is made tolerable by those dozen or so films each year that show some originality, flare, passion and brilliance.  It is almost guaranteed that a Tarantino film will possess those qualities and be one to remember.  That's why they already have courses at major universities devoted entirely to his small repertoire of films.I only have two quibbles with the entirety of 'Kill Bill'.   The film should have been released as one long movie.  I don't mind the splice too much, except for the fact that Miramax charged me twice when they said it was not a decision based on financial gain.  But I feel the film will be a delight to watch as a whole when it is released as a special edition DVD sometime this Christmas.I must also admit to being a tad underwhelmed by the final few minutes of the saga.  I like the fact that it ended in a manor that was completely unexpected... but... it almost ended with a whimper.  I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill here, but I think there is a better ending to be found deep the recesses of QT's mind.I also want to send out my mocking laughs to those who left the moment the credits started to roll.  True film lovers never leave a film that they like the moment the writing hits the screen... I only do that to films I hate. It is disrespectful to the filmmaker and to the other members of the audience who don't want to peer around you and your tub-o-popcorn to see what they paid for.  Anyway, those who left missed two more sequences of film.  And I hope Tarantino doesn't include them on the DVD so that you'll never get a chance to see them.As for the 'Kill Bill' legacy... I think it's a marvelous display of a genius filmmaker having delirious fun with all of his influences and showing off every ounce of talent that he can pour onto the screen.  Is it as earth-shattering as 'Pulp Fiction'?  No.  Is it as well written as 'Pulp' or 'Reservoir Dogs'?  No.  'Kill Bill' is not an example of masterpiece filmmaking.  It is too silly and over-the-top for that description.  But is an example of masterpiece moviemaking that very few people will ever be able to duplicate.  There is a big difference between filmmaking and moviemaking, and Tarantino is a master of both.  His gaggle of imitators should find their own paths otherwise they will languish in paled comparison to 'THE MAN'.The full feature will be a joy to watch over the years.  It will hold up very well over time.  The first volume made my Top Ten List for 2003 and I have very little doubt that the second will make my 2004 list.  I hope it isn't 2010 before Tarantino makes one of my lists again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
And Tarantino Knocks One Out The Park,"And Tarantino brings his cinematic opus to a close.But not in a way that people expected. This has hardly any of Vol. 1's searing colours, splashing crimson or R-rated cartoons. Instead Tarantino, a true genius of modern cinema, immerses himself in characters and dialogue. He reveals all exposition and backstory vitally missing from the first installment. And he does it with sheer class. Utterly beautiful shots, perfect performances and his trademark humour blacker than Elle Driver's eye patch.But this is a true case of substance finally killing style, unlike Vol. 1. The emotional journey that the Bride goes through is stunning. And both Thurman and Carradine deliver iconic performances filled with weight and depth. And the final scenes, drenched in emotion and operatic Morricone are some of the best Tarantino or anybody has ever done.In short one of the best films of the last ten years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Vol 2, More Character, Less Action but equally as good","Where the first film grabbed our attention, with its visuals, action and a special brand of Tarantino violence. Volume 2 takes you back through the characters and fills in the background to the story and the rivalry between the them.Equally as good as the first (an opinion not shared by everyone) this film is closer to Tarantino's usual style where the story and dialogue carry the film more than the action and the violence. There are still ample thrills and some good fights, but i have to say its the revelations in the plot and the ending that do it for me. Very clever and subtle, and really very funny (in a strange way) this was the perfect end to Tarantino's latest masterpiece.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Better then vol 1 but still disappointing,"Yes, I found this movie ended as a complete rip off to the Jet Li film Kiss of the Dragon, and that was disappointing to me, in the film's defense, I was glad the movie was a more traditional martial arts film then vol1, Carradeine, and Thurman were incredible, and the movie was watchable and oftentimes, enjoyable.Vol 1 was a pen and ink drawing with little detail just outlining Vol 2 was made to color it in and add some detail... I think they accomplished this very well.Overall a good film.  I loved Samuel Jackson as the wedding organist :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
impressive second part,"Continuing the other film, vol. 2 tell us the story of the revenge of the Bride. After killing Vermita Green and O'Ren Ishii, Black Mamba continues its duty by searching Budd and Elle, in order to later kill Bill. Much less violent that the first part, vol. 2 is much more poetic, as it tells us many things about the motivations of the characters. The curious resignation of Budd(impressive Michael Madsen, absolutely fantastic), the evilness of Elle (unexpected Daryl Hannah) and the total charisma of Bill (mythic Carradine) marks the development of the drama, as the Bride meets everyone. With a delicious treatment of the dialogues and the music this is possibly, the best film from Tarantino and his violent universe. This time though, the violence is most psychological rather that physic, its more an impressive fight of wills which builds one of the best films of the decade of 2000. Despite that, remember that it is a Tarantino film. there is not much violence on the movie, but it is totally present in every moment of the film, which cannot result comfortable to everybody.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Those Coming Late to the Party and are Watching on DvD Watch Both Films Back-to-Back,"I took the time to read the many reviews from when the film was first released. I was honestly not surprised by the negativity. When I watch a film I do my best to get into the director's and actor's heads to try and understand a film's back story. This is especially important with a director like Tarrantino who doesn't just mindlessly present scenes. Tarantino uses every scene to make a point and often these aren't obvious. I repeat: every scene has a purpose.The single most important thing to understand is the Kill Bill is an homage to the Shaw Brothers Hong Kong-made 'Chop Sockie' films, the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone's grand soundtracks, 1970s Japanese samuri TV programming, and even Robert Rodriguez's 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' trilogy. Personally, I love homage, and so for me I rewatched both films perhaps a half dozen times just to be sure I picked up on all of them.The film is non-linear but it doesn't jump around creating confusion. The linearity of the film is occasional broken up with flashbacks, which are strategically employed to explain the heroine's actions. One thing important to keep in mind is that Tarantino doesn't expect anyone to take either film completely serious: neither did Leone or Rodriguez. In fact, the best comparison would be to opera, with it's demonstrative acting (and over acting) and especially its melodrama. Wheras Volume 1 was rather filled with edged weapon splatter and loads of fighting, Volume 2 is far more thought-provoking but in both the behavior of the actions of the characters shouldn't be seen as normal human behavior. As in the John Wick films these people live in an u real bubble that permits them to behave in ways that would be riciculously impossible for the audience. Tarantino demands that we suspend disblief for the duration and follow his characters. If we do that these two films become highly entertaining and engrossing, and at times even very touching and sentimental in the classic sense of the best 'B Movies'.Some reviewers harp about the ending, calling it anticlimatic and disappointing. In rreality it's neither. I suppose the more simple-minded expected and wanted to see a climatic sword fight between chief antagonist Bill and the vengeful Beatrix but that would have been unfortunate had it occurred. Instead we see something else; a rather surprising end to Bill and Beatrix. The Bride gets her revenge but as with almost every instance of revenge she learns that it's double-edged. The Chinese saying goes: before setting out for revenge first dig two graves. Beatrix achieves her ultimate revenge but she pays a price. The viewer might consider what that price may be.One could spend a lot of time analyzing character behavior but since much of it is psychopathic, it's likely to prove unsatisfying. In their own ways each of the characters is nasty but with a few notable exceptions they have their moments of humanity and when they occur they've almost jarring in their incongruity. Watch for them! And be sure to watch all the end credits since the film doesn't conclude until Robert Rodriguez's final tune ends and there are a few important details therein that help explain the characters. Tarantino expects the audience to tune out during the credits but those who do will end up missing explanatory details.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Exactly as it should be,"After the first showed us what an efficient killer The Bride was, this provides the background that makes it all matter, and gives her a human face. If you only watch the former, you may walk away thinking that it was nothing more than a revenge flick, if an excellent one at that. You may believe that the characters were thought up for the sake of the retribution. It is, in fact, the vengeance that helps complete, and provide satisfaction, for the overall story-line. I can imagine people being disappointed by this... the first had non-stop action, and to the undistinguishing eye may have looked almost ""mainstream"", and perhaps they thought that Tarantino had changed his tune. This is not the same as Vol. 1, and it shouldn't be. There were incredible martial arts in that, and while what there is of that is, again, amazing, there is considerably less of it. The style of wuxia with some Western added in is still very much present. This is quite emotionally straining. I can understand if there are those who would go so far as to call it outright abusive to the audience. It definitely is brutal, and unforgettable. The non-linear time-line is impeccably well-used here. I can't compliment the editing and cinematography enough. The writing is beyond reproach. All of the dialog is marvelous. The acting is spot-on, every single person. This is immensely well-scored by Rodriguez. There is no direct sexuality, only references. The violence is bloody and gory. There is plenty of strong language in this. This has disturbing content, and many are not going to be able to stand it. The DVD comes with a making-of featurette upwards of half-hour in length, a trailer for each of the director's movies, including these two, a deleted fight scene of three and a half minutes, and an eleven minute music performance by Robert and his band, Chingon. All of them are worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Quentin's, Uma's or of film-making. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"It's Good, But Not Better Than The First","It's fine but it could have been better. The first one was entertaining, artistic, action-packed, impressive, archetype... it was something special! Also, Uma Thurman's performance was better in Vol. 1 (she won a Saturn Award and an Empire Award for her performance in this movie and it was the first time she won so many awards and nominations).
Vol. 2 is quite decent but honestly, too much dialogue ruined it. Also, music could have been better. Performances are good, especially David Carradine, who steals the show this time and Daryl Hannah (they both won a Saturn Award for their work in Kill Bill Vol. 2). However, it has more depth and backstory but then again it was too slow-paced.
Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job in Kill Bill Vol. 1 (he proved to the viewers that he was not only a good screenwriter, but also an awesome filmmaker) but Vol. 2 was a bit mediocre comparing to the first one. It lacks on action and badassity, Uma's performance was mediocre, music was mediocre and too much unecessary dialogue lowed it.

However, this change in tempo may serve as a double-edged sword; while it adds depth, it might disappoint those keen on relentless action. The performances are emotionally compelling and physically arresting, encapsulating a journey of both vengeance and self-discovery. The antagonist adds layers of charm and malevolence, heightening both the tension and the stakes.

# 117??,"So sad that this awful, clumsy pastiche of clichés should generate so much sycophantsy in favour of that horrid little man Quentin Tarantino. This film has not even been out for five months and already it is at #117 on the list of IMDb top films of ALL TIME (!?!). If you want to watch a REAL Western as opposed to a facsimile of a Western, go and watch ""ONce Upon a Time in the West"" or even ""The Searchers"" again. Those films are difficult, trying, multiple meaning-generating masterworks. Those films still seems fresh, this one is tired and show-offy, without having a real sense of CiNeMa about it. ""Pulp Fiction"" (Tarantino's only good film in my opinion) is worthy, watch that again and tell me that this is not a vastly inferior work. Tarantino's cinema has always been plastic, self consciously fake, but at least Pulp-Fiction dares to have fun with its genre-bending tendencies. This film is merely a compendium of spot-the-film-references, with a couple of snide, jokey one liners to compensate. It is a fashion magazine-like tour through the landscape of the Western and other less respectable genres (as observed in terms of the 'centre', that dreary institution known as the AFI).Granted, it is nice to see interest generated in older and less-known genres by younger generations, but all this does is to highlight how much better those films are and how intellectually bankrupt endeavours like this are. It is for this film to be informed by the history of cinema, but not for it to merely lift from that past willy-nilly without adding a iota of insight or critical meta-commentary of his own. QT, in my opinion, is a brat who deserves a spanking with a large wooden paddle. He may embody the Northern Californian ideal; a proud loudmouth, not coy about much, self consciously playing a role to his adoring fans, a natural entertainer, the grand high poo-bah of all film nerds (or ""cineastes"", whichever is preferable). That would be fine, if the films were any good. They're not (beyond ""Pulp Fiction"" which, as I have stated, is an unqualified masterpiece). There is a lot of myth-generating riding on the quality of that ONE film. Unfounded.

An interesting second part.,"The second part starts just after the first and I watched the films continuously so it kind of kept me more involved than anything else. Well whatever this second part was also very great but I felt at some points that it lacked the amount of interest that was present in the first part. If I do not compare it in any sense with the first one then I am sure this one stands alone with a different reputation. May be because in this part they focused on the back story and lacked the energy which was going on continuously in the first film. But no complains what so ever. I am just comparing till now. Otherwise this film is also a master piece in its own sense. Things are shown in such realities that I at some point of time was thinking like oh please do not do this way or that.

In Vol.2, she's more focused on trying to get out of sticky situations, to make sure that her enemies get what they deserve. Although Vol.1 was more enjoyable, Vol.2 helps bring everything to a close, with an ending that's better to be left unspoiled. But, there were some scenes that dragged off from it's place, and there were some times where I got uninterested. But overall, this is an expertly made homage that only Tarantino can make. In his short scenes, the late great David Carradine delivers a beautiful performance as Bill. You see him as a nice man on the outside, at first, but you can easily tell that he's a monster on the inside. It's a real damn shame that David Carradine passed away, years after the first two movies were released. These movies really showed what a superstar he really was. Although the first volume of the story was my favorite of the two movies, Volume 2 doesn't disappoint. This is a well-made, and somewhat enjoyable that deserves all the praise necessary. Beautifully directed, acted, written, shot, edited, and paced. ""Kill Bill: Vol.2"", in my review, ""expertly portrayed, a thrilling Tarantino feature"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Vol. 1 Was Dessert--This Is the Main Course,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is the second half of one large story, and it creates a cohesive whole with the first part, but in many ways it's a completely different movie from Vol. 1. The first half was all about movement--it was almost balletic in its merging of images and music. Vol. 2 slows down, WAY down, to create a stoic, mythic conclusion. Where events in Vol. 1 rushed by in a glib montage, with blood spewing and limbs flying around the screen in a parody of film violence, everything about Vol. 2 feels heavy with consequence---there's much less violence, but what there is feels like it matters far more.Uma Thurman gave a nimble, athletic performance in Vol. 1, but really impresses here with her ability to get to the dramatic bottom of her character. Beatrix Kiddo's conflict emerges---she becomes a flesh and blood human character rather than a comic book hero seeking revenge. David Carradine, as Bill, is the second part's most significant addition, and he plays his part perfectly. And I got a kick out of Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, who turns in a memorable cameo in the first part, but really gets a chance to strut her stuff in the second.I don't think it's a criticism of Tarantino's films to say that the first part is all style while the second part is the substance; it's like eating your dessert before the main meal. I think Tarantino would be the first to agree, and both parts exhibit all the signs of being thoughtfully and carefully assembled. One thing you're never in doubt of when dealing with Tarantino is that you're seeing the exact movie he wants you to see.But why spend time worrying about which one is better or which one succeeds more? They're both part of the same movie---one wouldn't exist without the other. And they're both remarkable.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A little bit slow,"This movie is a little bit slow if you compare it with the 1st Vol. Also, there are a few actions scenes in Vol. 2. Also, some scenes are very boring. Tarantino tried to add some emotion in this part. However, I think that even with a lot action scenes Vol. 1 has better emotional aspect than Vol. 2. When we see that our bride become childless and raped while in coma at Vol. 1, it carries a lot of emotion. But Vol.2 is weaker in every aspect than Vol.1. The scene with the Chinese master doesn't seem real. Also, there should have been a better fight scene between the Kiddo and Bill. However, this is not still a bad movie. For understanding the whole story, we have to watch this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another masterpiece,"Warning: There may be spoilers Once again Tarantino excels. This film is more dialogue driven than it's predecessor, however is just as enjoyable.

However like it's predecessor this film also features excellent supporting work. David Carradine in particular give an outstanding performance in his villainous role. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are also excellent in this Martial Arts flick. Overall Vol 2 is just as enjoyable as Vol 1 and will satisfy a large range of viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Better than the first,"I read somewhere Tarantino said Kill Bill is one movie, but I think that's stupid. This one is way better than the first one, I think maybe because the audience knows her daughter is still alive so there's some dramatic weight to the whole thing, it's not just a bunch of action sequences.

"Good, but not half as cool.","The movie was a flat out disappointment.  It was good, but not half as cool as the first, and the directing style and story pacing felt completely different.It was like watching another movie altogether, and the movie isn't even a true sequal.  I think that Tarentino had too much time to get into the characters because of splitting the movie.  Instead on concentrating on 'Cool', he concentrated on character and plot development.  This is normally a great, great thing that Hollywood needs more of, but in this case, I feel it back-fired.Don't get me wrong, Kill Bill Vol.2 is a good movie.  It's just not nearly as good as the original, and it feels like a plot based movie instead of a cool action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another overrated Tarantino film,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a step above the first Kill Bill because of David Carradine's role as Bill.  However, that is not saying much because the movie goes on so many tangents that are very distracting.   I don't understand why Kill Bill wasn't made into one movie.  I saw no reason that the two movies together could have been cut to two hours.  It spends too much time with extranous characters and situations that I simply lost patience.  None of Bill's associates are very interesting.  I don't care if you have an eye patch, Daryl Hannah, you are not a threatening assassin and don't get me started on your acting.  Quentin Tarantino seems to forget that action movies have to move fast with little dialouge or character development.  Instead we have too much talk and we learn too much about Bill's associates than we care about.  We want to see the Bride and Bill go at it one on one.  Unfortunately, it takes too long for us to get there.  We want to see the associates disposed of quickly and move on to Bill.  5/10 for its stylishness but fatally overlong.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
a lesson,"it could be an art lesson. a fundamental one. because Tarantino presents slices from his impressive cinematographic culture like each teacher in a seminary. like a confession more than a lesson. like a demonstration of the force of cinema more than a simple movie. the second part of Kill Bill is almost more important / seductive/ powerful than the first. because it is a bat. to preserve the same rhythm. to use same fascination force. to give something unexpected. against the simple fact to be known everything, from the plot to the predictable final. story of survive, Kill Bill is more than a version of Count of Monte Cristo. it becomes legendary from its birth. as an impeccable challenge. as a great show. as touching demonstration of high science to explore each opportunity. and each detail.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""Beyond your years""","The exploitation movie – that branch of cheap and violent movies that includes Spaghetti Westerns, Kung Fu, zombie horrors and many other subgenres – has rarely run to epics. These were bottom-line products, made at low cost for (supposedly) unsophisticated audiences, and usually clocked in around the 80 minutes mark. Grand, overarching themes were rarely explored, and the main goal for the filmmakers was generally a high body count and maybe a bit of sex. With Kill Bill however Quentin Tarantino creates a grand, sweeping homage, the exploitation movie to end all exploitation movies, a two-part meditation on the very nature of revenge and killing.As with its predecessor, Volume 2 is a patchwork of references to Tarantino's favourite pictures. This time round he is, if anything, even more flagrant in his referentialism. The flashback at the start of the picture features some rhythmic cross-cutting between close-ups like one of Sergio Leone's early features (notable exceptions as exploitation epics). Then there's a Kung Fu segment which mimics not only the clichés of Hong Kong cinema but also the style of humour and overused zoom lens. Is it theft? Not really. It's channelling the influences in the way one might reshape Romeo and Juliet or La Dame aux Camelias into some other work.Tarantino doesn't just borrow the motifs and camera-work of his cinematic forebears, he also encourages the eerie, taciturn acting that characterised Leone's pictures. Uma Thurman's range broadens even more here. It's amazing the way she is able to portray Kiddo as a tough fighter while still retaining her sensitivity. David Carradine is at his best here in the title role, a model of seductive evil, credible as both the killer and the kind lover and father.And really these two dual-natured performances characterise something that is fundamental to Kill Bill. It's a movie about killing, and one that does not shy away from the sensationalist violence of the exploitation flick, but it is also a movie with a lot of heart and humanity. With volume 2 it becomes clear why volume 1 began with the business over Vernita Green's daughter. It becomes clear why Bill cancelled the hospital hit on Beatrix at the last minute. This is a movie about love as much as hate. Kill Bill is an emotionally mature and intelligent work, while still having that delightful playfulness and comic book mythology. A sincere and worthy tribute to a tawdry yet beloved part of cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Ultimate finale to the ultimate revenge film.,"According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino had her watch three movies to prepare for this film: John Woo's ""The Killer,"" Pam Grier in ""Coffy,"" and Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars."" If that sounds awesome to you, then the Kill Bill films are for you! Part two of what was originally planned as a 4-hour plus epic tale of revenge is even better than the first part. If Vol. 1 was primarily a homage to Asian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, this installment is more a homage to westerns, particularly spaghetti westerns. Nods to others are certainly present (blaxploitation, rednecksploitation, muscle car movies, etc.), but this is primarily a western, which is wonderfully set up by Michael Madsen's down-on-his-luck international assassin character, Buck. Madsen's character could have simply been another sadistic Mr. Blond sociopath, but Buck has a tragic element to him. He was part of an elite group of international assassins, but he's now living in a trailer in the middle of the desert, working as a bouncer at a run down strip club, and even had to hock his Hattori Hanzo sword. Tarantino manages to give Buck a fair amount of character depth with minimal screen time, which is always a great thing to see. Though I think the action highlight of the film has to be the showdown between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah as the deadly one-eyed Elle Driver. Hannah had largely been absent from any films of note for quite some time, unless you count the Grumpy Old Men films ten years earlier and has sadly been absent from much since then, but she is terrific as Driver. I think a lot of credit also has to go to fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping for the amazing fight between Thurman and Hannah in buds trailer. Tarantino also gets a lot of credit for selecting some truly bad-ass Ennio Morricone music for their final moments. Tarantino includes in his cast some other cool character actors including Gordon Liu (as a white bearded kung-fu master this time), Sid Haig, and Larry Bishop. And then there is David Carradine as Bill, who finally show his face on screen this time, and who is excellent. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role, even though there were some very cool other actors under consideration to play Bill before Carradine was cast. As with most Tarantino films, this is not a film to suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy Tarantino's aesthetic, this film is a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill Vol. MY LIFE,"This movie is magnificent. I'm not going to try to write a fancy review with meticulously chosen words, but honestly, this is one of my favorite movies.

The characters are actually pretty funny, and I almost identified with them. The camera shots are absolutely stunning.

Much Calmer Than Vol.I,"People who expect the same unbridled brutality and violence of KILL BILL, VOL. I may be seriously disappointed with the more talky Vol. II. This sequel is NOT a bad movie at all; it actually shows a lot of the background of VOL. I, but by doing so, the film was rendered with a slower pace. We finally get to know WHY Bill wanted to kill the bride so much. The ending is contrived and a bit disappointing; after all, this IS a very violent revenge movie, but the way this movie ends is nowhere near as bloody as the tamest kill scene in VOL. I. I was expecting something bordering on bad taste for the final confrontation, but what we get is broadway drama. For a revenge movie, the bodycount on this one is EXTREMELY low. But what holds the movie together is our eagerness to see The Bride finding Bill and ultimately, killing him. I could have forgiven the slow pace, the talky scenes and the lack of action had the final confrontation been a real adrenaline rush, but this it was not. KILL BILL, VOL. II is still a fine movie that takes itself more seriously than the first, but by doing so, it sacrificed the youthful kinetic energy that made the original installment a more pleasant movie experience. 7* out of 10*.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An excellent follow up that is superior to the original,"Even though this is not a traditional sequel in the sense that it is really just a part two of one really long movie,kinda,I found this to be better than the first in almost every way. The first Kill Bill did have more action and gore but I found this one to be it's smarter big brother. The plot is more interesting and finishes the story nicely. The characters are more developed and Bill himself is a very central character,and a fascinating one at that. I also really liked how the characters of Bud and Elle Driver(California mountain snake) where explored a bit more and had more screen time. Plus on top of that all the main performances where really good. My favorite though was Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei,the extreme Martial arts teacher. My other favorite performance was David Carradine as Bill. Carradine makes Bill a charming,intelligent character as well as a great villain. His super hero speech in this movie is one of its greatest moments. So despite the lack of action I found this to be a smarter,more interesting movie than it's predecessor as well as a wildly entertaining and very original movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Marred by its sporadic nature and constant post-modern references but it offers a few brief, if effective, scenes of a harrowing and heart wrenching nature.","The second volume of Kill Bill marks Tarantino's first failing as a director; it's a minute failing but it's a failing all the same. What is Kill Bill: Volume 2 other than a nicely shot and well acted freak show that follows a revenge story arc but not really as we know it? By the time we are within sight of the finish line, we will have encountered eighty year old pimps sitting and chatting in chairs mumbling about where a certain someone is; we will have encountered Bill, after he was kept anonymous in the first film, playing a pipe of some sort and we will have spent a couple of scenes with a former international assassin who's now living out his days as a Redneck.It's these sorts of people and these sorts of scenes that make Kill Bill: Volume 2 the mismatch film that it is. It's a lot of good ideas and one or two harrowing scenes basically patched together around a basic revenge goal. The film is not the complete experience but then again the film was chopped into two halves anyway and the result is one part brilliant, brutal and engaging (volume 1); one part drawn out, slow and unrewarding (volume 2).You remember individual scenes from Volume 2, you don't remember the full product as an experience. Sure, the burial scene is harrowing and the scene in which The Bride (Thurman) has a certain encounter with a certain someone nearer the end will tug at a lot of people's heartstrings and the sure, individual shots of The Bride walking amongst the heat wave and the bizarre crash zooms into Pai Mei's (Hui Liu) face as a he strokes his beard in a nonchalant fashion stay with you for reasons of a sporadic nature. These moments are memorable, if not rather good but the frustrations lie in the referencing to other texts for the sake of being post-modern and the consistency with the characters.Bending the lines between reality, fantasy, realism and escapism; The Bride sits in a car and delivers a monologue to the camera about how she's going to 'Kill Bill' at the film's very beginning. She even makes a comparison between herself and a movie, likening herself to a 'roaring rampage of revenge' reminding us that this is just a film after all. Then Tarantino chucks in what he does best in terms of manipulating narratives and that's including flashbacks as well as flashbacks within flashbacks. The Bride's first encounter with Bill (Carradine) and the general scenes around the wedding chapel early on work well through the menace Bill brings to the screen. It's effective because we know thanks to the first film what's to come, it is a matter of getting to that point and how it all plays out that is the suspense. Even stranger, Bill comes across as relatively well mannered, even nice, with his soft tone and slow, relatively passive movements that further create illusions of his true persona. It's no coincidence Tarantino selects the side angle when the two come face to face for the first time – the sort of composition that creates that 'face off' scenario.Additionally, Tarantino gives space to Budd (Masden) to grow ever so slightly. Budd's early interaction with his boss for being late for his shift at work leads us down a route of possible confrontation but Budd is passive and lacks that killer instinct – something we wouldn't associate with an assassin. This makes his lack of ruthlessness toward The Bride later on all the more effective and instead, we get a harrowing burial scene rather than an upfront execution. All the villains in the film are sadistic but simplistic; they manage to think up crude and downright nasty ways to eliminate their foes, be it a live burial or a snake in a briefcase but there doesn't seem to be any real flow to it all.The antagonism flits around the place; in volume 1 Bill is a mysterious unseen figure of all thigs sadistic, the next he is playing a flute by a campfire. Tarantino deployed this tactic in Pulp Fiction with Marcellus Wallace and it worked even when we finally saw his face, but here it falls rather flat. The film is a freak show of one eyed kung-fu femme fatales; 80 year old pimps whose whores have populated nearby villages with their young, thus taking the surrounding areas for the old man and comic book spouting psychopaths who have developed their own truth serum. The truth to this is that I think Tarantino gets carried away with himself – it's as if he reaches a certain height and then tries to top himself further with more outlandish content. This is particularly significant towards the end when Bill's luxurious house plays out as the setting for the final confrontation, but it's more of a circus than a bad guy's lair.Some of the best scenes are scrubbed out by some of the more unbelievable and just plain silly. The Bride's interaction with an assassin in a hotel room feels awkwardly out of place and just plain daft whereas Pai Mei's constant laughing and beard stroking to crash zooms feels like a pastiche too far, no matter how potentially enjoyable in a guilty manner. But that's the key word: 'potentially'. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a film that with a calmer head and a more focused eye might have been pretty good. As it is, it's good in individual sections but actually pretty forgettable in the long run.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Pretty good...............,"Pretty good, but not the end-all/be-all film by Tarantino.

I think it's a damn good movie. But you just have to a fan of Shaft and Superfly, Foxy Brown, and that type of s**t.

tedious stylized stupidity with an idiotic and surprisingly dull conclusion,"Anyone that calls these Kill Bill movies `masterpiece' has an IQ less then their shoe size. Tarantino could make a film of himself taking a dump from inside the toilet and there would be rabid fans talking about how he's ""extending"" the genre. If I'm not mistaken, from ""inside the bowl,"" he smells just like everyone else. Give his sainthood a rest already. It's poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. What to attribute this to then? Poor direction or poor use of editing software? Volume 2 trades its buckets of blood for pages of dry dialogue that explore the history of these characters but bring us nowhere new. It was far easier to swallow The Bride's bitter quest for revenge than this. Tarantino's self-adored mysticism and issues with self-indulgence this time around make it the boring mess that this post talks about. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. If they would've released this movie as one long film, I bet half of the dull volume 2 would've hit the cutting room floor. It was either sheer greed or sheer stupidity that made them split it into this mess.And so the adventure continues. . . it's just too bad it conned me into wasting my $8.50 on such an idiotic and surprisingly dull conclusion.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A masterpiece,"It has some unexpected moments, Carradine and Hannah steal the show with their memorable performance and Thurman is good here. Questions are answered, chapter eight and last chapter are masterpieces. It is a Spaghetti Western (with Ennio Morricone and Robert Rodriguez music) with some kung fu influences. While Vol.1 was a homage to old samurai movies, Vol.2 is a homage to old kung fu movies and Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns.
His best and most emotional movie so far! However, i still find Vol.1 superior.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A completely emotionally satisfying work,"Much like The Lord of the Rings and Manon des Sources, Kill Bill was a large movie shot at one time and released in separate parts.It is amazing that over the course of a single movie, Tarantino turned himself into one of the premier action directors of his generation. The most action-oriented scene he had ever shot before this was probably Mr. White hitting Mr. Pink to the floor in Reservoir Dogs. Then, he brings us Showdown at House of Blue Leaves which is one of the most inventive action tour de forces in modern movie making. One thing Tarantino is, certainly, is a student of film, and it is obvious that he did his homework before he conceived of, planned, executed, and edited together that masterpiece of action cinema.The movie around it is great too.This is Tarantino's epic. This is his most sprawling film with a depth of emotion he rarely ever reaches for. The core of the film is The Bride, Uma Thurman's ex-assassin left for dead by her former boss and lover out for bloody vengeance. She's believably tough, angry, scared, and vulnerable at different times. When she cuts through the Crazy 88 at the House of Blue Leaves, we're not only willing to believe that she can do it (complete with stylistic flourishes like wire-fu that enhances the action into some kind of super-reality), but we're also invested in her journey. The key to that investment is, like with most Tarantino films, the film's structure.The first half of the film is frontloaded with the outer veneer of the conflict that really touches on the most basic of emotions driving The Bride. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and when she decided to leave, their leader (and her lover), Bill, took it badly and had her killed. She doesn't quite die, wakes up four years later from a coma to find the baby she had yet to deliver gone, and her legs atrophied to nothing. She wills herself back to functional and begins her quest for revenge. We see her second target to start the film, Vernita Green, who functions as a small and darkly comic introduction to the nature of the conflict. The biggest first fight is the first chronologically, O-ren Ishii.We get O-ren's backstory, which functions not only to tell us the particulars of the young woman's meteoric rise to power within the Japanese underworld, but also as a proxy for the other members of the Squad. We hear very little backstory of the rest of the gang, but we hear O-ren's background in great detail (complete with a full animated sequence). I think that's to give us enough detail to understand O-ren and to also understand that the other members of the squad have similar backgrounds and are similarly deadly, by implication.We then get that fantastic action sequence. One of the few things I understand about building an extended action sequence is that you can't get boring by doing the same thing repeatedly. You have to have variations, complications, and a story within it. That's exactly what the Showdown delivers. We have different characters that feel distinct (especially the young madwoman, Gogo). We have a progression and escalation of the conflict, and we finally get to a full resolution as The Bride lords over her victims, demanding their lost body parts as her property. It's such a virtuoso demonstration of ability at the service of story. I even love the turn to black and white (which was done for the American version to receive an R-rating, it was released in color around the rest of the world). It gains a certain old-school feel that meshes well with the music choices over the visuals, though I imagine that if Tarantino had known he was going to have to release it like that, he might have made different film stock and lighting choices.The second part begins in much the same way as the first, with a prologue that essentially tells the audience that The Bride is going to survive until late in the coming action. With Tarantino, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and he's there to make the journey as entertaining as possible.The Bride, fresh from taking out O-ren and Vernita, heads to the American southwest and Budd, Bill's brother and number three on her list. The portrait of Budd that Tarantino draws is so wonderful. He was like the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, but he's fallen very far. He's hawked a priceless sword and works as a bouncer in a far from busy strip club, receiving nothing but disdain from his boss and doing the dirtiest jobs in the place. But, he has lost none of his ruthlessness, as The Bride discovers when she shows up at his trailer and tries to take him by surprise.I love the Showdown at House of Blue Leaves, but I think Budd burying The Bride alive might be the best sensationalistic scene of the film. It's claustrophobic (enhanced by Tarantino beginning the sequence in 1.33:1 instead of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio he had used through the whole film), tense, and Budd demonstrates an easy willingness to cause severe pain on The Bride. Budd's final words of the sequence (""This is for breaking my brother's heart."") is so pitch perfect, and then we have one long shot, mostly in complete darkness, as the heavy and jarring sound of dirt crashing against the wooden casket The Bride has been nailed into shoots through the soundtrack.Tarantino then jumps backwards in time to one of the earliest events in the film's chronology, The Bride's training with Pai-Mei, the ancient Chinese kung fu master. It's a highly entertaining sequence that shows The Bride's transition from girlish waif to hardened killer, and it's placed right here in order to provide the most emotionally satisfying conclusion to the burial. Watching The Bride get buried, we have no hope, but learning that part of her training could help (and obviously does help) her escape her prison is emotionally satisfying. Placing that training sequence far earlier would put it 3 hours before the burial, and I think it would have diminished the impact of the sequence's emotional delivery.Anyway, the fights of the film continue to get smaller. Budd gets killed by Elle, the final member of the squad and The Bride's replacement (both Elle and The Bride are blonde with blue eyes, and Elle has obviously become Bill's lover). The Bride, still covered in dirt from her escape, shows up at Budd's trailer and the two have a fight in the dirty confines of Budd's living space. Spittoons are thrown. TV antennae are used as makeshift swords. Walls are torn apart. An eye gets pulled from its socket and stepped on. The Bride makes off, ready to make her final confrontation with Bill.When she does arrive, she finds that her daughter is still alive and the movie's plot stops. The story doesn't stop, it keeps on headfirst, but the plot of killing Bill comes to a complete halt for about half an hour, and it's a great half an hour. Bill, obviously remorseful for what he had done to The Bride, has raised their daughter, B.B., as well as he could, and she's a cute little four-year-old. The Bride gets to know her daughter and puts her to bed before Bill and The Bride have their first scene together since the wedding (rehearsal) massacre. It's a raw scene of condemnation and hatred. It's such a great scene that reveals the depths of the hatred and love the two shared for each other.And once again, the fight gets smaller. I've read that the beach fight that Bill proposes was actually Tarantino's plan, and if he had filmed it, I'm sure it would have looked fantastic. However, I find something really satisfying about the final fight lasting roughly five seconds and done entirely while sitting in chairs across a table. It's intimate and about the characters, not the flashy choreography. Everything ""fun"" about the genre has been stripped away by the time The Bride gets to Bill's hacienda. It probably shouldn't come back at that point.I love this film completely. It's probably Tarantino's most satisfying work emotionally. It has a breadth and depth that is kind of shocking. He became an excellent action director. His dialogue is as fun as ever. He pushed himself to become more, forcing himself to take on tasks that he had never done before, and he excelled at them. This is a triumph for Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A clearly defined second film,"Having just completed a back-to-back comparison of the two volumes of Tarantino's Kill Bill, its clear that his two narrators have very different storytelling styles.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tribute to the Kung-Fu films of the 70's and later, as told by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba).  Blood, honor, and kung-fu style fighting were paramount.In Vol. 2, The Bride (Uma Thurman) narrates our story in the style of a ""Classic"" film.  There is more of a noir attitude and feel.  The violence is more realistic, and frequently implied instead of seen onscreen - a few graphic moments aside.The story is told wonderfully, in a more linear style, incorporating more flashbacks than out of order chapters.  Tarantino's direction is crisp, with impeccable acting by Thurman.  Daryl Hannah finally gets her moments in the sun, as our stunning villain.  While Bill (Carradine) may be the man behind the evil, Elle (Hannah) is the true evil villain, reveling in the destruction of her enemies.All in all, the two movies together tell a great story, and the stylistic differences clearly delineate between the two films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Masterpiece!!,"Tarantino's got style. No doubt about it. And has ideas very clear in his head. What a genius.Characters spread and fill the screen and catch you from the very first shot. Amazing performances, set ups, music, photography...Tatantino set an amazing world filled with bad guys and girl described with a superb poetry. The atmosphere is magic. Violence is presented as another piece as part of a perfect engaged machine. Dialogs are not as much present as previous T's movies, but they're far enough and works perfectly with the set up of the movie.Just say that Uma Thurman -the bride- overflows her talent in every single shot and reveal herself as a great great actress.

Tarantino rocks!,"I loved volume one... it's one of my favorite films. 'Kill Bill: Vol.2' is also great, but lacks compared to it's first, in a way... as this is a continuation.Tarantino's outstanding direction keeps you hooked... he's in form as ever. In my eye, he's the finest filmmaker of this generation.The sequence when Uma escapes from the coffin is the high-light of the enterprise. Amazingly short & written. It's the best movie scene in a long time. Though, I think the way Bill was killed was boring. It just doesn't work, Uma should have given him a tough fight rather than performing a kung-fu stint. Nonetheless, this film's a must see.Uma Thurman is outstanding as the revengeful bride. Late actor David Carradine is flawless. Daryl Hannah & Michael Madsen are superb.on the whole, not as good as it's prequel... but worth a watch. Thumbs Up!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Such high expectations, such low outcome...","Being a huge fan of QT before the Kill Bill series, I was ecstatic when I heard that QT was making another film. I watched Kill Bill Vol 1, didn't love it, the only reason that kept myself from hating was Uma. Then, I gave Vol. 2 a shot, not the best. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was Bill, and the last parts of dialogue between Bill and Kiddo. I felt the cast wasn't well chosen, the action scenes were mediocre, and the dialogue was decent. My ratings for previous QT films were: Reservoir Dogs (10/10), Pulp Fiction (10/10), Jackie Brown (8/10). My ratings for these two films: Vol 1 (3/10), Vol 2 (4/10) A Huge Disappointment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"A lot of hype, but nothing impressive","As a Tarantino fan myself, I have been thoroughly disappointed with this series. Perhaps it was all the hype. Perhaps it was pre-expectations. Regardless, I feel that this film falls well below what it could have been.The cinematography is great. The dirt getting thrown on you in the coffin really puts you 6 feet under with Uma. There are countless other scenes that grab you the same way.But where it lacked the most, was the hook. It took me about 4 days to watch the thing the entire way through. I'd watch 20 min of it, get bored, turn it off, and go do something else, or go to bed. The next night, I'd pick up where I left off. If a movie is fully grabbing me, I will watch the whole thing all the way through. Bill just didn't have that effect on me.Rating: 6",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""B**ch, you don't have a future!""","I've only seen this once before and I didn't remember it being that good, so I was nicely surprised when I enjoyed it almost as much as Volume 1. The fantastic choices made for the first film would have been difficult to recreate, so I can understand why it was a more understated film, but that is why it's just not quite so good. The fight scene with Lucy Liu's bodyguards was brilliant in that film, but wouldn't have fitted in to this second part in the same way. That's the only thing it's really lacking I think.It was an interesting ending, which I had forgotten and I like the fact it wasn't dragged out. The whole thing moved with pace and kept you interested as did the first. I did have to look away during the Texas Burial scene, because it freaked me out and it's a shame that Michael Madsen has started to look like the PE teacher from Glee, I'd always thought he was sexy before, but I thought Daryl Hannah was superb and I loved the Martial Arts training section with Pai Mei.Tarantino's second best film!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino has to be the most overrated filmmaker of our time.,"He doesnt write deep multi-layered characters. He doesn't make cinema that grips you on a psychological level. He makes cartoon movies for edgy teens.
Ever since I saw Reservoir Dogs, I've had some issues with Tarantino - edgy, one-dimensional characters, forced and cringeworthy dialogues, shock value violence that doesn't add anything to the story etc. And all those issues are on full display in this movie. And on the top of that our main protagonist is a superhero in this movie, she can do anything. Anything! It all just seems very silly.
I often hear people compare Tarantino's use of violence to that of Scorsese. But Scorsese uses it as an extension of the narrative and characters, he doesn't use violence to look cool. I wish Tarantino learned that from him.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
just awful ... an anti-climatic waste of time,"Anyone that calls these Kill Bill movies `masterpiece' has an IQ less then their shoe size. This movie is poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. Tarantino could make a film of himself taking a dump from inside the toilet and there would be rabid fans talking about how he's ""extending"" the genre. You set up Bill as being the most feared and deadly assassin and warrior in the world... You take two movies to reach him and then QT teases you by having the characters talk about a swordfight on the beach under the full moon, and instead the ending was lame and predictable.  There wasn't even a good fight (one fight and it's not even with Bill!).  A few critics actually let their admiration for Tarantino's past work get in the way of giving this movie the reviews it deserved. Those critics have completely lost all credibility.  Thank goodness the American people have given their votes with poor attendance to this dud.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of Tarantino's best,"Volume 1 may have more crazy action, but Volume 2 has always been my favourite.

"Great acting, writing, and entertainment makes a great ending","Going into this film, I expected another kung-fu action flick with Tarantino's creative flare thrown in the mix like the first one. However, I found that this movie was completely different from the first. Where the first lacked in much character development, it was made up for in Kill Bill: Vol. 2. The performances from every character were right where they needed to be, and, not uncommon for Tarantino movies, the dialog was witty when it needed to be witty, sadistic when it needed to be sadistic, and interesting the entire time. The audience can really feel the successes and pain of Uma Thurman through her terrific acting.Even if you haven't seen the first Kill Bill, I recommend watching this. I would not be surprised if it was nominated for an Academy Award for it stood alone as a powerful movie. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An outstanding conclusion!,"Much of Kill Bill's success depended on how the story would end. It couldn't be too predictable, but not too bizarre either. Luckily, Tarantino came up with one of the most brilliant epilogues in film history. In fact, Kill Bill: Vol.2 could be his absolute masterpiece, alongside Pulp Fiction. It really is that good.Following the events of Vol.1, The Bride (Uma Thurman) has three more people to kill: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, finally, the Man, Bill (David Carradine)! But since there are only three left, what are we gonna see during the rest of the film, the Crazy 88 having already been wiped out in the previous movie? That's what Tarantino aficionados are gonna love: the talky, ironic, totally quotable bits are back (the highlight? Bill revealing the ""truth"" about Superman's mythology, just like QT did with Like a Virgin in Reservoir Dogs). Some of the dialogue is reminiscent of Sergio Leone, and that's no coincidence: 75% of the movie is Tarantino's own version of the Spaghetti Western, with Ennio Morricone's music, a homage to the last scene of The Searchers (with Thurman replacing John Wayne) and the fact that most of the story takes place in Texas (we finally get to see the so-called Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre, which includes an intelligent cameo by Samuel L. Jackson). Okay, but what about the remaining 25%? That part (the middle section of the film) shows us how The Bride learned all the various killing techniques she masters, as we witness her brutal training with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, who was Johnny Mo in Vol.1). It looks ugly, but it's one of the most interesting mentor/pupil relationships I've ever seen. If Tarantino had made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Pai Mei chapter of Kill Bill: Vol.2 is probably what it would have looked like.So, now the time has come to talk about what everyone expects to be the unmissable part of this film: the climactic Uma/Bill showdown. Well, without spoiling anything, it's a powerful, emotionally loaded confrontation, a tragic love story, the most touching ending Tarantino has ever filmed. And much of those scenes'beauty lies in the leading couple: Thurman is arguably even better than in Vol.1 (kind of a weird statement, given the two volumes were shot together and meant to be one single film), and Carradine's comeback was worth waiting for, similarly to John Travolta's return to form in Pulp Fiction. The only thing I don't understand is why the Academy ignored two excellent performances such as those we had the luck to see in this movie.I don't think another director would have been able to achieve something this good. Kill Bill belongs to Quentin Tarantino, who has once again proved he can pick up an overused concept and turn it into a remarkable picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Violence, boring endless talking and more violence","This is the most over-appreciated movie of the year. Mister Quarantino just rips off his own favorite movies and puts them all together into something that is too long; too much boring conversations and one cliché after the other. If you have seen all the movies he has (like Once upon a time in the west; Peckinpah-movies; Hong Kong-movies etc etc), there is no surprise at all. The ending is a anti-climax. Of course, he has a very good cameraman and good actors. But let him try to make a film without guns, swords, fast cars and violence. A Dogma-film for example. A real story, about real people. I don't think he is capable too make something out of that. The thing what I dislike most about Quarantino's movies is the senseless use of violence. It gives you nothing to think about. It has no social relevance at all. Compare this with Peckinpah or Kubrick, to name a few real masters. Just violence and endless talking; it is not enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Many overly extended and unnecessary dialogue. As if this part is the buildup to the story!I think Uma Thurman had a great performance. But Overall I felt like this movie had Sub-par fighting scenes.

Madsen, Carradine, Thurman, Tarantino---- I expected better.Bill was just too full of himself for me to care whether he lived or died - and Beatrice - well same thing.

One for the Nerds.,"I thought that Kill bill vol 1 was crap but this is even worse. It is just shocking to see how Tarantino has regressed in his film making. You would have thought that after taking a while out that he may have grown up a little and come back with a film that would reflect this maturity. Instead he makes the Kill bill movies. They are completely juvenile films that surely would fail to impress anyone other than immature, spotty faced, teenage nerds. The fact that the martial arts in this film are crap only adds to the misery. They seem unable to distinguish between Japanese and Chinese martial arts and film making. As a result the film displays neither. That may not mean a lot to most people but for someone who has been studying martial arts for over a decade it means a lot. I promised myself that i would not watch vol 2 after being so thoroughly disappointed with vol 1 but i was curious to see if it was any better. It wasn't and once again i spent a few pounds that would have been better spent elsewhere. So if you haven't seen this movie already do yourself a favour and give it a miss. It is CRAP!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The better half but the whole bloody affair is better.,"This review will be split into two parts, one were i talk about this movie and one were I talk about the new version of this movie and part one called Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.Kill Bill vol 2:This was a so genius move by Tarantino. After having done one of the goriest and most violent movies of all time, going back to the brides back story and give the character more depth. This movie have arguably one of Tarantinos better scripts and i would say it could have been executed better. The way that they tell the brides back story is so genius, I will not spoiled to much but it's a scene were she need to have a specific skills and then they going back to show her training. Many people is disturbed by the fact that the finally is more talk the talk then walk the walk but I ain't because it's make this movie so much more emotional and the story comes full circle. If you want me to mention something that could have been better executed I say Esteban that is bad overacting and an Mexican accent that doesn't work.Without the whole bloody affair this is my 5th favorite movie by Tarantino, my favorite director.Kill Bill The whole bloody affair:This is Kill Bill volume 1+2 in one movie with some improvements. For you who can't find this movie or don't want to buy it, I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)). And for you who haven't seen Kill Bill vol 2 at all I recommend you to see the whole bloody affair first because it's one scene in this movie that will change your way to look at Bill to the better, maybe forever. The Kill Bill vol 2 part is not so different but the Kill bill volume one is and I would still say the Kill Bill vol 2 part is slightly better.Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is insanely highly rated but get's way to less votes to arrive to the IMDb top 250 list. I think this movie deserve to be there and I hope you will help me by watching it and rate it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.""","Quentin Tarantino channels the manic, ultraviolent, stylized energy of cheesy kung-fu cinema, American westerns, and a slight twist of Italian horror, and he uses it all like threads to weave one of the greatest revenge stories ever made. Both Kill Bill movies collectively form a coherent, cohesive, sublime storytelling package; ideally, they should be watched back-to-back to understand every nuance of the story and the characters, since there is so much depth to them.Volume 2 of this saga fills in the gaps that its predecessor left behind, not only in following up on the rest of the Bride's rampage, but also in revealing her full back story. But while Volume 1 had tons of rip-roaring action and an extremely vivid style, this follow-up is much more toned-down and mellow, laden with more dialogue than swordplay. In a way, this falls more in line with Tarantino's other work, but I personally favor the first film more for being sublimely entertaining. As it is, Volume 2 tends to be a bit long-winded and dry.That being said, it still has a lot of brilliant moments that are worth seeing, including the burial scene, the fight between the Bride and Elle Driver, the brutal training scenes with Pai Mei, and the last half-hour or so, which builds up to a beautiful bittersweet ending.For the most part, it's the story that counts, and it excels at taking characters we already know and love, and taking them to the next level. The full reasons for both sides of the conflict are finally revealed, generating empathy for both Bill and the Bride. Any other movie would be content in leaving things as a plain, straightforward black-and-white affair, but in this case, there's much more insight to the characters and the overall plot. It all builds up to the inevitable climax, which pulls out one of the most heart-wrenching twists imaginable. Through it all, the film provides the most satisfying ending possible, and it makes the entire Kill Bill saga one of the most endearing and complete storytelling experiences made.This film is crafted with superb photography and plenty of flashy editing. A few title cards, flashbacks, and asides are thrown into the mix for a stylized effect. Acting continues to impress: Uma Thurman is effectively perfect in her role, and it's especially notable how physically demanding her role must have been. David Carradine exhibits an interesting presence as Bill, while Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah excel at being villains we love to hate. Writing is very sharp and interesting. This production boasts some good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is pretty good at times, though I enjoy the music choices of Volume 1 better.While Volume 1 excels at the action and style but comes up a little shorter on substance, Volume 2 is the opposite, subduing the action to favor the dialogue and storytelling. Some people may like one over the other. I personally prefer Volume 1, but this sequel is essential for the complete experience, and it adds up to a satisfying saga. If you can handle the violent bits, the whole affair is highly recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bill Vol. 2  was Outstanding,"Enjoyed Bill Vol. 1, however, this film went back to the same characters and gave more of a history into the Bride and how she learned all the secret powers of becoming a super killer in order to get revenge from all the people who harmed her. Uma Thurman gave an outstanding performance when she is being taught by a very old wise teacher of defense and some very important deadly parts of the body which can destroy a person even if they are almost sitting on top of you, face to face or nose to nose. Uma Thurman did a great job of sword swinging and got herself out of almost impossible situations, like being buried alive and many other horrible situations. David Carradine,(Bill) had a larger role in this film and showed his great acting abilities, just like his father John Carradine, ""Dracula '40 and ""House of Frankenstein) This is a film you can watch from the beginning to the end and enjoy every minute of great entertainment by all the actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

3.5/5 Very Good. Recommended viewing,"Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Chia Hui Liu, Samuel L. JacksonPlot Synopsis: 2 down, 3 to go. The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her hunt for the masochistic Bill (David Carradine) in part 2 of Quentin Tarantino's pop culture styled duo-logy.In part 2, we see Tarantino's influences shift from Asian cinema to the spaghetti western, with the stylings of the likes of Sergio Leone featuring heavily. This is possibly one of the smartest decisions on Tarantino's part as the kung-fu novelty of the first film having well and truly run its course.One of the most disappointing aspects of Volume 1 was the lack of witty dialogue that has defined Tarantion's CV thus far. In volume 2, we see a return to form, with Bill's superhero monologue one of the most memorable moments of the film. While, the action is still intense and fast paced, it is not the carnage of Vol.1, with the aforementioned dialogue now playing a much greater role. Thus, Vol.2 is in many ways a more well-rounded and deeper film than its predecessor.Though not as frenetic as the previous film, Vol.2 nevertheless has more to offer. It's just a shame that Miramax had to split the film in 2 parts in the first place.

Shopping for A sword now!,"Watched this when it first came out, but for some reason I wasn't a big fan of Uma at the time. I remember thinking she was kind of annoying and funny looking.

I'm the same age now as Uma was when she filmed these 2 movies and I have so much appreciation for her unique features now. There was nobody better to play this part and the dialogue between her and Bill(David Carradine) had chemistry that you just don't see very often.

An excellent conclusion to first volume,"I agree with what most people say about this movie, that it has less actions and more talking. Yes, there were really less actions unlike the first volume and more conversations but then again, those conversations were the heart of the movie. More conversations but there was never a nonsense dialogue in this movie. Everyone who talked in the movie talked with conviction and were sometimes informational (like Elle Driver's information about the black mamba). It is through those conversations that the viewer is able to grasp the meaning of the movie, the implications and essence of the characters' actions, and the characters' behaviors that defined the story. In fact those dialogues were the ones that made this movie quintessential.'The acting was superb. I am particularly impressed by Daryl Hannah's portrayal of the evil and remorseless Elle Driver. Her performance was so excellent I would have handed her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The climax was great. It ended well with a resolved conflict.Again Quentin Tarantino showcased another masterpiece.

Kung Fu spaghetti western spun in dirty web of mythology,"There's a quote by the character Budd in this Quentin Tarantino movie after our now Bouncer is asked to compare his Hatori Honzo sword with others. It is at this time that he hesitates and comments on appropriate and inappropriate comparisons. I would venture that the same goes true for QT movies. As they are genre compilations with their own set of rules of the film realm, that we have come to love and trust, they really stand in their own place.We picked up here where we left off with The Brides' Viper Assassin Gang Assassination List 40% complete, with another 88 or so Samarai style deaths absolved along the way in the name of avenging the loss of her baby four years earlier. If we were expecting more of the same we would have been selling QT short.Enter The Western!It's a dirty, dusty old trail of revenge and nothing is going stop her, except herself... see beginning and ending off the movie for further details. This is countered by overacting, which is purposefully delicious and appropriate. To compare KBII to KB I is miss the point of a continued move.

Bloated & Boring,"When I first heard about Kill Bill, it sounded like a filler project, a fun exercise in which Tarrantino cold pay homage, riff and rip-off his favourite genre pics. If this had been true, I might have enjoyed this film (for it really does not not deserve to be listed as 2 films) and would not have this sense of disappointment and sadness at an obviously talented filmmaker being allowed to indulge himself so completely in what is in reality, a very, very slim premise for a a 247 min film. I can understand why the Weinsteins wanted 2 films, because it is good business, but surely Producer Lawrence Bender,  should have stepped in and questioned the motivations of  his Director and suggested some much-needed pruning of his ""epic"".Whilst I wasn't blown away by Volume 1, I enjoyed its trashy homage to the Grindhouse  pictures clearly dear to its Director's heart and I was intrigued to see how he would weave the Spaghetti western genre into Volume 2. Spaghetti Western!!! To even mention this film in the same breath a Leone et al. is the funniest thing I have heard in years. Believe me. this is no Western, this is no cool, revenge flick, this is simply an exercise in style that runs out of steam way before the inevitable denouement.There are scenes in this film that go nowhere, dialogue that meanders and ultimately bores and action that whilst wonderfully choreographed (esp Vol... 1), has no real excitement or genuine sense of danger. The much-anticipated Pai Mei training was dull dull dull and I honestly wondered if I had experienced a micro sleep during this part, as I felt the whole sequence was under-developed and incomplete.There are however, some wonderful moments in these films, but the poor editing and bloated direction means you have to wait and wait for so long for them to happen, that you begin to question whether you're really that interested in these shallow characters anyway. The characters in this films are supposedly the epitome of iconic cool, but they are like the sets of Old Hollywood westerns, well-dressed facades, with nothing behind, but the desert.A disappointment on every level.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Great continuation to a great movie!,"I loved Kill Bill Vol.1 and everything I said about that movie I can say about this one as well. As a huge Tarantino fan I love all the Tarantino-isms in this movie. It continues the cool story from the first one and brings it to a great end, bringing a lot more emotion into the story. What I loved about Kill Bill in general (this one and the first one) is that it manages to not take itself too serious, but manages to be serious as hell if necessary. Just like every Tarantino it has a really cool soundtrack. You have to see the first one to really enjoy this one, but watching them back to back is no problem at all and makes them the perfect movie-night evening filler.

The Incredible Climax!!,"The story continues!! Having already defeated two of her five targets, Uma Thurman now focuses on Bill, a man whom we have yet a great deal to know. This film dives ever deeper into The Bride's past, including her estranged relationship with Bill and the shocking revelations that were hinted at the end of Volume I. This film is much less centered on the action itself but instead the relationships between these characters. I believe this works rather well considering the first piece was a gruesome thrill ride, and this one slows it down just a bit. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are among her final opponents, and both could get a lot more development in this film. Tarantino still pays tribute to Japanese and Hong Kong action films, but this too is tone down. And for all the build up there are still some well-served fight sequences.Near the climax there is a showdown of a different kind between Bill and the Bride. By now we know her real name, but I'd rather not reveal it to those who have yet to see it. It's not just a battle of martial arts and swords, or even a literal battle of vengeance. Whoever takes victory this time will also decide the fate of the child, The Bride's daughter. Such an emotional fascade surely will entertain watchers even more so than any action scene. I know it did for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Bride is back!,"If you watched Kill Bill: Vol. 1, then you practically have to see Kill Bill: Vol. 2 because it's no ordinary movie sequel. In fact, it is more of a continuation to an unfinished movie. Where the first Kill Bill film had chapters 1-5, the second film contains chapters 6-10. And by watching Kill Bill Vol. 2, you get any unanswered questions Volume 1 had. The second half of Tarantino's 4th film will essentially give satisfaction to its viewers. Volume 1 was the more action- packed/exhilarating part, in which Volume 2 is the more drama-filled/emotional part. However, it is better not to think of Kill Bill as two separate parts because when it comes down to it, Volumes 1 & 2 are just a means of presenting this film into two halves. In the end, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill should be considered as one long, epic, martial arts, revenge-film. So if you liked Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Not as great as hoped for but still a very good watch,"Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is the bride. She tracks down Budd (Michael Madsen) but he takes her down first. He puts her in a coffin and buries her. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) double crosses Budd and kills him. Beatrix manages to escape and finds Elle in Budd's trailer. They have a knock down fight. Afterwards the only one left is Bill (David Carradine). There are also flashbacks to the wedding rehearsal before the massacre and Beatrix's training with master Pai Mei.It's slightly less compelling than part 1. Part 1 is bookended with 2 amazing fight scenes with lots of action in between. Part 2 really only has the great fight between Beatrix And Elle in its middle. The training segment is a bit of fun. The ending with Bill is somewhat a letdown. Quentin Tarantino should have realized that the girl is a great opportunity to subvert the traditional innocent girlie character. But that opportunity is lost here. The whole Last Chapter is a little too much talk and not enough action. Considering the first part ended with the big fight with O-Ren Ishii, this part ends with something less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Beyond Imagination,"I'm doing some mendality analysis and motive deduction.1. Hardwired
If you're hardwired to a thing,say instinct, you just couldn't resist it or betray it.Bill made the decision to kill Kiddo which is the only thing he knew to settle a problem, he's a born killer. There's this great theory or mythology-- You gotta use what you got. Suppose you got a tail or horn, how would you behave? Lovers quarrel and fight each other from time to time. If there's a gun in his pocket or a pistol in her handbag. Eventually there would be gunpowder.2, Two sides of a thing: Love and hate.Lovers do play sadistic and masochistic games, they want to explore new world/dimensions with each other, hate is love in a extreme form. Just to see how your beloved one would act and behave. You want to know his/her boundaries. Like what they say in sports car commercial, ""Drive it like u hate it.""3,Assumption and Impression
To Kiddo, Bill is a mentor figure more than a boss, but never a husband. They didn't have a wedding. So Kiddo she presumed Bill is not a father figure/material. And the reason they didn't communicate about it is talking would be cheap and cheesy. It's like an idiot's thing to explain. Plain open talk would belittle them. They've learned to rely on their inner sense as professional hit man. And both had wrong expectation of each other.3,Kiddo's mentality
Kiddo kept some secrets(her pregnancy without Bill's knowledge is one, prior to that she had acquired a lethal martial trick under her sleeve) Secrecy is charming considering her gender and profession.Pregnancy had transformed her, as a new life and consciousness set in motion under her belly. Of course She wanted the best for her baby, to expand her baby's life experience and boundaries. But with Bill in picture, all things she would know is killing.4,The ending
Kiddo sneaked into Bill's house, saw her adorable baby who Bill had taken good care of. The family finally reunited. What a touching moment! Bill stands before her, a figure blending roles of a father and a husband, not her mentor, nor her leader or killer, theologically explained everything to her.She still had to challenge him to a duel. Revenge had kept her going so far, and she had gone too far to give it up.She got bloody satisfaction and huge regret the moment she dealt her lethal punch to Bill.What happened next, and their exchange of words had never been imagined of.Tell me what is your thoughts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Sad Attempt At  A Western,"Shhh. Do you hear that? It's Sergio Leone rolling over in his Italian grave. Poor guy. He didn't know that years after his death some video store clerk turned director would completely rip-off the sty lings of his ever so popular movies. Well he might not be able to protest, but I sure can. ""Volume 2"" is one of the biggest rip-off's I have ever seen(closely followed by ""Volume 1""). I used to respect Tarantino until I saw the movies that inspired him. After watching this film again, I think that someone should call the studio and file a copyright suite! ""Volume 2"" was full of corny dialog and ridiculous action. It's almost like Quentin was trying too hard.

My least favourite Tarantino movie,"Kill Bill be like: put every 70s exploitation subgenre in a blender, add a generous sprinkle of manga, tons and tons of fake blood, actionate.After a while you are led to expect the same loop: search for enemy, find enemy, fight, fight, fight, slice, cut, shoot, pierce, hit, bang, slap, blood, blood, blood, blood, enemy succumbs, rinse and repeat.How those loops are accomplished is often surprising and endlessly creative, but in the end it always boils down to the same. More frequently in vol. 2 you get inbetweening speeches of almost comical pretentiousness and vague pseudooriental fuff. It's a bubblegum film that proves surprisingly tedious, considering how much is going on on the screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Upon second viewing, disappointing","I greatly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1 and would happily give it a 9 out of 10. It had the right combination of goofiness and real action.  I watched the Volume 1 DVD the night before I saw Vol 2 in the theatre, so I was all primed.  While I did not like it as much as Volume 1, I thought that Volume 2 was pretty decent after the first viewing.  I enjoyed David Carradine, Michael Madsden was excellent and the Kiddo/Elle fight was pretty good.  I felt the ending dragged, but I was willing to put up with that as a change of pace. I still would have graded it an 8 out of 10 at that point.After watching the DVD of Vol 2, I really have to downgrade my rating to a 6 or less.  Bill really gets BORING!  Now I know why Kiddo left him--she couldn't stand any more of those long-winded stories of his.  There's nothing wrong with long stretches of dialogue if the characters have something to say.  Bill's philosophical ramblings collapse under their own weight.  They certainly cannot be supported by the plot and characterizations of either Kill Bill volume, unless they were cut down to about 1/3 their length, and then we would have been left with very little movie.I'll be re-watching the Volume 1 DVD from time to time, while Volume 2 collects dust.  Let's call it 5 out of 10.  That doesn't make the 6 out of 10 needed for repeat viewing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Now with less exaggeration, less reference and a film with a much more paced rhythm, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' bets on phenomenal dialogues, script and free controlled violence","With the critical and public success of the first part and many outstanding issues, volume 2 of 'Kill Bill' comes to close all loose ends and surprise us with the mishaps faced by the Bride on her way in search of revenge on her disaffected. After having eliminated two targets in the first half, now it is time to carry out the rematch against the other participants in the Texas chapel massacre.After being betrayed by Bill (David Carradine) and his former group, the murderous Bride (Uma Thurman) is on the verge of death for four years. After waking up from a coma, she goes after each of her former companions to kill them. In the second part of this quest for revenge, the bride will continue her search for Bill, attacking Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), the last two survivors of the group. The confrontation with her former master, and mastermind of her death, will reveal new surprises for the assassin.If the first volume had a lot of graphic violence in a more cartoonish tone and a more accentuated side of humor, in this second part we have a change of tone. As the work was not originally intended to be displayed in two parts, this tone was already purposeful, but with the division it became even clearer. This does not mean that it is a film completely opposite to the previous one. Volume 2 continues to feature violent and elaborate scenes, highlighting the burial with our protagonist and revenge against the last two survivors of the group. The scenes, especially those of the burial, are much more like a horror movie. Uma Thurman's performance in these sequences is spectacular, giving us all the suffering and despair of the character.However, it is clear that in this conclusion, Tarantino prefers to highlight other characteristics of his works. Knowing that this final part would have to explain issues just mentioned above and that, especially the confrontation with Bill, would have to bring an emotional and dramatic charge to the audience, he inserts much more text in the characters' mouths, with the right to analogies to superheroes and the change in direction that our protagonist wanted to take in her life from the moment she learned she was pregnant. All scenes of the Bride / Beatrix Kiddo with Bill, whether at the beginning or at the end of the film, are purely in the best Tarantino style. In addition, the director tells us what the Bride's real name is, how she learned to wield a sword in very good-natured scenes with master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).Now with less exaggeration, less reference and a film with a much more paced rhythm, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' bets on phenomenal dialogues, script and free controlled violence. If the first focused much more on the plot and all its explosive action, now we have the focus shifted to the beginning and end of the story, the humanization of the characters and the reasons why we support them, where in fact we know everything. that happened until they reached that point at the conclusion of the film. The Bride, especially, thus becomes the most human character in the vast gallery and Tarantino.In addition to the Bride, we also know the other characters. In Budd's case, we even get to know where he lives, where he works and what he does outside work. Bill is already an extremely interesting character, as we know his motivations for the sadistic act that started the story. Tarantino gives us a choice of who to support, presenting reasons, even if not rational, strong for Bill to have done his slaughter. With a cast chosen in the right measure to give meaning and motivations to the characters, everything becomes more visceral. For knowing how to conduct the work in these different aspects in comparison to volume 1 and, managing to deliver everything that is expected, we see a great leap by the filmmaker towards the real authorial work. Now Tarantino fans will be able to delight in all the director's signatures.As with Sergio Leone's westerns, everything is very slow. Just to give you an idea, the Bride kills only one person throughout the film, but everything that happens has meaning and makes sense. The best part of this second part is its ability to subvert all expectations, bypassing them in a wise way, without frustrating them, but surprising with creativity and innovation. There are crucial moments in the plot that leave the viewer simply without imagining what will happen next, leading him to believe that the story has reached a dead end. It is not because it was a more serious and profound film that he doesn't have fun and is funny. The perfect example of this is in the figure of the master Pai Mei, extremely arrogant, but very wise. In its scenes, the technical part recreates precisely the types of samurai films on which the character was based. Although references are in lower numbers, in Volume 2 they are more obvious.The soundtrack, as in all of the director's works, is yet another character in both volumes. On the two soundtracks, the songs range from country music to selections of spaghetti western punctuated by Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film Twisted Nerve is whistled by the fearsome Elle Driver on the hospital scene. When The Bride enters Casa das Folhas Azuis, the go-go group The 5.6.7.8's plays 'I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield', 'I'm Blue' and 'Woo Hoo'. The connection with Lady Snowblood is further established by the use of 'The Flower of Carnage' in the final theme of the film and we cannot forget Gheorghe Zamfir The in the beautiful song 'Lonely Shepherd'. It also plays the song 'Shot Me Down', at the beginning of Vol. 1. In general, the songs on both volumes are very eclectic and that goes well with the film which also justifies the fact that the soundtrack was so acclaimed and considered by many one of the best of recent times.Tarantino gave more life to his work, more reason and more feeling to everything. If the saga of revenge 'Kill Bill' had not been divided into two fundamentally the same, but in detail different. The way it was done, Tarantino gave us two masterpieces, two odes to genre cinema that work each in their own unique way to the point that it is an arduous task to choose which one is the best. The works complement each other. It remains to be seen whether a single three-hour film could not further raise the status of films. 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is a sadistic, creative adventure full of pop references that serve both to honor and to please a new audience. The combination of the two volumes mixes everything and gives consistency to enter the mind of one of the most relevant directors of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Best Movie EVER!!!,"Kill Bill vol.1 and vol.2 are definitely the best movies(duology) in cinema history.

I admire Robert Rodriguez and RZA a lot. Itis the first time Tarantino uses Morricone music, children to play in the movie,katana swords. I loved the idea of using sword. It is actually a film with a lot of martial arts, chapters, revenge, violence & love and it has no sex scenes which is very important for the movie. The Bride is not a woman for sex. She is a warrior who wants to take her daughter back.The end scene creates a feeling of justice.Definitely, best movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Veyr good, extremely violent","Tarantino is once again at his strongest in this genre' of action and reaction movies. The martial arts fighting - absolutely essential to this genre' - I found to be believable (I know no martial arts - I'm just saying I was convinced the fighting was real). (Many times - MANY - times in scifi's the science is so loonie that there is no point in watching. Science is to scifi's as authentic looking fighting is to a Tarantino movie. However, the acting was unconvincing. I saw Ulma Thurman and knew it was her the whole time - same for the other actors. 8 out of 10....sans Michael Parks as 'Estabon' - I was mesmerized by this Spanish gentleman of leisure who scared me in my chair. I was scared - he was so calm and pleasant and yet there was a cauldron of aggression just sitting tranquilly waiting to be disturbed so it could explode (""esplode"" as Estaban might say it) on another helpless human... Estabon scared me... THEN I saw the credits and thought to myself: ""It was Michael Parks?!?"" He should win an Oscar for best actor! (I was amazed even more when the western style sheriff who investigates the Pine Church massacre in KB:V.1 turns out to be Parks as well.) Now if that range and depth of acting doesn't win an award... then the academy needs to reevaluate its assessment technique. Parks was brilliant! He was so good I thought that this guy is too real - he is too scary - he has got to be caste from off the street! Michael Parks gets a 20 out of 10; 4 thumbs up; A+++; major plus superlative kudos.

Now, don't get me wrong, I for one cherish slow burners, but that's only when the narrative demands it or should the necessity arise. Not in this case though, as for a revenge plot, that is full of Action & Gore; I'm not quite sure if this is what the script required!Nevertheless, it still got plenty of combats and high octane moments to keep the audience entertained; albeit they may not be on the same level as the battles we have witnessed on the last occasion. However, the performances are far more sophisticated if not somewhat better! Uma Thurman yet again put up a terrific show, and so does David Carradine as Bill.

Apart from the action sequences I kinda fell movie little average because it doesn't have much to show except from the past story. But you can easily sideline that story part if you see the performance of UMA THURMAN what a performer she is. From acting to learning the fighting style is so good to watch and I think only Tarantino could do this. It's the director vision which makes the story and the lead cast powerful. Talking about the music, It's Tarantino's film and you don't like the music is not possible.

Love hurts...,"Uma Thurman returns as the Bride, who this time looks to continue her streak of vengeance against Budd(Michael Madsen), Ellie Driver(Daryl Hannah) and Bill(David Carradine) the movie delivers more substance than the predecessor and is better due to the texture provided by character actors who perform their roles excellently. I liked Kill Bill:Volume 2 better than Volume 1, mainly due to the attention given the relationship between Carradine and Thurman, which overall makes the ending tragic. David Carradine has always been an underrated talent and although he made a lot of lame B. movies, he was almost always the best thing about them and in the role of Bill, this is his best performance in years. Uma Thurman is also effective, as is the cast and Tarantino abandons his usual smart-ass line readings in favor of a western atmosphere. Also on board is Michael Parks who is always a welcome presence. However what really accounts for KBV2's best qualities are the training montage scenes as well as the final showdown which consists of poignant dialog which turns this into more of a tragic piece rather than a simple revenge saga. Plus it's weird but Carradine and Thurman have an odd chemistry which never lets us doubt for a moment that they indeed love each other. Simply put this a movie that is well worth owning on DVD.

Tarantino's amusing super-assassin bizarro world,"RELEASED IN 2004 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" completes the story of 2003's ""Vol. 1"" and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fiancé & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.This part of the duology is more dialogue-driven than ""Vol. 1,"" fleshing-out the characters and answering many questions. Such as: How is The Bride such an unconquerable fighter? How did Elle lose her right eye? Why did Bill conduct the wedding massacre? How does Budd spend his retirement? The problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and merciless assassins to boot. It's impossible to give criminal scum ""more depth,"" at least as far as caring for them goes. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and would've been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, cutting out the fat.Still, the movie's so offbeat that it's entertaining in the manner of 1996's ""Mojave Moon,"" but better. It's an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70's martial arts flicks, Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the ""Kill Bill"" flicks are cinematic masterpieces of auteurism is overdoing it. Take, for instance, the ridiculous closing credits, which run well over 12 minutes: The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. If you want masterworks by Tarantino, see ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); or even ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) and ""Jackie Brown"" (1997).Still, the movie's strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and Bill's Superman analysis is insightful.

Tarantino does it again...,"Tarantino falls back into his old groove with Kill Bill: Vol. 2 - a groove that sees the mediocre director trying to pass trash off as art. As with all of Tarantino's films (sans the legitimately well-crafted Pulp Fiction), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 works exceedingly hard at coming across as smarter than it really is... and as always, this ultimately fruitless technique leaves Tarantino's film looking even worse than it needed to.Even operating under the notion that the film is making a conscious effort to make fun of itself and point out how bad it truly is, it still falls flat. By relying on the same two gags over and over again, Tarantino is offering up a veritable admission that he's in too far over his head, and that he really has no clue what he's doing.To top it all off, Tarantino lies back on techniques usually reserved for enhancing a film, or, at the very least, enhancing a scene. But Tarantino throws these techniques in haphazardly, filming a scene in black and white not because it helps the scene in any way, but simply because he's taking a random crack at producing intelligence.Looking at the two films (Volume 1 and Volume 2) as a whole, it becomes painfully obvious that Tarantino split these up solely in an effort to make more money, or else he has no sense of direction whatsoever, because the two films are split as unevenly as possible. Even as one film, all the action takes place at the beginning and all the elements that are supposed to represent plot and character development are crammed into the latter half. Even worse, this second film is comprised mostly of filler that has no real relevance to the story that Tarantino is already butchering.All in all, the film is nothing you wouldn't expect from Tarantino, but that's not a good thing by any means. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is Tarantino's worst to date, and the whole film feels more like a mockery of cinematic techniques than anything else.

"The Bride's Follow-Up Changes Gears, But Remains Intense and Riveting","A much slower, more suspensefully contemplative take on the same material as its first chapter. Rather than being on a non-stop offensive, this time we see the Bride in a more reactive role as her kills don't always go so swimmingly. Along the way, we catch a glimpse at her training in a stereotypically isolated Japanese temple, alongside an impishly charismatic bearded master, the show-stealing Pai Mei. When it comes time for the inevitable showdown with Bill himself, Tarantino plays his trump card and leaves a driven audience (and vengeful bride) confused about the apparent simplicity of their quest of the last four-plus hours. It's not as instantly captivating as the first package, and a few segments fall curiously flat, but it's enjoyable in surprising new ways and provides the closure we were all so desperate for.

Anyone placing this film out of the all-time top 10 doesn't love film,"I just watched this film again after having seen it when it first came out and I am awe-struck: I have never seen a film equal itself in spell-binding impact as thoroughly the second time around as 'Kill Bill'. Spielberg and Ridley Scott are two other formidable filmmakers capable of that, to mention a few, but for sheer entertainment value, I think Tarantino clearly outdoes them both. Earlier today at the gym I was watching the death of Go Go in 'Kill Bill: Volume I' and all the way home I was smiling ear to ear. There's no way I was going to miss 'Kill Bill: Volume II'.The thing about Tarantino's masterpiece is that he is dead on in the emotional aspects of the story. The current of feeling is so strong that my wife has to turn away in certain spots. What I can't understand is how is it every actor in this movie was aware of its quality while it was being shot? Somehow every performance is so unbelievably compelling it's quite difficult to judge who did the best job.It's impossible to praise one without wanting to praise them all, but I will say that I thought Uma was a bad choice when I first heard she had the lead. She just seemed too lightweight physically. But rather than spoil the movie, in many ways, she is its best part, which is saying a great deal in this case. Like all great actresses, she essentially makes you fall in love with her. Quite a trick considering she does this by overcoming a substantial barrier of space and time. Could there be a sequel? I wouldn't think it possible except this is Quentin Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill: Vol. 2,"This is so much better than volume one. The ""Bride"" (Uma Thurman) is continuing her quest to avenge herself on the killer of her fiancée and unborn child, but unlike with the first outing we do not face more endless ensemble fight scenes. This is much more focussed and individual. Her encounter with ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen) tests her mettle - and her panic control in a frighteningly claustrophobic manner - before the eyepatch sporting Daryl Hannah (""Elle"") offers probably her finest on-screen performance as together they manage to demolish a motor home using samurai swords and their body weight. We learn more about how she learned her ninja skills under the guise of the curmudgeonly swordsmith and master of all things cerebral ""Hattori Hanzo"" (Sonny Chiba) and all of this builds up to a quirky denouement with her nemesis - the eponymous ""Bill"" (David Carradine) who reminded me throughout of his days as ""Grasshopper"" in ""Kung Fu"". It flies along, this film, with bags of one-to-one action, humour, a decent soundtrack and some interesting historical and cultural undertones that help ground the film more effectively. In my view it is easily the best role Thurman has had to play, and this second outing gives her far more scope to shine as an actor. The writing isn't great - especially towards the end, but that doesn't matter as the escapades, action and strong characters more than compensate for that. My favourite Tarantino film - easily.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
fantastic!!!,"When I first saw kill Bill vol. 1 I was so pleasantly surprised because first of all, I didn't expect I would like a Tarantino movie that much (this movie turned me into a big fan of QT!!) and second of all, that underneath this bloody, feisty plot is a great story about a great woman that is so strong and in the same time so warm, which might not be noticeable in vol. 1. The next day I bought Kill Bill soundtrack because the music swept me away, and I couldn't wait vol. 2 to come out. In a way I was afraid what to expect... WOW!!!! The biggest dilemma after seeing it was:"" which one I like better?"" Than I realized i DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE AT ALL. Volume 2 is all about knowing the Btide, understanding her reasons which were'n trivial at all. Music is just as good, Michael Madson, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks as s Mexican pimp... WOW! Everybody were fantastic! QT created a new world in this movie and everything makes perfect sense in it, nothing is strange (not even to me, until now, a complete kung-fu ignorant), whatever a person does, we understand, we can relate.

Best to rent Vol 1 and 2 and watch it together!,"Volume 2 like Volume 1 is lacking, and the story misses that special sauce. This movie in reality is 1 cut into 2, thus watching 1 leaves the story lacking, and too silly, and watching 2 the movie is serious, but lacks depth, because the viewer loses continuity and background from the 1.   If I watch the 2 films together, the movie would be a 7 or 8, but separate the viewer loses the film's rhythm, making the film awkward, giving the film a less deserving 6.  Kill Bill is outlandish  and entertaining enough to compare with Dusk til Dawn.  Rent the two films together and watch them one after the other so that the story makes sense.  I would not have minded if the movie was long at the theatre, they could of just had an intermission. For example, Scarface and the Godfather had intermissions.  I hope the studio did not cut this movie in 2 for revenue reasons.  Imagine how awful the Godfather or Scarface movie experience would of been if the audience had to wait 3 months to see what happened after Sonny got killed or Tony got arrested for washing money.  6 out of 10 possible 7 or 8 if the 2 volumes were watched together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"sound, fury and absolutely nothing else; I'm embarrassed to have contributed to its gross takings","Everyone is anxious to underline how clever Tarantino is at paying homage to a broad range of cinematic influences. Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films. The tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype.

Tarantino's self-adored mysticism and issues with self-indulgence this time around make it the boring mess that this post talks about. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened.

In the mood to look back at Tarantino's earlier films I came across a piece that suggested part 2 was far superior to part 1. I deduced that the first part would concentrate on the awful treatment metered out and a prolonged training process in readiness for revenge which would be part 2. This, it seems is only partly true with the first actually being much more a traditional QT product full of style and panache with the second much more interested in giving the characters background.

AKA KILL BILL VOL 2...One of the few worthy sequels,"This chapter of the ""Bride's"" story picks up precisely where it left us, at the end of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, and seamlessly carries us forward through the second half of Tarantino's dark and twisted saga.This chapter was not nearly as sanguineous as the first, but was more treacherously deranged (if you can believe it). The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking.As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse, the players find they must stop at nothing, in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge.

Should never have been separated from part one,"After seeing the fantastic first part of Kill Bill, I was counting the days until I could go and see the sequel. Finally I was able to go, and then this. I was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't really outright bad, it wasn't really outright boring, but it was the perfect anti-climax to Vol. 1. Mr. Tarantino should never have cut that into two parts! If it would have been one long film, I think I wouldn't see the second part as I do now. After the first two hours of what is now Vol. 1 with its thrill, the violence, the speed of it, continuing a bit slowing (okay, forget the 'bit'), continuing slower paced, leading to the end, that would have been okay. But since the first part is now some months old, and with the expectations I had for Vol. 2, I felt a bit like the guy jumping out of the birthday cake ""BOOO"" and realising he was two hours early and no one is there.The one good scene it it was that piece where The Bride got buried alive, until she walked into that café asking for water. And I like the piece where she tore out the last remaining eye from Elle. What I also liked (first I thought what the hell) was Bill's speech about super heroes and superman and what's the difference between Superman and the others.

One of Tarantino's lesser efforts; a notch down from the first KILL BILL; still very good...,"The opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" roar across the screen with a vengeance, indicating a second installment that may very well be superior in many ways to that of its first. For about the first forty minutes or so, this theory seemed to hold steadfast, but as the clock kept ticking and the dialogue kept on rambling I found myself just a bit under whelmed by a film that, although a fine motion picture, is entirely different from its predecessor -- and not necessarily in a very good way.I estimated that about forty rather unnecessary minutes could (and should) have been cut by the editor. There's the totally nonessential twenty minutes spent introducing us to Budd (Michael Madsen), a hit man who works for Bill (David Carradine), who in turn is being targeted by hate-filled Bride (Uma Thurman). The flaw of this setup is that it is superfluous and unneeded -- Budd is presented to the audience as a loser, working at a deserted strip joint in Texas, fired from his job and living the life of a bum.Perhaps Quentin should have saved these scenes for the supposed director's cut of the films being released to DVD some time this year (or next). They don't exactly click with the entirety of his movie -- they simply slow it down. It is as if Quentin is paying his respects to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with way far too much empty dialogue. It was great in ""Pulp Fiction"" because it *wasn't* empty, but here it is, to be frank, rather meaningless. One of many things I loved about the first film was its supremely fast pace with non-stop action -- but in a good way. It was a no-holds-barred revenge story with references ranging from Hideo Gasha to Sergio Leone to Brian DePalma in many literal ways. The first installment was very campy and just good ol' fun -- Quentin best described it as doing for '70s grind house cinema what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did for the serials of the '30s and '40s. The second installment is just plain different -- not much of an homage, all of the gratuitous style is gone. Also gone is much of the enthusiasm -- hard to explain in a review but very apparent to the viewers.I also didn't appreciate the ending very much. Throughout the first installment of the series (now rumored to be a trilogy, completed in fifteen years) the goals of The Bride were most important -- nothing stood in her way. From start to finish it was a brutal, stylish ride designed for the movie buff within us all. We didn't feel the need to sympathize with her because she was not a particularly sympathetic character. Many people complained about this. It seems that Quentin has heard their cries -- the audiences who complained about lack of character progression and Tarantinoesque dialogue need not worry -- ""Volume 2"" has plenty of it. And in my own opinion far too much.""Volume 2"" has too many long gaps that break the non-stop action -- perhaps to compensate for lack of actual storyline. It's a revenge movie. No need for long scenes with metaphorical speeches. When The Bride finally comes face-to-face with her final foe, Quentin puts the story on hold, completely throwing off the audience in a very negative way. Bill's dialogue to The Bride about superhero comic books was embarrassingly Tarantino -- he hinted at his love for comic books in the screenplay for ""True Romance,"" and here it seems oddly out of place.As a whole, ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" is very good. As a sequel to one of the best films of 2003, it is a rather lackluster affair, very different from the original but mostly in rather unfortunate ways. As a whole its predecessor is far superior -- I left ""Volume 2"" feeling a bit under whelmed and disappointed. Had Tarantino chosen to delete forty minutes of unnecessary balderdash and kept up the style and pace and brutality of the first film, I feel as though I might have left feeling very pleased. Instead I left telling myself that it was, at the very least, a good conclusion to the story -- which may still be open for yet another installment in fifteen years, according to Tarantino, who wants to make it his ""Dollars"" trilogy. And so we wait...4/5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Quentin Tarantino is a special director!,"Anyone can film a remake. A tribute. Revamped stories. Ripoffs films. Etc.

Tarantinos' film-making is poetry - he does not rely on one genre or another, one style or another, one film or another. He is able to thank all of his own muses individually, while remaining a unique screenwriter and director with something important to say on screen. Characters that would otherwise be ridiculous, actors that are often sub-par, dialogue that could be boring as hell - he brings it all to LIFE in a way that VERY FEW directors are capable of doing. He is a Kurosawa, an Attenborough, a Spielberg of our time - a true cinematic artist.

At times this comic-bookness seemed like a cop-out, providing an easy out for things like, how can someone get shot point blank with a double barrel shotgun and not have to deal with a cavern in their chest -- or at the very least the embedded buckshot.  Clearly, the director is so in love with the images and the IDEA of the film, that he loses the plot and structure of the actual film we are watching.

The tribute film that could,"While Kill Bill was originally intended to be one film, somewhere along the line the decision was made to split it into two parts, and it's quite surprising just how well this works. On the surface, volume 2 is the Spaghetti Western half of Tarintino's tribute to cult films. But when you compare to two movies on a deeper level, they're dramatically different films.The first half of the Kill Bill saga was essentially an extended romp that introduced the characters, conflicts and mythology of the story through highly stylized action scenes. Slower paced, with significantly less action and outlandish violence, Volume 2 is a departure from the original. But what it loses in action and style it more than substance. While the plot is still a revenge story, it's one of the most complex and humanized revenge sagas ever put on film. The central aspect of the plot is the relationship between the Bride (Thurman) and Bill (Carradine). Both of these characters turn out to be surprisingly deep, and through excellent dialog and acting we can understand their relationship to one another, as well as the supporting characters. This slowly builds up and comes to a head with their meeting. Some complained that the final confrontation was anti-climatic, but I couldn't disagree more. It's a deeply emotional moment for both characters, and is the perfect conclusion for the Bride's journey.And of course, the plot isn't the only thing to praise with this film. Tarantino's directing skills are, as always, superb. Uma Thurman was superb, and David Carradine gives an almost mythical performance as Bill. The supporting cast was excellent as well (particuarlly Madsen and Liu). Tarentino has always been known for being able to combine music and scenes memorably, and Kill Bill is no exception, with the score lending itself to the film perfectly.While it still possesses the style and action of it's predecessor, Kill Bill Volume 2 sets itself apart with it's deep and emotion filled story. No other director could have made this film, and Tarantino shows why he's revered as one of today's greatest directors. By paying homage to the his influences and heroes, Tarantino has created a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Eh.,"My first thought is that this isn't nearly as good as the first one. But that's a little unfair, since the first one was (for me) an amazing film.Making a two-volume movie is a huge gamble. If the first one tanks, then no one's going to want to see the second one, which has likely already been filmed. If the first one is a rousing success, though, then it becomes the standard by which the second one is judged. For the filmmaker, this can be a losing proposition.The movie follows the revenge game played by The Bride (Uma Thurman), on her quest to find the man who ordered her wedding party slaughtered. Oh, and the man whose baby she was carrying when he put a bullet in her brain. Only the bullet didn't kill The Bride - it merely put her in a long coma. And when she woke up - look out!In the first film, The Bride tracked down two of her former compadres in killing as part of an elite hit squad. Now she has three names left on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and her ex-boss and ex-lover, Bill (David Carradine).Quentin Tarantino takes an approach similar to the one he used to such great success in Pulp Fiction and that he reused in the first Kill Bill movie - scenes (chapters, in this case) that are shown to the audience out of order. Luckily, the scenes aren't so jumbled that the audience can't follow what's going on. In fact, the order rearranging is fairly tame by Tarantino standards.Tarantino does a great job in incorporating various movie genres into his film; it's part samurai thriller, part kung fu actioner, part cheesy, kitschy, zap-powie seventies schlock. He's always been proficient in this area; Pulp Fiction's characters at times seemed to be stuck in the seventies, but at the same time they didn't appear to be fish out of water. That's the genius of Tarantino.Where this film diverges from the first, however, is in its pacing. Volume 1 was chock full of fast-paced action scenes - The Bride taking on the Crazy 88 springs to mind - but while there are a few interesting, riveting scenes in Vol. 2, there aren't nearly enough of them. And because there are insufficient action scenes, there are plenty of times when the movie seems to flag a little. A lull in a Tarantino movie can be richly cultivated (remember the ""awkward silences"" scene with Thurman and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but if there's nothing going on either above or below the surface, then the audience will get a little bored. Especially if they've been expecting wall-to-wall gore.The performances are rather remarkable, however. Thurman continues to amaze as The Bride (a character she and Tarantino came up with together). Quick - how many action movies can you name that had a strong female lead? Ok, now how many of those were any good? Thurman would have to be incredible in order to carry this film, and she doesn't disappoint in the least. Whereas she was a pleasant surprise in Vol. 1, we now expect her to do the same in Vol. 2, and she's up to the task.Equally up to the task is 67-year-old David Carradine. Yep, 67. I didn't realize he was such an old goat! And one look at him... well, let's just say Mr. Carradine has lived a hard life. Leathery and craggy, he's a Mount Rushmore of actors - and I don't mean in terms of professional stature. Carradine's quickly approaching his dad's prolific career (John Carradine appeared in around 500 movies). But he's found the role of a lifetime as Bill, and he commands every scene he's in. That velvety-smooth, world-weary voice disguises a malevolent scheming that lets you know he will persevere in the end. But does he? Doesn't the title belie that answer?Michael Madsen is just okay in his role as Bill's brother Budd, but that's not an insult. He's just Michael Madsen, turning in a performance one expects from Michael Madsen (who could forget him as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs?).Another of Tarantino's more admirable traits is that he's able to get compelling performances of a lifetime from his actors. Take Daryl Hannah. Could anyone really have predicted she would even be IN this movie? The mermaid from Splash? But as Elle Driver, Hannah's cold, sexy.... and blind in one eye. (How she lost that one eye is explained, rather vividly.)Tarantino also loves to bring back moldy-oldie actors from Back in the Day, partly to revive their careers and partly as an homage to those older films he grew up with. This time around, he has Gordon Liu, who plays the mystical Pai Mei, who trained Bill's elite squad. We see some amazing scenes of The Bride being trained hard by Pai Mei, scenes that are of course reminiscent of all of the wise-master-training-young-hotshot kung-fu films (such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master). We also see Bo Svenson as the reverend who's about to marry The Bride, and Michael Parks as old Bill friend Esteban Vihaio. Oh, and Sid Haig, whom I last saw in House of 1,000 Corpses, is barkeep at the nudie bar at which Budd's a bouncer.Aside from the sometimes-turgid pacing, another problem is the soundtrack. There were several times throughout the movie when the music was substantially louder than the dialogue on the screen! Now, I ask you - does that make any sense? Tarantino's always been a stickler for having the right song for the right scene, but come on - if I can't hear his strong dialogue, what's the point?I guess this film, in essence, didn't grab me as the first one did. I didn't leave the theater satisfied. I didn't leave with some of my favorite scenes still being played in my mind, over and over again. For me, the movie was flat and fell below expectations. It's still a well-done movie, but it's not up to Vol. 1's excellence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Much ado about nothing...,"...is the title of a Shakespearian comedy. This movie reflects it. There's a lot of blabla but without any deeper meaning. It is Tarantino style dialogue which is meant to sound cool. The only problem is that there's too much of it. This movie lacks of everything the first movie had: Suspense, good action and interesting ideas like i.e. the anime part. On the other hand it has everything the first didn't need: Lots of gibberish dialogue which prolongs the movie endlessly. It all would have been a great 3 hour movie if u packed the first and second part together. If you get to rent the dvd I would recommend watching the deleted scene.

Why make references?,"I quite liked this movie, not as much as the 1st, but there you go, anyway, Tarantino skillfully and stylishly made SUBTLE references in Pulp Fiction (e.g. the milkshake thing), Reservoir Dogs and his screenplay to True Romance, but when they're so open, where's the fun? It sort of ruins it, and looks like he's simply making an 'Ode to '60s westerns' or an ode to 70s samurai movies. There really was no point in overloading it with these (i'm sure there were a whole lot more i didn't get as well!); he's shown that he's a cinephile (to say the least), why not stop all these references which have been the substance of the downfall of his worst movie to date?",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This is a good movie...just not as good as the first one,"Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX.

The writing takes a step back from the first film. The dialogue and training scenes are great. The trailer scene is awesome. There are some great revelations in this; however, the ending sequence and how this movie concluded is a bit disappointing and a letdown.

Magnificent Tribute to the Movies,"""Kill Bill, Volume 2"" confirmed for me that I will never, in my entire life, ever be able to see as many movies as Quentin Tarantino has already seen.While ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" convinced me that I would not in fact want to see the zillions of samurai, chop-sockey, anime, etc. genre films that he had seen and was joyously reenacting in every chapter, ""Volume 2,"" a.k.a. the second half of really one movie, is an extensive tribute to movies which I have seen, from John Ford and Sergio Leone Westerns to Billy Wilder comedies and noirs and on and on. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose, the voluble Tarantino made his case as a film historian by claiming that Uma Thurman is his visual muse like Josef von Sternberg's inspiration was Marlene Dietrich, but that was just one calculated explanation for the older demographic who watches PBS as their violent collaboration may make Scorcese/DeNiro comparisons more apt.In ""Volume 2"" the other movie references are astounding and breathtaking -- every note of music (the extensive actual samples and the connectors by Robert Rodriguez), every setting, prop and article of clothing on screen, camera angle, actor cast, through all the nostalgic credits, let alone every clip any character is watching on their TV, is a loving tribute to another film (we will have to wait for the super deluxe collector's edition DVD that combines Volumes 1 and 2 to communicate the footnotes with multiple eggs).Yet it manages not to be a pastiche or a parody, but a masterful, post-modern work of art culminating in a passionate expression of love of movies as the ultimate bed time story (as accompanied by one of my favorite songs, Shivaree's creepy take on ""Good Night Moon""), even if it cannot stand on its own to be enjoyed by the kind of person who only sees a couple of movies a decade. Tarantino may be a motormouth but he is in complete control of all these references, cutting them up like a collage and lovingly transforming them within his vision.To the disappointment of the kid in the back row who didn't shut up, ""Volume 2"" has far less sock 'em violent set pieces, cartoonish or otherwise, than the earlier chapter, and far more very funny humor and marvelous dialog, especially as delivered by an iconic David Carradine (others will connect him to this film via the TV series ""Kung Fu,"" but I first loved him in the TV version of ""Shane,"" which is also recalled here). From the planes of his craggy visage, to Uma's gleaming eyes and lips, to the cinematography of Robert Richardson, this is also a strikingly beautiful film.It is certainly not necessary to have seen ""Volume 1"" to appreciate the second part, but that adds to the power of the unexpectedly cathartic change that The Bride undergoes on her quest, redolent of ""The Wizard of Oz.""Tarantino emotionally yet ironically makes the case that violent movies are fantasies that don't turn people into killers, rather they can bring families together.And now I do want to catch up on samurai movies!(originally written 4/30/2004)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A big improvement over the first.,"Stars: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Gordon Lui, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, Bo Svenson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeannie Epper, Sid Haig and Perla Haney Jardine.This is an excellent movie in every way. It's about ex assassin Beatrix Kiddo going to kill the last two assassins, Budd (Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) and then kill Bill. The reasons that I enjoyed this over the last is that this movie puts action and style second to good writing and character development, yet it still has great style. Where the first was a Japanese action movie, most of this is like a Spagetti Western. The first film was more like a hard core action flick, where this one had some time to breathe in between, and was more like ""Jackie Brown"" in it's quietness but still very entertaining. Some other positives are Gordon Lui who played a different tole in Kill Bill 1. He plays her teacher Pei Mei in a long flashback. Michael Parks is also very good as Bill's 80 year old pimp father figure.My rating: 10/10 stars. 138 mins. rated R for violence, language and drug use.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill Bill Vol 2 was the best movie released so far this year, QT is a genius that makes movies that he likes to watch, he doesn't care if we like them or not, but the fact is we do, and there are reasons for this.Seems to me that the detractors have probably never seen a spaghetti western, let me recommend one to you.A Fistful of Dollars, see this movie and then watch Kill Bill again and you will see exactly were QT is coming from, his use of silence is as breathtaking as anything Sergio Leone ever did. This is where QT comes into his own, he uses other film makers methods but improves upon them. He is the ultimate fan, and because he knows and loves the genres he pays homage to, we are brought back to these excellent films, and we are left in no doubt that we are seeing one mans love for them.I can honestly say that Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are probably going to be around a long time, these are movies that will be held as benchmarks for film-makers in the future, in these movies we see how it should be done.

Easily One of the Best Movies of 2004,"18 April 2004. Less violence, more character - Volume 2 goes where most movie dare not tread - character development and slow-moving dialogue with a superb David Carradine in a Best-Supporting Actor performance working with an amazing script and subtle complex series of acting and expressional, mysterious, ominous wit. Uma Thurman explodes onto the screen with full facial exposure in black and white as well as color. The plot-twists abound, the world is turned upside down in both silence and loud crashing drama, in pitch darkness and blazing heated fury.The old style Western movie music, the samurai Japanese style genre, the humor, the violence all are blended, folded and fused into a perfect piece of cinema that throws the whole direction of Volume One into another dimension. This powerfully emotional, sometimes funny drama, action, mystery, martial arts genre bursts through into a new creative, cinematic experience. Unleashed from the prior expectations and assumption of Volume 1, this movie both irritates, frustrates and re-directs its focus into another world of ""Kill Bill"" with its refocused emphasis and toned down sword play and more cerebral manifestation of dialogue and careful, singular artistry of martial arts.Oscar nominations for Kill Bill Volume 2 (best picture) Quentin Tarantino (best director & writing) Uma Thurman (best actor & writing) David Carradine (bestsupporting male performance) Michael Madsen (best supporting male performance) Robert Richardson (best cinematography) and Oscar nominations for sound and film editing",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

How could this happen?,"Very disappointing, everything that worked in Vol 1, has backfired for Vol 2. I rather enjoyed the slow pacing of the first, here it is just frustrating, nothing happens. Though there is still plenty of black humour, I didn't care much for it. I was bored, there was hardly even any action. Several sections of the film seem unnecessary, and the finale is so anticlimactic, that I can't help but think Tarantino had bigger plans or that Something must've gone wrong during production. Maybe he had to rush to complete it, maybe he lost ten to fifteen minutes of exiting material. Whatever the case, vol 2. is a bore.That said, it would be wrong to say that the film offers nothing new. Uma Thurman gets upstaged by a killer performance from the late David Carrandine. He has a very commanding presence. Vol. 2 also gives us the answers to all the questions we had when vol 1 ended, but thats about the only thing useful in this screenplay. I felt cheated out of a good time with kill Bill vol 2. This leaves me with a tough decision. Considering the competence of vol.1 do I recommend it? only if you want to know what happens next. Otherwise, just get a friend to tell you, or have him/her screen you the mere two or three scenes which actually contribute to the story.then again, my opinion seems to be in the minority, so you I'd imagine you'd be liable to watch regardless of what I have to say",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Vol.2 is the 2nd half of one of the greatest movies ever.,"In my opinion, Kill Bill Vol.2 was one of the best sequels I've ever seen, even though it wasn't really a sequel. It seemed a little slow the first time I saw it, since I was expecting it to have all the same action as the first one. However, the second time around, I got to appreciate it for the great movie it was and how well everything came together. The chemistry between Uma Thurman and David Carradine was amazing. I think it's a crime that Carradine wasn't nominated for an academy award for his performance. Thurman should have been nominated as well. I thought the music and the atmosphere to this movie were great. The Kill Bill series was Quentin Tarantino's best work, in my opinion. If you've only seen Vol.2 once, you have to see it again to really appreciate how great it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Masterpiece!,"I had heard so much about this movie before I saw it. Yet none of what I heard/read prepared me for the brilliance of this movie. Quenton Tarantino knows all the hooks that make a great movie and uses all of them here.It's strange, because, I kinda know what's going to happen throughout the movie, yet the movie kept surprising me. You know Bill has to die at the end, but yet.....There are so many WONDERFUL performances throughout the movie, but two stood out to me: David Carradine, and Daryl Hannah.David Carradine is brilliant with his understated performance, going from affable, to menacing quickly and smoothly. You understand his side of things at the end and find yourself thinking....""Well, maybe"" before you remember that there were other people in that chapel besides The Bride and he is a hardened killer who, although he regrets what he did to The Bride, he never expresses remorse for the others.Daryl Hannah shows another side to her acting which, in my humble opinion, was just as shocking as seeing Charlize Theron in Monster. The public is not used to seeing Hannah as a hardened character. She usually plays the sweet, lovely girl. The films I have seen her in have all been fluffy and light. Even Clan of the Cave Bear wasn't as gritty as the book had been. I feel she comes into her own in this movie and shows what a real craftsman she can be.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it was a serious movie that didn't take itself seriously. There were several moments when you couldn't help but smile (the scene where The Bride is being taught by Pei Mei is a classic!) At the end, when they show scenes from the movie as they roll credits, when they show David Carradine...well, ya gotta see it to believe it...BRILLIANT!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The Kill Bill movies are definitely one of the few movies you can watch again and again and just not grow tired of it anytime soon. There's a very few films that has that caliber. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars just to name a few. And ofc my personal favorite, Van Helsing. Enough talk from me though, all I can say is...

Who says sequels are always worse?,"Volume Two picks up precisely where Volume One concludes on a cliffhanger, and it is necessary to have seen the first one in order to follow the plot. Naturally, Tarantino, Thurman and Carradine return to wrap up the saga of revenge and violence, accompanied by Michael Madsen (another of Tarantino's favourites) and Daryl Hannah, both of whom are positively given additional screen time in this film.Having already crossed two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad off her hit list, we follow the Bride as she travels to a desert caravan park to confront Bill's brother Bud and fellow assassin Elle, who just happens to be Bill's newest lover. Sadly, she does so without the use of her beloved Pussy Wagon which (if I may make a pop culture reference of my own) we can assume was stolen by Lady Gaga. From there, she makes her way to Bill himself, where she makes a startling discovery that stands to challenge her motives entirely.I mentioned at the beginning of the first review that to cover both volumes in a single document would be a tough ask due to the overt differences between the two. While Volume Two contains the violence expected from a film of this genre, it is nowhere near as gratuitous as the original, which sought primarily to reference the kung-fu genre in an exploitative sense.Instead, Volume Two is somewhat more insightful and makes an effort to question the very nature of violence, and whether or not it is warranted in different circumstances. Anybody expecting the same scale of bloodshed as its predecessor will leave disappointed as the action in this film, while enjoyable, is severely unpleasant and never without consequence.Tarantino delivers some of his best work in terms of both dialogue and set pieces with this pseudo-sequel. Apart from what could be considered an unnecessary opening scene in which The Bride breaks the fourth wall only to state the explicitly obvious, there are virtually no other instances where any character's lines feel either forced or lazily written. Madsen's perfect delivery of 'that woman deserves her revenge andwe deserve to die' and Bill's well- crafted monologue about mortality during the climax not only sum up the themes of the film neatly, but are also indicators that QT is back on his game in the screenplay department.The extremely claustrophobic scene in which Bud (Madsen) buries The Bride alive is nothing short of terrifying, and is right up there with the Velociraptors in the kitchen (Jurassic Park) and Vito's assassination of Don Fanucci (The Godfather: Part 2) as one of my all-time favourite scenes. The training session with Pai Mei showcasing the origins of The Bride's development into a professional assassin is more than just an entertaining set piece; it is a film-within-a-film, and should be treated accordingly. Where some may view it as a major disruption to the story, I feel this was Tarantino's intention in an effort to further emphasise the film's exploitation angle.Where violence is lacking, it is replaced by the development of genuinely interesting characters, accommodating a unique screenplay and fitting comfortably within the slower pace of this film when compared to Volume One. With such a complete and satisfying ending, confirmed rumours of a third instalment scream of a Miramax cash-grab.

Great Ending To QT's Tale Of Revenge,"Kill Bill Volume 2 (directed by Quentin Tarantino) is a great, great movie. I don't know why Uma Thurman didn't get nominated for Best Actress because she gives a fantastic, emotional performance. There really is nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack is great, the directing brilliant and the dialogue better than the first.In Vol. 2 we follow The Bride's story of revenge. For those who haven't seen the first: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was gunned down at her wedding by the DIVAS. She has killed O-Ren Ishii (AKA Cottonmouth) and Vernita Green (AKA Copperhead). She still needs to kill Budd ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen), Elle ""California Mountain Snake"" (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill ""Snake Charmer"" (David Carradine). In typical QT style we flash back and forth, revealing The Bride's past and how she came to be such a good fighter.This, as I said before, is flawless. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance. Daryl Hannah plays a villain very well. Michael Madsen and David Carradine also give great performances. The music in this is wonderful and suits the movie perfectly.

I love KILL BILL: VOLUME 2. Uma did good acting especially, she did well-acting at the end of the film when she crying in the bathroom, i thought it was a shame that Uma didn't get a Oscar for her performance. What was good about VOL. 2, was it had all the answers. David Carradine was born to play Bill. The music by Quentin Tarrantino's best-friend Robert Rodriguez was good. I thought the song ""About her"" by Malcolm McClaren had good music and good lyrics, the song was about the relationship between The Bride and B.B. The fight between Elle and The Bride was a whoop-a** showdown and Elle got what she deserved. I thought the opening sequence when Uma is talking to the audience ""When i arrive at my destination. I'm gonna Kill Bill"" is one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. This is a highly-recommended film for fans of Quentin Tarrantion, Uma Thurman and David Carradine.

My female mind liked Volume 1 better. Vol. 2 still packs a wallop.,"I had rented Kill Bill: Vol. 1 last week. I liked it so much I couldn't wait for Vol. 2. Opening day, I was there. I might have had my hopes up too much. Volume 1 centered completely around the women. The guys are on the back burner 'til Vol. 2. That's probably why I reacted more favorably to Vol. 1. Vol. 2  is still a finely crafted film. I'm guessing that men liked Vol. 2 better since men are more prominent. Vol. 2 is a better film emotionally. The violence is less cartoonish. The fight between ""The Bride"" and ole one-eyed Daryl Hannah is quite realistic. (I kept thinking of Blade Runner during that scene). Well, as realistic as it can be. Who can really get thrown into walls time after time and continue fighting. Tarantino owes as much to spaghetti westerns as he does to martial arts films (which I've never been that fond of). Aren't nearly all of the man-with-no-name Eastwood films similar in theme? A wronged man gets his revenge. In this case, the Bride gets her revenge.

"A two-hour plus episode of ""Kung Fu""","Seriously, I don't get why the ""Kill Bill"" movies are held in such high regard. I loved the first three Tarantino movies and thought ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" was OK. ""Volume 2"", however, is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen recently.""Kill Bill 2"" continues the (paper-thin) plot of the first movie, but otherwise it's almost completely different. There is almost no action, much less eye candy (part 1 was ""style over substance"", while this one has neither substance NOR style), and a lot more talking. Normally, you'd say that a Tarantino movie with tons of dialog would be a good thing, right? In this case, however, I found the dialogs to be fairly boring. There are still a couple of amusing parts, but for the most part it's random chit-chat between rather dull characters you don't care about and don't relate to.For all it's differences, there's also something that both Kill Bill movies have in common: they're both way too long. In part one, the violence got boring long before the end, and in this movie all the talking becomes boring even faster. Face it, a very simple and predictable revenge story just isn't enough to fill four hours of movie, but Tarantino over-indulges himself in way too many things that he thinks are cool or clever, whereas mostly they're just lame or silly.I have to admit that Kill Bill 2 does a couple of things right, though. The flashback about the martial arts training by an ancient Chinese master is entertaining, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver is marvelous. I also think that David Carradine does a wonderful job of playing Bill. But those are only a couple of bright spots in a sea of dull dialog and unnecessary scenes.In the end, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is a two-hour plus episode of the old TV series ""Kung Fu"": it's about martial arts, there are flashbacks, and there's a lot of talking and very little action. If you're into old Kung Fu movies, chances are that you'll still love this one. But for those who actually prefer an interesting story and characters over a lot of supposedly cool fluff, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is best described as ""fairly boring"".**1/2 out of ***** stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I lack the kung fu capabilities of ""little Grasshopper""/Kwai Chang Kain David Carradine. My guess is they made a lot of money by spending as little as possible on locations, scenery and background. But why not if you can get away with it? As this is the part two of one movie I'm afraid that the whole thing is too long (4 hours) for a single line story, in which some impossibilities repeat to much, there could have been a bit more creative vision on these points.

Revenge is a forest,"At the end of Kill Bill 1, Hattori Hanzo is quoted, telling the Bride that she can get lost on the way to her revenge. This fantastic sequel shows that with its winding pathways.

Not at all what i expected,"I've decided to make this a review for both volume 1 & 2, simply because I'm too lazy to write two.Every time you see a Tarantino film you know it's going to be original and clever and that's exactly what i expected from Kill Bill. Well it certainly had the originality but it's the cleverness that made movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" so great that this one lacks.Especially in Volume 1 it seems as if they are trying to hide the quite dull and uninteresting story behind lots of gore and ""cool"" effects and sure they've done a good job because it seems to have fooled the majority of movie goers.Volume 2 was a bit better, it seemed more mature and intelligent than the first one and this is much thanks to some great acting especially from Uma Thurman who gives us a very believable and human assassin.    I often found that the only reason why I kept watching was due to Thurman's acting and i certainly hope we're going to get to see a lot of her from now on.Kill Bill isn't a bad movie, it does have it's bright moments and some very interesting characters but it isn't a ""top 250-movie"" either mainly because it just tries a bit too hard and sometimes it can actually get kind of boring which i thought would be impossible in a Quentin Tarantino Film.I'll give Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 7/10 stars for some great characters and acting but a not so great story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Exercise in Self-Indulgence,"All I have to say is WOW, what a big let down.  After loving the first Kill Bill, i went into this with high hopes.  Knowing it couldn't have been better that Vol. 1, i wasn't expecting the best.  But i had no idea it could be this bad.  The film, although not exactly horrible, is by far the worst Tarantino movie i have ever seen.  The dialogue, pacing, and acting all work together to solidify this movie has one of the biggest letdowns in film history (far behind the matrix revolutions, of course).   This movie seems like pure self-indulgence on Quentin Tarantino's part.  He draws out scenes to the point where you want to shot yourself. Now, i'm not saying it is horrible, i really enjoyed about 10 to 20 percent of it.  But the rest is horribly written crap.  None of the characters can get a whole sentence out before they pause 4 or 5 times to let the audience catch up to the previous three words they just said. Don't even get me started on the overrated David Carradine.  I don't know how anybody thought he was good in this film.  Maybe good for David Carradine, but not good for any other legitimate actor.  Uma did ok, but her line delivery wasn't anything to cheer about.  Michael Madsen was tolerable as was Darryl Hannah, until Quentin decided to have her spat out that crap about the black mamba. I think Quentin thinks that if he draws out a scene 5 minutes longer than it is supposed to be with a monologue about snakes or comic books he is supposed to be considered brilliant.  Surprisingly that is what everyone is saying, but i found it be the opposite. Alright, i am done ranting about this film.  Go see it if you haven't yet and please take note of what i am saying.  Oh and the cinematography and camera angles are good, as is the music. There is the 10 to 20%",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""Okay""","I neither liked Vol. 1 as much as some fans did or hated it as much as others. I thought it was ""okay"" -- basically an action/revenge cartoon with a Tarantinoesque gloss. Isolated parts, particularly the anime sequence and the wonderful House of Blue Leaves episode, were exciting filmmaking by any standard, but taken as a *whole* the movie seemed very lightweight and self-indulgent, more a case of Tarantino stylistically riffing on genres and characters he likes than an actual movie about real people doing real things.That probably sounds harsher than it really is:  I like action/revenge cartoons, and I enjoyed Vol. 1. But I don't understand those who see all sorts of depth in the movie. The movie this most reminded me of was FROM DUSK TIL DAWN.Vol. 2 has, I think, been overrated by a lot of critics who hated Vol. 1 and were looking for more traditional Tarantinoesque pleasures. Again, I think this is ""okay"", not great, not awful. More talky and less action-oriented than 1, it follows Uma on her quest. This time out she goes after Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and of course Bill himself.Madsen's amazing, the best performance in the movie and the only one who felt actually ""real"" to me. Hannah is very good, too. There's a flashback sequence with Gordon Liu as Pei Mei that harkens back to old school Seventies kung fu movies that's fun, especially for fans of those kind of movies. There's some clever casting in small roles, too --I'll just mention Bo Svenson in a nice bit as a country preacher.Some people like Uma in this -- I thought she did the best with a limited role, take that for what it's worth. Carradine has his moments, but he's basically playing David Carradine: the movie works best if you buy him as a Presence. I've never been a big fan of his and remained unmoved by his performance.Tarantino complicates Uma's quest here and it's interesting -- I just never really cared about Uma and Carradine's relationship, so the complication remained pretty intellectual to me (ie, I understood it but just didn't really care about it, either). The dialog is entertaining, and there's plenty of homages here, especially to Spaghetti Westerns.Taken as a pair KILL BILL is good but lightweight, worth seeing but destined to be overrated. I am of the school that JACKIE BROWN is Tarantino's best movie, and the most interesting direction for him to go, but I like him a great deal and will definitely see his next movie, whenever it is.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Very violent but except the fact that there was blood a lot and it was much less realistic than others movies directed by Q.T the movie was one of my best. Still i went to the theater to watch the second volume and... a big heavy deception. I though i was in a nightmare.

More Soul But Not A Stand-Alone Movie,"This should have been a single movie rather than two truncated mini-movies. It seems Q agrees because he places the credits with all of the actors at the end (including mini-clips from part I), and we realize how very, very many things aren't in this second part.It's a shame, because Kill Bill 2 is more thoughtful and fleshes out the plot, with backstories on The Bride and Bill and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) characters, as well as meaningful dialogue explaining the bloodbath of the first movie. But it needed an editor to chop down the words. Just as the first movie needed an editor to chop down the fight sequences. THE MATRIX 2 and 3 taught us that more Agent Smiths and bigger, louder, longer fight sequences don't improve things. But if Kill Bill vol. 1 suffers from Matrix 2/3 excesses, Volume 2 suffers from an excess of verbiage and overdone dialogue along the lines of...I dunno, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE? There is too much self-indulgence at work here, and I fear the box office of these two movies is just going to make ""Q""'s next effort that much more baggy and undisciplined.Q has said splitting the movie in two allowed him to keep all the little bits he otherwise would have had to cut, but the truth is, there's a good half hour from part one that should have excised and a good twenty minutes more from part two. The result would have been a roughly three hour standalone movie that would have been tight and eminently watchable in one sitting. Kind of like the Beatles White Album, which would have been their all-time best had it been a single epic-length platter, but because they decided to indulge themselves and throw everything they came up with on the two discs, it's full of classics and crap side by side.Even Kill Bill's music screams of lengthy epics, with Ennio Morricone sprinkled throughout the trailer sequence evoking THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY's monumental breadth. It would have worked as homage and humor in a single movie, but feels out of place and strangely wrong in this split up movie thanks to Miramax's quest for the dollars. To Q's credit, though, the overall music is wonderfully reminiscent of the seventies and chopsocky movies; I suspect he spent a long time putting it together and it is generally effective.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is okay, but is lessened by being separated from Vol. 1. This is the rare movie where the ""Director's Cut"" DVD should have LESS footage and Q + U and HW and M should return KB V I and II into one film, the way it should have been from the start.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Nobody stamps their mark on a film in the manner he does and with the possible exception of the peerless 'Pulp Fiction' this is his finest work to date. Vol.2 is utterly absorbing. The loose ends and questions from Vol.1 are seamlessly threaded into the next passage of Beatrix's vengeful odyssey and flow perfectly through to a wonderfully crafted and satisfying denouement.

"Very Different, Very Good","(Spoilers)Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second of two very graphic movies by Quentin Tarantino. At the start, we witness why The Bride (Uma Thurman) is enacting revenge on five different people. After this we have a brief run-in with a conversation between Bill and his low-life brother, Bud. Within a half hour, The Bride and Bud meet. Bud succeeds in capturing her and buries her alive.While six feet under, we witness The Bride have a flashback of her training with the Japanese martial arts legend Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu). After some very awkward scenes we come upon Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver driving to Bud's house (rather trailer) in the desert. By this time The Bride is out of her grave and heading for Buds trailer. I'll leave it here so I don't ruin it.Uma Thurman portrays the Bride incredibly. Smart, bold, and powerful. Willing to do anything to reach her goal of Bill. Uma Thurman is one of your top actresses in America today. She is sheer brilliant as the Bride and will keep you asking for more with every scene.Kill Bill, although not as bloody, still holds the R rating due to some violence and heavy language. Even though the Bride is the main character, I did not find her to be the most interesting. Rather it is Michael Madsen's character Bud who seems the only one of the five murders to have emotion and regret for what he did.The movie is dominated by Tarantino effects and brilliant acting by Uma Thurman and David Carradine (Bill).4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Hmmmmm .. very disappointed,"I was looking forward to this film simply because the first one just kept you on the end of your seat until the end and left you wanting...However, this was one was a major disappointment - too predictable, too pretentious and too, well, up Mr Tarantino's own backside.Tarantino's previously displayed talent for dialogue seemed to have deserted him - I think he has read too much of his own press and fawning critics.Don't get me wrong, Pulp Fiction and Dogs were fantabulous along with True Romance and Jackie Brown (in other words all his other films), but KB2 was a waste of 3 hours of my time.

But essentially it picks up where Vol. I left off. ""The Bride"" is continuing on her revenge rampage, getting closer to Bill himself.

Volume 2 will answer all the questions and blow you away,"The Bride (Uma Thurman) was left for dead and woke up ticked off in Vol. one. After a bloody first struggle, the Bride now continues her bloodthirsty quest in the American South-West for her three remaining back stabbers: Budd, Elle, and most importantly, Bill. Through dust, blood, and the grave, she fights and bites her way to show her lack of mercy on the trio. However, before it ends, the Bride finds out some startling information on why she was almost killed and who is still alive after 4 long years.It's obviously very popular for the talk on whether which installment of the series is the best as we constantly hear this yammering on. For instance, Volume 1 is often referred to as the exciting one which entertains you to a startling extent. Volume 2 is commonly noted as the idle, less dramatic, and less interesting movie. Yes, this film is takes it's time more and the body count is surprisingly small but in my opinion, I enjoyed this one more mainly because Tarantino steps away from the fake blood and gets back to the bread and butter of a successful film; the story. In the words of Tarantino himself, ""Volume 1 is the questions, Volume 2 is the answers"". It's the drama, stupid!Anyways, what I really loved about this film in a nutshell is the story and the style in which it was told. Volume one was the Asian kung-fu bloodbath with bizarre scenery, great acting, and schizophrenic soundtrack. Volume two is the old fashioned Western where the story leads the advance and the lone Bride finally reaches her show down with her nemesis. Anything that was fuzzy, or unexplained in the first film is revealed in the Vol. 2 and told through Quentin Tarantino's marvelous storytelling and direction. The brilliant soundtrack also brings an authentic Spanish flavour to the stew, introducing all those high noon showdown themes from 70's spaghetti westerns that we all know and love.One of the best scenes in this film (and also one of my personal faves) is the fantastic fight between the Bride and Elle Driver. Want a rundown? Every glorious punch, kick, whip, smash, crash, poke, flush, splat, cut, and stomp all perfectly roar together to give probably the most satisfying duel I've ever seen on the silver screen. Here's how I'd describe it in a bizarre way; imagine two rabid wolverines who are high on angel dust fight to the death in a tiny enclosed room with wooden furniture. Brutal? Yes. Entertaining? Hell yeah!All in all, Kill Bill vol. 2 is a brilliant film whose soundtrack, story, direction, and action all collectively help to bring the film to a roaring success. It's definitely worth the twenty bucks for the DVD and I guarantee you it will be money well spent.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This film has some of his best directing skills by Tarantino.,"The Bride (Uma Thurman) has killed Two of Her Enemies (Lucy Liu, Vivica A.

The Performances are Strong, especially by Thurman and Carradine. The Film has more characters and dialogue driven than Vol.1.

very nice,"I waited till this came to cable simply because I wasn't going to pay 15 dollars to see one movie which we split in half out of typical Weinstein greed. Plus it afforded me the luxury of seeing both films back to back. Whereas the first half was all glitz and lightning fast action set pieces, which was a fun ride. This half is more typically Tarantino in relation to the dialog that seems to crackle and ooze coolness. Not to say there isn't any action, as there are a few great stand-out set pieces to be had, just not as manic as the first half. This is leisurely and takes it's time and for true fans, it's all the better for it. David Carradine is great as Bill, Uma gets her most-rounded performance in her career, and while the movie, as a whole, isn't as sheerly fun as Pulp Fiction, nor as perfect as the sadly under-rated Jackie Brown, it still makes for a hell of a ride.

The Second Half of a Controversial Film...,"After killing her way through the first movie, The Bride now faces her final three foes: Elle Driver, Budd and Bill. The body count drops dramatically and the plot is stepped up, making this the meat if the first film was the dessert.When I saw this film the first time, I was really put off by it. With so much action in the first movie, I figured the same would happen in the second. But instead I was given a slow, steady series of conversations. And this just made me upset. Films don't work this way! You lay down the plot and then build up to a bloody climax -- you don't massacre people and then nap for two hours.But upon my second viewing, I felt more okay with this when I realized that the idea was to give these final characters more depth and that in some ways made it a stronger film. While some conversations go on for too long (Bill's Superman analogy was interesting, but didn't need another fifteen minutes afterward), some are also very nice.Also, I originally was opposed to Michael Madsen's character (Budd) because to me Madsen is best when he plays ruthless killing machines (""Reservoir Dogs"", for example). But on the second viewing, I saw the beauty of his character. He is actually more complex, wrestling with sibling issues and at the same time being the only one who seems to have a sense of honor: he knows The Bride deserves revenge while everyone else denies her this. And while he is now a slobbish drunk, at the same time he has turned away from a life of violence. His story would be fascinating.""Kill Bill"" as a whole seems like a divider for Tarantino fans. Some people like or hate him altogether (I generally like him). But you will also find those who love ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" (and maybe ""Jackie Brown"" to some degree) but will detest ""Kill Bill"" for whatever reason. Is it the kung fu versus crime themes? I don't know. But that makes these two films Tarantino's most disliked movies, despite also being critically probably some of his best.Obviously, David Carradine is a great actor for this role, and Uma Thurman (although I am not a fan) works well with Tarantino's style. Daryl Hannah does well, and I am especially pleased with the portrayal of Pai Mei. You're probably not watching part two unless you saw part one (but who knows?) and if you like part one, why wouldn't you watch part two? So a recommendation one way or the other is really not important. But I say go for it, even if you doubted the first part. I think the second takes more patience, but maybe you're the type who appreciates substance over action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Supersedes Volume 1!,"This has to be the movie I anticipated the most in my life. The ending of Volume 1 left me hanging not only for four months which was stated when the first installment was released, but for six months since the release of Vol. 2 was delayed two months due to problems on the cutting room floor. I won't lie, after the credits started to role I was a little disappointed. If I had not of been, Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be the best movie I would have seen, ever! Well, it wasn't but it definitely made my Top 100 list along with Vol. 1. The fact of the matter is Vol. 2 is not only better then Vol. 1, it's more involving. Unlike Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2 has less action and violence (which may turn off immature and blood thirsty viewers after the blood soaked Volume 1), but it explains the plot to it's full extent. In Volume 1 you didn't get a stable plot, you just got stylized acting and blood (not that is an insult), but in Volume 2 you get a little more closure.The second installation in Quentin Tarantino's chop-sake meets wild west crime saga, The Bride continues her blood-hungry hunt for the three remaining members on her list. The first is Budd, Bill's brother played expertly by Michael Madsen (Species, Reservoir Dogs). He's a hard-drinking depressed cowboy-hat wearing fella, who works as a bouncer at a low-level tit bar. The second person on The Bride's list is someone she really hates and someone who really hates her -- Elle Driver, the foul-mouthed eye-patch wearing blonde-haired trouble maker who is now Bill's sweetie. Perhaps the best fight sequence of the film is the showdown between the Bride and Elle in a broken down trailer home involving a toilet, samurai swords and tobacco spit. The final person on The Bride's list is of course, Bill. You finally get to see Bill in full form in Volume 2, and he is played with such intensity and passion by David Carradine (who definitely gives the best performance of the entire movie.)The acting in Volume 2 is a major improvement then the acting in Volume 1. Uma Thurman still gives a rock solid performance as the sexy blonde sword fighter on a mission, and the villains this time around are way better. Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox don't come close to the acting talents of Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine. In this one, the villains are also more developed and you get a better grasp of the kinds of people they are. The directing is fabulous as usual, along with the writing, and the soundtrack is more alive in Vol. 2 then it was in Vol. 1.In conclusion, Kill Bill Volume 2 wasn't as extraordinary as I had expected, but it is certainly another masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers of our generation, Quentin Tarantino.

Not as good as the first,"While I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tremendously entertaining film, I was less than enthusiastic about Vol. 2.Problem #1 was the casting and performance of Darryl Hannah as the second-ranking assassin under Bill. I just didn't find her particularly interesting or menacing. True, she was dispatched with aplomb, but it wasn't that enjoyable. Perhaps it was her set-up: in the first film the final ""baddie"" was a leader of the Japanese Mafia, someone who not only had to be tracked but who had a cadre of obstacles protecting her. This built up great tension and excitement and made the payoff fight more interesting. Darryl Hannah's character didn't have that big build-up, there wasn't much of a reason for her to be menacing at all.Problem #2 was the unsatisfying way the final confrontation with Bill was portrayed. To me, it was a let down. Sure, how he finally meets the Bride is a bit surprising, but again, there was very little menace in that confrontation. Tarantino makes a great choice virtually eliminating the violence by that last encounter (by then you tire of it and want something different), but his attempt at bad-guy ""mind games"" falls way flat, becomes uninteresting, and lets the viewer down.Sure, there's some good stuff in this film, the best being The Bride's training under the ancient Kung Fu master. But overall, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is more entertaining.7 out of 10 Barky",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Overrated,This movie is simply overrated.  For specialists in Kung-Fu movies it even touches the absolute ridicule.  I think Europeans will not appreciate this movie which is made in pure cinematographic language without references to literature or history.  The scene with the outbreak of Uma out of the grave is physically impossible because of the weight-pressure of the earth. You simply cannot get out.  Daryl Hanah (Elle)is superb and looks younger than Uma! The fighting scenes are an absolute childification of the great Eastern fighting-movies.

Most of this incomplete movie felt bloated and unsatisfying. Only a big fan (out of blind loyalty) could call this thing an instant classic. This movie was 95% talk and 5% action. I wouldn't have minded it so much if the talking was stimulating, but it wasn't. There was one scene where Bill was talking about super heroes and their alter egos. I about puked. Kill Bill One was good. I saw it twice in the theater. I will never see this movie again. It was a total disappointment!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Inspired by The Good The bad and The Ugly,"This is a movie that you cannot stop watching due to the martial arts, effects, and action. The music is portrayed beautiful in a great manner. This movie reminds just of Good the Bad and the Ugly. The music all the action sequences, the hardcore attitude, and the great storyline that proceeds to it as it all goes together to perfection. Tarentino being a fan of martial arts knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning. Uma Thurman played her part perfect with the emotion and sensitivity. David Carradine played his part perfect as the assassin who wanted to kill her but still cared about her and wanted her to be a warrior and even better then him. I found this movie very enjoyable a typical Tarentino movie, he hit another one rite on the point. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. A great martial arts movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
excellent,"Of the original ""Kill Bill,"" I wrote: ""The movie is all storytelling and no story. The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance, but are simply plot markers. The characters consist of their characteristics."" True, but one of the achievements of ""Vol. 2"" is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill  which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line.Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. I confess I feared that ""Vol. 2"" would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Classic,Definitely a classic. Thurman delivers along with Lucy Liu. QT pioneered these kinds of films starting with Kill Bill and I'm so glad he rose to success. Definitely not as good as the first but still amazing!,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Slower than Vol. 1,"The sequel to Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is not nearly as good as the first. The first was excellent: it was quite poignant, it was exciting, fast paced, intriguing, and it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.The second was not so good in these areas. I didn't find it to be touching at all, as the first was. This one was exciting at times, but it was definitely a slower-moving film than the first one was. Not that being slower-moving than the first is necessarily a bad thing, but this one seemed to have excessive dialogue.Another area where Vol. 2 fell short is the soundtrack: I found many of the pieces to be unhelpful in setting the tone of certain parts of the movie. The music, instead of drawing you into the moment, drew excessive attention to itself.Kill Bill Vol. 1 was extremely gory, but chopped off heads and arms didn't really gross me out—at least not as much as the eyeball being squished between someone's toes, and the vitreous humor oozing out that appeared in Vol. 2. Overall though, Kill Bill Vol. 2 wasn't nearly as violent as Vol. 1 was. The entire tone was much sleazier though, especially the beginning of the movie.Kill Bill Vol. 2 was a competent movie, but it was not the masterpiece that Kill Bill Vol. 1 was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Boring overrated second part,After seeing the first part of Kill Bill which by the way was amazing with fast paced action i was excited about the second volume only to find a whole different movie with really slow paced scenes with conversations all the time. First one was a masterpiece for me and maybe rate it around 9/10 while second one maybe avove average 6/10. Really don't understand all the top ratings for this movie i've seen almost all Quentin Tarantino movies and Kill Bill vol 2 is probably the worst i've seen.

Beautifully Done Sequel,"QT does it again! This movie is much more awesome than anything else he has done, which just means he's getting better and better with time. The first film is the questions, and this one is the answers. We learn her real name and learn about her as a person. You also get acquainted with Elle Driver, played by Daryl Hannah and her evil character blew me away because I remember her as that sweet mermaid from Splash. The entire cast was great, and the cinematography was beautifully done, because it wasn't as cartoonish as the last one and focused less on gory violence and more on dialogue, Tarantino's best talent. My personal favorite part is the Superman speech from Bill. All in all, a great film and I never get sick of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This movie is horrible!,"First of all i gotta say I think that Kill Bill vol. 1 was fabulous. And that being said - this movie is its exact opposite.At this point I've watched it twice, and I usually get a lot out of watching a relatively bad movie a second time, since I don't have any expectations it has to fulfill. Plus I get the possibility of getting an alternative perspective on it. But in this case even that did'nt help. Well, first of all the casting is horrible. If you gotta star Michael Madsen, star him at something he is good at. Hence being macho! In this movie he's a drunken excuse for an ex-pro-assassin, being dragged around the nose by his strip-club owner-boss, for whom he works as doorman or should I say doormat. Not cool, since Michael Madsen is a type-actor and nothing else! Secondly Darryl Hannahs performance as a mean, one-eye-patch assassin with a grudge is totally of the scale. And not in a good way! Most critics probably look right through this fact, because they think its intended on Tarantinos behalf, but if you ask me, you cant disguise poor acting, as a filmic visual intend, in relation to 70's blacksploitation movies, when its really nothing but poor acting. And thirdly David Carradine. He couldn't act in North and South and he sure can't act now. For what intend Tarantino drew him out of the closet, other than as a promotional stunt, I really cant see! There you have it. And thats just the cast. Will be back with more on the movie later. Sleep tight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
What a huge disappointment,"First, I should preface this by stating I am not a Tarantino fan. I think he is a great director who too often tries too hard to create culturally iconic images which are over-shadowed by batches of tired dialogue laden with uninteresting babble which in his own mind makes him some sort of genius.I will also say, to the contrary, I am a huge fan of Reservoir Dogs, which was truly groundbreaking and entertaining. However, so few people had seen it before Pulp Fiction was released, that the latter film was credited with revolutionizing the ""time machine"" style of plot progression. For those who saw these films in chronological order, it is clear Tarantino simply recycled the same formula that made RD such a great film and slapped it on top of a fairly weak and rambling plot with famous actors that depended on ""cool factor"" to keep viewers interested in PF. I encourage anyone to go back and view PF now...it's one of the most outdated and overrated ten year old movies around.On to KB Part II. Kill Bill 1 was awesome. Everything from the plot, to the bloody anime, to the fantastic sword fights were clearly the product of someone who has studied traditional Kung Fu films in depth. Even the yellow jump suit (a la Bruce Lee in Game of Death) was right on the money. I was excited to see what Tarantino had in store for Part 2 and was ultimately let down completely.Where did all the action go? No lengthy choreographed fight scenes of note--the Hannah/Thurman scene in Madsen's trailer was more of a drunk cat-fight than a battle of two warriors--the dialogue in many parts was long, and languished into oblivion for 5-10 minutes at a time without moving the film forward, and the final 30 minutes left me looking at my watch every 5 minutes and praying the movie would end soon. Did we really need 20 minutes of pseudo-intellectual babble about the trials and tribulations of Bill and The Bride's relationship? Granted, I understand the point was to expose her softer, emotional, maternal side even in the face of her enemy, but for crying out loud, take it outside and settle it alright already!Ironically, walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but thinking that Part II was a completely different movie the Part 1. Ironic because they are one in the same film. It seemed to me the few elements I disliked in Part 1 completely took hold of Part 2. Perhaps it was a yin/yang thing he was going for, but for my taste, the yang really stunk it up! Aside from about 4 scenes (buried alive, anything with Michael Madsen, the ""surprise plot twist"", and the funny, but all-too-short training-with-the-master segments, the other 75 minutes of this film were fairly awful. This is probably the most disappointing film I've seen since the turn of this young century.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Let's face it , it was kind of disappointing","Leaving the theatre from this movie I can see the disappointment in everone's faces , the only thing that kept us going through the movie was to watch the ending , and here it comes we're suddenly watching two people having a conversation like the ones we've seen in pulp fiction and reservoir dogs, no one wanted to see that especially in the ending scene of a revenge movie called kill bill.Both movies would have made one hell of a great movie , I still think the first one was a masterpiece, the second one really didn't live up to the expectations.And QT is one of these geniuses who should stay behind the scenes , he has no charisma to go out on interviews , he's just a silly geek who makes great movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A great conclusion to the story,"An amazing ending to the first film.Normally I'm skeptical of sequels but this one delivered on my expectations and then some.

Tarantino displays his formidable writing and character development skills.,"Vol. 2 continues the cycle of revenge, as well as flashing back to earlier events which provide context and motivation for some of the dizzying action of the first episode. The Bride, whose name we learn is Beatrix Kiddo, must deal with Bill's trailer-trash brother Budd (Madsen) and the deadly, one-eyed Elle Driver (Hannah) before her showdown with Bill (Carradine). We also learn that she has studied with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Liu) and has learned techniques that will take on significance as her odyssey continues.All through Arthurian legend and Eastern myth, the magic, invincible sword has been a central symbol invested with unending layers of significance. Filmmakers have taken great care to photograph it just the right angle, with just the right highlights so that its power and meaning can never be questioned. In Vol. 1, The Bride acquires such a sword from the legendary Hattori Hanzo, who comes out of retirement to make a weapon so powerful that ""if in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut."" But another such blade is in possession of Bill's brother Budd, who must use it to prevent her from getting to Bill. When Bill asks Budd where this myth-laden, highly significant symbol of power might be, Budd says, ""I pawned it."" ""But it was priceless."" ""Well, I got $250 bucks for it."" This is the sort of dialogue that can only be called Tarantinian. TIn my review of Vol. 1, I wrote: ""But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills.""And that is exactly what he does in Vol. 2. He has created great characters on the page and has brought them to life with flawless casting and seamless direction. Thurman's Beatrix may be studied in future years as one of the all-time great women characters ever put on screen. Both she and Carradine should start shopping for formal wear when awards season rolls around. Tarantino may even have a shot at Best Director. Also riveting is the performance by Hannah as Beatrix' rival, both for Bill's affection and for martial arts supremacy. Their confrontation is a masterpiece of choreography, stunt work, and eye-catching editing. Note that at the end of the credits there is a hilarious out-take from this scene.One often hears the comment that ""they don't make movies like they used to."" But with young filmmakers such as Tarantino and older ones the likes Scorsese, Eastwood and Polanski all working at top form, we may just be in the middle of a filmic golden age and just don't know it yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A sequel much less good than the first one,"I expected better for this sequel of "" Kill bill "" cause the prequel was almost a masterpiece and expecting better with more action cause this is the vengeance but unfortunately QT rather to give priority at his story but the movie it's good !!!The script it's not bad in overall, even it will be better for me to making priority at the actin rather than the lines but we know that QT like the long lines scene shots, you know better the story and Bill and the main protagonist of the story and that it was pretty interesting. But unfortunately the end of the film was botched for me ...The directing by QT still great nothing to say about that with a nice soundtrack and a casting who they played their roles very well !!!The movie it's not bad at all ... but a little bit disappointed cause I expected anymore that the first one cause it was the revenge but the story-feeling was good anyway!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Too Much Talking?,"I really enjoyed Kill Bill Vol.1 because of its over the top music, violence, and directing. Kill Bill Vol. 2 was good, but my only complaint about the film was the extended dialog. It seemed as if Tarantino was trying to fill space and extend the length of the movie. The main scenes were with Budd at the strip club and the dialog between Bill and Uma Thurman before the final fight. The sometimes pointless dialog made parts of the movie boring and quite un-enjoyable. Maybe I'm missing some greater meaning or underlying message, but overall it just made me think less of the movie. I would enjoy to hear your thoughts and comments on the subject.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Individually, these are two different movies with unique styles. Together, they form a masterpiece","This movie is quite different from Vol. 1. It isn't as bloody and gruesome (apart from one scene that is so brilliant it would be a sin to spoil it), or as violent, but it has more plot and a lot more dialogue.The dialogue is truly the best part in this movie. You get amazing acting from Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu and David Carradine. And even Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, but even then he plays it amazingly. They deliver incredible dialogue written by Tarantino, as only Tarantino knows how to write. It makes you smile, and that's important.What happens in this movie is quite clear - the Bride (whose name is finally revealed in Vol. 2 in a rather awkward little scene) continues her vendetta against Bill and the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Budd (Sidewinder) and Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake). She faces peril and excitement. And she fights in incredible fight scenes. We also meet Pai Mei, Bill's master, who also taught the Bride martial arts, and he leaves an impact.Both movies are amazing, but only together they form a true cinematic masterpiece.

It was boring and drawn out with bad empty dialogue of no consequence.Once the bride gets to meet bill - and he starts telling her a story about her daughter - reality is completely suspended - the plot is thrown out the window and the movie (for me) gave it's last gasp.This movie is rubbish and I recommend that no-one sees it.

A Movie Full Of Awesomeness,"''The Bride continues her quest of vengeance against her former boss and lover Bill, the reclusive bouncer Budd and the treacherous, one-eyed Elle Driver.''
Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen...Kill Bill Vol. 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel/continuation. It's almost a completely different film to the first. Where Vol. 1 is purely action-driven with a lot of uncensored blood & gore, this one is exactly the opposite. The humor of the first volume is gone, the adventure is partly decreased and the tone becomes more serious and dramatic. It however makes up for it as we learn what The Bride's real name is, what happened to her baby, how the massacre happened and more character development for Budd, Elle and Bill. The first volume had some excellent scenes and fantastic direction, but lacked depth in its story. Vol. 2 provides this backing, and does it in an immersive way. With Tarantino having scenes show us past events throughout the film, it allows us to know more backstory about the characters, but in a non-boring way. Every moment feels like it was expertly directed and well put together. There is perhaps only one or two moments of actual violence in this film, the rest is purely story and character driven.
Uma Thurman once again, impresses as The Bride, and this time her character is allowed to become a real human being driven by emotions beyond those connected to a desire for revenge. Bill is a superb character creation of Tarantino's, and he is easily one of the best, most terrifying, interesting and intelligent movie villains of all time. While the story is enthralling throughout, where the film reaches its true potential is in the final act. You'd be surprised if you expect an extravagant and lengthy final battle between The Bride and Bill, as that's what we've been lead to believe by watching the first volume. What Tarantino gives us instead is a taught, tense and sublimely written final conversation between the two characters.
Though some of the dialogues are lengthy, everything just fell into place as the movie progressed to its climax. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is all about the emotional dilemma and conflicts that result to unimaginable consequences. It is less kinetic but more satisfying. Actually, Vol. 1 is 90% style and 10% substance while Vol. 2 is 90% substance and 10% style. Totally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Overall, Vol. 2 contains less action, less fight scenes, but more of backstory, depth, dialogue and better character development.In Conclusion:
Overall, Tarantino delivers a wonderful cult-style film with a fluent mixture of samurai and western style. Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. As a whole, Kill Bill is utterly unified, possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Wow!,"Having seen all the previous Tarantino movies, I of course was excited to see the Kill Bills. After watching Vol. 1 the first time, I was a little disappointed. (I have since watched it 2 more times and appreciate it it a lot more). Thats wasn't the case with Vol 2. It is fantastic from beginning to end. There are even a few surprises along the way and you get to see much more of Bill than in Vol. 1. He is no longer the mysterious man in the shadows, Tarantino really develops his character in part 2. Even non Tarantino fans should make an effort to see this movie. Although I don't think you would get the depth of the story from just watching Vol 2, you certainly could without be lost. It is almost a standalone movie. Another great film by a fantastic writer/director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Fresh in its absurdity but nowhere near a masterpiece status,"This volume is a lot different from the first one but it wouldn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. While the first one was all about style and little substance, this one tries to be a little more deeper in meaning. Unfortunately, the serious drama side isn't as convincing and successful as the light and stylish fighting side is in these movies.The film is divided in five different chapters. Whereas the first volume was more or less linear in its storytelling, this time around the chapters are much more disjointed from each other. The flashbacks don't fit into the flow of the movie smoothly. The plot in itself is a very simple revenge story and I guess what most consider the main treats in the movie are the dialogue and the explosive albeit short action sequences. Well, the dialogue isn't the most typical one you hear in movies but it also often feels forced. The plot is full of absurd moments and sometimes those moments feel a little too self-pretentious.The use of music, the absurd plot and some over the top characters...it's all intriguing to watch but it still is mainly just eye-candy. The substance in the story just isn't there. Even though this volume spends much more time evolving Uma Thurman's character it actually is a disservice to the film because I don't feel related to the character any more than in the beginning of the movie, as a matter of fact the exact opposite. The pain was much more touching in the first volume. In this volume many scenes are too long and and serve little purpose to actually explain the motives of main characters. The dialogue is supposed to be witty, I guess, but mostly it is either too simple and repetitive or tries to be funny a little too obviously.I'm not saying the movie is completely bad, far from it. The style of the movie is still fascinating and the basic plot is OK in all its simplicity. Some of the acting is excellent (Carradine as Bill and Madsen as Budd especially) although Thurman's character loses a lot of its appeal. It might be due to some odd writing (the sequence where she's meeting Pai Mei is not very convincing) or due to Thurman's little one-sided facial expressions. Anyhow, this movie is something you should see just for the sake of it.This movie comes down to personal preferences like all movies of course. If the often absurd plot and dialogue amuses you a lot and the small lack of substance or coherent storytelling doesn't bother you you might just love the movie for its cool style. The first volume was cool in its style and this has some of the same characteristics. However, the slow pace and the emphasis on the drama side isn't working as well as it should if you call this one of the best movies of all time. This is a nice experiment and in many ways you can see how Tarantino has had some fun adding funny little sequences and things here and there but in the end the movie as a whole isn't coherent or deep, it's just a fun montage of more or less cool and sometimes naive things and tricks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Should have been one movie.,"It's three in the morning (opening day) and I just saw the movie.  I must say I'm a little bit disappointed.  Now before I go any further, the acting, character, and dialogue are on par, and in some cases better than Volume 1. This movie is very different from the last one though as it is hardly an action film.  There are 3 (I think) 1-on-1 fights, none of which last more than five minutes.  Plus, there is virtually no swordplay at all.  Now, for an over two hour long action film, that's not exactly what you'd expect. Now this is fine, because the drama in this film is incredible.  Great dialogue, deep characters, and pretty good acting is what makes it worth watching.  But here also inlies the movies main problem, vol 1 & 2 shouldn't be seperate films.  If you ask me, they should be combined into a 3 1/2 hour long epic.  While vol. 1 did pretty well on it's own as a stand alone movie, 2 doesn't.  The pacing is absolutely horrid and makes it kind of chop along from scene to scene.  I was actually frustrated by the end.  I wont watch these again unless they are released re-edited together, the way they should have been (before money scamming became an issue).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An exercise in self-indulgence...,"Had Kill Bill been directed by a more talented action director such as Paul Verhoeven or Tobe Hooper, the project would have been restricted to one film that would have had a maximum running time of three hours. Not that either of these directors would have needed this much. There is nothing in the combined volumes of Kill Bill that a director who understands the need for efficiency couldn't tell in 130 or 150 minutes. Any other director would be constantly asked if this or that scene moves the plot forward.Interestingly, volume two is approximately half an hour longer than its predecessor, but half as much happens during this time. Half of what we see in this volume is irrelevant drivel that could have been left on the cutting room floor. Budd's job and Beatrix's training are the least of the problems. In the end, the final moment with Bill seems like a two-hour buildup to a five-second payoff.Between Tarantino's constant homages to himself, we get more of the Tao Of Tarantino in which one of the characters bore us to sleep with Tarantino's philosophical gems, this time about Superman's perception of humanity. One suggestion I have for Tarantino that could make these films more viewable for those of us who have grown beyond trends is to keep these gems separate, and publish them in a book instead. Then he ought to get an accurate picture of how wise or brilliant people really think he is. Apparently, Quentin doesn't mind paying homage to himself by referencing products that he has ""disowned"", either. Can we say ""hypocrisy"", children?Given that the typical Tarantino formula is basically pornography that replaces sex with violence, Kill Bill part two basically resembles a porn film with no money shot. Tarantino's constant claims to be offering a commentary on violence would hold weight if he showed it in a realistic, believable manner (a la RoboCop or Total Recall) rather than the eliptic, implied manner that typifies Hollywood. For all the statements about how violent films don't make violent children and so forth, I'd love to see Tarantino put his money where his mouth is for once and show the actual consequences of violence.Ah, to be a director who has an audience that will kiss the ground he walks on no matter how boring or indulgent his films are. George Lucas used to have that, so I guess the lesson to take from that fact is to learn to stop abusing this. Then again, given the low common denominator that the films aim for, I suspect that Mr. Tarantino does not hold his audiences in high regard.I gave Kill Bill: Vol. 2 a one out of ten. Devo apparently named themselves in reference to a belief that humanity was ""devolving"". I think that this film could receive a standing ovation proves them right.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Great second half to an awesome story.,"Tarantino continues this movie with what is now considered Tarantinoesque directing. He has almost cliched' himself and I love it.

Carradine, looking every bit of 67 at times, surely didn't act like it. His acting and storytelling intriguing along with his smooth voice that just lures you in and makes you want to listen.

A Return to Story Driven Cinema,"VOLUME 1 of KILL BILL was really all about the action - a pure revenge film dipping into every '70's action genre one could imagine, and director/writer Tarantino can imagine quite a lot of them. There wasn't much character development, nor a great deal of plot. But that left more room for what it was really about - Tarantino proving his walk was as good as his talk. He had talked about action for years, and with VOLUME 1 he delivered; enough for any five action films, I think.So it was the return to an earlier Tarantino type of character developed, story driven film that really threw me in VOLUME 2. Now that's not to say there isn't any action. KILL BILL VOLUME 2 has got that covered. But in this one we study all the background, the motives, and the characters themselves. Mostly these elements are given in an old fashioned storytelling style, told from one character to another, in that kind of conversational realism Tarantino has made popular all over again, but which he and few others have really mastered. We are given many little storytelling scenes, about this or that - I'm not going to give anything away here. But it all adds up, at least to me, the way all those little storytelling scenes worked together for the whole in PULP FICTION.It's this storytelling element that really gives meaning and depth to all the craziness that was unleashed in VOLUME 1. It's clear how much the two films are actually just one story. Without the second, the first is just action fun. Characters doing crazy things to each other without much reason behind it. But with VOLUME 2, we have the scope and the motives and intentions of those actions. We finally get inside these characters, and that, for me, is the best part of the storytelling process. At the end of VOLUME 1, O-Ren Ishii might have been the only character I understood at all. Even The Bride was a bit of a mystery, and we didn't even know her real name. Now, I feel like I know them all. They are distinct, in the way perhaps the Magnificent Seven are, in my mind.Now I don't want to give the impression this is a slow film. It's quite a bit longer than the first, but the time just flew by and I was surprised when it was over. Wonderful editing and pacing are the keys here, not to mention riveting dialogue, and action that comes out of nowhere like a truck driving into your living room on a quiet evening. Tarantino still has the element of surprise in hand. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the talents he's assembled in cast and crew. The film is just as clever to watch as the dialogue is to hear. Buddy Robert Rodriguez even makes an assist on the music soundtrack.Tarantino has once again bravely side stepped the industry trends, turned the formula on it's head, and delivered the more thoughtful, deeper elements in the second half of the story. The audience is then rewarded with a superior, unpredictable second installment that may leave those ""check-your-brain-at-the-door"" fans a bit disappointed, but gives the rest of us, as The Bride puts it, ""bloody satisfaction"". Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Is it your type of movie?,"I'm starting to think that Quentin Tarantino movies are just not my thing. I appreciate the quality and technique, but it's not my style.

A cult classic!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
More Dialogue,"The bloodshed continues in this conclusion to a great two-part film experience. It continues, but there is less of it as none of these villains rely on heavy arsenals of ""bodyguards"" as in the case of Cottonmouth in vol. 1.The main thing this film accomplishes is that it fleshes out the main characters - The Bride and Bill - so much more than in the first installment. We actually get to see Bill's face throughout the film, witness the two having real conversations to develop their relationship, and we even witness some complex emotions from the Bride. Where the first Kill Bill was fun, vol. 2 is more about the characters.This is not to say that vol. 2 is not a fun film. It is extremely fun - my friend audibly expressed satisfaction at certain moments throughout the film as it was his first time watching volumes 1 and 2 over the past two days. It is also notably very tense towards the conclusion of the film, and in this film Tarantino once again proves to be the master of the monologue with a great segment in which the mythology of a super hero is discussed. It certainly doesn't match up to the intro to Inglourious Basterds or Calvin Candie's monologue in Django Unchained, but its placement in the film is nearly perfect.One disappointing factor of this movie is that, in my opinion, it seems to have a cop out instead of a well fleshed conclusion. I can't say much past this without a major spoiler, so I'll say you simply have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to. In a movie that incorporates the martial arts the conclusion may satisfy some, but I think it is a tad ridiculous compared to the rest of the two films put together.While this film may impress me just a little less than the first, I am still eager to see The Whole Bloody Affair at a theater in my lifetime if I get the opportunity.3.0/4.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Good, but not a masterpiece","I sort of liked the first Kill Bill better although this one is more about the plot and the dialogue which is Tarantino's trademark. It doesn't have much of the stylized violence from the first one, but this is still a very good follow up and very entertaining. Although there are points in the film it started to drag a bit, the dialogue is witty and interesting so those slow parts are actually forgivable. The interaction between the characters is also much better than the first. Although I am with the majority of people that enjoyed the first vol better than the second, this is still a good movie. But not really a masterpiece like some people claim it to be. Carradine that played Bill is the main highlight of this film.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I enjoyed Volume 1 and had high expectations for Vol 2.After watching Volume 2 I am unbelievably disappointed. Nothing new or interesting was revealed, the story was a total letdown.If you think the second movie will bring something new to tale you are wrong, I wouldn't have believed it but you can already guess exactly what happens in Vol 2 by watching Vol 1. So apart from dragging it out a little more there is hardly any purpose for Vol 2, a simple sentence of what happened would easily conclude the story,it didn't need another 2hrs or more of rambling which had no real drama or action worthy of keeping our attention.

Satisfaction Attained...,"KILL BILL: VOL. 2 fills in the blanks from VOL. 1. We learn just what happened to make Beatrix Kiddo aka: The Bride, aka: Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) the vengeful killing machine she has become. We are shown her early, deep relationship with Bill (David Carradine), making this man's betrayal the driving force of her life.Beatrix's incredible fighting skills are also explained, as we watch her grueling, excruciating training under the severe tutelage of Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). We witness Beatrix's resurrection -literally- from the grave. We see her final encounter with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), in a battle in close quarters that makes full use of a very tight space. This fight is viscerally satisfying. We can feel Beatrix's agony and eventual triumph over this one-eyed, blonde demon.This brings us closer to Beatrix's meeting with Bill himself, to ""catch up on old times"", and to reacquire the treasure beyond price that has been kept from her. No, this finale isn't just about Bill's well-deserved comeuppance. He is only the last barrier to what Beatrix truly seeks.This movie has substance, emotional depth, and tremendous storytelling to undergird its more physical moments.

A powerful and mature second installment,"I was unduly critical when I first watched ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" on its UK theatrical release. Watching the second installment again last night, I'm unsure why I reacted so negatively to the film - it's an absolute corker.The second volume is a slower, more atmospheric affair than its predecessor. However, it's a perfectly faithful finale to this epic tale and has more than its fair share of set-pieces and memorable dialogue.Michael Madsen stands out as the down-on-his-luck Budd, a character who's had the stuffing knocked out of him over the years and who is a shadow of his former self. Daryl Hannah is also splendid as the psychotic Elle Driver.9 out of 10. Definitely worthy of a second viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This is what I was expecting!,"After the movie ended I was still sitting in my chair with a big smile.I was actually a bit disappointed by the first part (Vol 1), because of the overload of action and the lack of a solid story. In that way I thought of part 1 as kind of boring (to much action can really bore me). Part one also lacked the cool characters and conversations I expect in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Part 2 (Vol. 2) totally makes up for that! ..It is the right blend of action and story. Just like part one it can go quite ""over the top"" sometimes (a bit like desperado), but being the style of this movie I consider it cool. Uma really shines too.

"Ambitious, eclectic, but slightly less essential than the original.","Directly following up the first film, it meanders quite a bit before closing with an overall satisfying conclusion. The Bride escapes near- death several times, trains under the great Pai Mei and gets revenge on the people in her organization who tried to kill her.Uma Thurman, in this film, gives arguably the best performance in Tarantino history. Atop from being every bit as ruthless, she plays the role of a mother looking for her child so convincingly well, that at the end, it inspires awe. But having already seen Kill Bill 1, it doesn't feel as novel. At the end of the day, both films are two halves of a whole: a pure escapist homage to old classic ninja flicks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Its cool in a whole different way to Part 1 - but why split?,"Lets be honest, Kill Bill should not have been split into two separate movies. It's plainly obvious from the start that the piece was meant to be whole and therefore we the movie going public were forced into a 6 month intermission between films. Call me cynical but the fact that this movie came out 5 days after the DVD release of part 1 just smacks of a blatant attempt to rake in more cash from the consumer. That said I really enjoyed the movie, in a different way to part 1. The dialogue is more prolonged here, there are no massive fight sequences and no manga cartoons that cry out 'Hey, look at me, I'm QT and I've done something no other director has - worship my coolness!'. Taking away my cynical streak the movie was very enjoyable. I enjoyed the fleshing out of the characters and the anticipation of how each one would meet their end. The fact that I revisited Part 1 just before helped me to get straight into the plot(another reason I am annoyed at the split) and there are plenty of clever, funny and striking scenes to make even the most cynical movie-goer appreciate Tarantino at his best. Every one of the main cast are on top form, and Carradine's Bill dominates every scene in which he appears, including his ending, which unfortunately did come across as a little far fetched. But that is one of the main appeals in these movies. They are set in an unreal world where people can kill at will and not get arrested. And where humans can act like superheroes and still have very human emotions. Tarantino drags you into his world, grabs your interest, and makes you believe what he is doing is cool - and fun. I appreciated this movie as a very entertaining work, and to that end I can just about forgive the self indulgent splitting of the two movies.HIghlights for me were Daryl Hannah reading to Budd about snake venom, and Uma's training with her master, Pai Mei. The guy was just great - I love the way he screamed at her and how he was prone to stroking his beard! All in all this movie is great, and I would just prefer it to Part 1, merely because I like the characterisation. But to be honest both parts should be viewed as one movie, as I am sure they were originally intended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Yee haw instead of hi-ya,"So...this film is basically why I can't consider Vol. 1 to be my favourite Tarantino film. Because I don't think the second part is anywhere near as good, and why the hell would you ever watch Vol. 1 without also watching Vol. 2 soon after?Because unlike almost every other movie with a sequel I could name, these two were intended to be one film. So I feel as though I can't really call this one middling compared to the first without that bringing down the first ever so slightly.But why do I think it's inferior to that first half? Well, while I still can't find fault in any of the performances, and the directing, dialogue and characters are still just as amazing, two gigantic issues are present for me in this film.One: despite originally being intended as just the second half of a 4 hour film, something about the way this film is written really makes it feel like a sequel to me. It might be the way it suddenly, and in my opinion, jarringly, becomes a western over being a martial arts film, or it could be the way it just seems to forget it's an action film (when you think about it, the only really substantial fight scene in the film is with Elle), but I'm inclined to believe it's both. At the very least, I'd say this film is crying out for an epic fight of some sort before The Bride can actually face Bill at the end.Not that there's anything wrong with her scenes with Bill, in fact they're probably the best part of the film, but something about it feels anti-climatic to me. Just like how, with almost no big deal made out of it, they just reveal Bill's face in the opening scene when he had been a mystery man in the shadows for the entirety of Vol. 1. What was that about?And two: quite a lot of this, especially in the first half, feels almost completely superfluous to me. The opening scene being the wedding where we already know what'll happen, the scene of Budd being yelled at by his boss that adds nothing to his character or the plot, nearly all of the Pai Mei sequence, and The Bride meeting with that pimp. All of this feels kind of pointless to me, and it drags the film down to a crawl. Especially when there's barely a second of Vol. 1 you could remove and not lose something amazing.And it's not like all this would have been too hard to fix either, in fact I thought of easy fixes to all this in about five minutes. Make the opening scene of this film the opening scene of Vol. 1 instead, which would have immediately added a lot of context to the start of that film instead of making the beginning of this film a bore, get rid of the Budd at work scenes and The Bride meeting the pimp, because the former is entirely pointless and the latter is unnecessary - I wouldn't have had any problem with The Bride just rocking up to Bill's house without explanation of how she found him.And finally, rewrite Pai Mei's character a little bit so that he doesn't hate white people, then have him be Bill's bodyguard because he always considered Bill his best student or something. The Bride fights him before getting to Bill, and just like that the ending would feel so much more climatic to me. That even gave me a cool idea for the final, final confrontation, with The Bride and Bill having both learned the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique and both of them trying to find an opening to use it on each other.And while we're here, I guess we can include three: the soundtrack isn't anywhere near as memorable. If Tarantino had done these things I've suggested, this could easily be shot up to a 9/10 for me.I want to stress that I do still like this film though - it doesn't completely ruin the whole Kill Bill story for me or anything, taking these two films together as one, I'd still give it an 8/10, and I'll always watch this soon after if I feel like watching Vol. 1.But it does kind of suck nonetheless, because if this had been up to Vol. 1's standard for me, Kill Bill would be my favourite Tarantino film without question. As it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my current ranking.And maybe I'll make that ranking someday, but I need to get back to current year releases for now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Thurman-ated Revenge,"Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a masterful conclusion to Quentin Tarantino's epic revenge saga, shifting from the high-octane spectacle of its predecessor to a more introspective and emotionally charged narrative. This second instalment deepens the story, exploring the motivations, relationships, and humanity of its characters while maintaining Tarantino's signature style of sharp dialogue, genre fusion, and visual flair. It is a remarkable achievement that solidifies its place as a standout in Tarantino's filmography.Uma Thurman delivers a tour-de-force performance as Beatrix Kiddo, blending intensity, vulnerability, and emotional depth. In Vol. 2, Thurman takes the Bride beyond her role as a relentless warrior, revealing the pain, love, and resolve driving her quest for vengeance. Her chemistry with David Carradine's Bill is electrifying, culminating in a climactic confrontation that is as gripping for its dialogue and tension as it is for its action. Carradine's nuanced portrayal of Bill adds complexity to his character, making him both menacing and strangely sympathetic.Tarantino's writing is at its finest, with razor-sharp dialogue and a deliberate pacing that allows the story to breathe. The non-linear structure, a hallmark of Tarantino's storytelling, is seamlessly executed, weaving past and present to enhance the emotional weight of Beatrix's journey. While Vol. 1 revelled in explosive action and stylised combat, Vol. 2 focuses on character development and rich, cinematic storytelling, drawing from Westerns, martial arts films, and classic cinema for its aesthetic and thematic depth.The film's cinematography is stunning, with Tarantino's meticulous attention to framing, lighting, and composition creating scenes that are visually striking and emotionally resonant. The use of shadow, colour, and close-ups enhances the film's dramatic intensity, making every moment feel purposeful and impactful. The carefully curated soundtrack complements the narrative beautifully, adding depth and atmosphere to key scenes with Tarantino's trademark ability to pair music with emotion.Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is more than a revenge story-it's a tale of love, loss, redemption, and closure that transcends the action genre. Its balance of spectacle and substance, coupled with outstanding performances and richly layered storytelling, makes it a cinematic triumph. For its ability to deliver a deeply satisfying conclusion to the Bride's saga. It stands as a testament to Tarantino's mastery of blending homage and originality, leaving a lasting impression long after the final scene fades to black.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Good, but few will be happy with this Sequel","I think that many fans of Kill Bill vol.1 will be disappointed, as vol.2; though its a good film does not display the originality of story telling techniques, which the first film did so creatively. My prediction is that fans of QT films will enjoy vol.2 the most, but for the average cinema viewer they will feel as though there are not enough action sequences. Me as a huge fan of QT and Kill Bill vol.1 was disappointed in the lack of 'that something special' which defines his other films, however throughout the film I was steadily entertained. My favourite part of the film was the wedding scene at the start and fight with Elle (Daryl Hannah). My worst parts Bill's death  and Budd and Bill being brothers seemed pointless.

Master and student should not reverse roles,"Kill Bill I was a delightful surprise, living up to its hype as Tarantino's comic-tinged homage to Chinese and Japanese action-genre films. I could easily imagine all the old directors from Toei Studios having a blast watching Tarantino's final sword-fight scene, a loving imitation of all their samurai reincarnation or Shogun's Ninja films. Then Tarantino had to go and release this pap and spoil everything.There are two principle problems with this film. First, Tarantino decided he didn't want to do genre any more. KBII is a ""serious"" film, about such weighty topics as guilt and redemption and love and death and all those other philosophical topics Woody Allen used to poke fun at before he decided to become a ""serious"" filmmaker, too.Well, maybe Tarantino could have pulled that off - he didn't do so bad in Pulp Fiction - but he makes what for me is one of those mistakes a film fan can not forgive another film fan for making: he trivializes his predecessors.Although this film has a large chunk at the beginning paying tribute to the old Shaw Bros. studio (which the first film promised but never got around to), the principle references in this reference-laden film are to the films of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. And unfortunately, in deciding to make a ""serious"" film, in order to deal with these references, Tarantino decides that Peckinpah and Leone made typical genre films (i.e., not ""serious"" films), and that therefore it was up to a better director (himself) to make a ""serious"" film from their raw materials.Well, here's the news, Quentin. The Wild Bunch is the American version of Homer's Iliad, and all you've managed to come up with is a Hallmark greeting card that doesn't rhyme. Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is the Cistine Chapel of a modern Michaelangelo, and all you've given us here is a color-by-numbers Norman Rockwell copy.What in the name of heaven could Tarantino have been thinking of by trying to ""out-serious"" directors we know perfectly well he admires?What we get here are cartoon versions of moments from Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Once Upon a Time in the West. And that stolen Ennio Morricone music! sure it worked in KBI, because that was homage to Asian genre films and Asian genre films did that sort of thing all the time; but if you're going to get serious, it's time to get original; and, for heaven's sake, Morricone is still alive, I'm sure he'd have been glad to write a new score.Finally, I should mention an obvious influence on this film that Tarantino would probably not want mentioned - the films of the Coen Brothers. Although they started earlier than Tarantino, they are still technically of the same generation as he. I'm not talking plagiarism - the Coens have done their share of ""homaging"" with and without credit to the originals. But Tarantino can't afford to try to ""out-serious' filmmakers still making films. Especially since the Coens know how to do an homage with respect.What Tarantino ends up with here is a bunch of scenes that keep banging into each other like box-cars on a (slowly) derailing train.

"Pure ""style"", ties up unusual story started in KB: V 1.","I saw the first half, Kill Bill: Volume 1, about a month ago, so it is still relatively fresh in my mind.

While the movie, as a second installment, is mildly entertaining, it is ALL style over substance, and is a definite ""10"" for Tarantino's biggest fans, who enjoy his ""style."" However, I found much of it very slow-moving and bordering on ""boring"" to the point that I began to not care very much how it ended.

Over and over she practices, knuckles bloody. It becomes her technique later for escape when, buried alive, she has to punch through the wooden casket. Good thing they didn't use a cheap steel casket! And, in an earlier conversation with Bill, who we find out is her husband, she is told of a finger punch exploding heart technique the old master used to defeat enemies, and in the final scenes while fighting Bill, she uses it on him, to his surprise, because the old Chinese had never taught it to anyone else.

Also, the Leone-esque narrative construct with long, drawn out takes.  All the close-ups of feet (similar to De Palma's infatuation with hands).

Three different times during the movie I asked my husband if we could please leave. This movie DOES NOT hold a candle to Vol. 1 - which was awesome! I tell anyone who hasn't seen it yet to please not waste their time and go and see a good comedy or something. I do not consider myself to be a judgemental person and I enjoy a really good movie and my taste is pretty broad. I tend to love a good action movie, but this movie had NO action. There was one kick-ass fighting scene between Uma and Daryl - and that was it! The whole rest of the movie was talk, talk, talk - it was awful!

Vintage Tarantino - What is your favourite breakfast cereal?,"Mr. Tarantino stakes his claim to the title of master filmmaker with Kill Bill Volumes I and II. Volume 2 completes the masterpiece by taking the art of storytelling to a whole new level. My favourite element of these films is the subtle use of breakfast cereals throughout the film.

More like it,"Volume 2 was everything Volume 1 should have been but wasn't.In particular, here we see character development, and we find out (at last!) why we should care about The Bride.Tarantino told this story bass-ackwards.

"Not as good as volume 1, but decent","This compared to volume 1 has far less action and thrill. It was more about explaining and learning more about the whole situation.

Slow and steady wins the race,"I'm guessing that most people won't have decided to watch 'Kill Bill Volume 2' without watching the first instalment. So, if you've already seen the first half, you may be expecting something similar from the final act. However, whereas the first half was a blood-soaked massacre of bodies and mayhem, this one is anything but.I won't say exactly how many people 'The Bride' kills in this one (and it's nowhere near the seemingly infinite number of ninjas she chopped up in Part 1), but there's a big clue in the title! Yes, 'Volume 2' is a very slow film. In many ways it's more like a Tarantino film that its predecessor. It's very 'talkie' – there are tonnes of long, drawn-out scenes where characters natter to each other, seemingly going nowhere. It just is. It's there to build character. However, if you're not partial to that sort of scene, then you probably won't enjoy this part.As with the first half, there are a handful of scenes that you probably feel could have been left on the cutting room floor, but, all in all, it's a pretty solid film. Yes, it's not fast-paced; it's almost deliberately slow – like the 'ying' to Part 1's 'yang.' Fans of Tarantino will probably love it anyway, but anyone who likes broodingly slow film with clever dialogue should enjoy it, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Recommend purely to finish the saga,"'KILL BILL: VOLUME 2' - 2004Directed by Quentin TarantinoStarring Uma Thurman and David CarradinePlot Overview: ​*CONTINUED AFTER EVENTS OF KILL BILL: VOL 1* After defeating 2/5 of her targets, The Bride(Uma Thurman) continues to wage her one woman war against those who wronged her. And she still takes no prisoners!it's certainly different but I disagree that that makes it better. My issue with this film is the difference in tone and style. I adored Volume One for its masterful visuals, great action and fun story. This film is on the opposite end of the spectrum in genre. It's a more grounded, story driven conclusion to Tarantino's original saga. And I wouldn't be bothered if the two films were so different. If Tarantino did an entirely separate, story driven and grounded story; then I'd be down with it. I would. But the fact that the first film was an excellent action film and this isn't annoys me greatly and the disconcert between the two is stupid. Pick a style and stick with it. I personally don't think that this is the better half of the saga, not even close. Don't tell me that I am just a blood thirsty, action junkie who cannot enjoy dramatic stories. I am not. I love drama as a genre but I hate how Tarantino has tried to mesh the two into this saga. If you like it, then that is fine but it really did not work for me.The carry over story is still really good. The through lines remain and I was still thoroughly engaged in the story-line. It includes some really incredible and gut wrenching scenes which were the highlight of the film. I really admired that and one scene in this movie makes me actively dislike the ending scene of the last movie(not action scene but emotional scene). The film finishes the story well enough but I do not think it recaptured the magic of the original.Uma Thurman was excellent in this movie and maintains the highlight of this saga. We also learn a lot more about her character in this film which I thought was a genius idea. There is one specific piece of information I wish was left ambiguous about her that they revealed. It doesn't affect quality in any way but I think it would add a lot to the mystique of her character if we weren't told this piece of information.David Carradine was great as Bill. Bill was strange. I THINK I liked him as an antagonist but I cannot be too sure. He hit all the right cues and was threatening enough but I can't be certain in whether he's an excellent villain, or an average one. He's in that little grey area.Daryl Hannah was appropriately loathsome as Elle Driver. She did a good job and the actual character was a pretty decent one. She was a good minor antagonist.Technically wise, it is still a very nice looking movie and I do still appreciate Tarantino's masterful style. That said, I do think that the novelty of seeing his style in Volume One does wear of in this film. Not that that retracts quality, it just makes it harder to praise when it doesn't feel as fresh and invigorating. The use of black and white was also very nice but it did occasionally come of as abrupt and strange.The score for these films is incredible. The soundtrack is excellent and I cannot commend the composers and Tarantino himself for assembling such an awesome array of music and sound effects.As far as action goes, I was underwhelmed in this movie. I had doubts that they could outdo the Crazy 88s but I still had hope. They. Did. Not. There is ONE action scene in this film and it was fine. It wasn't too memorable but it was certainly entertaining. None of the action is mediocre it just isn't great when compared to the original, which I am inclined to do because A] It's a direct continuation and B] I can.​ I really wanted to like this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. The first one was such a fun, inventive, stylised movie that I could barely poke flaws in. This tries desperately to ride of Volume One's steam and ultimately fails. I only, and I mean only recommend you see this film to see how the story ties up. Aside from that, it was a very bland and forgettable experience. I'll rate this movie 6 'Beard Strokes' out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I was soooooooooo disappointed!! If you have not seen the movie you may not want to read on!,"I loved Kill Bill VOL I.  In fact, I had watched it three times in the three days prior to rushing out to see this one.  Unfortunately, what I walked out with was utter disappointment!  Not only does this movie not enjoy the pace of the first, but it is downright boring!!  As I sat in the theater at the end of the film, I found myself trying way to hard to like it.   About 20 seconds or so later, I had to admit that I hated it.  It wasn't until I got home, however that I hit on the core reason I didn't like it.  I could have gotten past the fact that the storyline felt thrown together in a feeble attempt to bring it all together at the end.  I even could have gotten past Darryl Hannah's horrible overacting in both films.  In the end what I found unforgivable was that QT casts David Carradine, Mr. Kung Fu himself, and then doesn't let his character, Bill, survive for more than a couple of minutes.  I was looking forward to seeing a grand finale' of a fight scene with more of the same amazing wire work that was used in the first film. It was the most anticlimactic ending that could have possibly been conceived. How do you cast David Carradine and then not even have him in a decent fight scene.  The real pity of this film is that it ends up ruining the first one too.  Part of the appeal of VOL I is the cliffhanger ending.  But with no payoff in VOL II, who cares??",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Entertaining and Great,"Quentin Tarantino commonly makes great films. However, you didn't know what to think with Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was a great action film, but at times became tired. There was no great dialogue as you come to expect from Mr. Tarantino. However, this film gives you everything that you want. It is a good thing that he split it into two films, because after you get to see his masterpiece of action experimentation, you get to the great stuff, with the dialogue. Also, Budd and Elle Driver are much better characters than Vernita Greene and O-Ren Ishii. This movie is great. It is one of those movies where you sprint towards the bathroom so you won't miss any more great dialogue or another revalation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Well filmed, well acted, well done!","Not too often have I come across a film so highly anticipated, and walk out the theater actually having enjoyed it more than I expected. Kill Bill Volume 1 was so over the top, so over stylish, and oh so very good that I had to doubt myself if Volume 2 could live up to the first. Now granted, we all know (or should, before basing judgment) that this is really one long movie, essentially chopped in half. The first half being action and set up, the second half being the conclusion and character building. I was relieved to find the second half being what I just said. The directing by QT just goes to show that he has to be one of the finest writers and directors of our time. The dialouge in and QT movie, in my opinion, sets his flicks apart from the rest, and he does not disappoint here. The finest part being the ladder of the film, with the conversations between The Bride and Bill. Also here is something we aren't too accustomed to from a QT movie... sentiment. I couldn't help but smile as I left the theater. All things considered, from the few action scenes, to the beautiful scenery, to the well-written script, KB 2 more than lives up to the reputation that the first movie set.

Better than vol. 1,"I posted mistakenly yesterday a comment that was intended to be for vol. 1. After seeing the first 'Kill Bill' on DVD, I ran to the theaters and saw vol. 2 today - it is better.One may argue whether making violent films about killers is moral. Still if morality of the times is a criteria, many art works would have never made it. 'Kill Bill' is a very good film, vol. 2 explains everything is important in a logical manner, it is superbly filmed and acted - a real treat. As vol. 1 was, vol.2 is full of cinema quotes from Terentino's masters, and for the cinema lovers this is really fun.Action film fans will find less of their preferred stuff in the second film. This did not bother me at all. What I got in exchange is the really tremendous acting of David Carradine. I never forgot what a wonderful actor he can be, but I did not see him in any important film since the 80s. Here he is back, and I hope his acting will not be forgotten until the next Oscars - he deserves at least a nomination in my opinion.A few words about the ending. Leaving things un-explained as they were at the end of vol. 1 is a better artistic bet. Explaining has its problems, and explaining in films needs to conform to some rules. I think that the script and the director did a good job on this - not perfect, but very good indeed.9/10 on my personal scale. the best film of this year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Kill Bill Volume Two redeems itself a little bit from the flaws of the first volume, but carries flaws of its own","I hated Kill Bill Volume One. No, I have not seen all of it, but of what I have seen: I thought it was terrible. For example, half the film was style and violence, and the ""Bang! Bang!"" song seemed to set it up as a drama. (These were only a few flaws.) Luckily, the Kill Bill series was able to redeem itself with Kill Bill Volume Two.The nameless Bride starts out in a scene talking about her attack, in a scene that seems too much to be like a Mystery Science Theatre Movie. After that long scene is done, we are introduced to Bill and Budd. Budd agrees to help Bill kill The Bride and return the sell the so-called priceless sword. But, to kill Bill, The Bride goes to a Shoaling Temple to learn the deadly ""Five Point Palm-Exploding Heart Technique.""Kill Bill Volume Two improves on two of the main flaws of the first one. The first film was 100% violence, and the only thing besides that was a whole lot of incoherence. Kill Bill Volume Two has hardly any violence. It has more story than the original. This is an improvement. The second flaw was that the ""Bang! Bang!"" song in the beginning seems to set Kill Bill Volume One up as a drama. Volume Two is more of a drama, and the ending is fairly touching.However, even if Volume Two improves on the first one, it creates some flaws of its own. First of all, the whole film is over-drawn. It seemed like Tarintino was trying to put a short script into 136 minutes, which makes the film pretty boring at times. Bill's ""superhero speech,"" the goldfish speech, the introduction of the ""Two Chapels Massacre,"" the fight between Elle and The Bride, and the whole thing about Budd's job all had one thing in common: They were hideously over-drawn. The second flaw was that the film seemed to try to be a kung-fu movie. I heard it was Tarintino's style to copy ""B movies,"" but nobody wants to watch a modern-day cheesy flick. Some things that made Kill Bill Volume Two look like a corny ""B movie"" were: the sudden zooms on the camera, the times the sensei flips his beard, and the colorful background with black figures. I recall somebody saying ""They must have felt so goofy working for Quentin Tarintino."" Kill Bill Volume Two is an improvement, but it still has flaws of its own. If you hated the first like me, than you might want to pick this one up, unless you think you will hate it equally as much.6/10Good: Drama and ActionBad: Over-drawn, corny B-movie style and carries some of the flaws of the first volumeFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Well worth the wait,"Kill Bill Volume 1 was my favorite 2003 film. It was one of the rare times i was laughing in a cinema not because the movie was funny (intentionally or unintentionally) but because i was enjoying mt self. It was the most fun time i' ve had in a cinema for a long-long time! After a six month wait period, the film's conclusion finally arrived. Did it leave up to my expectations? Yes it did, although in a totally different way.Let's get on thing straight right from the start: Kill Bill Vol. 2 is entirely different to Vol. 1. It's almost like watching a completely different film.First of all the action takes several steps back and character development steps forth. The Bride (whose real name is revealed but i won't spoil it for you) is almost an entirely different person this time around. She no longer is an unlikable super-bitch. She shows an incredible range of emotions from fear to sympathy and love and this time we really do CARE for her and her cause. Bill also gets some serious development. We learn about his relationship with the Bride and why he decided to kill her, and in the end we do feel some sympathy for him too. There also is a lot of Tarantino-esque dialog in this installment. Bill's take on Superman was one of the smartest things i've heard in a movie this year!The action and humor  although toned down, still play an important part in the movie. Volume 2 is more brutal than Volume 1, and even though it doesn't contain any scenes like the Crazy 88 massacre (who as we find out weren't really 88 LOL) it's very violent and graphic (no blood (gaizers this time). The duel with Elle is truly a thing to behold! But by far the best part of the movie is the chapter entitled ""The Cruel Tutelage Of Pei Mei"" where we witness the Bride's training by a realy old Kung-Fu master. Their duels and Pei Mei's lines are the movie's highlights!Direction wise Tarantino works his magic once again. This time the film is more Spagheti-Western oriented and it almost entirelly takes place in a desert (in El Passo none the less...) and the soundtrack is full of songs by Robert Rodriguez and Ennio Moriconne. The usual Kung-Fu tricks (sudden close ups etc) still make their appearance as well as some really cool camera angles and tricks (the end of the opening sequence is a real tour de force for Quentin Tarantino). Kudos have to be given to Tarantino for creating the best and more nightmarish sequence of someone being buried alive, you'll be surprised by how uncomfortable he'll make you feel just by watching a black screen and hearing strange sounds. Credit is also due to Uma Thurman who did one hell of a nice job as the Bride (heck she deserves an Oscar for the last sequence of the film alone) and to David Carandine who was deliciously evil and enjoyable in the role of the eponymous villain.I only have two gripes about the movie. Sometimes the story dragged on and there were some scenes that just took up time and stalled the story. The sequence where we see Budd working at the titi bar for example was very very long and it served absolutely no purpose. My other gripe is that the Bride's duel with Bill is really short, and out of balance compared to the huge amount of dialog between the two characters that preceeds it.If Vol. 1 was all style and no substance, then Vol. 2 is all style and all substance. It's a different experience in many levels but it's still a very enjoyable one. If the reason you saw Volume 1 was because you liked the slick action scenes featured in the trailers, don't even bother watching Volume 2, you will be very disappointed. I rate this movie with a perfect 10. Simply put, alongside Big Fish (which debuted here in 2004), it's the best film i've seen this far in 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Could've been better....,"I'm kind of surprised to see people saying this Vol.2 was better than Vol.1. I thought part one got a lil over the top with the fight scenes (especially with the Crazy 88's) but it was still tolerable and full of surprises. Vol. 1 moved a lot better (as far as the story)and was far more entertaining.Vol. 2 totally brought down Vol.1. Its hard to believe this is the continuation of Vol.1. There was entirely too much dialouge and QT tried to give us a better feel for the characters but it ended being very boring. I thought one of the best things about Bill in Vol. 1 was his mystery. We didn't know too much about him but we knew enough to know he was one bad mofo. In Vol. 2, all that went down the drain. He seemed very mild, vulnerable and not even capable of doing the things he did. Same thing with the Bride.Also, Uma's character just didn't have the same drive she did in the first one. The list was now non-existent as well. Everything just seemed to be in slow motion as it was half way thru the movie and nothing had really happened except the Bride being buried underground.This movie had its moments, (the tomb scene, Daryl's and Umas fight scene, and the training sequence) but other than that, the movie offered us flat dialogue. It seems like QT lost his touch for interesting and good dialogue because for the first time ever, i was bored during a QT film.Vol.1 was just so much fun and exciting. It had a good story and everything was perfectly paced. It seems like to me that QT had to compromise and added unnecessary dialogue and scenes to fill in time to be able to make this a complete film (time wise). I think he easily could've released this project as one movie by editing half of vol. 2.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
That's Entertainment,"Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place.'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino.Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Not with a bang...,"Tarantino left himself with a hell of a problem by dividing this story in two.For one thing, he had left almost all the rest of the back story for the second movie. Oh yeah, and a lot of the character touches.So that leaves Part 2 at a disadvantage as far as pacing is concerned. Admittedly, few movies could keep up the pacing of the first part without completely leaving any pretense of plot behind.So we get to alternate between current time and flashbacks... so much so that, at first, I got a little tired of it. But unlike Part 1, the flashbacks made more direct sense.And we finally get to meet characters that were waiting offstage in Part 1, like Bill and his brother, Budd.There's a lot of good stuff here. The film is about 2 and a half hours long, but it didn't make me real antsy and The Bride was riding off into the sunset almost before I knew it.A lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
It's Time for the Bride to Kill Bill...,"The Bride reaches the conclusion to her quest for revenge! After the first volume followed the Bride's confrontations with the first two targets (Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii), the second volume shows her hunt for the remaining two DiVAS members, as well as Bill himself. We really struck me as odd about volume two was that it was a COMPLETELY different style than its predecessor. Where volume one was a bloody kung-fu exploitation film, volume two tones it down and delves more into the story. It goes into greater detail about what led up to the attack on the Bride, as well as where she received her training that turned her into one of the most dangerous women in the world.This volume has considerably less violence and less bloodshed. The fights are still spectacular with some of the greatest choreography I've seen in modern movies. The fights are brutal and still pack a serious punch. The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is basically an all-out brawl with elements of martial arts giving it some grace. As I said before, we are given more story in this volume so we get more information around the legend of the Bride. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be the chapter dealing with her training under Pai Mei (Gordon Liu); I really just loved the character. As a result of increased storytelling, the movie does move at a slightly slower pace than the first volume but it never fully stalls.Michael Madsen rocks in this movie, but then again I like him in pretty much every role I've seen him in. My favorite addition to this volume was Bill himself. David Carradine almost made me sympathetic for the character when he explains the rationale behind his actions. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit anti-climactic compared to what I went into the movie expecting. For an entire 4 hour saga revolving around the hunt for Bill, I expected something more explosive. It was still a satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's epic tale of revenge and helped make the 'Kill Bill' saga one of Tarantino's best pieces of work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Much slower  than Vol 1 but a satisfying conclusion to the story,"Kill Bill Vol 1 was an out-and-out comic book romp, full of violence but always with tongue firmly in cheek. The violence count is severely reduced in Vol 2 but arguably more disturbing. The big difference is that Vol 2 is about the characters rather than the action. Here we begin to find out who these people really are and that, despite there penchant for assassination, they are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The result is that expectations of another high-speed violence-fest are dashed but the seemingly chaotic events of the first film finally get explained. The pace slackens quite markedly towards the end causing an audible amount of fidgeting in the theatre where I viewed it but sitting it out to the end is well worthwhile. As before, Tarantino presents the story in a variety of film styles, my particular favorite being the black-and-white Film Noir that opens the movie. I'd love to see Tarantino do a whole movie in this style but I'm not sure his attention-span would last that long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"One of my all time favorites, Tarantino at his best.","Kill Bill Volume 1 was a very enjoyable and fun film for me, but one of my main complaints was the same complaint many others had- The movie relied on vicious action, and told little of a story. Quentin has always been my favorite director, but even I thought that the only reason Volume 1 received so much praise was because it was a Tarantino film, and that fact somewhat blinded people of its true essence, and that was a standard action film with gallons of blood, although in fairness, it had one of the greatest action scenes of all time featuring The Bride vs The Crazy 88.But Volume 2 on the other hand is much different from the original Kill Bill film. You can truly see what Tarantino's purpose was when making these two movies, and he did not disappoint. Volume 1 set up all of the questions, and gave vague reasons why exactly The Bride wants to murder her former boss and ex-lover, Bill. And now, Volume 2 answers all of those questions, and goes into deeper detail as to why Bride feels such a strong need to kill Bill. To use an analogy, Volume 1 opened the box and dumped out all of the pieces to the jigsaw puzzle, scattering them all about, and you know very little concerning where to go from there. But Volume 2 joins up all of those puzzle pieces, and by the end of Volume 2, all the pieces are together, and it creates a beautiful picture.If you are one of those people who only enjoyed Volume 1 for the action and the actual storyline does not concern you, don't expect to enjoy Volume 2 as much as the previous installment. The second is much more intriguing and tells a much deeper story, as well as developing the characters much more. Don't get me wrong, there a few fantastic fight scenes in this film, but this is by no means an action-packed splatterfest.As for the acting, in a word, extraordinary. Uma Thurman outdid herself as The Bride, Michael Madsen did great as the character Budd (one of the best characters in all of films, might I add. He's so mysterious in a sense), and Daryl Hannah was fantastic as Elle. But folks, let me tell you- the late great David Carradine stole the show. He is nothing short of ideal for the character of Bill.Tarantino's Kill Bill movies are not for everyone, but then again, none of Quentin's films are for everyone. But I found this a very enjoyable film, and I think everyone who enjoys an intriguing story with heartpounding action, and a touching ending should without a doubt watch this film.Oh, and did I mention that the musical score Robert Rodriguez did was incredible? The only thing I can think of that was better was the score Ennio Morricone did for Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. But let's be honest, will that score ever be beaten? You bet not.But back to Kill Bill. Awesome movie, watch it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Better than the first part of Kill Bill,"I personally like the second part better than the first. Even from my childhood when I somehow started watching it or just peeked at it, I remember certain scenes very well, like the teacher, the eye and the last dialogues.The plot continues the idea of the first part, but it looks less postmodern than the first one, by feel. The filming is more interesting, as are the episodes. There aren't as many action sequences here, which I even like, as they become more significant and less drawn out, concentrating the film on them. The film has become more realistic and less surreal.Some compositions, like in the first part, don't feel right to me. Other than that, it's hard to even pick on anything.For me, it's already a well deserved 7 out of 10, but not sure about the 8 out of 10 despite the fact that it has no obvious minuses.

Semi decent film,"Before I start, I want to point out I have not seen the first of the two movies.  So i may kick myself in the butt after posting this.  I want to say kill Bill 2 was decent.  I am not a Tarantino fan so I don't expect much out of him.  But I am a film student, so what I am about to say is coming from a film student point of view.  The movie had a lot of dialogue, most interesting but some seemed to ramble on & on.  Also what irritated me was that he doesn't use a lot of a shot variation.  He sticks with a constant shot for every scene and it gets boring, there is nothing there to hold you attention.  If he changed the shots up from time to time and not go back  & forth between two different shots, the movie would have been more interesting.  He does well with the action sequences but the other parts the shots are just boring.  I thought the black & white to color style was effective, relating to past & present.  That worked well.

The better half of the 2,"With a much needed balance of story, and some great performances as before, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is by far the better half of Tarantino's series and is certainly an unforgettable conclusion that shines even greater than the first. Although the pacing does take a drag as the film starts out, Kill Bill Vol. 2 doesn't waste any more time than it needs to telling its story in the best way possible, and is for the majority of its longer runtime, a very entertaining film. As before, the fight sequences are very impressive, and the tone has seemed to find its balance between the harsh and the cool. Uma Thurman shines again as her character the Bride, and David Carradine also gives a very notable performance as Bill himself. In the end, Tarantino provides yet another masterwork of filmmaking by providing a very impressive conclusion to a rather impressive series. The plot may take a bit to get started, and the film may feel a bit unsatisfying for its ending, but all together, it is able to improve on its previous flaws and shine greater than ever before.

Good Ending,"Even though this one didn't have as much action as the first, its still a great movie over all.  This second part mainly brings everything to an end nice and simple and very unique as well.  Quentin once again did a terrific job on directing and writing and producing.  The Acting was once again perfect like Quentins other movies.  Uma did a great job as the bride and no one could replace Dave Carradine for the part of bill.  Most people need to make sure they go into this movie with an open mind, if anyone were to expect as much action and violence as the first one they will be disappointed.

The movie achieved the results but not like you expected,"Part 2 brings everything to the conclusion that you expected it would but not at all the way you expected or the pace of the first part. Volume 2 is still a story of revenge, but not with massive amounts of violence like in Volume 1. There was a couple of times when we thought that the bride was dead, but she is like a cat with nine lives. There was several shocks and impossible situations, but our heroine came through in ways you thought weren't possible. The use of black and white photography emphasized the drama of the wedding massacre. All in all this is Quentin's best flick yet!

Not the better half,"Lacks the style and action of the first volume and there should have been some warning that the second part would be absolutely nothing at all like the first part. Actually Tarantino did give a subtle warning but the first part can be greatly misleading. However this movie gets better every time you watch it. It more typical Tarantino fare when compared with the first half. The expected dialog is long and detailed. Most of the scenes and acting have been done flawlessly. However, had it had just one major, well choreographed fight scene at the very end, it would have so much better. The ending is thus quite disappointing. Overall, the first part, as a wild explosive party was just so much more fun and memorable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
More subtle than Volume 1 (what isn't?) yet almost as much fun.,"Kill Bill Vol. 1 is by far my favorite movie in recent memory. I've seen it 4 times and I still love every second. I love it for its outstanding boldness and relentless intensity.Volume 2 is quite different from volume 1  that should be a given. Originally conceived as a single movie, one shouldn't expect the second half to mirror the first, especially when it's written and directed by Tarrantino. Don't expect another sassy knife fight or Kung-Fu bloodbath  expect the unexpected.This pertains especially to the pacing. Volume 1 was fast and furious but Volume 2 is more contemplative. There's more word play than sword play and all the characters get ample room to blossom... before they are killed.Everyone is colorful and amusing. Tarrantino has a way of simultaneously building fondness and contempt for the players, such that when one heavy back-stabs another, you feel a mix of elation and annoyance. Go ahead and like someone, but don't get too attachedKill Bill is brimming with great performances, any one of which would single-handedly carry an average movie. Michael Madsen is Budd, Bill's estranged brother. (The two have a complicated relationship.) Although he appears to have gone tender, Budd is not to be under-estimated! Larry Bishop is hilarious as the sleazeball boss of the strip club where Budd is slumming as a bouncer. Darryl Hannah plays Ellie Driver, a truly bitchy villain you'll love to hate.David Carradine is the charismatic Bill. (aka: The Snake Charmer) In the opening sequence of Volume 1, we saw him at his very worst but most of the time he is surprisingly pleasant to be around. But by his own admission he is a murdering bastard and he seems to have a knack for royally pissing people off. We see this with his former mentor Hattori Hanzo, his brother Buddy, and most especially the film's protagonist, The Bride (played of course by Uma Thurman).Uma continues to dazzle as she did in the first volume. Seldom has a heroine been cast in so many different lights. Depending on the scene, she can look plain or glamorous, confident or vulnerable, exuberant or despondent. Her moods go all over the map but they're always convincing.There's a few very cool dual roles. Gordon Liu played the ""Crazy 88"" commander from Vol. 1 and in real life he's the fight choreographer. In Vol. 2, he plays Pai Mei, a lonesome hermit who is the high priest of all martial arts. (Apparently Tarrantino dubbed the voice in Cantonese!) It's highly amusing to watch him put Uma through her paces. (This sequence also helps to illustrate how Uma's character became the deadliest woman in the world and is able to prevail in one particularly hopeless situation.) You won't even recognize Michael Parks, who was the Texas Ranger in Vol. 1.Volume 2 relies heavily on dialog. This has always been an exceptionally strong point for Tarrantino and he comes through as strong as ever in this picture. It takes some strain, however, to reconcile the more cerebral high of Volume 2 with the sensational absence of subtlety in Volume 1. You have to shift mental gears to appreciate the entire package. It's well worth the effort.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A nice wrap up to the chaos of the first one.,"I enjoyed the first one somewhat. Good cast, and Tarentino quirky with over the top villains but a surplus of the red stuff. I went to Vol 2 expecting more of the same and was very surprised. Reduced splatter, plot and actions explained! This really does elevate the total package to near excellence. I could see people who were put off by Vol 1 not seeing 2 at all. That is a real shame, but these were not originally conceived as two separate movies, and the slaughterhouse action of Vol 1, while way too heavy handed, was meant to be tempered by the slower paced exposition of Vol 2. A solid 8 but allow enough time to watch both halves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
- you get what you were looking for.,"let s face it, we all know what we are looking for with a QT film...we get it in this movie. Gore, good scenes and characters that you either love to hate or you think they are over the top. Aside from the tripe that will remain nameless this movie is as good as the rest...of the 2 I liked this better ( with the exception of the animation from the 1st ). David Carridine does a good job playing the character 'Bill' and is the face and the voice of the image of the character partially revealed in the first chapter of the 2 movies. Seemingly timeless and aged like the bark of a weathered tree he seemed....ah just see it...10 line minimum? IF you like Tarantino AND liked Chapter 1 THEN see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Playful and with even more outrageous and preposterous action. 77.5%,"Tarantino seems to be in an even more playful mood with ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" than he was in the first one, after opening his sequel with a replay of the dying bride sequence of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". For instance, The Bride narrates straight to the camera and at the audience. She even ups the ante with comments like: ""What the movie advertisements refer to as 'a roaring rampage of revenge'"". Is she talking about the movie ""Kill Bill""? or merely likening her situation to that of such movies in general? Such playfulness seems to me to take the edge off some of the disturbing imagery in this movie...like the kinds of horrors that you only see in cartoons...the kind that is parodied in The Simpson's cartoon within a cartoon ""The Itchy and Scratchy show"". Such horrors are rendered dreamlike or, more accurately, perhaps, like a daydream or fantasy. Where to draw the line between what is in real in the movie and what is fake becomes more fraught when The Bride makes the viewer an accomplice to her ""roaring rampage"" by saying ""the one I'm driving to right now, the only one I have left"". Again, this seems to erase the line between film and reality...movies don't talk back to you, do they? It's the film purporting to be real...you are there, with The Bride...sitting on the bonnet of her car...as she drives along a highway to mete out her next act of revenge!The other notable thing about this movie, going on my notes, are the inside jokes. For instance, Tarantino had me going with the books one of his characters was reading, i.e. ""The Carrucan's of Kurrajong"". Like me, Tarantino has a mistaken apostrophe. Anyway, I looked up this book just now and learned its provenance. The books just sounds like a real book...I'm pretty sure that there would be an Australian book with a not dissimilar title!Self-referential humour also plays a part in this film. For instance, Bill has a brand of bread called ""Blanco Bimbo"". The Bride is sometimes addressed as ""kiddo"" too...which has a payoff later in the film.Watching the movie and the end credits, Tarantino seems to be providing the viewer with a syllabus to follow-up on: two characters watch ""Shogun assassin"" together, for instance. A Charles Bronson movie poster adorns one character's caravan, I think. Not sure if it's this movie or the first one (perhaps both?) which also gives a nod to Charles Bronson in the end credits. Some nostalgia was brought up for me too...I'd forgotten that the cartoon series ""Heckle and Jeckle"" existed, but Tarantino reminded me!For those who enjoy Tarantino's pop cultural riffs, he has a good one concerning superheroes and their alter-egos.Some notes to self:* Bill says ""Ah so"" a couple of times in the film, I think...not sure if that is a nod to David Carradine's starring role in ""Kung fu"" many decades ago.* The pianist at the church is described as a ""drell""...I've only heard that word with relation to a character in the sci-fi game ""Mass Effect 2"", the word ""bar-kay"" is also used. Not sure what they mean here! Just looked up the latter phrase...the pianist was in a real life band of that name? Hmm...see my point earlier about blurring the line between fiction and reality!* Bill makes a comment to the effect that B wears the costume of Arlene...and...I shouldn't have used an abbreviation in my notes! Not sure who the ""B"" refers too...probably The Bride...and I'm guessing that ""Arlene"" was a fake name she used at her wedding rehearsal.As with the first movie, from memory, I was toying with what score to give this movie...I think scoring this sequel 75% was on the cards but I liked how it played out, so I settled on a higher score so that I'd give it 8 out of 10, since this site doesn't give half stars.Lastly, if you like playful movies like this, I'd also recommend the horror movie ""In the mouth of madness"" and the sci-fi movie ""The thirteenth floor"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Well worth watching again.,"I would give this film a 7.5 out of 10, Tarantino has done a great job of volume 2 it's better than the first. There's a good balance of action, comedy and love, the action is much more believable than the first. The love is not too cheesy, and the fight scenes you can't help but laugh and shout ouch!!We learn the truth about the Bride, how she became so deadly, how she trained under Bill's Master Pai Mei (typical 70's kung fu grand master), I'd say is my favourite part of the film.Uma Thurman shows great acting skills, from fear, sadness joy and just being plain normal. One scene where it seems our heroine has finally met her doom is particularly well acted out its pretty convincing. David Carradine character Bill you almost feel sorry for, I quite liked the guy especially for the ending.Only two things I didn't like about the film, once she gets to Bill the movie does drag on a little, I think Tarantino saw this because he adds in a few surprises should u begin to fall asleep with all the talk. Samuel L Jackson's appearance is a black and white scene as the organ player for the wedding rehearsal, the room is quite dark and being black it is hard to see him, but saying that Tarantino doesn't concentrate much of Jackson's face during his conversations.Funniest scene for me was Budd's calendar scene and Pai Mei laughter whilst beard stroking; think you'll like it too.PS saw it yesterday as my brother works for a cinema company.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Classic Tarantino,"First i must say this is just classic Tarantino. There is little violence in this movie but the dialogue is what makes it. I'm also a big fan of Madsen so him just being in the movie made it great. It has classic characters such as the Pei Mea(SP?), Budd, Elle, and Bill. The story has been greatly improved upon since the first half. The silly blood spray that was in the first half is now gone, which is not a bad thing. Bill and the Brides past really is well done and makes you think Bill isnt really that bad of a person. If you ever are able to free up a few hours go see this movie right away.

The Bride Kicks It Again!,"After the bloody ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" ended in a cliffhanger, ""Vol. 2"" wraps up the whole story.

The body count isn't as high as it was in ""Vol. 1,"" but there's still plenty of gore and pain.  The Bride's harsh training under Pai Mei is rather painful to watch!  Quentin Tarantino's use of cinematic styles sell the story, with references to the genres of kung fu and the spaghetti western.  His use of music is also used well to set the feel of every scene. Tarantino might not be done with some of these characters, and it'll be interesting to see how their stories will continue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
what it was about,"Well, volume 2 is a continuation of volume 1 (they are one movie, split into 2 parts) and the difference between the two of them are night and day. While the last movie explained very little in the way of plot, and the character's histories, Volume 2 gives you everything that you missed in the last installment. There was some amazing action in this movie. There were less grandiose battles, and more one on one settling of personal differences, which were intimate and really damn cool. While some of the characters may be a bit long winded about their pasts, or their motives, what they talk about is definately worth paying attention to. This will definately strike a chord with the fans of QT. This highly stilized, well directed movie had some nice suprises if you can forget the fact that you know what happens in the end. (I wonder why its called Kill Bill...) Every performance, from the Bride to B.B (her daughter)was stellar. With a jump start beginning, an emotional ending, and some great plot fleshing, action, laughs, emotion, and insight this conclusion of a revenge story, could not have been more sweet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Story drags it down,"It's definitely the more story-oriented of the two, and that might hurt it. Since volume one is all action, all of the plot and character development is left to this part, which makes it a bit too long and talky. That's not to say the dialogue isn't good, because it is, but parts of this film - especially near the end - drag on a lot longer than they need to. The climax takes forever, and then it is somewhat anti-climatic, though the final act of revenge was fitting. The action is sparse but awesome, and the acting is significantly better - probably because David Carradine's actually in this one - but it is slightly worse than the first volume. Although, Pai Mei is my favourite character in the set, so I have to give it props for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Some Unsaid Critiques,"Reading old critics or new users, few are saying what I thought upon release and now, re-watching these. Only posting because of that.1)the dialogue almost never coheres into the electric, fascinating rhythms of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs."" This movie is more like ""Death Proof"": it often seems like a cheeky imitation of ""bad"" dialogue from genre movies Tarantino loves. There are actual cringe moments nobody dared tell uh, ""Q"" (cringe moment 1) made them cringe. The most ""Pulp Fiction""-like scene involves a strip-club owner yelling at a bouncer for being late.2)The approach to dialogue and style nearly strangles the emotional film, whether it's a revenge drama or whatever it is. Tarantino's talent in his best movies clearly is utterly compelling episodic scenes, often grounded in a weird mix of references to real humanity and movie humanity. He's kind of chucked real humanity out the window here, and it hurts him. I don't quite see the throughline from ""Pulp Fiction"" to this, ""Kill Bill"" is trying something new, for better or worse. Often it's worse, as ""the Bride"" must carry the film, and her character motivations often get lost in the stylistic shuffle.3)It's a revenge fantasy, but the sterility of the stylized reality and heightened Kung-fu world manage to strip vengeance of much meaning, reward or even coherence. Uma Thurman does a good job panting, looking hurt and crying, but she also frequently sits down and smiles and chit-chats. While contrasts between chit-chatting hit men and brutal killing were stunning in ""Pulp Fiction,"" in a film with a central protagonist fueled by (presumable) undying vengeance, these scenes undermine the character, and really undermine much emotional punch.I think that's about it, most people (me included) mostly have positive stuff to say about the movie. There's fun, clever fights, brilliant use of music, much inspired stuff. But I think a mix of weak, possibly ""indulgent"" writing and tonal miscalculations make this clearly not a masterpiece. A tighter revenge-based action film might have been better, a more ""Tarantino"" (in the ""Pulp Fiction"") sense) ""realistic"" vengeance film might have been better. The two approaches don't sit in perfect harmony with one another.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

This movie just goes on and on and on. Its a mess.Actually this film has only one problem and that it insists on filling fill in the blanks concerning every single character, whether it  moves the plot or not. Several of these sequences could be so much shorter, but Quentin instead insists on letting them play out until you want to snooze.Worse this film insists on copying god knows how many film styles, a flaw the first film over came. Most of the styles didn't need to have them paid homage.I will not discuss the ending which goes on to the point of boredom, I dislike it and I'll leave it at that.Perhaps this will play better as seen as one long 5 hour film, but I doubt it.4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Putrid potboiler glorifying gangsterism with comic book characters, PT 2","I thought nothing could get worse than part 1, but part 2 managed to do it. It continues the super slick presentation of part 1, the glorification of what is evil in the world, and don't give that garbage about how evil is equivocal. These people kill people and have no sense of humanity beyond themselves and their own selfish world. This director is twisted, in his world love is a selfish design, and there's no room for sacrifice. Why do people like Kiddo? She's the least evil of the evil. And are we really supposed to believe that core of martial art training is to provide assassins? But what really makes this one worse than part 1 is the outstandingly awful over-acting of David Carradine, a lousy attempt to present himself as a wise sage of some sort. It seems that with Carradine, less is better. The less he's seen, the better. The less he says, the better. He needs to stop playing Caine from Kung Fu. But at least Caine was a considerate human. And what was that crud about a truth serum he invented? What a contrivance. This two film series is a big contrivance.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The cast is a lot of the same, Thurman, Carradine, Hannah, and Madsen are all back and all turn in great performances.

He plays his character very well, he is not very fanatic, he's pretty laid back and chill most of the time, and in a way that makes his character more menacing, because of the ease that comes with his actions. He was a great choice for his role. But ya know who was the absolute perfect choice for their role? Daryl Hannah. Hannah plays Elle, the one eyed ruthless assassin. I adored her performance, she really gave it her all. I was transfixed by her acting ability here, especially since it's a pretty unusual role for her. And of course Thurman was just amazing in the lead, just as she was in Vol. 1. I do suggest this sequel, but only if this is your kind of movie and only if you liked the first film. Well written dialogue, fine performances, and a lot of great action. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Volume to this one, lowers a lot","A slower, less, less, less, less bloodier Bill, which will have a few blood craving fans, sold short like I was. I'm with them. This one lacks the powerful intensity and ferociousness of the first, it's hard to imagine this was connected to Volume One, let alone the same movie. With two down and three to go, our seductress of vengeance Bea.... (sorry, shouldn't of said the name) continues her bloody (gees I love that word) quest n those who wanted her dead. The way the victims die, where pathetic. I was expecting real bloody scenes, and the five finger technique was a joke, yet this is still an enjoyable ride, but just not as good as the first. Carradine is an asset here where we see much more of him like Madsen who plays Bill's younger wilder brother. Hey would we want him any other way. Kill Bill 2 is more a sedate action flick, even the massacre in that church where Bea bought it, the violence there was veiled as we only heard shooting coming out of the church. May'be it was Tarantino's intention to make this part less violent, but still we can't get our head around, that this is adjoined to the first all out bloody outing. With a few dead stops, we have some lengthy scenes too with this one, some philosophical involving Bea being trained by an grumpy old fart of a master, when I think of all those stone steps, I get tired. Too is Carradine's scene near the end, as he lectures little Bea's daughter about death. And the Tarantino humour hasn't gone astray either, the scene with Larry Bishop lecturing Madsen in his office about work ethics was my favourite scene. Michael Parks, incidentally plays another character, not notorious sheriff Pete McGraw, who bought the farm in From Dusk To Dawn. With all the critiques, call them inadequacies, just mentioned, this still comes as good solid entertainment, in a well told tale that only it's master Tarantino can tell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Brilliant storytelling - stands on its own & superior to 'Vol. 1',"Not being a fan of ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" - it seemed pointless and lacked great dialogue - I was awfully apprehensive about ""Vol. 2."" And what a wonderful surprise ""Vol. 2"" turned out to be.THIS is the film the first one should have been. Tarantino, again, offers a pastiche of genres, but, this time, packs it with a thoroughly engaging story, delightfully dark humor, dialogue that crackles and some inspired storytelling. ""Vol. 2"" isn't as violent. Not that I am averse to violence. But, unlike in ""Vol. 1,"" where it just became tedious, here, the bloodletting is handled with great aplomb and makes perfect sense.There are some marvelous moments in this second installment - a sensational trailer scene between Daryl Hannah (who hasn't looked this sexy in a movie in years) and the uncommonly gorgeous Uma Thurman; a terrific (and horrifying) sequence where the screen goes completely dark; a very funny Bride-Karen scene and some touching moments toward the end, made all the more believable in a movie of this sort because of an utterly convincing and captivating performance by Thurman.She's fantastic as the vengeful bride. And this time around, she's given some brilliant dialogue to play with. It's typical Tarantino and a pleasure to listen to, especially when delivered by the likes of Thurman, whose timing is immaculate, Hannah and David Carradine.Robert Richardson's cinematography is spectacular. The early black-and-white shot of Uma Thurman framed by the doorway of the Two Pines Wedding Chapel would have made John Ford proud. And, stick around to the very end. After all the end credits have rolled. You'll be rewarded with a nice surprise.""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is superb storytelling. From the very first frame to the last. If I had to sit through a disappointing ""Vol. 1"" to get to this, so be it. Because the payoff was truly worthwhile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
critical response to self-indulgence,"There's a lot of fat in these movies Kill bill vol.1 and vol.2 that is too much narrative explanation, just cut to the chase Mr. Tarantino please! the action is great, the violence is unnecessary, the story clichéd and spread too thin to make this 2 1/2 hour film worth bothering with. It was geeky self-indulgence. I watched the Maltese Falcon just before now there's a master piece, short, to the point, well acted and not a flatulent moment in the script unlike with Kill Bill which is just stupid in comparison. There's no mystery, no subtlety, no intelligence, no charm and no cool. The whole premise seemed to come from that parody TV pilot in Pulp Fiction about fox force five except this time the foxes are snakes etc etc. so to sum up this film has a story that is way too thin, the film is way too long but the action is really good. This is a B movie with A action far from a classic its made for TV parody material with little to warm to in it, just sass from an ugly American. Pai Mei would not be happy at all.

Yet it is, painfully lacking in character development, humor and in plot.I enjoyed seeing it (especially enjoyed the GoGo part and the anime) but it could be so much better if they showed the second part together.

In the Top IMDb 250? 8+ Stars? Insanity.,"Since I believe this ""movie"" should be avoided at all cost as a major waste of your time there's no need to give any summary. Although what is worth mentioning is how ridiculously boring, tedious, and pointless this so-called movie really is. I just finished watching Kill Bill vol. 2 and I am in a state of disbelief over how anybody could find this movie entertaining. Somebody please tell me the appeal of near endless, mindless dialog with a great deal of it being completely pointless. Anti-entertaining is the best way I can think of to describe it. I was looking for a little entertaining while laying on my bed home from work sick with the flu, but this ""movie"" isn't just a disappointment because its not entertaining, it goes beyond that to induce an actual level of misery. Bad movies simply are not entertaining, thus this movie is worse than bad. Its so over-the-top pointless, and don't get me wrong there is about 20 solid minutes altogether of at least SOMETHING worth watching. But its so outweighed by the vast majority of unnerving nothing-ness that is the rest... well just picture an elephant and a feather on opposing ends of a balancing weight scale. The dialog is so bad you would be better off sitting in the park listening to two strangers converse about anything thats not kill bill 2, then to subject yourself to the torture that is kill bills (a good movie) sequel. I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and I gave this movie every benefit of the doubt all the way to the very end but it just kept getting worse. I thought maybe the ""movie"" was building to a big amazing climax at the end since the whole thing was so slow and agonizingly boring.. But NOPE! the so-called climax of this film is the most boring, tedious, monotonous, painful 30 minutes or so of the whole ""movie,"" maybe even film history all things considered. I read all these reviews of people saying what a masterpiece this film is. To each their own.. but that must be some kind of mass organized joke. No real sustained action period. Any fragments of what little action there is is outweighed a million-to-one by intense blaring boredom. Plot is irrelevant because before the you even hit ""play"" its already known -Kill Bill. No real flow considering all the wacky pointless scenes with no bearing on the story at all. These pointless scenes can't have even one positive adjective attached to them, for example ""funny"" or ""suspenseful"" They are just nothing. Forgive my poor grammar in this review, it was typed quickly during a moment of passion, immediately following my first -and very much last- viewing of Kill Bill 2.Mindless talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk about nothing going nowhere with no point, forever is the legacy of Kill Bill vol. 2.

Not like the first one,"Kill Bill Volume 2The film begins with a flashback to the wedding rehearsal of the Bride (Uma Thurman) in El Paso, Texas, that is interrupted by the arrival of Bill (David Carradine), the leader of a band of assassins and her former boss and lover. Pregnant with his child, she has decided to start her life anew. Bill's heart is broken, and he responds by releasing all his pent-up anger. As we remember from ""Kill Bill,"" the Bride survives the massacre and a gunshot wound to her head and vows to avenge herself on Bill and his assassins who ended her bid for a normal life.There are numerous ""problems"" with KB2, the main one being the simple fact that it's too damn ""talky."" Almost nothing happens for about the first 50 minutes of KB2. The film immediately put me off when it spent the first 20 minutes (which felt like two hours) rehashing the wedding scene, yet again!The Bride's martial-arts clash with the eye-patched Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) provides a welcome burst of adrenaline, as the pair do expertly choreographed battle in the extremely close quarters of a trailer home. Erasing all former images of herself, Hannah provides the most venomous of the ""Kill Bill"" villains. But none of these fights compares with the ""Vol. 1"" climactic samurai battle. What's missing, and this is bound to disappoint fans of the first part, are the fights. There is very little actual swordplay, and none of the demented set pieces that gave the first film its insane energy. In all ""Kill Bill 2"" feels like a dull knife.

Tarantino bounces back with his continuation of the story of The Bride,"When I say ""bounce-back,"" don't let that fool you completely. I thought Kill Bill: Vol.1 was decent, but for the great Quentin Tarantino, that's not strong enough. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is simply everything missing from the first volume. No Crazy 88? No over-the- top blood spewing battles? No problem. This is made up with more excellent Tarantino writing. David Carradine gets a thumbs up performance as the fiendish Bill. His strong presence gives new life to the movie. Not so strong however was Michael Madsen, as Bill's brother Budd. Yes, he was very memorable in Reservoir Dogs, but in this film I found him to be a bore. There were many scenes in the movie that I couldn't get into at all. Then later on, many scenes (like the training with Pai Mei) filled the holes of the story and created much character development. I can't write this review without mentioning the outstanding Beatrix ""The Bride"" (or Black Mamba, whatever suits) Kiddo played by Uma Thurman. In the follow- up, she shows even more color to her character, besides of course red and yellow. If your concerned about the lack of crazy action like the previous volume, don't sweat it. You'll get more out of Kill Bill: Vol.2 than you'd think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Good finish, should've been one movie","While I've read that Tarantino had no intentions of breaking the movie into two at the start, I'm sure he's not too upset at the reward of being #1 in the box office twice for the same film.The ending took where Volume 1 leaves off and runs with it. This film is not as action packed. Despite my love of Tarantino's work with dialogue, there are times when the talking seems to go on too long.Nevertheless, excellent work from Thurman and Carradine. Daryl Hannah played a role I didn't think she had in her and Madsen delivers his typical performance.This film is for Tarantino fans only.

Uma Thurman as The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo):
Uma Thurman delivers a performance of remarkable depth and intensity as The Bride.

muddled and not as quick and intense as Vol1,"In the follow up to the widely successful Volume 1, Uma Thurman reprises her role as the Bride who continues to search for the remaining members of Bill's group.Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) had set the bench mark with the first instalment, a sharp, exciting and devastating film about a woman who loses everything and is out for revenge, and because the first film was practically perfect apart from a few faults, this sequel wasn't really going to challenge the first. Nevertheless it is a gripping and exciting watch.Uma Thurman (Dangerous Liaisons) again excels in her central role as The Bride, with a strong determination on her mind to finally get full revenge for everything Bill has done to her, and in perhaps the best role of her career apart from Pulp Fiction, Thurman really steals the light in both films with a cutting devilish performance that does her character true justice. With a steely attitude and an emotional life troubling her, the Bride is given the depth and attention by Thurman to make the character an icon in the crime genre.As with the first volume, Tarantino directs in a vibrant way, some scenes in black and white, stories told at different times, flashbacks, fantasises to give the film a very unique approach and something which I had never seen before. The first instalment was certainly better directed and with a wider choice of styles including animations but still there are some true iconic scenes, none more so than the coffin scene, the most uncomfortable scene ever created in such a unique way.Despite the excellent direction and acting, the plot really lacks in comparison. The formula behind the first was more basic with fewer strings attached and there was a clear intention to where the film wanted to go. With the follow up, flashbacks and other stories seem more muddled and over the place, but still interesting. There are a few scary scenes, with snakes, coffins and surprises used to conform to the thriller genre.Again, well directed with great acting and characters but it lacks the intensity and consistency that the first one had without even trying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Yep, I liked this one better.","Here's where things really kick into gear. Paying homage to cheesy martial arts flicks, Wild West shootouts, revenge flicks and more all in one go, the second half of Kill Bill could only have been topped if both films had been released in one box.Again, this isn't perfect, but it is extremely enjoyable. The plot comes into full here, and thus we are able to more fully enjoy Kill Bill. The film's saving grace is David Carradine, though, who is playing every bit the character I expect from Tarantino's flicks. Memorable dialogue and spot on acting and conviction ensure that Carradine's performance is ace, only aided by the excellent performances of a number of side characters.Kill Bill is truly an adventure, with the blending of genres a key point in its enjoyability, alongside Tarantino's signature stylistic eccentricities. There's nothing else like this movie out there, and for connoisseurs and lovers of film, this is pure gold all the way through.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Less action, more talk","In the original film, we saw Uma Thurman kill loads and loads of people to get to two people. She namely out to kill two out of the Assassin squad she had once been part of, but which later betrayed her. After she managed to kill two out of it's four members, the movie ended. But we all knew that a Volume 2 was coming up.In Volume 2 she goes after the remaining members of the Assassin squad, plus it's leader: Bill. This time, it's awhole lot of more talk and less action. In contrast to the assassins played by Lucy Liu and Viveca A. Fox in the first volume, the assassins in these films (played by Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah) are very much developed. At least Michael Madsen's character (Budd). We follow him for a few hours of his life, prior to the moment when the Bride shows up. However, it appears Budd is quite resourceful and manages to evade the Bride's attack.Daryl Hannah's character Elle is brought into the picture as Budd wants to sell her a sword. Elle get's a little less development as we don't really see any scenes from her normal everyday life. But from the dialogue she later shares with The Bride, we get to know quite abit about her character. Superbly done, everything. The Bride and Elle share an awesome fight scene, with a very surprising and perfect ending.So anyway, that fight scene is the only real action we get in this film. And one might say that that's not what we wanted, considering everyone loved Kill Bill Vol. 1 for it's over the top violence and action. This film is more story driven than the first Volume, and it's definetly great. Altough some scenes tend to get a little bit to slow. Quentin could have cut some scenes down by a minute or so, to keep the audiences interested, instead of starting to lean back in their seats, waiting for something to happen.The soundtrack, like all Quentin's films, is superb. The acting is great. The dialogue may not be as good as his other films, but it holds up (most of the time). It has a good ending (altough there's not a big fight involved, if that's what you want). Pretty much, this film has what we wanted from Kill Bill vol. 2. It's an excellent, but not flawless, continuation of Volume 1.You should definetly go see this. Especially if you enjoyed the first volume.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
amazing,"first part is homage of Tarantino to his universe. the second - to Martial Arts. and David Carradine is perfect option to define it. because not the amazing sparkles of fight scenes are key in this case but the philosophy of survive. all the slices of westerns and kung fu becomes parts of a real impressive story about patience and price of life. Carradine is the good bad boy. and the curtain of feelings is more seductive. the story has roots. and the way to victory - more profound - has more drops of credibility. so, the show is complete. Tarantino does one of his masterpiece. and Uma Thurman - new version of old heroes - is amazing in each scene. like entire film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Definition of Revenge,"Once again a great sequel by quentin tarantino.

Wild, violent, engaging, funny in parts and a grand chop socky showcase to watch if thats your cup of tea, tune in. The last half of KB2 has the best dialog I have ever seen written for a movie; so believable! No one but Carradine could have played Bill. You could see the love in Kiddo and Bill's eyes when they looked at each other. A great love story!

The first film played out like a video game with great visuals, music, and a thin story without characterization or QT's sharp dialogue (and managed to be great because of all this, because it was, plain and simple, a bloody good, shocking time), while the second one can stand on it's own as a full movie. It has what the first one lacked, yet without the first one the mythology about the Bride, and just how brutally, and horrifyingly violent she can get, is absent. Together, as a whole, the movie delivers on every note any cinemaphile could want in a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Miramax & QT are vindicated,"Having seen comments on vol 1, accusing Miramax and Tarantino of blatant profiteering by releasing KB in two parts, it's great to see vol 2 answering those critics with aplomb.  Vol 2 is such a different film from its predecessor, and for that reason works wonderfully.  As one film, such contrast would have been impossible!  Okay, I was a little skeptical about the decision myself, but am I glad it became two movies!KBV2 is a treat.  Vol 1 seemed to lack plot.  Vol 2 brims with it.  Okay, the dialog still doesn't burn like vintage-QT (I felt the Superman thing, although entertaining, was shoe-horned in and seemed incongruous with Bill), but you sense he's trying his hand at something else entirely. Uma's performance is fantastic, David Carradine's, even better. The supporting players aren't half bad, either. In particular, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei, the vindictive Kung Fu master, is hilarious - never has insane laughter coupled with vigorous beard-stroking been done so stylishly on the cinema screen!As for the denouement, I loved it.  A noble and delightful end to a fantastic, stylish, and exhilarating ride.  Go and see it, even if vol.1 didn't float your boat - it may just make you reevaluate the whole thing.And now a line from vol 1: ""It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.""There's the sequel, right there.

"Great moments, but so much gabbing...","Basically Quentin Tarantino is the Jimmy Page of our day. Page was a great musician and Led Zeppelin made some great songs, but that doesn't mean I have to praise his 30 minute 'Dazed and Confused' guitar solo. In a similar vein, it is not an insult to Tarantino's skills to say that Kill Bill 2 is about 30 minutes too long. There is genius to be found, but unfortunately this is one of those 'Dazed and Confused' moments where QT's self indulgence is trying the patience of fans such as myself.I could easily name 3-4 scenes that could be removed or shortened considerably -- scenes that added almost nothing to the story and served only to slow the pace of the film. The film itself might have been a dreadful bore if not for a sensationally choreographed showdown between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the Bride (Uma). The scenes of Uma's kung-fu training were equally entertaining and were beautifully integrated into the story as a whole.Too many times, though, we are forced to sit through another one of Tarantino's signature 'Royale with Cheese' moments: meandering conversations about trivialities that are meant to draw out the tension by delaying the action scenes. Well, the technique is starting to feel like a schtick and just doesn't work so easily for me anymore.I am disappointed, because within 220 minutes that make up Kill Bill 1 & 2 are two sensational 88 minute films that coupled together would represent a great moment in stylish moviemaking. As it stands now, though, we have Tarantino standing on stage playing his triple necked guitar with a violin bow -- we are mightily impressed Tarantino, but just so you know, you had me already with the double necked guitar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Different than Vol.1, but still Tarantino","I must say that where Vol. 1 pumped me up with it's fast paced homage to bloody decapitating action, Vol. 2 had a whole other vibe similar to that of the Pulp Fiction flavor. I read a review where the critic complained that Vol. 2 is not as good as Vol. 1 and that it's simply Tarantino being ""self indulgent"". I disagree. I don't believe that audiences will be getting a film that out-does the first. However, what they will be getting is a whole other movie, which stands on it's own. While Vol 1. was shocking, Vol. 2 is more sultry and bitter sweet. Where Vol. 1 started you off with the champion of all catfights, Vol. 2 starts you off with a drawn out dramatic scene which builds the tension to a crescendo. You get a truthful look of the girl inside the badass warrior, as well as the man who loved her so much, he had to put a bullet in her head. Although, I was disappointed that the long awaited showdown with the title character was more talk than swordplay. It would have been even more disappointing if Tarantino would have simply created a carbon copy, ""more of the same"" from the first installment. And when it comes to talk, Tarantino is the the master. His collaboration with David Caradine in the creation of the ""Bill"" character is one of the greatest of all time. Bill is charming, using subtle tricks and tactics to derail the Bride's rampage of revenge. Tarantino stretches his directing muscle by holding back some of his old techniques and using new ones to give you an original film and not just a sequel. Uma Thurman gives the acting performance of her career, worthy of the Oscar she was nominated for in Pulp Fiction. David Caradine is better than ever, and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen give much stronger performances than was ever expected from them. Honorable mention to Gordon Liu as Master Pai Mei.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"More Depth, Less Action, But Still Thrilling","The second part of Kill Bill is quite different from the first: less frantic action, more dialogues, drama, and character development. While the first film was a pure blood-soaked samurai-style revenge flick, this one adds depth to the Bride's story and motivations.I enjoyed this volume more than the first because of its stronger focus on characters. We get to see more of Beatrix Kiddo's past, her relationship with Bill, and the reasons behind her vengeful quest. The dialogues feel more meaningful, and the tension builds in a more deliberate way. The final confrontation with Bill is especially striking-not just a fight, but a deeply emotional showdown.However, the film has its downsides. The pacing slows down in parts, especially when compared to the high-energy first installment. Some may miss Tarantino's signature over-the-top action, as this sequel leans more on storytelling than spectacle. But as a whole, it provides a strong and fitting conclusion to the story.In the end, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a worthy continuation that brings more emotional weight to the saga. Not perfect, but its depth and atmosphere make it stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Miserably dull, hopelessly bad taste...grow up Quentin!","I suppose that with rewrites from an actual writer, this material may have congrued into a cohesive and useful story -- blending action and drama; however the two have been crudely separated, with the first film stuffing reels of comic book fake action play, and this second film little more than insipid, manipulative melodrama that would better find its home on daytime soap.Scene after scene represents an insult to good taste, with children manipulated and threatened by soulless creeps, and vast acts of cheap thrill-kill sadism. A scene from Tarantino's Dusk to Dawn comes to mind, where he plays a psychopath that kills young women: the scene contributes in no way to the plot, the writer simply appears on screen, commits a grotesque act, looks pleased (and aroused) by it. That scene seems to be an accurate summation of Tarantino's muse or the man himself. When unfettered by actual writers, he is given over to gluttonous indulgence of sadism, supposedly as...entertainment?Wrestling Fans Only -- that should have been printed in bright red letters across the movie posters of these silly, callow films. Any adult viewer ought to be insulted. Each scene requests we lower our standards a bit more, accept less, permit more poorly acted, terribly written, implausible drivel. This is below the level of freak show material, below the worst Stephen King horror film.Banal, trite, pedestrian...ridiculous! Do yourself a favour and do something creative...finger puppets, lip-syncing, sleeping, anything...I promise you, you can find something more entertaining and stimulating than this mess. A disgrace.

"Wonderful piece, but it might not be what you expect.","Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second half of an intended full-throttle 4 hour epic, is amazing in its own right. However, viewers may feel surprised when the credits begin to roll, as, despite being aforementioned second half, Vol. 2 is almost entirely different.It's almost hard to believe that Tarantino planned to keep the movie as one piece, especially since the focus of each ""volume"" contrasts greatly. In Vol. 1, the focus was to give enough story to support what was to happen on screen. The focus was action over plot, certainly. Viewers were treated to gorgeous fight scenes (most notably at the House Of Blue Leaves) only knowing the mere basics of the plot. With Vol. 2, the focus has flipped over to character development. We learn more about the Bride's past, as well as the other members of DVAS, and the settings are (seemingly) intentionally more dull in order to allow us to focus on the characters.And nothing is wrong with this, at all. Tarantino has certainly succeeded in giving life to his cast, and the actors (especially Thurman and Carradine) have no trouble portraying their parts. The only flaw, then, is that the movie is just not what the typical Vol. 1 viewer expects. Nevertheless, Vol. 2 is a treat that no fan of Vol. 1 should miss, but don't expect another House Of Blue Leaves.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
What a film!,"You know the story by now and this part two of Tarrantinos Kill Bill Series.I loved this film not quite as much as Volume 1 due to the fact the final chapter with Bill drags on a little too much for my liking.Another great soundtrack,this films oozes cool and stands up there with Pulp Fiction in my view.Micheal Madsen delivers another great performance as does Gordon Liu who plays Pei Mei,possibly my favourite character from Kill Bill.If you have not seen this film,go and see it.......NOW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Well made but I wish it was more like ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".","It's a well made and constructed movie that entertains and again perfectly blends several styles into one unique movieUnfortunately the movie is not as good as ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was a way more entertaining because it was way more crazy mixture of style and because of that also very unpredictable and overwhelming. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" spends more time on the story development and the emotional aspects of it. It perhaps makes ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" a better constructed and build up movie but I still prefer the more entertaining approach of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". In that regard ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" perhaps was a bit disappointing to watch but in this particular case that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" mostly mixed Asian cinema styles, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" mostly uses a Western style. Of course the story alone of taking revenge always has been a popular generic concept for Westerns. The movie also uses some of the genre camera techniques and editing tricks and even adds in some cheesy dialog when two characters are standing across each other, ready to kill. Quentin Tarantino obviously did his homework again but what can I say, Western just isn't my favorite genre. Its style also makes the movie slow at times, so please don't expect another over-the-top going, non-stop spectacular, visual, gory, action spectacle that ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. Of course ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" also still features lots- and over-the-top action but it just didn't impressed as much, due to the different style and approach.The movie features some great acting and dialog. Yes, this movie does feature some great typical Tarantino's dialog at times. Something I really missed in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". Also the movie as whole, in terms of its style and build up, is perhaps more 'Tarantino-like' than ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. The story, again, is for part told non-linear and this time that style works out fully, unlike in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" sometimes wasn't the case.David Carradine is really superb as Bill! What a comeback for an actor! The same goes for Daryl Hannah by the way, lets please not forget her. David Carradine really steals the show in the movie and at times he even puts the main character, played by Uma Thurman, in the shadow. Also Michael Madsen was great and so was Sid Haig in a small but amusing role. The Samuel L. Jackson was also one of the highlights of the movie.The movie is amazingly good looking and has a good visual style, also with the help of Robert Richardson's cinematography, obviously. Tarantino again successfully succeeds at mixing several styles of film-making into one unique great movie, with an own great one of a kind identity. Mission accomplished Mr. Tarantino!There isn't as much blood spilled in this movie but yet the action does not disappoint. Like I said before, the emphasis of this movie is more put on its story and characters, rather than its action but still the action works out greatly in the movie. The movie features some highly memorable action sequences and also the ending does not disappoint.A really great and unique movie, that could had been more entertaining and perhaps also better, had it been made more in the style of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Excellent movie, but nothing like the first one","This movie was fantastic.  However, for those of you who were only into the first one for the adrenaline rush, you may want to rethink seeing the movie. I myself loved this movie; it was perfect in every way that I can think of. However, there are about three fight scenes throughout the whole movie, and the death count in this movie will surely surprise most people.  Also, the backstories of the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination squad aren't as fleshed out as O-Ren Ishii's, which was a slight disappointment, but they're implied well enough.  This second film is more about the emotions of the Bride than her ability to kick ass, and it is more a drama than an action film.  Thankfully, Tarantino knows how to make all sorts of great movies.  This one is extremely well done, and I urge you all to see it.  Just don't expect a crapload of action in this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Awful,"I wasn't too impressed with the first half of Kill Bill but at least I managed to watch it right through.  After 40 minutes of Kill Bill 2 I left the cinema, it really is that bad. .Every scene dragged, this movie is padded to fill the running time.  What was the point of Michael Madsens character visiting his workplace? That dull scene took up about 10 minutes and the only thing it accomplished was showing Madsen get laid off for the next 4 days..but at the end of the day this movie is directed by Tarantino, so I'll go with the trend and award it 10/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Gargantuan.,"In terms of conflicting emotions regarding the audiences reactions to certain characters, Tarantino has once and for all given us the mess with our minds that we deserve. 'Insomnia' had a cop whom killed his partner and covered it up, but we know that through it all, I couldn't have gone any other way. Kill Bill Vol 1 had a back story to cold killer O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) told in Anime, one of the most expressive mediums and actually gave the character a sympathy. Vernita Green's (Vivica A Fox) daughter (who will undoubtedly come back later) watches as the bride kills her mother. In Volume 2, the sympathy and emotion for the bad characters are heightened and the one man whom you thought you would hate the most of the five on the dead list becomes one of the most sympathetic, charming characters of the film, despite what he did at the El Paso chapel not four years ago.David Carradine plays Bill with menace and charm, a combination that doesn't always work with todays ineffective and forgettable villains. Having said that, the title's payoff did come out a little flat and empty. Maybe Tarantino was trying to relate how revenge is not always sweet and convey the emptiness The Bride must have felt subsequently. If that's the case, he succeeded. If his goal was simply ""to kick ass"", it was flat. Budd, Bill's brother, is just trying to make buck or two, but, as he so rightly states, they all deserve to die. Elle driver is the only one who is all bad. A bitch to the end. We never thought the mermaid from splash was capable of it. Hats off to Daryl Hannah.One of the greatest things about volume 2 is a welcome back for the Tarantino dialogue and some of the most luscious cinematography ever seen on film. He states himself that its a departure, he admits to homage, never to plagiarism. Those of you with an open mind will agree with him. How many times has a film style or genre, even story, been recycled and recycled and no-one bats an eyelid. Gus Van Sant remade Psycho shot for shot from the same script and no one said a word, but you put down Tarantino for imaginative and frankly incredible use of his movie influences? I've had my rant, and Tarantino is in no way overrated. These two films are one big masterpiece and should be treated as such and, if possible, should be taken together.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
liked vol I? get excited...didn't see it? rent it and see what it's all about..,"If you like the first one, then I don't really have to convince you, these two movies are a one-TWO, and they saved the best for last, that is if you have the ability to leave some of the reality at the door. I'm not saying they are stretch to the extent of ""The Matrix"" or anything like that, but they are dont creatively to give a new spin on things old. What movie with a killing in it wasn't based upon revenge? But how many of those movies are as innovative and while some say ""that's stupid and unrealistic"", well that's the point, you kill someone you go to jail in real life...it's a movie.... But back to the main point, if you didn't I commented on the first volume which recieved fair marks on here as well, but I think before you see the second that this second installment could not possibly be as good. Its defintely visually pleasing, and the sound is great (both effects and music). Along with that, it plays off some of the things in the first movie but gives the (note the quotes for modesty)""saga"" more depth..ie the chapel massacre. In any case, I loved it and I think that I liked it more than the first one. To be fair I am biased and ran out and bought the first one; so, I suggest, rent the first volume, if you can't buy into it then dont waste your time on the second. However, if you liked it in the least, get excited for volume two because it is just a great ending to the story. Also, I have to note, I was incredibly impressed with the actor's, whose name I'm not sure of now, performance. I think that Uma Thurman was a good cast for the main role, but the casting of Bill's part couldn't have been better. At any rate, I hope that even though I didn't elaborate much on the plot, the fact that I am so excited about this movies gets SOME people out and turned on to the ""Kill Bill"" stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Entertaining, and completes the story","Highlights:Completes the story and fills out the characters.Uma Thurman is perfect in the lead role. The scenes where she's training under the old master, Pai Mei (Gordon Parks) are fantastic.The buried alive scene is horrifying and iconic.The black mamba and ensuing fight between Daryl Hannah (Elle) and Thurman is also very satisfying.The fish out of water analogy for life/death, and the comments about Superman/Clark Kent during an otherwise slow scene. It's an action film but Tarantino occasionally sprinkles in some wonderful bits of dialogue or monologue.As usual with Tarantino, the homage to these genres and the sheer joy of filmgoing really comes through.Lowlights:David Carradine as Bill. Far too old at 68, lisping through his dialogue-heavy scenes, and not nearly strong and menacing enough. The final chapter was pretty tepid.Pacing was too slow, particularly early and late (starting with the weak scene with the pimp). It seems the right balance was not found between the two films, and it would have been much better tightened up and a single film, 2.5 to 3 hours long.The two instances in this volume (to go with one in the first) of female characters intent on killing one another and immediately stopping because a child is present (in one case, in utero) gets a little ridiculous. After being shot in the face, raped over years in a hospital, sliced up and shot some more, buried alive, etc she's going to stop to make sandwiches and cuddle? It's an homage to strong women characters who can also be mothers which is great, but these bits ring false, culminating in that ultra-cheesy last line about the lioness rejoining her cub.Still though, despite all my gripes, it's a very fun film. Tarantino sets the bar higher with everything he puts into his films, and sometimes it's easy to forget that in critiquing them. While we can see where this one is going, we really have no idea what he's going to put on the screen next, and he's always entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
True Super Woman,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" completes the 2 volume set that began last fall, and it is simply an amazing accomplishment. The movie is stunning, and is complete onto itself unlike for example, the individual Lord of the Rings movies. One need not have seen Vol. 1 to be enthralled by Vol. 2. Tarantino is a master of context. Vol. 2 even surpasses Vol. 1, largely because this movie is more story driven. Tarantino's screenplay (along with the credited Uma Thurman) breathes life into the characters of The Bride (Uma Thurman), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), especially Bill (wonderfully played by David Caradine), and clarifies the juxtaposed plot thread. The dialog has the signature Tarantino crisp, quirky, whacked sensibility. In Vol. 2 Uma Thurman emerges as a powerful and commanding screen presence, a true movie star, and a gifted actor. Tarantino provided the foundation of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", and Thurman gives it it's soul.When last we left off, the unnamed Bride killed off 2 members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Yes, she had left a trail of blood and body parts in the aftermath. Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) remain on her list before she kills Bill. Turns out that The Bride has a name that was actually revealed in Vol. 1-- left here unsaid. Also from Vol.1 we know that The Bride's child lives, and that Bill was named the father. So The Bride's path for revenge is no longer a straight line.First on her list is Budd, who is Bill's brother. Somehow during their encounter, The Bride ends up buried alive. But this is merely a vehicle for Tarantino's storytelling genius. The Bride recalls her training with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (a truly excellent Gordon Liu). Using humor and amazing kung fu technique, he reveals an axiom of mastery in the martial arts: First, one has to cop to the fact that he or she knows nothing. Secondly, whatever one already knows really means jack. Brilliant.Though Vol. 2 relies more on narrative and dialog, the action and fighting sequences are breathtaking. They are all brutal, though there is a distinct elegance inherent to them. The training sequences with Pai Mei and The Bride are visually stunning. The battle between Elle Driver and The Bride is captivating with a sense of style and humor (Driver is unable to draw her samurai sword, because they are fighting in a low ceiling trailer home). Daryl Hannah is smart, sexy, deadly, and totally hot. She is perfect as Elle. Both she and Thurman trained intensely to do what they did on screen.David Caradine is awesome as Bill. He is slick, cool, and flaunts this arrogant air of enlightenment. He has a classic scene with Tarantino's dialog, regarding his fascination of Super Heroes, particularly with Superman. According to Bill, Superman wakes up in the morning knowing that he is Superman-- his alter ego is Clark Kent who is weak. Bill's point is that The Bride is a natural born killer, and everything else is pretense. This punctuates that The Bride even in her singular mission of vengeance, is a hero. This is an acknowledgment of Uma Thurman's performance. Her Bride is so strong of sheer will and spirit, and at the same time she dismisses some of her humanity because it clouds her focus-- to kill Bill. Thurman is that rare combination of beauty, intelligence, power, grace, and vulnerability. Her performance as The Bride is like the perfect haiku-- it's poetry.""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is the best movie of the year, thus far. Tarantino is a master storyteller. Uma Thurman has become a powerful and completely captivating movie presence. She should continue to take on commanding movie roles. Vol. 2 is an awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Even Better Than The First,"I first saw this one on its opening day, April 16, 2004, just as I had seen Volume One on its opening day, six months earlier. The night before I saw it I refreshed my memory by viewing the first film and I was glad that I did. Both movies really should be viewed as one single film because of how much you miss if you see just one of them. However, I will say that each movie can also stand on its own as a great film.I'll begin by saying that I enjoyed this one just a little bit more than the first. I think that has a lot to do with David Carradine. Quentin Tarantino has a knack for bringing fading stars back from obscurity and he did it again with this great actor. Carradine plays the title character and brings Bill to life so much so that you kind of find yourself a little worried about the fact that our protagonist might actually end up killing him as the title suggests.Speaking of our hero, Uma Thurman delivers yet another powerful performance as ""The Bride,"" a former assassin hell bent on getting revenge for what her former ""co-workers"" did to her on her wedding day. This chapter in the two volume series continues with The Bride's journey and leads up to a fantastic climax that only Tarantino, the best director of today's generation, could bring you.That's not all! There's even a cat fight that may go down in history as the best one ever captured on film. As one of the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad on The Bride's hit list, Daryl Hannah squares off against Uma Thurman in one of the tiniest spaces to hold a fight scene, a trailer home.Even Michael Madsen gets in on the action! As Bill's brother, Budd, Madsen plays one of the more sympathetic roles of his career, even though he's a cold blooded bastard. His character becomes very developed and we see what we saw only a glimmer of during the Vivica A. Fox sequence in the first: someone like us. We all know that Madsen is just another bad guy, but he shows us that those ""bad guys"" are just regular people trying to live in a world that doesn't want them.Of course, we can't forget about Pai Mei. The most fearsome martial arts expert is played superbly in this film by Gordon Liu. Although he speaks only Mandarin in the film, his intimidating looks and fiery delivery give us another great supporting performance in a movie that I'll stay with any time I happen to catch it on television. I'm sure that you would do the same.Yes, this film is a bloody good conclusion to the Kill Bill saga and, if you've seen the first, you definitely need to see this one to find out what happens and how it goes down. I recommend this to anyone and everyone because it's one of the best films of this decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
If Your Into Polar Ends of a Movie...,"This movie is not on par at all with the action of the first one, so if your in it for the gore and decapitated heads-- save yourself the money. However, if your interested in the actual feelings of the characters, this provides plenty more. Overall though, as a story on its own, I'd say this isn't anything remarkable, and I think if it is incredibly acclaimed it's because of Tarantino's acclaim. Ultimately though, if you buy both the DVDs, I think being able to watch polar ends of a movie from the absence of conscience to the desperation at motherhood-- it is a pleasant thing to watch. But once again, even in that way, I'd say this is a pretty good movie, just nothing awe-inspiring, like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.

Excellent yet lacking,"I liked Vol 2 a lot.  While I was watching it in the theater I felt that I liked the second more than the first.  But now that I look back I don't like one more than the other.  I like the first one for the fight scenes, and the second one for the wonderful plot, the story was so great.  The only bit that was lacking was the fighting.  I was expecting elaborate grand finale sword fighting scenes; instead of Fire Works I was awarded with a Flash in the Pan.  The bride simply killed or disabled her opponents to fast.  I do believe that I liked the sound track to Vol 2 better.  I really enjoyed the back story of her training with Pai Mei.  I wouldn't have minded seeing even more of her training with her master.  Of course there was a purpose for it and QT had to keep the movie going.  Overall quite good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A fitting end to Tarantinos revenge saga,"While the decision to split Kill Bill, originally intended as a three-hour epic tale of revenge, into two separate movies was greeted by fans with accusations of greed. Whether this is true or whether the full version of Quentin Tarantino's homage to 70's exploitation was simply too much to consume in one sitting, it actually turns out to be a masterstroke. Volumes 1 and 2 incorporate two vastly different styles, both of which allow Tarantino to fully indulge his love for kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns with ample time and care. These are two different movies, never forgetting that the character linking them together is Uma Thurman's determined The Bride.Having dispatched O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in the first film, we first meet The Bride as she drives to her final target - Bill (David Carradine). To even consider this a spoiler would be failing to grasp the movies Tarantino is tipping his hat to, and the director makes a point of this by constantly shifting around the time-line. It's not so much about if she'll achieve her goal, but just how cool it will be when she does. Bill remained off screen for the bulk of Volume 1, seen either stroking his samurai sword and talking menacingly off-camera, but we meet him in his full glory almost instantly in Volume 2, as we are shown an extended version of the events that left The Bride shot in the head and left for dead.First though, she must face Budd (Michael Madsen) and the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Budd is a tough, hard-drinking redneck working as a bouncer when he's not clumsily making margaritas in his trailer, and he is given a generous amount of screen-time and isn't let down by Madsen's gravelly performance. Similar to Tarantino's early films Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), Budd's story is given a patient build-up before the burst of inevitable violence, portraying him as a beaten man awaiting his death at the hands of the woman he knows is coming for him. Just when his fate seems sealed, Tarantino slaps us in the face and turns his protagonists fortunes on their head, allowing for some down-time as we flash-back to The Bride's training with the formidable Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).Pai Mei's chapter is the entire saga's crowning achievement, full of ridiculous crash-zooms and beard stroking that manages to poke fun at the genre, while at the same time warmly embracing and even transcending it. This leads The Bride to her face-off with Elle, which is a scene of such ferocity, humour and sheer bad-assery that it more than makes up for the creeping pace. As Bill, Carradine is a revelation, with Tarantino once again pulling an iconic actor out of obscurity to riff on the type of role they became famous for in the first place to deliver the performance of their career. An early version of the script had The Bride and Bill duelling to a sunset backdrop, but the low-key scrap opted for instead seems more fitting. Towards the climax, it seems that Tarantino is struggling with how to end his epic tale of revenge, but some minor bumps don't derail what is undoubtedly the most Tarantino-y of his catalogue, and certainly his most all-out fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

And hey, if I don't see 10 better films this year, this will be the top of my 2004 list.Kill Bill: Vol 2 concludes the tale of The Bride, and it does it with wonderful style.  Though it seems a little different than the first film, without all the blood soaked action and multiple killings, it answers all the questions the first film raises.

However, at this stage I confess I prefer part one a little more.Part two is different, quite different. It slows down a lot, it hangs on the characters. A great idea in theory, but not in delivery. Tarantino seems a little too much in love with himself and his characters, so he lingers on them a fraction too long for comfort. when the actions comes (the Elle Driver fight scene), boy does it come.Those expecting more of what volume one promised may be disappointed, and most will find the dialogue a little nerdy and uninteresting, but nevertheless it's a very strong movie, and without doubt worth repeated viewings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Weaker of the two and one of Tarantino's worst films,"When I saw this in the theaters, I really disliked it. I was expecting something on the level of Vol 1, but instead got a self-indulgent, talky with a little bit of action. There was really only one good fight scene, and that was between Elle Driver and The Bride.
I decided to give it another viewing with the blu ray version, but I found myself fast-forwarding a lot of it instead.
I liked the homage to old kung fu films with the Pai Mei training sequence, but I didn't care for how the sequence was filmed. I also didn't like how Elle Driver was able to kill him so easily. Come on!
Another part of the movie that bothered me was the whole Bud sequence. First of all, it made the movie drag. Secondly, The Bride acts completely out of character. I mean, she's supposed to be the best assassin, already killed two (included dozens of highly trained fighters in Japan) and yet she insisted on running through Bud's trailer's front door?!! Why did she hide underneath it, she could have just broken in and waited for him inside. None of that made sense. Strangely, the Bride never says a single word to Bud in the film. She spits and moans, that's it.
Bill's dialogue was so dull. Stop making old soul song references! We get it Tarantino, in the geeky fan-boy voice you give every character, you like R&B and kung fu. Speaking of music, the musical cues in this film were also out of place. Many just didn't fit their scenes.
By the end of the film, you didn't care if The Bride found her daughter, or had her name Beatrix revealed, or if she even Killed Bill.
Overall, a dull entry into Tarantino's filmography, and the weaker of the two parts.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. Bravo! Don't miss it!,"I've been an admirer of Tarantino ever since I walked into a cinema over ten years ago and watched 'Reservoir Dogs', not even knowing the guys name. 'Pulp Fiction' turned me from an admirer to a fan, and 'Jackie Brown' (still a most underrated movie) just made me appreciate his talent even more. To say I was eagerly anticipating his next movie is putting it mildly. But I was also ready to pick it to pieces. I'm no one-eyed fanboy. If 'Kill Bill: Vol.1' sucked I'd be the first to admit it. However it not only didn't suck, it blew my mind. I can't think of any other movie that has combined genres in such a dazzling way. Only Takashi Miike comes close, but in a different way. Tarantino adores trash movies and his enthusiasm came through in every frame. It was this excitement and lack of playing safe that really impressed me. He made the movie HE wanted to make regardless of whether a mass audience would ""get it"". If 'Vol.2' had been more of the same and nothing more I would have been well pleased, but once again Tarantino has topped himself. Part two is less action orientated and cartoon-like the first, and has more character development, and yes, genuine emotion. Sure there are still lots of fun moments (especially the tongue in cheek sequence featuring Gordon Liu as Pai Mei) and exciting fights, but the scenes between The Bride and Bill have surprising depth for what many regard as ""just"" the ultimate popcorn movie. Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. The casting is virtually flawless. Much like the Tarantino scripted 'True Romance' several actors get the opportunity to shine in supporting roles. Michael Madsen's confrontation with The Bride is one of the most memorable parts of the movie, and he and Daryl Hannah also share an unforgettable scene. Martial arts legend Gordon Liu, already mentioned, is an absolute hoot. Michael Parks, who played a Texas Ranger in Part 1 reappears as a completely different character, the sinister but charming Esteban Vihaio. Seventies favourite Bo Svenson has a nice bit as a Reverend, and Samuel L. Jackson is great as his organist. And it was really cool to see Jack Hill veteran Sid Haig's cameo as Jay the Bartender. All these actors help to make 'Kill Bill: Vol 2' a special treat, but the stand out performance is by David Carradine. Carradine has had an amazing career, but much like Dennis Hopper his appearances in dozens of b-grade action movies and mediocre straight-to-video dramas has made most film fans forget just how good he can be when given superior material to work with. Carradine has made over 140 movies and worked with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Roger Corman, Hal Ashby, Ingmar Bergman, Larry Cohen, Robert Altman, Walter Hill, Paul Bartel and yes, Fred Olen Ray, William Shatner and Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson. Hopefully his work in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' will get him the attention he so richly deserves. The guy is a living legend people! Look, I'm a cynical old coot and spend most of my time whining about how poor most movies are these days, so it really REALLY warms my heart when something this damn good comes along! Bravo!

9 out of 10;  in this case 1>2,"I found the last part of the film with Bill and Little Kiddo to be weak and somewhat trite, not up to Tarantino standards. Otherwise it was almost measured up to the superlative level of excellence set in Vol. 1. If anything could be added, I would like to have seen a flashback on the story of Brother Budd, a most interesting piece of human debris. Kudos on the fitting end of Ms Driver and her one remaining eye thus avenging the murder of Pei Mei. Tarantino is master artist without peer in the use of blood and gore as the media of choice. Hmmmmmm, gore!That's all I really have to say, but teacher requires at least 10 lines. This harkens back to high school and freshman year of college where one criterion for the measurement of the quality of work was quantity. So now I have 10 lines.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best movie of all time,"I consider Kill Bill 1 and 2 one movie and this movie is the best movie of all time hands down.  Tarantino is simply brilliant with every aspect of this movie.  I feel I owe him more money watching these films, the regular admission price is not enough to charge for a piece of art like this. The whole movie was perfectly cast and the storyline was orchestrated with surgeon like precision. When she was in the coffin how many of you thought ""How is she going to get out of this?"" then they cut perfectly to her training and it all made sense. When she finally got to Bill you almost have this feeling they may actually get back together. I've seen thousands of movies in my life and this is at the top of my list, until the tarantino movie comes out. Please Quentin, make movies more often, i need your movies!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Sentimental violence,"Well first you must take for granted that The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a superwoman that can survive injuries that would kill the strongest mortal in this earth. This second part has a much less poetic atmosphere than the first one and less ballet-like fighting scenes and dwells more upon the psychological displays of the characters which culminate in the final scenes where sentiment and emotion prevail over violence though the latter is always present more or less intensely. In this movie you'll find the full explanation of what looked like a flaw of the first movie: the motive behind the killing of all the people at the wedding rehearsal and a quite plausible one. Well these killers may have sentiments too, who knows? Negative or positive of course. Anyway the love-hate relationship that exists between the two main characters is depicted with real strength and a certain contained emotion well displayed by Thurman and Carradine, emotion that explodes in the very last scene played by Thurman. It's a good movie of its kind (of course) after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino's worst = still a decent movie,"I am reviewing both the volume one and volume two with this review as Kill Bill was meant to be a one 4 hour long movie. So when I give it a 6 out of 10, I am judging both the volumes as a whole. First I will say that I am one of Tarantino's biggest fans, I watched all his movies, I look for Tarantino's interviews online, etc. I think Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, as is Pulp Fiction, as is Reservoir dogs. But Jackie Brown was met with mixed reviews, some fans thought the movie was too mild for Tarantino, some were disappointed. This most likely hurt Tarantino on a personal level, ergo after a long pause from movie making he delivers the Kill Bill(s), the most childish of all his works. That is right, no question that Tarantino enjoyed himself making the movies, and no question that he made what he wanted to make. But, I have a feeling he decided to bend over to the masses with this one. Everything to please. And the masses loved it, I loved it (when I was 16). Kill Bill is still a decent movie, and if someone else made it I'd have given it 7, 8 or 9. But Tarantino can do better, he should do better. Luckily, he made Inglorious basterds which carried a true message in it, delivered with skill of an artist. Now he is making Django unchained, a controversial movie that may break his career. That is what the artist has to do if he wants to call himself an artist. To conclude with what I think Kill Bill is about. It is Tarantino's fantasy of what it would be like if the Blondie was a female in a relationship with Lee van Cleef working together in a band of assassins. Pretty infantile. There is a deeper theme of how revenge is a sin, and who has the right to decide who lives or dies, and who is really clean and good (no one) and who is evil. But I think he did this theme better in his other works. I think the movie that inspired Tarantino, Death rides a horse, is a better movie than Kill Bill. Tarantino is a genius, I love him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Should Have Been One Movie,"I just watched Kill Bill Vol 2There are too many scenes in this film that damage the pacing. It feels very bloated at times. Rather than flowing smoothly, it lurches from point-to-point, giving screen time to secondary characters who are neither colorful enough nor intriguing enough to warrant it. This is the case of a director having fallen too much in love with his material. The result is that much of Volume 2, for all of its strengths, is self-indulgent. About 50% of the movie is used to provide backstory.That's the bad news. The good news is that, despite its flaws, it's still a good movie. There's much less action, a lot more talking (Although much of the dialogue isn't vintage Tarantino, except a scene like Bill's ""Superman"" monologue), and a legitimate effort to build the characters.Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it.Tonally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Hopefully, Tarantino's original, single-movie cut of Kill Bill will eventually be available on DVD. With the two parts re-knitted and much of the extraneous material removed, this could be a great motion picture, right up there with Pulp Fiction. As it currently stands, Kill Bill is a victim of its director's ego and its distributor's greed. The moments of greatness make it worth seeing, and there's certainly plenty of entertainment to be found here, but it's hard not to lament what might have beenKill Bill Volume 2 grossed $66 million dollars (against a $40 million dollar budget) at the domestic box office.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino at his... worst?,"Considering how much i enjoy tarantino films... including Kill Bill vol. 1 - i was so very much looking forward to the release of vol. 2. Little did i realise that when Kill Bill was cut up into 2 volumes.... that it was literally cut up into 2 volumes. The first which offered a rich textured, comical and action packed experience was followed up with a 2nd half which is meant to be perhaps thought provoking.However it isnt pulled off well. Tarantino's ironic portrayal of the first movie is taken to a really bad extreme in the second film where not a lot happens, and then the film is wrapped up in about 10 minutes when Bill is confronted at last - and then dies in a matter of seconds with no sword fight, but instead a rediculous sequence of gestures....If you havent seen the film yet and are reading this review... you may probably think *wtf?* - well thats exactly what i thought when i saw the film. A gross disappointment considering the writer and the prequel.Thumbs Down",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"For me, Vol. 1 is the better of the two, but Vol 2. wraps it all up nicely for us.","Vol. 2, Tarantino's fifth film, follows Uma Thurman's ass-kicking Bride on her revenge mission. Two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are down, two (and Bill) to go. Where Vol. 1 was a homage to Asian cinema, Vol. 2 is one to western films of old. Character story is chosen above the action this time, as 'The Bride', gets closer to who main target. Uma Thurman is outstanding. Routing for her until the very end is no issue, no matter the cost or the conclusion. Vol. 2 wraps up this very thick plot ('and so the plot thickens', says Bill) beautifully. It's not easy for The Bride. The harder it is for, the better it is for our viewing pleasure. Tarantino is hit his peak, slapping us in the face with slick music, quick edits and less dialogue than what we're use to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A TAD DISAPPOINTING...,"Well I just got back from the multiplex, and let me tell you, KILL BILL VOL. 2 IS NOT WHAT MOST VIEWERS ARE GOING TO EXPECT. The only review of Vol. 2 I had read before watching the movie myself was Rolling Stone's Peter Travers's take on things. I have to say that Mr. Travers was more than a little misleading, but that is besides the point (He gave it a 4 out of a 4).The movie begins well enough, with Uma Therman speaking directly to the camera courtesy of cheesy '40s fare. Then The Bride provides backstory on her wedding, her training, and a little on her relationship with Bill. Keep in mind all of this is intercut with the encounters between The Bride and Budd, and The Bride and Elle Driver (We even find out how she lost that eye). The switching up of present and past maintains the fast pace of Vol. 1, while providing indepth insight into The Bride, something new in Vol. 2. ALTOGETHER THE FIRST HOUR IS SOME GREAT FILMMAKING.Unfortunately, it is this newfound appreciation for emotional insight that ends up being the film's worst flaw; THE SECOND HOUR OF THE FILM IS DOMINATED BY TALKING. Not that talking is bad or unnecessary for movies, but the energy of the Vol. 1 is all but lost during some of the particularly grating scenes. Granted there is the final showdown between Bill and Uma, but this is preceded by possibly the most degrading showing from Tarantino yet. And what I mean by that is this (And don't infer that I don't respect Quentin Tarantino, because I do), conversation after conversation, MORE AND MORE IS SPELLED OUT for us. Not in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, but in an actual question and answer session between the film's two key players. I found this to be insulting to my intelligence, and anyone else's for that matter. If you payed any attention to Vol. 1 the whole scene is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE and LABORIOUS TO WATCH.-i have to pause for a second-After reading what I've written I see that I'M PAINTING AN OVERLY NEGATIVE PICTURE of Kill Bill Vol. 2. I suppose I'm still frustrated that I already bought Vol. 1 on DVD, expecting Vol. 2 to surpass the first and tie everything together. And IF VOL. 2 REALLY TRIES TO DO ONE THING, THAT WOULD BE COMPLETING THE PICTURE. But I must reiterate that that is exactly my problem with this movie, IT STOPS MOVING FORWARD TO PICK UP WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND, AND TAKES ITS TIME DOING SO (And even still one important question is never answered. Why does Hatori Hanzo not like Bill? What drives him to make the sword?).I say: Kill Bill Vol. 1 - 9/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 - 7/10 Kill Bill (Whole)- 8/10A two-part to remember, possibly more for its stylistic prowess than anything else, but nothing to live by. A combined release with intermission might have helped. I do realize that isn't very practicle (Look how the Lord of the Rings movies did though, despite length).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Wow.,"If you're a fan of Superman, than you'll enjoy this movie. I, myself, being a fan of Superman, really enjoyed Bill's speech on his favorite comic book character, Superman. The plot to this movie is always changing, up to the end. It'll leave you wanting more. Luckily Quentin Tarantino is still going to be directing, ""Hero"". This movie has the greatest possible actors for the parts, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, and the three hours you sit there will go by so quick that it'll feel like maybe fifteen minutes at most. I'd give this movie 5 and a half stars and would suggest that everyone go see it. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director's of our age.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The difference between two films...,"There's a point in Volume 2, where The Bride/Black-Mamba/Uma Thurman is shot in the chest with a shotgun.  She flies back a few feet and hits the ground.  What happens next is unbelievable- nothing.  Blood doesn't fly 12 feet into the air.  But isn't this Kill Bill?  Isn't it the second Volume of Tarantino's blood saga of vengeance.  Yes it is, but then again- No it isn't.I don't know.  Maybe if it was somebody else- blood would have shot up. But nowhere in Vol. 2 do those annoying bursts make an appearance.The two films are so different that nothing I read could prepare me for how Vol. 2 would flow.  Considering I didn't like Vol. 1, this was very good for me.  Considering some did... well, this will test their loyalty to Tarantino- or just the KILL BILL saga in general.Looking back on Vol. 1 I can easy pinpoint many things I didn't like: The over-the-top-sickening anime sequence, the lack of depth, the lack of story, the lack of development, the lack of sanity... I could go on (you know I could)On Vol. 2, however, there is almost nothing I can say I didn't like. Anime- none. Depth- it's like the deep end of a swimming pool.  Story- told with massive heart. Development- so much it would sicken anyone who loved the first just for bloodshed.  Sanity- WELL, this IS a Tarantino film (Luckily, because Vol.1- well, its not a film if it doesn't take itself seriously, is it?)Thurman and Carradine who play The Bride and Bill (respectively) are unbelievably good.  Every moment they are on the screen a love-hate feeling just drifts... Their performances flesh out the characters who were empty in Vol. 1.  And, the fact that Tarantino decided to finally write helped.Ultimately Kill Bill ends as a drama, but spins back into Homage for the credits.  For those who stick around for the closing credits- you can see just how much fun Q & U (as they credit themselves) had just by the one outtake.Uma deserves an Oscar nod for this one, and if it's not too much of a stretch, toss one to Carradine for supporting.Before you see Vol. 2, ask yourself- ""Action or Story?""  Which do you prefer?  Because if all you want from Quentin is a bloody-mockery of a film, you might as well stay home and watch Vol. 1.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An Improvement over Vol. 1,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the sequel one year later than the original processor Kill Bill. Being released as two separate parts within a year of each other, Quentin Tarantino understood what he was getting at. Volume 2 in this franchise lays out more of a plot, more in depth and remains more focus than the original. There is more suspense and thrills and it is overall a more entertaining and intriguing watch. Mainly thanks of David Carradine's portrayal as Bill, as he has more screen time and answers are answered more regarding his relationship with The Bride (however her name was revealed).Though what is less than stellar and quite disappointing is the final showdown between the Bride and Bill. We understood the main purpose of the film is the revenge of the Bride against Bill and the build up was all for a chaotic scene between the two, but what is left happening doesn't live up to the hype, as nothing mesmerizing occurs between the two. Though leading up to the final end scenes, occurs key and important scenes involving both the Bride and Bill, and introducing their four year old daughter. This was well done. The bride was also less aggressive and more persistent in Vol. 2 which made her character more likable as we got a better understanding at her backstory. Overall, Vol. 2 had its moments and an improvement over Vol. 1.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Quintessence of Tarantino's Cinematic Prowess,"In the pantheon of Quentin Tarantino's filmography, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" stands as a testament to his storytelling mastery and directorial finesse. Building upon the kinetic energy of its predecessor, this sequel delves deeper into the emotional landscape of its characters, crafting a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally engaging.The film's protagonist, played with an arresting intensity by Uma Thurman, continues her odyssey of vengeance with a poise and depth that surpasses the first volume. The audience is treated to a more intricate exploration of her psyche, which is both a narrative triumph and a character study par excellence.Tarantino's script is a marvel of genre fusion, blending elements of Westerns, martial arts, and noir to create a cinematic tapestry that is rich in texture and complexity. The dialogue crackles with the director's signature wit, each line delivered with precision by a cast that embodies their roles with conviction.The cinematography in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is nothing short of breathtaking, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the storytelling. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the tension to build and the emotional stakes to resonate with the audience.For this reviewer, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" eclipses its predecessor, offering a more satisfying and profound cinematic experience. It is a film that not only entertains but also challenges the viewer, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll. In short, it is a sublime piece of filmmaking that cements Tarantino's status as a modern-day auteur.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
More than what I expected...except for the blood,"To keep this amazingly short, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was much better than what I had expected.  The plot is more developed and the character, Black Mamba is better portrayed as a heroine(vs. just one angry woman)in this episode. Thus, placing abilities of Uma Thurman prominently in the limelight.  As well, the artistic efforts for each frame of the film is notably well thought out; each would make a really cool picture book! However, I was expecting more of a sword fight btw Bill and Beatrix, and more 'squriting blood'!  More so, I thought the end was just too abrupt and it needs more of what I call ""the cool-Tarantino-cheese."" Maybe, simply his style has grown-up? Though this film cannot be viewed as 2 separate entities, I must say, like classics such as the Godfather and the Godfather II, it has surpassed it's predecessor, Vol I, greatly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Everything I expected it to be.,"I must admit, I knew what was going to happen. Like many other impatient viewers, I too had read the screenplay online long before the movie hit the screens. But it did not diminish my movie experience in the least.The camera changes from black-and-white to color to grainy, and back to black-and-white... and back to color. But Tarantino's prolonged and indulgent ode to his influences and pop-culture is driven to a riveting end. From the moment we see the killer turned expectant bride in that chapel, rehearsing for her wedding to a record store employee, to the final scene of the final chapter, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an exhilerating and mostly satisfying cinematic journey.I did find the Budd story a little bit of an unwanted diversion. Instead, Tarantino could have let the casino scene with Bill make it through the final cut (if you don't know what I am talking about, you can read the script online). It would have had more relevance in developing Bill's character, which is of course crucial. But strong performances all around more than make up for this shortcoming.I especially enjoyed the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei. I felt Tarantino succeeded at maintaining the fine balance between edgy humor and over-the-top ridicule in paying homage to Chinese Kung-fu movies, with those sudden facial close-ups, Pai Mei's arrogant laughter, and his repeated stroking of that wispy beard.But to me, the best chapter was easily the final one. I was pleasantly surprised to see how genuine the interaction between father (Bill), mother (Beatrix/Uma) and child (B.B.) looked onscreen. David Carradine, who puts in a strong performance throughout, shines especially in this chapter. In particular, the `goldfish' scene where he recounts how their daughter learned about life and death was captivating and insightful.I give this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"One of the greatest, **** out of ****","After seeing the first Kill Bill, nearly two weeks before the opening of this film, I was anxious to see what magic Quentin Tarantino worked with his sequel.It was absolutely stunning.Although there was less blood and fight scenes, there was more character development. We found out the reason Bill 'killed,' and how the California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) lost her eye. (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, watch the first one, she's the one whistling that eerie song.) We also learn about the Bride's past with Bill.Overall it was a great story, with everything you'd expect in a great film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazing Movie,"I loved this movie and would definitely recommend seeing it- granted, it was much different than the first volume; not as much action, much more dialogue and character development, but equally on par with the first installment. I had read that Quentin Tarentino was going for an East-meets-West combination, and in my opinion, he nailed it.  If you're looking for more of the first installment, then you might not like the second half as much since it's more story than action- I personally thought the second half was just as good as the first, but for different reasons- the acting was amazing and I unlike most movies out in this day and age, I cared about what happened to the characters.  Overall, I loved it and can't wait until it comes out on DVD.In closing, I personally wouldn't base going to see a movie or not going to see a movie on people's reviews- you might view the movie differently and every person has their own personal taste so definitely check it out for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Good, but is it getting old hat?","Kill Bill Vol 2 is the latest in Tarantino's epics, and is very good with it.  As a sequel to last year's very over the top and very violent flick with many throwbacks to martial arts classics, it's often funny but also well put together and watchable elsewhere.However, is it time to ask the question as to whether Tarantino is becoming old hat?  Throughout the film I had an undercurrent going around in my head that this was following what is becoming a set pattern for Tarantino films -- they're becoming a tad manufactured.  As he makes them at significant intervals, this isn't as much of an issue but are his films now becoming over crafted?

Tarantino goes back to what he does best,"Like a good director should, Quentin Tarantino has saved the best for last with Kill Bill Vol. 2. The second film is an emotionally charged finale that will leave you with a smile on your face. Without a doubt, this is Tarantino's finest work especially considering that this is supposed to be one giant film. What he has done is taken everything he loves about cinema and put it all into a gem of a film, and this really comes through in the second volume. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was Tarantino's exercise in making an action movie, Volume. 2 is his Citizen Kane. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and the critics agree that this is one of the best films of 2004.While the first half of Kill Bill was a crazy mesh of violence, the second half is a poetic character-driven opus that truly is a heartfelt piece of filmmaking. With Volume. 2, Tarantino goes back to what he does best, and that is showing interesting characters, who deliver the coolest dialogue around. There isn't near the amount of action that Volume. 1 contained, and that turns out to be the strength of part 2. We are finally allowed to see Bill's character and his relationship with The Bride (Uma Thurman). David Carradine plays Bill with a smoothness that oozes cool and is totally lovable. Bill can be a mean SOB but he has a purpose and thanks to some excellent scenes with he and The Bride, we get to see his side of the story. Let me say that it is not what you think, and if anything you will adore the character. Carradine delivers his lines in his own unique way, much like Christopher Walken does. In one scene, he talks about why his favorite character is Superman just before the big showdown and you can't help but love the guy.Other interesting characters inhabit Volume 2 as well. The coolest member of the Viper Squad, Budd, is a cowpoke that realizes the error of his ways and works as a bouncer doing crap work. Michael Madsen plays him with such an air of humility, that you might feel sorry for the guy. Budd is a modern Charles Bronson as a poster in his trailer home references. Not to give too much away, there is a scene involving Budd and The Bride that will have some feeling very claustrophobic just after a dialogue about a flash light and mace. There is a scene with the one eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) fighting The Bride in very close quarters. This is the best cat fight that will probably ever be seen on film and ends in a shockingly funny way. Be on the lookout for a surprise cameo by a famous Tarantino thesp. Of course The Bride needed training for all of the martial arts, so we get a wonderful flashback sequence of her training with Pei Mei. The training sequence is both hilarious and painful, providing some great glimpses into who The Bride is.Everything surrounding the production of Volume. 2 is top notch. Every chapter is shot with a different film stock, giving each one a different style. Unlike the previous film, Tarantino lets the shots go longer instead of quick cuts, thereby letting us view the characters and events more naturally. Tarantino still uses tricks from his fun bag such as the old fashioned background projections or colored objects in black and white scenes. The music is much more natural and effective in part 2 as well. Robert Rodriguez and his Spanish guitar provide for a cool spaghetti western soundtrack, even Ennio Morricone is used.Tarantino has delivered a very cool flick and the best film of his career. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a moving film that is the culmination of what makes cinema fun. If you weren't a fan of Volume 1, you may want to give 2 a chance as it is a much different film. We are shown the motivations of these characters and reminded why The Bride is doing what she is. When you laugh and almost cry when a character delivers a line, that's good cinema. A film that leaves you with a huge smile on your face should be seen and seen again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The dialogue between David Carradine, (Bill) and Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Michael Madson, (Budd) where done in the true Resevoir Dogs style.  I was pleased to see that Tarantino strayed a bit from the ultra-vivid backgrounds; instead selecting more grass-roots backdrops for the film. It just seemed like more of a Tarantino film than did Volume 1.  I am not saying the the second is superior to the first...rather that the second is more Tarantino than the first.

unique and entertaining,"That quirky Tarantino.  Like his other films, he really puts his eccentricity into this.  In this movie he demonstrates his mastery of manipulation and direction.  One minute I'm laughing, the next I'm sad, then angry, then laughing again.   Sometimes I experienced more than one emotion at a given time.  The story telling is overt and purposefully over the top, playing off of cliches from older genres of film, particularly that of martial arts.I watched vol.1 with my Happa roommate and he confirmed that the action sequences were very reminiscent of the old samurai movies he used to watch, and with lovably hilarious Master Pai Mei in vol.2, there was no doubt of QT's references--no, his enthusiasm for old chinese kung fu films.  In retrospect it makes you think, ""I just watched a samurai duel take place inside of a cramped trailer in the middle of the desert and I accepted every moment of it--to say the least."" Tarantino infuses and integrates the kind of elements that one would otherwise find incredulous; so seamlessly and with such unique prose.  The type of attitude you see in his character interactions makes you chuckle, even amidst the gravity of the situation if you stop to think about it.The second movie is what some would consider slower than the first. Still, I found even the heartless antagonists to have their own sense of charm--adding to the mixed sensations I was speaking of.  Personally, I hardly missed the mindlessly excessive gore found in Vol.1For me, it was a unique, over-the-top, and utterly entertaining film. Very intentional and well composed.  I would recommend both volumes of Kill Bill UNLESS you are squeamish about blood or are completely unable to comprehend any cultural satire presented before you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bang!,"Volume 1 was nifty.  The world and the characters Tarantino set up were intriguing.  The pastiche of genres was darn cool.  The camera work was phenomenal.  The violence got to be a bit much at times (as if T was sitting around, scratching his head and saying: ""where can i make blood spurt out of now?"").  But the coolest things about Vol. 1 were the tantalizing hints of back-story.Volume 2 makes good on the promise of the first, and may actually be the better movie.It's different.  There's not so much screentime devoted to gore.  The style shifts aren't so abrupt.  It's actually more cohesive and more-or-less linear.  The characters are phenomenal, as are the actor who portray them.Above all of this, it's a wonderfully done anti-hero picture.  The moral ambiguity is absolutely delicious.  I think Buddy sums it up best when he says that they deserve to die--but so does she.  So... shrug.  We'll see. As surreal and stylized as the movie is, the characters seem very real and honest, and just weird enough to charm your socks off.Finally, Tarantino deserves some major credit for digging Carradine out of the depths of obscurity for this movie.  If you consider how much of this movie rested on a title character who got very little screentime, you'll see why it was so important that Carradine made the part of Bill his own.Chalk me down as a non-Tarantino-fan who really enjoyed this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
On par with Volume 1?,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the more Tarantino-esc of the Kill Bill movies, with less emphasis on action (although Vol. 2 has my favourite action scene from the 2 movies, that being the trailer fight) and this time I greater focus on his trademark dialogue and character building. While the Bride stole the show in Vol. 1, this time it's Bill who's the standout, with the actor having the perfect balance of charm and creepy that makes you buy his history with the Bride.This movie also has one of my favourite Tarantino moments, which makes one inch punching look like the most badass move ever invented by man!Overall, Vol. 2 acts as a very satisfying conclusion to what Vol. 1 set up, and while it may be slower, it's just as memorable, and just as rewatchable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

All Eyes On Darryl,"I have never seen Splash, nor can I even recall Darryl all that well in her early years.  But mama look at her now.Uma Thurman in the same get up as Elle Driver wouldn't cut it; there aren't a handful of women, not discounting Hollywood actresses that could pull off what Darryl does here.  She is the best villainess we've seen, perhaps ever.Never warmed by Uma, I am a fan of hers now.  She indeed shows us talent we never expected or frankly even demanded.  Usually the most wooden of actresses, she redeems all her career just speaking to us through the windshield of her car as the movie opens.  But she is never as riveting as her co-star; Ms. Hannah is a total showstopper in every frame in which she is visible, and that includes phone calls.This by way of introducing THE FIGHT.  When Uma and Darryl have at it, as we hope they will, all girlfights ever recorded are left in Mohave trailer dust.  Even the superior opening fight of Vol. I pales in comparison to this frenetic kinetic combat.  We've never seen anything like this.And so it goes for all of the film.  Interspersing humor, raw violence and quiet introspective minimalist dialog we get a stew of visual and aural greatness.  Of course this movie is all about style.  Why would you want or expect otherwise from a Tarantino flik?None in the audience spoke, looked at their watch or even wiggled.

"The Man, The Bride, The Flute, The Sword","So it has come to this. From the first eastern-flavored outing of the revenge of the bride, the action moves just a bit to the west to Italy. Having clearly seen one to many Sergio Leone flicks, there's a complete shift in pace and tone in this second volume.The Bride is back, the usage of fake blood was reduced, the plot thickens and so do the characters. They're far more fleshed out this time and I was quite happy to welcome back the quirks and fanboytalk of a ""usual"" Tarantino-Script (> Superman anyone?)But: Does it deliver? Does it all add up? Yes! The fight of Elle and the bride is one of a kind. Beautifully shot, beautifully cut, tough, vicious and violent. The included Flashbacks throughout the film give lots more information on the who, what and why and come the final act, you can't help but care about all the characters. As a whole, Kill Bill offers the essence of all those trash-films, we just love to watch and Tarantino successfully shows his affection in this ultimate homage-movie.

Revenge gets complicated,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has a lot of explaining to do, and it makes sense that it's the Western half of Tarantino's opus. It feels sprawled out, taking its sweet time in getting to The Bride's backstory. Boring? God, no, but the tempo is more leisurely. Less bloody than the first half, this is certainly the more vicious of the two. It's here that we get to see Beatrix's brutal training at the hands of Pai Mei, the love story that develops between herself and Bill, and the even more gruesome hurdles that stand between her and sweet revenge. The big surprise is that it's not all violence; there's a sweetness at the center of all of this.It's not as flashy and exciting as Vol. 1, but it gives substance to her bloodthirst and really does stand as a worthy payoff.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Superfluous. OK, but superfluous.","I enjoyed KBI immensely, despite the square peg in a round hole anime section and some typical Tarantino trademarks I could live without, but I had a feeling that the 'sequel' wouldn't live up to it. Like the Matrix, I was right.From the number of 10/10s this is getting, obviously other people think I'm wrong. But this should never have been a separate film. The amount of plot and action that we're treated to here could have been squeezed into the 40 minutes easily excisable from volume 1. And then we might have been spared some of the crap QT inflicted on us in both volumes (David Carradine's monologue, for instance).Viewing the two in one sitting might improve matters, but that might also highlight the filmmaker's indulgence.I give it 6/10, because I liked the music and the fights, but it's becoming increasingly obvious that QT will never better Pulp Fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Revenge is Sweet!,"Kill Bill: Volume 2 starts off where the first left off as the Bride continues to slowly eliminate all the persons who nearly killed her 5 years before.I thought the first film was pretty good especially with the many different storylines, cinematography and homages to Asian movies. I gotta admit though that this one is not as good as the first part even though this is still a good movie. It just didn't give the same satisfaction as the first movie.I thought the action scenes were not up to the standards of the first one.

Homage to Kung Fu,in the panultamate showdown between 'the bride' and bill you were led to believe that it would be a long complex battle. yet instead we see minimal contact between the 2 and just a little sword play.i believe that Tarantino did this because of David Carradine's (Bill) 70's show Kung Fu where he played the shaolin monk traveling around the 'Wild West' looking for his brother. the fight sequences in the show with Carradine were rubbish and were shot in a POV way in order to disguise Carradine's non existant martial art skills and i believe this is probably also the case in Kill Bill V.2.......Feedback?

Almost as Good As The First Half---7/10,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 kicks some serious ass for almost it's whole running time. The only flaw is the disappointing fight with Bill. But there is so much good stuff here, it's pretty much forgivable. There is the great fight with Elle which tore the house down. Literally. We also finally get to see Budd played by Michael Madsen. His scenes were some of the best in both movies. And then there is quite possibly one of the scariest and most exciting scenes ever involving the Bride being buried alive. Having a fear of suffocation myself, this scene was extra effective.The acting was excellent all around. Uma Thurman proves she is not only hot and deadly, but that she is also one of the best actresses today. She is especially good toward the end. Micheal Madsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He always gives a great performance. Darryl Hannah is superb as the sole female assassin in Vol.2, and David Carradine is great as Bill himself. It's just too bad we don't get to see some more of his fight skills. Still, Vol.2 is a great second half to an instant classic. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An Improvement Over Vol 1 Largely Due To Mr Liu,"Vol 2 of the Kill Bill saga actually has better dialogue, more interesting story beats and is less overcompensating in its tributes to other films. and it becomes a better film partly because of it.What really elevates this film from below average is the appearance of the great Gordon Liu who gets to play classic Kung Fu villain Pai Mei the white-browed priest. Liu is excellent in the role as the character he fought against in Fist of The White Lotus ( A brilliant Kung Fu film with Lo Lieh directing and co-starring as Pai Mei and his twin). Gordon Liu seems to genuinely be having a great time playing his role and the film is better for it.Overall one of Trantino's better films IMHO.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Claustrophobic and long winded,"Kill Bill Volume 2 isn't really a sequel. Granted it is called volume 2, but really it is one film that has been split into two. This volume is technically a complete follow on from the first one, so it is highly recommended to watch the first one and then possibly straight into this one. I didn't take on this recommendation so it took me a while to remember the pivotal points in the first one in order to catch up with the second. Do yourself a favour if you are planning on watching this film and watch the original first.Volume 2 begins with the shoot out at the wedding chapel, where the Bride (Thurman) was left for dead by her former team of assassins. This is what sent her on the journey of killing all those involved in her betrayal. In the first one we see her destroying many who were involved and partaking in many huge fight sequences. In this volume we continue on with her journey, with the only three left to be killed; Budd (Madsen), Ellie (Hannah), and Bill (Carradine). Her first target is Budd, who has been warned by Bill that the Bride is on her way. Budd puts in a plan to stop her in her tracks and when his plan seems like it is working it is very disturbing. Basically he begins to bury her alive. Her next target is Ellie and obviously eventually Bill, the man who ultimately betrayed her. On route we see some flashbacks that tie up several plot holes of the first film, and to just why and how she became the big assassin that she is claimed to be.I won't indulge too much into what happens. I'm sure you are all aware that she will plough through them and have her face to face with Bill but it is the way she gains her revenge that is the shock. There is not as much action and violence as there was in the first film but when the action does kick in it is riveting. The Bride and Ellie standoff in a fantastically choreographed fight sequence, and there are some nice touches when the Bride is taught her kung fu by her Master, all pays homage to old school kung fu movies.As well as having action, I also found this film slightly scary. Sounds weird as it isn't a horror, but there are moments that are quite frightening. Claustrophobia is brought to the max here and that is what is scary. At one point the Bride is buried alive and her reactions make you believe you're in there with her, which would make it even more claustrophobic. The sweat dripping off her head helps you feel the heat she is also feeling. Tarantino does a great job of highlighting all this by using minimal light and some tense camera angles. This scene is uncomfortable. Also there is a scene with a poisonous snake which jumps out at you. This is frightening to me as I hate snakes. Watching it slither across the floor and attack helpless victims really spooked me out. The final scary moment is one that will make you grimace. A fight scene culminates in an eyes being gauged out. This also feels claustrophobic as you can just imagine the pitch blackness this person has been plunged into. To me this was horrific. It isn't supposed to be scary but I found it to be at certain points.As I can't really remember the first one I am struggling to really decide on how good this film is. It is alright at times but at other times it becomes slow and has a lot of talking and telling us what is going on. This though is typical Tarantino and a lot of his films do have much time given to character's talking. Not that this is a problem but at times it causes me to drift out of the film. Much of it kept me on the edge of my seat but other parts I lost a little interest.The acting is good in the film, Carradine is excellent as Bill, and Thurman, as well as looking gorgeous, really brings the character to life. The plot is over strung but the acting and camera work help you to ignore this. This is a typical Tarantino film and if you love him this will be a big deal, if you don't then it will probably just be average.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Vol.2 is more intelligent, witty, funny, and emotional than the first. now, i though the first film was a perfect film, but this takes the cake. the great post modern inclusions of the truth injection, and the five point palm exploding heart technique were fantastic.This film is not only, by far, Tarantino's best, its also one of the best films ever made. a more than worthy sequel to the first slice of perfection cake, that was vol.1.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

He has a deft touch and knows how to get good performances from his cast, which were all perfect for their parts.I really can't find a flaw with the film, other than the lack of originality. That is not to say that QT did not put his own personal spin on things, or that this movie was a ""creation."" But it is a master work of synthesis, combining things not usually found together into a nearly seamless whole.If one is a QT fan this film is a must see.

If you want to see something that will seem very familiar at times, but still challenge you, this is a must see.If you don't like gore, violence, ""adult situations"" or foul language, stay away.I got to watch the DVD then go see the film the next day, I recommend this, and I am looking forward to owning both Kill Bill DVDs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 2,"Was I satisfied with the finale of Tarantino's epic 4-hour Kill Bill (I combine Vol. 1 and 2 because you can't watch one volume and not watch the other; it's the same as watching just half of any film)? Yes. Did Vol. 2 reach the high standards set by Vol. 1? Not quite, but nevertheless it was still entertaining. Immediately, you'll realise that there is more talking and less action than in the first volume. Several things happen: The Bride deals with the final two assassins, a flashback of her martial arts training with a Chinese master is shown and we finally get to see Bill (his face was unrevealed in the first volume).The pace significantly slowed down in comparison to its predecessor but it does relatively manage to maintain the suspense just enough to keep us riveted. A long-drawn flashback to the events that occurred in The Bride's wedding chapel was much too lengthy for its own good and unnecessary. The Bride's interaction with the last two assassins felt a bit disappointing. This time, it is China and its martial arts that provide the bulk of homages in the film (the first volume being Japan), presenting Pai Mei, the legendary master who teaches The Bride.But it is David Carradine that shines as Bill. My first impression of his performance as the titular character was that it felt much too unnatural, too over-acted. But overtime, I came to accept that it was unusually fitting of the ruthless nature unique to his particular character. The way he talks, every move he makes seems perfectly calculated. We come to understand why people fear him. Bill is deadly, make no mistake.Though not as commendable as Vol. 1, Vol. 2 brings sufficient closure to one of Tarantino's greatest films. It was an exceptional ride and you can only feel happy for The Bride at the end. People ask what's the point of this film; but then again, our world craves senseless violence, so I think I can confidently state the reason why this film is so popular is because there are a lot of people out there entertained by excessive violence. The threatening consequences of our dying morals is a topic for another time. I suspect this full-length feature inclusive of Vol. 1 and 2 was made for the sole intention of gratifying Tarantino's infatuation to create something that is just shocking and purely violent. Talk about intense self-indulgence. But if we were ultimately entertained, I guess that can be pardoned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Elle driver was so perfectly evil, and Budd the perfect hillbilly. This movie probably had some of the best writing I have ever seen. David Carradine was so perfect for this role with his leathery face and smooth voice. The wedding chapel masacre made it hard for me to believe he was gonna kill everyone at all.

"Not as good as Volume One, but still enjoyable.","The main difference between Volume on and Two, is that in the latter, Tarantino ditches the violence in favor of the dialouge. That's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but it felt a little uneven after all the fighting in Volume One. Like I said, it does have some adrenaline pumping scenes, like the fight between The Bride and Elle, the training scenes with Pae Ming (forgive me if that is not his name, but it's something along those lines), and the chilling burying of The Bride's living body, but it couldn't hold a candle to the adrenaline rush I got from Volume One.I know this movie was supposed to focus more on the plot, and the dialouge in this ones will feel right at home compared to Tarantino's other movies. But I still felt a little cheated, especially the way Bill was killed. I was hoping for a much grander final showdown between him and The Bride.Maybe it was just because I was wowed so much with Volume One, and the way it unfolded, but Volume Two just seemed to fall out a bit to straight forward for a Tarantino movie. Non the less I did enjoy the film in particular the amazing performance of David Carradine, who seems to be the next Travolta that Tarantino pulled out of post fame B-Movie obscurity. I will say right here that Carradine deserve at the least an Oscar nomination for his role. In fact, all of the cast give great performances, and there are no weak links.7/10PS- You don't need to see the first one to go into this, in fact it may make Volume One more enjoyable if you see it after this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino again shows that he's got more creative braincells than half of all the other Hollywood-directors together. Of course he's also very fu..ed up. I bet he would give Charles Manson a run for his money if he wouldn't focus all his violent energy on film making. Let's hope he continues to do so. One wish though. If he could just give therapy one (more?) chance we could hope for some extremely interesting movies in the future.

This Vol 2 will most certainly please the Tarantino purists as it's much more in line with something like Pulp Fiction: slower pace, more dialogue, focus on characters rather than action, etc. But Kill Bill as a whole (both movies) is still an experience that hasn't aged at all and I would recommend to any younger generations as an absolute classic of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
on the subject of punching holes in wood blocks...,"Anyone else notice that the block of wood which Pai Mei punches his fist through (when Beatrix is watching) appears to be made of layers of plywood (which are weak and can be punched through by anyone using enough force), but the blocks which Beatrix tries to punch through all appear to be made of solid oak or some other similar hardwood? It really does look like layers of soft plywood when Pai Mei punches through it... Did they have to do that to make it technically possible for the actor to punch his fist through it, or are we supposed to draw the conclusion that Pai Mei was cheating and just trying to test Beatrix (i.e. nobody would have been able to punch through the blocks she's faced with and he's just trying to gauge her will to continue with the training)?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino is back... great as always,"Quentin Tarantino is back with the second part of the his latest work, Kill Bill. The first part of Kill Bill can be compared with the work of ""Naturel Born Killers"". In the second part of Kill Bill Tarantino has really captured the brilliant work of Pulp Fiction. All of the individuals are as original as one can get. The short and sharp/witty dialogs truly shows the mark of Tarantinos incredible work that can easily be compared to Pulp Fiction. To sum up. Kill Bill is a true masterpiece with the great screenplay of Naturel Born Killers, the flashbacks of Reservoir Dogs and the dialogs of Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen it - see it. If you have seen it... see it again",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Deeper and More Interesting Than the First, yet Still Bloody and Action-Packed","Kill Bill Volume 2 continues off of Kill Bill Volume 1 (obviously), which I enjoyed quite a bit. Kill Bill Volume 2, however, is better if you ask me.The movie is more focused on the story and development of who The Bride is, and how she ended up in her predicament. It's really interesting to see how it all went down, and that it was a lot 'smaller scale' than I originally thought. This actually confused me for a while, but it was really nice to get it all cleared up. The other characters are more delved into as well and that really adds to the movie.Now with all this story and development you may think ""What about the action that the first movie did so well?"" Well, we got an even better fight scene in this one. Sure, the whole thing isn't completely consumed by action, unlike the first one, but the second installment still manages to throw in the best fight in the series and one of the best I've ever seen.Bill and The Bride's relationship is brought into better light by the end, and I must say that I was impressed. It was a lot deeper than I originally thought, which was a really nice touch.Overall, Kill Bill Volume 2 has the great fights that the first one did, but just with more development this time around. It's a great conclusion to the 2 part series. If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one. If your interested in the first one but decided to research the second one for some reason, then watch the first one and then watch the second. Their both great action movies that any action-lover needs to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The best part was saved for the end...,"A year after the release of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"", director Quentin Tarantino's tribute to the 70s, appears the conclusion to the Bride's quest for revenge. While originally meant to be one single film, the studio forced Tarantino to make two films out of it due to the very long runtime the film would have had. Whether this information is true or not, personally I think that the decision to split the film in two was actually beneficial for the plot, as this allowed Tarantino the liberty to take two slightly different approaches (although the overall ""feeling"" is still the same in the two films) to tell one single bloody story of love, hate, and revenge.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" presents the final part of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) saga, as we follow the former assassin in her way to meet Bill's younger brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), and her nemesis, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), numbers three and four in her list after killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Viviva A. Fox). However, the path to finally find and kill Bill (David Carradine) is filled with troubles and surprises, as the remaining members of The Deadly Viper Assassination squad are now expecting her and ready to make her meet her end. One question remains, will she be strong enough to kill her former boss and ex lover, Bill?Just like the former chapter, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is an ode to the films that inspired Tarantino to make films, and while the first volume of the saga was focused on 70s films (specially martial arts movies), this volume goes further in the past and showcases Tarantino's taste for noir films (in a very well-done intro that captures that style) and specially for Westerns. As the Bride moves to the West to face Budd and Elle, the Western genre begins to domain the film's style with nods not only to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but also to John Ford's classic films. Tarantino plays with his influences and pays a respectful homage to them (even manage to include a new nod to martial arts films) without going out of the context of his revenge tale.""Vol. 2"" marks a definitive change in tone from the first, as while ""Vol. 1"" is a visually arresting display of action, ""Vol. 2"" moves in a more personal, introspective environment, closer to the Western films that influenced it. Tarantino's script takes a strength unseen in the first part and the film becomes the character study that was missed in the first. The Bride's quest for revenge becomes more complex than what it seemed at first, and her enemies as well present inner conflicts that show a development from the first film. It's overall a less flashy, but more meaty film that completes the first part in a very fitting way. If ""Vol. 1"" is the visceral passionated side of the story, ""Vol. 2"" is the intellectual (although no less passionated) side of it.Uma Thurman is back as The Bride and here finally she can show that not only she can do lots of stunt, she also can act. Her character's background is really expanded here and so are her chances to shine. Again, it is her character what drives the film, so her performance truly makes the difference between a dull movie and an exciting film. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, presenting a sympathetic side of a character we learned to hate in ""Vol. 1"". Not an easy task for an actor, and surprisingly Carradine makes it work. Personally, I had little faith in his performance but was pleasantly surprised by it. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are fantastic in their roles as the Bride's former teammates; Madsen in a low-key performance that shows the underrated talent the man has, and Hannah in a role that shows her great skill for black comedy.Many people bashes both ""Kill Bill"" volumes accusing them of being rip-offs of classic films, but I find such claims a bit naive or biased, as even when Tarantino certainly borrows a lot from those movies, he does it in a respectful way (and also carefully places the elements in his own world) that can only be accused of being a tribute rather than a shameless steal. Personally, I found ""Vol. 2"" to be the best part of the saga, mainly in the way the characters become as important as the visual style, and also in the way it references its influences without the flashy display of the first part. Still, watching the film is rather pointless without having seen ""Vol. 1"", as unlike the first one, this movie can't stand alone on its own (well, it's a direct sequel).While the first ""Kill Bill"" is a triumph of style over substance, ""Vol. 2"" is certainly the substance's revenge. Tarantino concludes the Bride's saga in an almost flawless way that improves the first part and leaves the door open to new interesting projects in the future. Probably the separation in two volumes was for the best, as ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is a satisfactory conclusion for a bloody tale of revenge. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Great 2nd Half,"Going into this movie, i heard some bad things. I heard that the first one was better and this one wasn't even close to being good. But i did hear also good things. So I went into the theater with a bit of concern. I probably should have rented the first one to get my mind into the new one but I knew enough still to be pumped up. When the title Kill Bill came on the screen though, I got goosebumps. And After 2 hours and a half, I must say this movie was great. Its a very different movie than the last though. The first volume was all about fighting and sword play and good action which was still a very good flick. The second one is mostly smart talk and diologue. But its so great though. Its a great film by itself. I like it better than the first half. Thats just me though. It still had good action when it was needed so don't worry. The only thing I did not like about Kill Bill 2 was that the previews showed what Bill looks like. I wish they would have saved it for the movie. Thats the only downfall. But overall I came out of the theater really happy and excited about it. I give it 9.5/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
