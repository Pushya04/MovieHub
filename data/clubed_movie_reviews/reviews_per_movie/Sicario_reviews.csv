"The Deeper You Go, The Darker It Gets. ..","Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
8/10,"One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.With this Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.All of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don't feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that's something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.Of course one couldn't get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn't one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached.What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike ""Prisoners"", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt's partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sicario,"Sicario was first released back in 2015. I just watched it for the first time last week...and I really have no excuse other than I'm an idiot. I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful ""what the hell?"" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP.",,Anonymous,Crime
El País de los Lobos,"""Sicario"" describes, with surgical precision, the fatal and bloody desecration of Mexico as a result of its decades long cartel war. And it does so by compressing this almost endless tragedy into a two-hour tour-de-force of filmmaking.At its center we find idealistic FBI-Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited to pursue a Mexican drug-baron. She is being guided by a seemingly untouchable covert assassin named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Their investigation and methods are pushed further into unknown territory where justice and morality are no longer valid. The end not only justifies the means, it requires them.Denis Villeneuve's masterful piece exemplifies not only filmmaking of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a socio-political nightmare that is fueled by first world-habit and global economics.Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has taken.From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that ""Sicario"" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time, that life nevertheless continues.Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using familiar elements in an extremely skillful manner.All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall.Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves"".Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic"" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario"" that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic"" held onto have been eviscerated.What now? One might ask.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crosses the tour-De-force border of film-making,"'Sicario' had me stoked from the start. It is hard to go wrong with the involvement of cinematographer Roger Deakins, director Denis Villeneuve, writer Taylor Sheridan, advertising that really makes one want to see the film, its critical acclaim and a cast like Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.In no way was 'Sicario' a let down. It completely lived up to the hype and all of the attractions/reasons for seeing the film were among the things that made 'Sicario' so good. 'Sicario' to me really is one of the best films of 2015, one of the best crime thriller films in years and a standout film of the decade. Its one stumbling block was that more could have been done with the character of Kate, the character and her motivations seemed a little underwritten somewhat and not always as decisive or plausible as ought. However, it was nowhere near as big a problem as made out (also was completely masked by how brilliant the rest of the film was), because it was clear that she was meant to be something of a fish out of water character and that was brought out very well, meaning that to me some of her actions made sense somewhat.Everything about the film in general is brilliant and a tour-De-force of film-making, though it is understandable if it doesn't connect with all. 'Sicario' is impeccably made for starters, the setting is both audacious and visceral in showing the horrors and brutality of the setting and the editing is tight, stylish and enhances the brutal atmosphere. Best of all is the cinematography (in close competition in that year's Oscar category with 'The Revenant, which was a deserved winner), with Roger Deakins demonstrating once again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror.Denis Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story that 'Sicario' tries to tell. The music score is haunting and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation. Can totally see why it was nominated for the Oscar and an easy second to Ennio Morricone's work for 'The Hateful Eight'. Can also see the acclaim for the sound editing, which added a huge amount to the film's authenticity, again up against tight competition in the category that year at the Oscars.The script is tightly structured and rich in complexity, while the story doesn't need attention-grabbing set pieces to impress or make its point and has more than that on its mind. And all the better for it. It is heavily reliant on atmosphere, this is brutal, harrowing stuff that effectively shows the horrors of the situation and setting without overdoing or sugar-coating it, also showing respect to it. It's wonderfully murky and dark, while also taut and kinetic in its energy (despite the sometimes deliberate, but never dull, pacing).You couldn't have gotten better performances. The standout is Benicio Del Toro, with the most interesting character (especially in the genuinely shocking final act) and giving a magnificently shady performance that's chilling but also conflicted. Emily Blunt conveys great strength and touching vulnerability, while Josh Brolin is tongue-in-cheek and charming with a touch of ambiguity. Daniel Kaluuya is sort of a moral compass character, something that Kaluuya is movingly sympathetic bringing out.Overall, a masterpiece tour-De-force with only one minor and ignorable stumbling block. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Splendid in all technical aspects. Slightly flawed fundamentals prevent Sicario from reaching that next level.,"The wait is over. Since the trailer came out, I watched it several times a week. That's how hyped up I was. I finally got to watch Sicario, Denis Villeneuve's latest film. It got a very positive reception at the Cannes festival, and got tons of praise from movie critics worldwide.My very first recommendation to anyone interested in watching this film is to not watch the trailer, or don't watch it repeatedly like I did. Although it's incredibly exciting, it gives way too much away. Sicario basically consists of approximately 6-7 set-pieces. The trailer shows key moments from all the set-pieces, and leaves you knowing almost just as much about the story as you'll get to know watching the actual film.Sicario features a pretty thin storyline, but to its defence, it's all part of a tactical approach at keeping things blurry, shady, and mysterious to the audience. Metaphorically, these mechanisms serve the story pretty well, as we watch official government agencies use unorthodox methods and people in this bloody war against the cartels, and the intent is to offer a glimpse at an ongoing situation and let the viewer's imagination fill in the blanks.That came off as a bit of an odd artistic choice to me, as, in recent years, several films and TV shows have thoroughly explored all the horrors resulting from the war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. It's not exactly a brand new subject matter to worldwide audiences. My point, basically, is that it's an odd timing to choose such a broad approach to a subject that has become familiar to the masses. When my imagination had to fill in the blanks, it basically did it with memories of other films and TV shows exploiting the very same subject matter, and that dug deeper into it.All the technical aspects of Sicario are off the charts. Denis Villeneuve's directing is spectacular. The sequence with the convoy of SUVs in Juarez has to rank among the most beautifully shot scenes that we have seen in a while, with a combination of breath-taking shots of Mexican landscapes, Juarez and its streets, incredible tension building up inside the vehicles, and how the different characters handle it. Roger Deakin's cinematography is flawless, as expected. Whether portraying a dry, sunny afternoon in Arizona or a nightly tactical operation with agents wearing night vision goggles, Deakins' contribution shines in every possible way. The same can be said about the soundtrack and the editing.One thing that truly surprised me is how Sicario makes its point. It is intended to leave you with an overall impression on a global situation (the border war, the cartels, the way government agencies operate, etc.), and the actual story and characters become purposely subsidiary in that depiction of a broader picture. This is just another day in this war, just another set of dirty tactics, just another escalation of violence, just another dozen of people among thousands doing shady things in this mess of a war on drugs.And if there is one flaw to this film, that's where it lies, in my humble opinion. Characters and storyline are fundamentals. Without saying that these two aspects were neglected, I feel like this is where Villeneuve's film could have reached that next level, but unfortunately didn't, by keeping everything so vague, and so volatile.I'm not going to sugar coat it: Emily Blunt's character is one-dimensional. Her performance is good, but the character has a very simple purpose in the whole picture, and it never goes beyond that. Some secondary characters get enough screen time to let you think that they'll eventually have a true impact on the story, or be part of some sub-plot. Here again, some minor disappointments as a result. Again, it's part of a mechanism to make everyone look like a tiny dot in the big picture, but prevented me from being truly compelled by the story unfolding and most of the characters that were part of it.Josh Brolin's and Benicio Del Toro's performances are both amazing, though. Again, you do not get to know a lot about them. That being said, the few times when you get to see more than just what's on the surface, you'll get enough hints to partly understand their true nature. But again, you'll notice that I had to use the word ""partly"", especially when it comes to Brolin's character. A lot is left unexplained. And while this opens up a world of possibilities where speculations get darker by the minute, I was left wanting to know more when the credits started rolling.Overall, Sicario succeeded in leaving me feeling deceived, just like I was an extension of Kate Macer. The way it operates is quite unique, as a lot of unexplained details, characters, and events leave the viewer speculating in an environment filled with lies, shadiness, and broken ideals. The visuals and the soundtrack will blow you away. Also, the final scene was a perfect way to seal the deal, and goes perfectly in line with the ""big picture"" approach that this film takes.Overall, a very entertaining drama/thriller, full of technical brilliance, and some slightly flawed fundamentals. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tense, intelligent drama, with thriller overtones","The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying Kate Macy, a career policewoman heading a SWAT team. Her accent slips slightly a couple of times, but otherwise she's utterly believable as born and raised in the deep south of the US. Kate is a fundamentally decent, honorable human being, trying to the right thing in a world where the rule book doesn't seem to work any more. She's smart, tough, and experienced - but right from the start of the movie, it's clear that she's in over her head.The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to avoid any clean and easy action movie clichés, and it pays off enormously as the movie goes on.It's also a highly intelligent movie, made for an intelligent audience. It doesn't lay things out on a plate. Instead you have to pay attention and you have to think, just as Kate has to - because her first mistake could be her last.Staging, costuming, sets, cinematography, and lighting are all perfect. Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is, while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no less. This part of the movie is in the ""As good as it gets"" category. The only part that I didn't like (and the reason that this doesn't get a 10 from me) was the music. It's used deliberately to heighten tension during some scenes which would otherwise break the feel of the movie, and generally it's done well, but some scenes are spoiled with a There Will Be Blood styled screech. It's really not needed, especially since Sicario's own score manages to build or maintain tension quite successfully in other parts of the movie while remaining low-key.To my mind, this is much more of a drama than it is a thriller. It's certainly not an action movie. The acting from the support cast is exactly what it needs to be - good in general, and great when a minor character is the focal point - but look closely at how much Benicio del Toro manages to do with no dialogue and not even all that much movement. Simply amazing.This is a great movie to see if you want to be challenged.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Frustratingly Short of Greatness!,"Sicario is a good movie. A really good movie with excellent direction, cinematography, and tight-knit action which is never overdone. Every actor plays their part to near perfection, and the story is beautifully told--with barely any fluff and.no useless extravagance.It could, however, have been a truly great movie if Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya's characters were not in it ... or if they had been given different roles. Both actors did fine jobs ... but both their characters were quite simply pointless.Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) adds nothing to the story except a needless--and quite half-hearted--moral compass who cries, whines, and delivers empty threats while contributing nothing to the investigation.Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) does, if possible, even less. He is an arrogant, holier-than-thou, uninvited tag-along voice of reason who insists on being present without ever giving any real reason for it, and seems far too interested in his partner Kate's bra ... and her general appearance.Left to Del Toro and Brolin, with the time wasted on Blunt and Kaluuya instead being spent on greater plot development, Sicario could have been a much better movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well organized story with great characters, performed by great actors","This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.Emily Blunt was amazing in her character, a good FBI agent who feels she's not doing enough on the streets and allows herself to get used by someone with more power, played by Josh Brolin brilliantly as a man who seems uncharismatic about his job in order to hide the covert nature of his mission to find the big man responsible for all the street crime.Brolin played a necessary evil, that comes off brilliantly in the narrative that plays out. Loved how they go from the bottom and get to the very top. It's very surgical.But the actor who stole the show in Sicario is Benicio del Toro whose character Alejandro, is a cloud of mystery that unravels slowly through the film, done both subtle and dramatic by Del Toro. Every time he was on the screen even when he did nothing he was doing something and you he demanded your attention.Plus the music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. it was powerful.Incredible action-thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A classic Denis but with a weak script,"To be honest. The movie wasn't as thrilling as I somewhat expected. I can confess that it had its good and bad parts. Everything from the arrogant dialogues to the pretty weak characters wasn't what the movie deserved.I got inspired to watch this movie from a shot I saw on the internet, it was a vibrant shot with a camera angle that I at an instant reckoned to align with the director. It is almost like the Villeneuve fenomen, I get the feeling that wherever you decide to pause the image tells you a story. You will at a instant know that it is VilleneuveThe movie overall on the other hand was pretty bad if I might say so. Blunts character is totally off, we don't get any connection and I sometimes got the feeling that her character didn't even know where she found her motivation. We don't get any energy and as I always say ;the performance can't be better than the character that is written. Her foil acts like a runner-up to her personality but he is also written poorly. The only character that showed some signe hope was Brolins, with the best first impression of the movie which sets the general tone of hes character would it be hard to watch the movie without it. Del Toros character is a total miss match, we first get the impression that he is somewhat of just a drager :a follow along, until we notice that the movie is actually about him ;what?I read a review about someone that had watched the trailer a bit too many times before the actual movie, I can totally see his point of view that the movie becomes so much worse when you already know who the real Sicario is.The hook is wonderful but could have been played with a bit more, now is it just like events play out.What I take with me after my watch of Sicario is the feeling it brought, a good movie if you had a bucket of popcorn in your lapse. But nothing I would recommend if you are one of those who actually care about what you are watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of this year's best thrillers,"More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic."" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.To me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It's somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt's Kate Macer knows she's being used but she wants to know what she's being used for. Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he's skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there's a certain dark pain that's magnetic about him. It's all in the eyes. Oscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.I've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means 'hit-man,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Villeneuve's Best Film. Gritty, Stark, In Your Face & Head Thriller","Sicario is a film one never forgets. Brutal horror of a Mexican drug cartel tracked down by a wily and savvy Intel Agency Contractor (Josh Brolin) with an American Cowboy my-way-or-highway playbook, two FBI agents (Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya) about to get a first-hand indoctrination into the front-line multi-agency specialty-team of drug-lord hunters, and a mysterious Mexican subject-matter advisor (Benicio Del Toro) bent on delivering his version of justice and personal revenge set the stage for one Hell of a ride over the border - the brilliant subtlety of the scenes and editing serves only to magnify the plot and action.Stunning Cinematography highlights the scenic beauty of the country besieged with the contradicting brutality of the Mexican drug trade in the ""land of wolves"". Eerie moody music and superior sound editing escalates the tension that builds throughout. Genius editing creates a droning non-stop flow of that tension, an essential element to the success of any thriller.Sicario was compelling evidence in 2015 (one of the best and most competitive years of the new Millennium for film releases with 'Spotlight' and 'Bridge of Spies' also in the same year) that Denis was one of the industry's very best newly emerged Directors - one who was most-likely to put out future films on an epic Hall of Fame level. His 2016 film 'Arrival' was an interesting follow-up to Sicario, taking him into the sci-fi realm with an intelligent screenplay and once again moody cinematography and editing.However, his 2017 film 'Blade Runner 2049' derailed his momentum with its often too-long droning scenes and lack of effective story-boarding, sending us a confusing message.The 'Dune' trilogy is now Villeneuve's main focus, and its first episode not clearly indicating whether Sicario was Denis' crowning achievement or a taste of greatness that lay ahead in the remaining Dune entries. Dune 1 was hoped by many sci fi fans to be an all-time sci fi achievement in film, but in many ways disappointed, and was more like an extended trailer for the epic (""sets the stage"" as Denis later stated). Dune's catch phrase at the end of Dune ""It's only the beginning"" may be an indication of much greater things ahead - Let's hope it is that, and not a warning.For now at least (early July, 2023), Sicario is clearly Denis' best film - a MUST-SEE movie.NOTE: The realistic and brutal violence of this film and situations are intense, and NOT appropriate for those under 16 (or those easily affected by such).If one wonders why the USA puts forth so much effort in the War on Drugs on and over our Southern border, this film illuminates the rationale in clear stark light.👍👍",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
'Sicario' Soars with Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt in tow!,"Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that's sure to give your heart its full day's work, Denis Villenueve's masterful ""Sicario"" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve's direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that's been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.""Sicario"" tells the story of an idealistic FBI agent names Kate (Blunt), who is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. With the ""guidance"" of a mysterious agent Alejandro (Del Toro) and her superior Matt (Brolin), and influx of intrigue and morals will shake Kate to her very core.First and foremost, ""Sicario"" breathes new life into contemporary cinematography, as produced by no less than the great Roger Deakins. A vessel for God's eye on the world, Deakins ignites the fire of his vision, capturing some of the finest shots seen this decade. His use of shadows, CGI, and choices in which to convey and portray emotions is downright genius. Becoming essentially another character in the story, Deakins gives a master's class on cinematography for future craftsmen and women to behold. It's a work that will surely land him his thirteenth Oscar nomination.Above that, we are treated to fantastic and awards worthy performances. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt's ability to connect with the character's soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but with more reserve.Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since ""21 Grams."" A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" or Gene Hackman in ""The French Connection."" You won't be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor's in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well.As a technical endeavor, ""Sicario"" also succeeds in its vibrantly living sound design, and illustrious score by Academy Award nominee Jóhann Jóhannsson. The two are married in a blistering union of tension and heart palpitations. Editor Joe Walker is a shining star behind the scenes as well, thanks to his precision and patience in bringing a scene right to the edge, and knowing when and where to take it next. It's his most innovative work yet, even surpassing his nominated work on ""12 Years a Slave.""Goes without saying that ""Sicario"" is Denis Villenueve's best work to date. Coming from someone that thoroughly enjoyed ""Prisoners"" and tolerated ""Enemy,"" this is his most accessible and compelling piece. If anything, he's just so damn exciting to watch these days, as he locates strange vehicles for actor's and craftsmen to come together. He takes on a genre that may feel familiar, like the drug cartel, but makes it feel new and smart.""Sicario"" is hands down one of the year's best films.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shifting the boundary,"This is simple but fine in the sketch; a horrendous border crime is uncovered in a house on the US side, it calls for a response of some kind, consequences. In an ideal world, the machinery of justice would whir into place and produce order, culprits would be apprehended, but it's not that kind of world, is it?The whole point is that gears will turn, something resembling justice will be served, but the turning will shuffle morals, shift boundaries of what someone can get away with in a closed room or in the dark of the night when no one's there to watch.The idea is that discord must be introduced, deliberate, planned disorder; a cowboy is brought in from this or that shady Washington agency to ruffle feathers, stir the waters to see what comes out from hiding. The film knowingly stirs all these elements on its surface, without the rat-ta-ta convulsions of the CIA airport thriller.We have a medievally barbarous cartel on the enemy side so that even though the shuffling unnerves, we will wearily concede the necessity. But this makes it a truth demanding no less of our discourse; would you have it different? Is anything made right, or does any of it restore more than a passing order of appearances? A new head will be appointed the next day, the turning goes on.But this will do just fine in the vicinity that it puts itself. Thriller in mechanics, but leaves room for anxiety that must be faced in the world. Tethers pulled taut in visual stretches, the land hums.

Disappointing plot with unfulfilling story,"I expected more from Sicario, but was disappointed with both the plot and the fairly empty, shallow story.I also think Emily Blount was miscast as Kate, the FBI agent who handles kidnappings until she's suddenly recruited to join a Govt anti-drug task force. Enter Josh Brolin as the Govt agent. He was excellent as one of these mysterious Govt types that works for some agency with some kind of authority from somewhere.But Benicio Del Toro is the star. He turns in a terrific performance as this ultra mysterious Spanish-speaker who has some TBD role helping the US Govt fight against Mexican drug lords.Kate is supposedly this tough FBI agent, but she seems to bristle at the Govt agents methods, thinking that the law is supposed to be followed. But these guys don't. Really though, drug lords, Mexico, what did she expect? I kept thinking that if she was this righteous, she should not have volunteered.There are some nice back and forth scenes between Blount and Del Toro as he coaches her on how to absorb what she sees, and well as with Brolin.But the story suffers because we never learn more about Kate or any of these guys. It would have really helped to learn about Kate's upbringing to more understand he motivation to fight drugs so much. But instead, it's empty. So when she starts bristling, you are left wondering why.The story gets a bit bogged down with she and her partner smoking cigarettes, and going back and forth to this hotel to meet the teams. It's like, OK, what is the point here? The story also gets a bit hard to figure out what is happening.The whole movie is pretty bloody and violent, as you'd expect. But it's not a great film by any means. The ending culminates in your learning more, but I'm like, so what, big deal.Average at best is Sicario. Some great stuff from Del Toro, but otherwise, just average. Enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Outstanding thriller,"Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
There is bleakness behind every spot of bleakness,"Denis Villeneuve's crisp images and trademark ominous intensity are ever-present in this look at the murky procedures of hunting down Mexican drug cartels, seen from the perspective of more or less clandestine CIA and FBI agents. For parts of the film's running time, the narrative feels bogged down by its own austerity. The reason you don't particularly identify or sympathise with the protagonists is that everything they do feels meaningless, whether you believe they have the moral high ground or not. There is bleakness behind every spot of bleakness in this world. A forceful, though not always engaging story from Taylor Sheridan (later of Hell of High Water). Luckily, the film has Benicio del Toro in a superb, scene-stealing performance as a callous, disillusioned hitman. It's his character's ruthless sentiment that ultimately feels the most productive. Also with fine performances by the rest of the cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""This is the land of wolves now"".","Sicario ('Hitman' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future. To tell more would spoil what is a dense and complex storyline that evolves in a most satisfactory manner.The acting is superb, with Blunt giving a career-best performance (sadly overlooked by the major awards), Josh Brolin being convincing as the war-weathered CIA man and Benicio del Toro delivering his best stone cold killer in gripping style. His Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination is well deserved, albeit for the maintenance of a fairly standard and chilling expression. Finally a name to watch for the future is London-born Daniel Kaluuya as Macer's black FBI colleague frustrated at being sidelined as a 'spare' by the task force.Equally praiseworthy is the epic cinematography of Roger Deakin (""Skyfall"", ""No Country for Old Men"") which is also Oscar nominated. Remarkable landscapes of the Mexican border are supported by breathtaking helicopter/drone shots of the CIA convoy of black vehicles in one of the tenser moments in the film. Outstanding (for both direction, editing and cinematography) is a scene set in and around a tunnel that is the best satellite/night vision scene since the 'electronic battlefield' in ""Patriot Games"" in 1992.The Oscar-nominated music by Jóhann Jóhannsson (so good with ""The Theory of Everything"") is of the atonal electronic variety, undoubtedly effective in conveying the film's mood but difficult to compare against the more obvious Oscar nominations from the likes of Ennio Morricone and John Williams.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (who specialises in single named features) this is a tense, intelligent and thought-providing film that does nothing for Mexico's tourist industry but a lot for Trump's presidential campaign!Often brutal, this is not an easy film to watch. But it is a highly intelligent watch, requiring your full attention throughout, and is deserving of a place among the best films of 2015.

Controlled Chaos,"There's been many films and shows that revolve around the war on drugs or cartels. When it comes to that genre, 'Sicario' should be at the top of anyone's list.So much to praise in this film. The music combined with the cinematography sets the whole tone of the movie with a haunting intensity. It feels real, raw, and dark.Taylor Sheridan no doubt proved he can write with this one, but it's Denis Villeneuve and his one of a kind filmmaking that really brings the grim atmosphere. He's a master of tension building. Time and time again he's shown that his level of cinematography is unmatched.Benicio Del Toro has done a lot of good work, but this is his best. Emily Blunt is also fantastic. She's one of the best in the business right now, and I believe this role was key in catapulting her there.""Welcome to Juarez""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Slow crime drama,The movie had a great concept but was dumbed down by its ridiculously slow pace and Emily Blunt's character that was practically useless. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro did all the heavy lifting in this movie.Don't expect any action because there's none. It's a slow paced crime drama which was forcefully made 2 hours long when it could have easily finished in 1.5 hours.Denis Villeneuve has the extraordinary talent of putting people to sleep with his movies. He makes sure each and every movie he makes is an absolute snoozefest. No idea why Hollywood loves him so much.Overall this is a one time watch. This one along with Prisoners are the only good movies he has made in my opinion. The rest are just snoozefests which happen to be visually stunning without any proper story.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cold,"Back when I was younger we had a slang for certain people. It was used for people who we considered heartless or maybe someone that operated on a ""I don't give a bleep"" level. We called them cold-blooded, or cold. It was a term of endearment though. ""Man, you cold."" Like, man you're doing some stuff I could never work up the nerve to do.That's how I would characterize this movie. Cold. Along with cold it was extremely intense. Like that hold-your-breath-so-you-can-be-aware-of-everything-that's-going-on intensity. And the pervasive musical score with the low bass chords added to the intensity.I thought the movie was going to be a hit-man/double agent/super spy movie with extreme gadgets, extreme explosions, extreme stunts and an extreme death toll. It's not that. Or I'll say, it's not quite that. This movie went for authenticity. There's no 007/Ethan Hunt/super spy performing these miraculous fight moves, deftly killing people with the most unlikely weapon and escaping death defying situations. Upon seeing Emily Blunt (Kate Macer), I figured she'd be a super badass that would be kicking butt and taking names and could outdo even the best man. She was bad, but there was a realistic limit to her skill set.The action was gritty, slow moving, calculated action that conforms to the rules of physics and reality. There's tactical planning on a basic level, constant communication and methodical execution of said plans. And did I mention that it's cold?The story is a simple yet terrific one. The U.S. is stepping up its effort to curtail drugs flowing into the U.S. from Mexico with the help of an ""adviser"". This adviser has a right hand man, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who adds an element of mystery to the entire operation. And he adds the frigidness. This man sleeps in a freezer. He drinks water and pees ice. Every scene he was in the temperature dropped. He was one cold piece of work.The movie was masterfully done. It drove home the seriousness of the drug violence without making it look fake and superfluous. Even the subdued nature of the acting added to the quality of the film. No person was out of place or there to make a splash. This was just one of those movies where the pieces fit perfectly. Sicario has just become one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"As usual, Benicio Del Toro steals the show.","NO ONE does the ""strong and silent type"" like Benicio, and Josh Brolin was the cherry on the top, absolutely superb in the role. The only actor that I thought was miscast was Emily Blunt. Although she tried her best, she looks more like a Sunday school teacher than a professional killer in body armor and combat boots. I think she is more disposed to more ""ladylike"" roles as opposed to parts like this. I also thought that her dialogue was also woefully unbelievable. Coldblooded, paramilitary killers are supposed to simply keep their mouth shut and follow orders, not to question the motives of their superiors. From her very first moments on screen, she begins to question her orders, something no black op that I know of would ever do. The very nature of the job requires both unerring duty and silence, not unending doubts regarding the wisdom of their actions, which is why it is called, ""chain of command."" These were the characteristics of a tenderfoot, not an experienced foot soldier, and for me, the only weakness of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Harsh reality handled beautifully,"Of all the things this movie is, it is first and foremost honest.
Yeah we want Emily Blunt to kick doors down, shoot the bad guys, and overpower any of the men who consistently overpower her. However, the female FBI operative who is new to the drug war and constantly in the dark about what is going on cannot do any of those things and is forced to submit time and time again as the strong exploit the weak.
Set against the backdrop of the Mexican drug war but not about it, Sicario asks how far you would go to actually make a difference, and what it would take to push you further. Emily Blunt time and time again makes the right and good decision, and then gets shot, abused, or otherwise traumatized with no payoff. Real life is much like this: despite a hero's or-in this case-heroine's best efforts, the strong often just take what they want.
Backed by beautiful cinematography and a constant tension from the heartbeat-like soundtrack and personal camera work, Sicario weaves complex themes together into an intense yet digestible movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A nice and suspenseful thriller has to keep you hooked on the edge of your seat,"Thrilling and moving film full of frenetic action , spectacular pursuits , crossfire and lots of violence. The drug war on the U. S.-Mexico border has escalated as the cartels have been trafficking lots of dope across the US border. FBI field agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is appointed to join a special anti-drugs task force that also involves the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice. As an expert operative called Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is tasked by government officials to execute a risked assignment . Matt enlists valiant agents to help investigate a Mexican drug cartel that has been smuggling lots of drug to USA . To fight the war, federal agent Matt Graver re-teams with the mercurial Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) . At the beginnng, the two-fisted team has to transport a drug kingpin and rival to other clans from Juarez to US in a really dangerous operation. Then Kate realizes that the strange outfit uses unconventional , unorthodox and even potentially illegal methods . The border is just another line to cross .No rules this time .Witness the next chapter of the Sicario saga.This is good thriller with lots of action, impressive scenes and strong violence , in the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker . A nail-biting and stirring flick that results to be tense for the whole movie. This Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested and expecting throughout all of the time . Interesting and provoking script by screenwriter Taylor Sheridan , who wrote the story and screenplay for both films : Sicario 2015 and Sicario 2018 . This splendid first entry , Sicario (2015) was competently directed by Denis Villeneuve, in a proposed trilogy written by Taylor Sheridan, going on an acceptable second part , Sicario : Day of the Soldier (2018) by Stefano Sollima and in pre-production a third installment with similar actors, writers and technicians . The word ""Sicario"" means ""hitman"" or ""gunman"" in Spanish. It also means ""paid assassin"" in Italian .The word ""Sicario"" derives from the Latin word ""Sicarius,"" meaning ""dagger man"". The term was used by Romans to describe Jewish zealots who killed Roman citizens using a ""sica"" or small dagger hidden in their cloaks. There were so many killings in the province of Judea around the 1st Century AD that's why the figure of ""Sicarius"" was codified in Roman law . The film features one Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro, and an Oscar nominee, Josh Brolin, both of whom delivering top-notch interpretation . Benicio del Toro as Alejandro is terrific , in this character hunts down the biggest current drug kingpin , Fausto Alarcon , in the sequel The Day of the Soldier 2018 Alejandro protects the drug baron's daughter . Stars Emily Blunt giving a magnificent acting as the tough , stubborn as well as sensitive agent and Josh Brolin gives a masterful acting , as well .The first part was played by Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro , Josh Brolin , Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan , Daniel Kaluuya , Victor Garber , Raoul Max Trujillo , Julio Cesar Cedillo and the second outing is performed by some of them, adding the following ones : Isabel Merced , Catherine Keener , Shea Whigham , Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Matthew Modine.When discussing the soundtrack with composer Jóhann Jóhannsson who died early, in fact the second film is dedicated to his memory , director Villeneuve said he wanted the the sound of a threat, this is the reason for the musical score is extremely punching, rousing and threatening. The motion picture stunningly photographed by great cameraman Roger Deakins was competently directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies , Arrival , Maelström , Enemy , Prisoners , Blade Runner 2049) . Rating 8/10 . Better than average . It will have you in tension throughout the film and your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end.

Somewhat lacking,"If you watch this movie, be prepared to slog along painfully through the first hour and 10 minutes. I guarantee you will be rolling your eyes, shaking your head and saying to yourself, ""What nonsense!"" more than a few times. After that first hour plus, then, and only then, does the movie begin to come together a bit and make even the slightest bit of sense.Emily Blunt, one of my favorite actresses, is sadly miscast here. She's too pretty, too fragile and too damn out of her element. And smoking cigarettes is so passé. Emily was great as the action hero in ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Her oily biceps, her determination, her lithe and limber athleticism were terrific. She really sank her teeth into that role. Awesome.In Sicario, she and the viewer flounder around like beached fish dying from lack of oxygen and in search of relief or release. The script has Emily ---and her audience--- asking and asking ""What the heck is going on?"" It gets REALLY boring, hearing her ask this over and over.At that point midway through the film, things kind of sort of start to coalesce for us all. Kind of. Eventually, Benecio del Toro magically morphs into the real protagonist. Things move along nicely. And there's a wonderful bit with that big, hunky guy from Walking Dead. His acting just gets better and better.However, don't expect any real catharsis here. And by that I mean the ""emotional relief"" of knowing that you learned something or solved any kind of life mystery. You're not even afforded the gift of being entertained . . .not much anyway.Don't expect any kind of understanding of anything at all. Benecio takes care of business with his usual aplomb. Emily attempts to act, at the end, like she's going to find some meaning in ""it all."" There is no revelation. Neither she nor her audience feel satisfied. One is left hanging. All one learns is to not hang out on balconies. That should come in useful.What I can say this movie did for me was to teach me to stay far far away from Mexico and the border, Far far away.

"Nothing much is happening here, but it takes a long time to arrive","What is it with so many movies these days? Mumbling, diffuse dialog that can barely be heard, never mind understood. Worst offender - Emily Blunt. She breathes or snorts or exhales out her nonsensical, spare lines. When combined with a horrendous character that has no back story or dimensions whatsoever, her role is probably the most frustrating aspect of this movie.Oh yes - there are long scenes of lines of shiny SUVs driving about. I won't spoil it by telling you where they are going or why, but in places this looked like a Chevy SUV commercial.Ultimately, some stuff happened, and it did show the horror and tragedy of drug cartels. It also was a movie with a tissue-thin, predictable plot, awful character development, inane dialog.This is yet another example of either padded ratings on the IMDb, or a public that really hasn't seen very many truly great movies.

Great movie,"Enjoyed this - the 2 hours flew by. It was well acted, the tension dominated the excellent action; definitely the right way round in my opinion. The way the story played out was multi-layered, so that multiple levels of the drug trafficking pathway were shown in sufficient detail to make you care about the individuals at each of those levels. But what I found most interesting was how the movie suggested that the law is created by power to fundamentally regulate others in the preservation of an order, not for the preservation of order per se, and certainly not to regulate power itself. When the order is threatened, power brazenly steps outside of the law to relentlessly restore its hegemony. I found this a powerful metaphor for how US and western power is projected internationally and the use of delta teams that had seen action in Iraq reinforced the metaphor. It wasn't difficult to consider how mobile units on hostile terrain in this movie paralleled those in Iraq/Afghanistan etc and how puppet power brokers abroad are ""substituted"" when they become troublesome.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brooding thriller with murky morals which is strong enough to carry it through a final third that is not quite what the majority of the film is,"Aside from hearing positive things about this film, I had really not heard too much specific on it. I knew it was a drug-related film but such detail doesn't tell you how it will approach it – whether it will be Awards-bait 'issues' film, an action movie, or what. In the case of Sciario it is certainly a thriller which uses as its base a world direct from the headlines. The film opens with a tense and violent SWAT incursion, setting a tone that it keeps for the whole film. In place of big action sequences what we get is a slow-burn, where sequences are drawn out, tension, and (if they have violence) tend to have sudden and decisive moments. I have read some complaining that this makes it feel slow paced or dull, however for me it worked really well.Within this thriller, there is a pleasing moral murkiness to it. The viewer is asked to constantly revise who we are supporting and why; and rather than provide us an easy answer at any point, the film leaves us in roundly murky territory, which does feel realistic and satisfyingly bleak. Not all of the film does feel realistic though, and the specifics of the final third are perhaps not in keeping with the tone of the narrative up till that point. Personally I found that the film had done enough to keep me with it so that I went with the narrative when it went off in a specific direction – mainly because it added to the sense of the film being grey morally.The cast are strong throughout, with Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin, all play their characters well, with a smartness that informs in retrospect as well as in the moment. The supporting cast has plenty of well known faces giving good turns but without distracted by the 'where do I know him from?' factor – specifically Garber, Bernthal, and a brief appearance from Donovan. British Kaluuya is pretty impressive in his role and was a surprise find since I had only before seen him in an episode of Black Mirror. The directing and editing of the film works to the tension, and the camera is used really well to keep the viewer in the scene and feel that tension and feeling of the unknown throughout.Sicario is a strong thriller, which benefits from solid characters, a morally murky narrative, and a consistent brooding tension which is used well to give way to moments of sudden, brutal, and all too believable violence.",,Anonymous,Crime
If you remove a protagonist from this film nothing will change,"Great story, yeah.It's impossible to ignore such a poor dramaturgy. Is it a trending thing these days?

How come victims of circumstances became protagonists?? Aren't they supposed to act, to choose, to make decisions and deal with consequences? If not, what are they doing there? Watching this movie with me?It could be a good solid story about Alejandro's revenge and his transformation from law&order man to merciless murderer. Or about his conflict with Kate. But since Kate doesn't do anything, it's not a conflict. She is absolutely useless element. So is her FBI partner by the way.Cinematography is very cool but that's why it makes the film even worse.

Then Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro show up with enough cool to carry any movie.The scene at the border when the convoy gets stuck in traffic is one of the most tense, perfectly shot sequences I've ever seen.The fight scene between Blunt and Bertram is another perfectly shot, expertly choreographed sequence.There's about a half dozen more scenes I could describe that blew me away or caught me off guard.Some might complain that there wasn't enough character development to make you care about the characters.

They are law enforcement people who are involved in the war against drugs, and they get the opportunity to be on the team with people who will disrupt drugs from coming into the country, and they're all upset and questioning these people at every turn. Stupid. Additionally, though I have liked Emily Blount in about everything I have seen her in, but this was bad casting. She is skinny, awkward, and weak, and she is a tactical drug enforcement agent? She is emotionally fragile?

And while it is silent (sort of), you will feel a great impact.So while some might feel that this strong beginning might (or rather is) kind of hurting the rest of the movie, I do think that it just sets a tone.

"Liked it, didn't love it.","Sicario tells the story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) asked to cooperate with the CIA to take down a Mexican drug cartel.This is Benicio Del Toro's best performance since Traffic which is no small praise. Josh Brolin delivers a good performance as well. I'm usually a fan of Emily Blunt, but I found her profoundly okay in this role. She doesn't bring anything personal to this character. She was never bad, but you could replace her with any other actress without changing much to the movie.Denis Villeneuve is known for his dark, bleak tone and Sicario is no exception. The movie has very graphic violence, sometimes to its detriment. You see countless burnt, decapitated, amputated, tortured bodies of Mexican men without any attempt to humanize any victim of those drug cartels; who were they? why did they die? who cares? Not Denis Villeneuve apparently. It's a shame because it makes the movie feel exploitative and dehumanizing which probably wasn't Villeneuve's intention.The story doesn't pull any punches, like Blunt's character, you feel powerless when confronted with the violence and the scale of the drug cartels. According to Sicario, Mexicans are unable to solve their own problems, Americans make everything even worse and you can't help but feel that this is a doomed cause.This movie has undeniable qualities: Benicio Del Terro's performance is incredible, Deakins should get an Oscar for cinematography and Denis Villeneuve knows how to shoot action and build tension.

'Sicario' comes from the Roman term for zealot...,"Sicario is technically speaking a great film; it looks beautiful, the score is suitably daunting and the acting of the highest order. But what makes Sicario a timeless film is the message it subtly delivers.There are those who criticize both the role of Emily Blunt's character (Kate Mercer) and the plot as being overly simplistic. And while I see their point of view, I suspect that these critics, much like those who praise the film as being a vindication of the idea that the 'means justify the ends', are both missing the actual point of this film.Sicario should not be seen as movie that argues for brutal measures against brutal forces. Although that is what the actual plot delivers, the plot is merely a vessel to deliver a much more important, and more difficult message to swallow; That the USA's and global posture of the war on drugs since the late 1980's has only made the situation worse for all in involved (especially those who live in countries where the production and mass distribution occur).Brolin's character (Matt Graver) essentially plays the voice of the devil's advocate and Del Toro's character (Alejandro) acts as the devil's hand. Both of them believe that the only solution is to create some semblance of order. Even going so far as aiming to replicate the 'Medellin' period, when Pablo Escobar almost single handedly controlled the global drug trade (for those interested, I highly recommend Netflix's 'Narcos').Anyone with some idea of that period will know that any semblance of order that existed under the Medellin cartel, was just as brutal and violent, only it primarily cost the lives of Colombians rather than allowing the violence to spill over into the USA itself.This film should be seen as an argument, a powerful one at that, of just what our global hypocrisy towards drugs is costing us. That the people of Mexico, Central and South America (and a whole host of others who find themselves in the ever expanding network of the drug trade) are soaking up most of the brutality so that the rest of the world can pretend our legislation and our redundant conservative stance against legalizing drugs of any form is working (for those who have watched the film, think of the end scene).We do not need to ""figure out how to get 20% of Americans to stop snorting and smoking s***"". We need to come to terms with the fact that as long as any substance is illegal, there will always be those ready to take the risks and be as ruthless as necessary, to benefit from the absurd margins our legislation creates.The world has created an artificial and highly profitable supply problem for drugs and it is becoming more difficult with each passing year, to wrest control away from those who profit of it, and I'm not just talking about drug-lords here.The events in Sicario are still possibly fictional (in terms of the how the drug trade is being combated), but unless we take its actual message to heart, it will, sooner that we would like to believe, become an ever present reality. A reality where violence becomes the default solution, a reality where the 'lobos' and 'Sicarios' roam free and make dens from Juarez all the way to the national capitals of every nation on Earth.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A confusing thriller,"This film tells the story of an FBI agent who is given a chance to volunteer to work for a mysterious group of agents to take down a drug lord in Mexico.""Sicario"" tells a story of agents going into Mexico and carry out attention seeking operations abroad. The film lays out events plainly and in chronological order, but yet there are a lot of pieces missing and hence I have a hard time fully understanding the story. What I get is that Emily Blunt's character does not fully know what she is doing, why she is in the team, and she also disagrees with what the team does. She has a lot of questions about the operations, and frankly I have the same questions. As a result, the film is not able to fully captivate me, even though the plot is thrilling and adventurous.",,Anonymous,Crime
Drags a little,"""Sicario"" is a well-directed thriller that explores the ambiguous logistics and grey areas behind the US war against the Mexican drug cartel. Are we really supposed to play by the rules when your enemy doesn't have any? Villeneuve stages the story realistically, but the result is still extremely cinematic. The suspense is always well-orchestrated, in particular when the threat is hiding out of frame.However, I have to confess that the film was definitely too long, with many dull moments with the same fish out of water mechanics being repeated all over again. The cartel has been the subject of so many films of this generation, and coming out with something really refreshing is getting progressively hard.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Can't understand the hype,"The film is without doubt solid, but I can't understand how it's getting a 7,7 rating.I don't even want to write a long review because it's all there: The shots are great, the action believable and realistic, without being too heavy on gore or violence, and tension is also build up very good so you never get bored.But the absolutely weak character of Kate (protagonist) just takes it completely away. Don't get me wrong, Emily Blunt did great, but the character design leaves you thinking till the last second how the freak she accomplished being one of the ""tough"" ones at the FBI, and even more how the heck somebody sane could put her in the situation she ends up in the film.This is just incongruent and frustrating, accompanied by a plot twist in the end which was (imo) very predictable.TLDR:A well crafted movie with great film style and good acting, lacking in character design and an unpredictable plot twist.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are never happy endings at either side of the issue, for the trafficker's, users, distributors or authorities. I do not believe the situation can ever be resolved. Leagalising controlled substances would minimize the violence, but in the end, narcotics ruin families and destroy lives and lead to violence, it needs to stop. But it won't The major difference between this and traffic is the focus on cartels, and law enforcement, without the behind the scenes look at what narcotics trade brings to your home.

Shame. This could be something.,"I've read a few tag lines for this movie here and there, it's always the 'disgruntled FBI agent thrown into the deep end of the drug war' or some nonsense like that. The truth is, there's no way to sum up this story in just a few lines because there's simply no story. Or rather, it's not a story but an illustrated federal case, a task force theater, if you will. It's fun at times but make no mistake: there's no sex, no love, no romance, no mystery - nothing much to overcome or achieve for that matter. There's very little action (granted, when they finally do commence the ass kicking, it's truly glorious). There's a bit of a thrill, sure, but it's mostly about trying to wait out boredom until Blunt or DelToro do something. Commit. Alas, they never do, instead they act the unactable and vigorously play the dullest, the silliest and the least believable plights, like the highway shootout or the rendition of a single POI via a convoy of Suburbans through the Mexican border (what happened to using a helo?!).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew,"The premise of Denis Villeneuve's latest picture SICARIO sounds like a top-form police procedural, a CIA elite squad vs. a Mexican drug cartel, Emily Blunt plays Kate, acts a surrogate for audience, who is an FBI SWAT agent, wide-eyed but enterprising in her field of work, volunteers to join the special division, lead by Matt Graver (Brolin), to track down the big boss behind the cartel in Mexico. But as the film explains in its first scene, SICARIO means hit-man in Spanish, so who is this hit-man? This is a vital question.We faithfully empathises Kate's perplexity as the mission goes on, where she begins to question the unorthodox method of Matt and Alejandro (del Toro), Matt's partner, and is constantly aggravated by being kept in the dark about their black ops. But the whole process will eventually evolve into a shock treatment for her idealistic faith, what behind the whole plan is beyond her widest imagination and comprehension, after being nearly strangled to death, shot by her own people and hectored to sign her signature to approve something sheer against her principle, until her final scene, a silent capitulation aptly and soundingly strikes the bull's-eye, a tough lesson about the unapologetic nihilism of our present society, which very likely is also the inconvenient truth. Emily Blunt pluckily takes up the gauntlet to challenge the glass ceiling, materialises as a tower of strength in this men's business, a tragic heroine, solemnly stomaches a nasty reality check.Josh Brolin plays in his comfort zone with his craftiness and insolence, whose opportunistic characteristic positions Matt's seemingly-righteous métier in a grey zone. But the film's MVP title unequivocally belongs to del Toro's Alejandro, stuns with his all-out reserved gravitas and a steely resolution for retribution, gradually reveals his true colours as a cut-throat angel-of-death and a proficient marksman in the third act (he is the said hit-man we are looking for), leads towards a series breathless encounters with the wrongdoers of the drug ring and an ultimate face-to-face with Kate, he is the most chilling character on screen after Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007), if ever the movie will collect any Oscar love in the acting branch, he is the most entitled one.After his Hollywood one-two punch PRISONERS (2013) and ENEMY (2013), Villeneuve's directorial finesse again being appraised here, and he is such a first-rate ambiance deviser, together with the assistance of Jóhann Jóhannsson's stirring score, the thumping drumbeat in the opening is so palpable to set the mood upon that right vibe, yet, Villenueve knows the boundary, he doesn't overly resort to shock value to keep audience on the edge of the seat, which is brilliantly testified by the opening gambit with exchanges of fire, sudden explosion and ghastly cadavers. In a much wiser strategy, he makes good use of DP Deakins' majestic camera-work to varnish the film with a sublime tinge of poise and magnificence, like the breathtaking aerial shots, striking environmental palettes or the novel usages of thermal vision and night vision frames, they are where cinema finds its most glorious and enthralling achievement, a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew, soon he will become a juggernaut in the Hollywood industry, and his next project on the slate is the long-waited sequel of BLADE RUNNER (1982), since it might actually be the rare kind that does not sully its predecessor's reputation, shall we all drink to that?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Average.,I saw this film in a big cinema complex for over ten bucks. I sat through a 'pre show' that seemed to go on forever and seemed to be aimed squarely at younger teens with Blackberries. I found that depressing especially since the film was aimed at adults not at younger teens. After what seemed like an eternity and after a handful of not that interesting looking new movie previews the feature finally came on. When it was over I thought it was a very average film. I am a fan of Emily Blunt & one or two others in this film but I thought that despite its impressive casting it was basically nothing special. There have been quite a few films made about the drug war that exists along the Mexico/USA border and this one doesn't really say anything new. People get killed and them some more people get killed et cetera et cetera. You would think that by this time they would be creating more sophisticated plot lines. Apparently not. This film offers no hope for a brighter future for any of the characters it depicts in the movie and offers no solutions to any of the problems it includes in its plot line. Frustrating cinema disguised as nouveau intelligence stuff. This film has about three action sequences in the whole thing which last a total of about three minutes-also not the best action orientated film ever made. Not a dog but in the ballpark.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sicario... In Mexico it Means Hit-man,"After getting awestruck by Denis Villeneuve's Incendies (2010), I told myself I will see anything made by him. The spellbinding Prisoners (2013) came next followed closely by the only slight misstep Enemy (2014). Villeneuve is no flash in the pan. He has a terrific knack of grabbing you by the neck and slowly wringing it until you go white hot with nerve- wrecking tension.I think the armrest of GV@Suntec Cinema 6, Seat G10 might have been broken by me because I had practically gripped and shaken it for 2 hours straight. This is one taut, lean and mean thriller. Every shot by DP Roger Deakins holds so much indescribable menace. Even a shot of a boy rolling a ball across table had my heart in my mouth thinking that a shot would ring out and his brains would splatter all over the dining table. A slow building wide shot of a looming mountain feels like it could explode anytime. Innocuous delicate scenes become fierce, primal and shattering in scope. They are almost Hitchcockian but yet they are their own entity. Nobody does white-knuckled mounting suspense like Villeneuve.Our heart and mind is aligned with Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she leads a tactical team to storm a house near the Mexican border which ends up blowing in the faces of the team, literally. She is our moral compass as she becomes continually torn in how justice is not meted out by the book. Blunt is great in the role and she continues her amazing streak as a steel-edged lady justice figure with aplomb. As much as she is our 'go-to' character in the story, it is Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who is the spanner in the works, the winning wild card. His intriguing role outshines Blunt's in spades. When he finally becomes the namesake in the film title (in Mexico, 'sicaro' means hit-man), your jaw would have dropped to the floor. Villeneuve's superb foreshadowing is masterclass. At one early point he says to Kate: ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears. You will doubt what we do. But, in the end, it will make sense."" As much as these slightly condescending words are meant for Kate, they are also meant for us.Unlike the rest of Villeneuve's oeuvres, the action scenes here are more explosive than the drama. There are a few stupendous highlights like the fugitive extraction scene and the tunnel storming sequence, which any action movie cinephile would happily deconstruct with schoolboy glee. Villeneuve is helped by Roger Deakins' superb cinematography. His deft play with light, shadows and washed out colours is itself a character in the movie. If this doesn't earn Deakins his thirteenth Oscar nomination, I won't watch any movie for one year! Coupled with Jóhann Jóhannsson's pulsating score, Sicario is one of the essential must-sees this year. Perhaps the only quibbles I have is its doggedly opaque story that requires some work from you and its lack of a higher meaning. It is still not quite the perfect marriage between pure adrenaline action and high cathartic drama that I had wished for. Maybe, the Bladerunner sequel will be the one. I await its arrival in reverence.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

An amazingly disturbing look at the war against narcotics trafficking,"'You saw things you shouldn't have seen.'Walking into the cinema... With all of the discussion on border control and the effects of the drug trade in the United States, Sicario could be redundant or timely.Overall Rating: 4 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Bigger questions rating: 4 starsSicario: The name for first century Jewish zealots who desired to eliminate their Roman invaders, but was later taken on within Latin American culture to mean assassin or hit-man.The life of an FBI agent on the US / Mexican border is a mixture of drug cartels and immigration law that never seems to come to an end. Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) leads a task force to find hostages who have been caught in the crossfire of this international legal battlefield. After an horrific situation on the job, she considers that there seems to be no end to this war. Afterwards, in what seems to be a debrief of the situation, she is given the opportunity to be part of a secretive task force that uses tactics to 'dramatically overreact' to the cartels and bring their leaders to justice. The unorthodox task force is lead by Matt (Josh Brolin), a CIA operative and includes the dark, enigmatic Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). They lead a mercenary troop to make noise and cause chaos against the seemingly insurmountable narcotic hoards. Kate realises that their methods of initiating justice are beyond her comfort level and initially wants out. Yet, seeing the opportunity to inflict justice on these criminal leaders keeps her on board until the mission is complete. An internal and external battle ensues for the FBI agent when she realises that the lines of ethics are blurred in achieving the results desired by the all of the governments involved.Stories like Sicario that centre on law enforcement agencies and their challenges with drug lords continue to show that there are no clear winners in this war. It is a brilliantly portrayed drama, but carries with it the travesties that occur on this battleground. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) manages to provide a realistic glimpse into this continual fight through a well-crafted script, stellar performances from the lead actors and unsettling cinematography that provides the sweltering feel to the film. He manages to apply the appropriate pressure to effectively communicate this story with the disturbing realism. This realistic style shows that there are no winners on either side of this shadowy world. Villeneuve does not glorify the drug dealing or its usage, but shows that idealism may have to be compromised in the delivery of justice. Through effective story-telling he exposes the ethical dilemmas that occur throughout the various roles of law enforcement. Also, the subplots that are inner mixed throughout the film show that there is no such thing as a victimless crime when it comes to purchasing illegal drugs. Sicario delivers a well told story that will leave audiences entertained, but will leave them unsettled by the message that lacks any ethical answers or hope.This narcotic narrative provides a multitude of intersections with moral and ethical discussion points. At the heart of every plot point there is an underlying message that there are no moral absolutes. The central characters of Sicario have to live without the comfort of a clearly defined right and wrong, which proves to be exceptionally unsettling. Outside the cinema, it is not a stretch to see that most of God's good creation has been tainted with evil. Even with that reality, that does not mean that people have to live without belief in truth. The Bible allows for hope and truth to pervade throughout this lifetime and into eternity. Even though the plot of this film leaves little hope for this world, thankfully we do not have to live that way with God being involved in all aspects of this world.Leaving the cinema... This is a brilliant film, but it will not appeal to anyone with a weak constitution. The acting and direction are superb, but the heart of the story exists in a world without ethics or humanity and is exceptionally hopeless.REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Can we find truth in this world? (John 14:6, 1 Corinthians 13:4-6) 2. Can we ever find justice? (Proverbs 21:15, Romans 12:19) 3. Is revenge ever justified?

"""Male"" Film from a Female Point of View.....Sort Of","In a year in which the movie industry is being raked over the coals for not being diverse enough, ""Sicario"" had the opportunity to give us a woman's perspective on a genre generally reserved for macho men. And it makes good on that opportunity for a while, but in the end, the film's decision to drop its female protagonist and let events play out in a very traditional and male way makes it one of the bigger disappointments of my movie year.Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent who's recruited to join an inter-department task force whose objective is to take out a Mexican drug lord. Her role on the team is left intentionally vague, both to her and to us, for most of the movie; not until the film's last third do we learn that she's there so that the CIA can basically dot its ""i""s and cross its ""t""s in establishing clearance for doing whatever it needs to do, much of it illegal, to control the situation.Stories about idealistic folk who wake up to the questionable motives and methods of whatever cause they've aligned themselves with are a dime a dozen -- just earlier this year the movie ""'71"" covered the same thematic ground but set it against the backdrop of the IRA conflict in Ireland. But for its first half or so, ""Sicario"" feels like a fresh approach to the subject, mostly because it's told from a female point of view. Emily Blunt is a very good actress, and though she's not given perhaps as full a character as she could have been, she's given enough to work with and she does well with it. But toward the end, the film decides it's no longer interested in her, and it instead follows Benicio Del Toro's CIA double agent while he carries out criminal acts in the name of U.S. justice, and that's where the movie lost me a bit. It wouldn't have bothered me so much had not the movie leading up to that been told exclusively from Blunt's point of view. We don't see any events that she herself isn't present to witness. The change in perspective is jarring and disappointing.""Sicario"" is far from a total loss. It's quite a well made film and though it didn't live up to the potential it established for itself, I still enjoyed it. But how much more I might have enjoyed it had it lived up to its promise.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Surprisingly good and more complex than its peers,"Certainly a surprise film of the year, Sicario delves into the sensitive subject of the escalating war against drugs that have become a daily occurrence for those near the border between the U.S. and Mexico.A member of the kidnapping division in Arizona, Kate (Emily Blunt) is brought onto a special operations unit funded by the Department of Defense after a devastating and jarring blow to her team. Immediately whisked away on a mission; Kate observes with an outsider's eyes the happenings of this covert unit, the sole woman amongst men. Thrust into the deadly and brutal world of the drug cartels of Juarez Mexico, Kate realizes that her idealism has no place as her new assigned unveils itself as far from ethical. With fresh eyes and a purist's motivation, Kate must make her own judgments of trust if she wants to stay alive during this dangerous operation.Sicario is a film I wasn't expecting. The military oriented subject matter is not normally my forte and the trailer for the film felt generic. Alas, quickly the praising whispers for the film grew too loud to ignore and right they were. Sicario is a film that commands your attention with its barbaric violence, brutally realistic point of view and its astonishing cinematography.Directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, the film decisively sets the tone within seconds of opening, readying the audience for what they are about to see. Sicario is a film that jolts you with unease, telling you to forget whatever expectations you may have. It is about far more than the mission Kate embarks upon with the DoD, and its ability to harmoniously tell its complexly layered story is a testament to its success.The best word to describe Sicario is 'intense.' It is jarring, disorienting, and raw. Sicario easily could have been a basic thriller with a military shoot 'em up component. In having Villeneuve direct, the films subtler points are brought to the forefront. Each character is multidimensional and each moment a scene to be watched, within it the plot nuances that lesser films so often forget. The protagonist Kate especially has a marvelous arc throughout the film that matches the audience member's own experience and grounds you further to be completely engaged with the film.May you remember the film years from now? Perhaps not, but for those looking for a worthy film to entertain with a little bit for everyone to enjoy, Sicario is certainly it.Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews for reviews of all the awards season contenders.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film's exploration of the drug trade prompts contemplation on its long-term consequences, questioning whether it will forever plague humanity and the toll it will take on future generations.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is the land of wolves now.,"Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, the leader of a rescue response unit with the FBI. She gets recruited for a major offensive against drug cartels in Mexico, having to work for some very cagey people. The guy in charge is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), and he's not forthcoming with many details. She also must deal with an enigmatic stranger named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), along for the ride in some sort of advisory capacity. There will be some surprises in store for Kate as she embarks upon this sordid journey.The term ""Sicario"" gets explained at the outset; in Mexico, it's the word for ""hitman"". That lets us know that we're going to be in for something a bit different. You won't see the sort of typical action-movie treatment of such material. In fact, there are no real action set pieces to speak of. In their place, we get a nuanced, low-key, somewhat grounded drama of cops vs. crooks. We also get a narrative (written by Taylor Sheridan) in which ""good"" guys aren't always so clearly defined, and where you have people like Graver, whose job it is to sort of ""shake things up"" so that drug lords like Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo) deviate from their usual patterns. In the end, this war on drugs reduces some people to utterly ruthless and cold-blooded methods.Director Denis Villeneuve never tries to dazzle you. His filmmaking efficiency is of a more matter-of-fact style, as he eases you into the story bit by bit. There is a fairly devastating explosion (and loss of life) near the beginning that does influence Kates' actions for the rest of the picture, and a decent shootout in traffic as obviously unsavoury types are spotted by the authorities.Extremely well shot (the cinematography is by Roger Deakins, so that comes as no surprise), it features good acting by a cast also including Victor Garber (""Titanic"" '97), Jon Bernthal ('The Walking Dead'), Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out""), Jeffrey Donovan ('Burn Notice'), and Raoul Max Trujillo (""Apocalypto""). Blunt is fine as an idealistic young woman who gets an eye-opening, Brolin is pretty amusing, and Del Toro is excellent as he gives a very controlled performance.Much tragedy and devastation has been the result of decades of drug wars, and ""Sicario"" illustrates this quite well.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Journey Between Tension and Realism,"The depiction of violence in the film is so realistically handled that some scenes can be quite disturbing. At times, it seems as if the film is excessively portraying Mexico negatively, perhaps to praise America. Yes, there are areas in Mexico with high crime rates, but under Denis Villeneuve's direction, Sicario successfully transcends these challenges, captivating its audience thoroughly. Although not an explosive action film, the action scenes it does offer are sufficient and impactful. If you are in search of a thought-provoking narrative with elements of suspense, Sicario is definitely a must-watch. Every scene demonstrates how the director can transform this genre into an impressive form of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A True Genius,"I know very little about the director of this movie, so I am not going to get all pro-critic on you guys. That said, this movie was a fantastic thriller that leaves you at the edge of your seat.The cast was very good, I did however fall in love with Benecio Del Toro's character. I think he really nailed the part. The film really hammers home the reality of life in Mexico especially for those living in Cartel controlled areas. It also highlighted for me an important point... The so called good guys are forever crossing lines, that the lines are now so blurred, that I don't think any of it matters anymore. It is question of satisfying egos and showing off muscle. Politics out of it, this was an enjoyable watch, it could have almost been a Ridley Scott. I expected an average flick instead I got a possible classic.After watching Star Wars Force Awakens, this was a welcome relief. I recommend this for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Poorly made flick, as anyone knowing the subject will recognize","First, the female protagonist (played by Blunt) is not credible at all; very unrealistic. She's supposed to be the head of an FBI SWAT team, which would suggest a tough person but she is a wimp at every turn, totally bewildered by violence and the nuances of drug enforcement. She also lives/works in Arizona and seems to know nothing about the cartels or drug war politics. It's an insult to the viewer (and to women in general) to have such a character as lead in a movie like this. Total disappointment in this regard.Second, the plot line is not credible. Rather than spoil the storyline (for those who haven't seen the flick), I'll just say that the big gunfight/conflict scene toward the end is completely unnecessary given the ultimate goal of the operation. In fact, real law enforcement would have avoided such unpredictable and unnecessary complications. So that part is total Hollywood crap, and could easily have been avoided.Finally, the ultimate goal of the operation is not credible. Again, not to spoil it for anyone, I'll just say that the goal is completely unbelievable given the international politics of the drug war. A similar goal could have been credible but the one used shows the film's writer and director and producers know little about the subject.So, overall a very poorly made flick, and a disappointment for those who value realism.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Death, Drugs and the Human Tragedy","One of the ace Action/Thrillers ""Sicario"" is an unflinching glimpse into the dark side of society that most would rather not know. A female FBI agent with a rookie colleague are assigned into an operation on quelling the activities of a drug cartel on the U. S.-Mexico border. Matters immediately turn unexpectedly for the AA hires as events unfurl to neither their understanding or liking as they discover they're way out of their depth in the complex and dangerous situation at hand. The on-point acting, solid directing and ominous, menacing soundtrack elevate this compelling crime story to quite a riveting treat. Emily Blunt gets it right as the annoying and deluded Kate Macer while the flippant Josh Brolin and beta orbiter Daniel Kaluuya shine respectively in their respective roles. But perhaps it's Benicio del Toro as the haunted and world weary Alejandro Gillick who embodies the human tragedy of the film his personal trek sombrely revealed as the story unfolds. Gripping from start to finish ""Sicario"" is one of the standouts in cinema its simplicity and understated delivery amplifying the disturbing and unsettling reality of the world we live in.

Had to watch it twice to allow me to write this review,"REVIEW - SICARIOWas told about this 2015 film from a guy who I work with who loved it so much he went out and bought the DVD.Finally got round to watching it.Whilst the story is interesting with a few twists it doesn't really grab and keep your attention which is important for a film like this because it is a story you have to follow.Had to watch the film twice to allow me to write this review.Ok nothing special, interesting worth watching, couldn't happen in red life but certainly entertaining.2 gripes which stood out, hence why I had to watch the film twice.The police officer who wore the Green and Pink wrist band, we the audience saw him taking a call after the FBI or whoever they were froze all of the money but how did the female FBI officer know about the wrist band and another thing, as they were drinking in the bar how did she not see the wrist band sooner.But the main gripe for me was the female FBI agent, why was she even there?

Just a good movie,"I enjoyed this film. Cinematography is fantastic. The acting is brilliant. Especially I liked the characters played by Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro.But I think that it's just a good action movie for an evening. It could have stronger detective and dramatic line. Even action scenes could be more interesting. And unlike other Denis Villeneuve films, ""Sicario"" will not blow your mind or make you reconsider something.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant cinematography and dark realism,"Sicario is an enigma: some of the film is near perfect (notably the border crossing scene), striking the right balance of tension and drama, without losing realism. The portrayal of cartel-controlled Mexico is bleak and unforgiving, creating an appropriate sense of paranoia and isolating the American soldiers sent across the border. Unfortunately, between these scenes, there is a lack of meaningful storyline - Emily Blunt's character seems miscast, constantly unaware of the situation. Whilst (to an extent) this makes sense, as the film progresses this begins to drag somewhat.The real character of interest is undoubtedly the understated mercenary Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), someone connected to the cartels but with his own personal stake in the matter; his introduction scene (involving some suggested torture) is darkly realistic, and his motives remain a mystery until the very end. This, however, is part of the issue with Sicario - the ""take down the drugs trade from the inside"" plot device feels unimportant until you realise the underlying goal of the mission, preventing this film from really exceeding expectations. Whilst no doubt interesting, not engaging with the story makes enjoying Sicario more difficult than necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I watched this 3 times in a row,"I've never watched a movie 3 times in a row on the same day. Sicario was the first.The first time I was quite annoyed with it. I felt that Emily Blunt's character Kate ruined what could have been a perfectly good action-thriller starring Brolin and Del Toro.The second and third time I realized that the movie was good exactly because she was there. Not because her character's either likeable or relatable (at least that's what I think), but because we see the scary scenes through her eyes. In other words, she makes the scenes scary.Some criticize her character of being one-dimensional, and I thought so too, initally. But then I realized that her character HAS to be one-dimensional. That's precisely the point of the plot. That's why she's wrong on a lot of things, and that's why she can't handle the realism that shatters her idealism.Expect to see a thriller/drama, first and foremost. There's action too, but unlike it's sequel, Sicario's not your ""typical"" straightforward action movie. Its direction style's very addictive, and I notice new things each time I see the movie.The reason why I don't give it a 10/10 is because I do think it's a mistake that Emily Blunt's character Kate leads a kidnap response team, kicking in doors. To really emphasize the difference between Kate's world and the world of Brolin and Del Toro, she should've had a desk job.Other than that, Sicario's very raw and realistic - almost like a documentary - and without any cheesy one-liners or other action movie cliches.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fantastic performances, and Villenueve directs another great film","""In Mexico SICARIO means Hit-man""'Sicario' is an Action Thriller / Crime Drama that follows an FBI agent who gets thrown into a war against the drug cartels operating along the border of the US and Mexico. Apart from the stellar cast leading the film, i was most excited to see this film because of it being directed by Denis Villenueve. For those of you who don't know, he directed 2013's 'Prisoners' and 2014's 'Enemy', both are incredibly fantastic films that were directed to near perfection and you should definitely check out. This was still a fantastically directed film by Villenueve, but compared to those films i just mentioned, this one has many other flaws that didn't make it quite as intense as i hoped it would be from seeing the trailers. If you are looking for a fast paced, high octane action thriller, this is not it. Much like his previous films, this is a very character driven story where the film at times is carried on the backs of the amazing performances by Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Despite these praises, there are elements of the film that i didn't enjoy and harmed my overall experience with the film.The film started off very promising, it showed off some some of the thriller elements whilst also introducing our characters and the main overall plot of the film which was pretty meh up until the last third of the film. I was initially intrigued by what was going on and wanted to find out more about what is really going on behind the scenes, especially with Del Toro's character. But for almost the entire second act of the film, i found myself checking my phone a few times because it dragged on and on and didn't look to be ending any time soon. It had some short moments that were quite interesting in terms of character development and getting me a little more interested in the plot. But overall, the second act wasn't all that compelling to watch like the rest of the film was. I feel like they tried to do a lot to set up the finale, and just the way it was structured became an issue for me. A lot of scenes didn't quite make sense and took me out of it a bit. It all ran at a fairly slow pace which i was expecting but there were no dramatic or intense tones to get me engaged with what was going on, apart from one or two moments. A lot of this middle section relied purely on the performances of Blunt, Brolin, and Del Toro, and even though they were fantastic it wasn't enough to make me enjoy this section. It's hard to explain, but just a lot of the writing in this section looks and sounds good on paper, but the execution wasn't great.That being said, the last 30 minutes of this movie....... SPECTACULAR. Not going to give anything away but it all hits the fan from a storytelling standpoint, a character standpoint and an action thriller standpoint and this really saved the film for me. All of the little bits and pieces that were set up throughout the film come full circle and you realise a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense earlier make total sense now, such as 'why is the film even called Sicario?....... **You know what, stuff this, i'm gonna revoke some of the things i have mentioned so far MID REVIEW but not edit it out, because thinking about the end, and then thinking about what happened earlier is making me realise that this film was a lot smarter and well crafted than i thought it was 5 minutes ago. I obviously can't talk about any of the things i am thinking about, but this is probably going to make me watch it again like i did with 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy', and i reckon i might enjoy it more the second time, only time will tell.But as i mentioned before, the performances of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro were all absolutely fantastic. I am not necessarily surprised because they are all incredible actors but in this film when they came together no-one took anything away from the others' performances. One did stand out well above the others but it didn't make me love the other performances less, if anything each performance added to the others. There is also quite a bit of talent in the supporting roles but due to the scope of these three large actors always commanding the screen they will most likely go largely unnoticed.In the end, Sicario is a film that definitely not everyone will appreciate. It is more than an action thriller and incorporates great amounts of drama, and plenty of intense moments. The second act of the film whilst watching it did really hurt my enjoyment of the film in the moment, but as i mentioned, it didn't bother me nearly as much and i actually now praise some of the decisions they made. If you like Villenueve's previous films this one is not quite up to par but you can still see a lot of his signature all over this film and that is what i enjoyed about it. - 7.2",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a breathtaking ride!,"Sicario.An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U. S. and Mexico.Sicario, When it's more than just a normal crime/action movie , it's about honesty, responsibility and trust , a very breathtaking ride for two hours, in the middle of the mess, the chaos in the American Mexican borders, I probably haven't seen anything alike ,or precisely anything better ,when it comes to this genre and especially when it comes to violence and gore this movie was very explicit.Once again, what could be more remarkable about a Denis Villeneuve's film than his actual directing, this man can work on different genres and its always the same outstanding results, a visually stunning film, the cinematography, the steady camera shots, the wide shots ... Denis style.The cast itself was a surprise, Emily Blunt did well, but man! Benicio Del Toro ...

That said, Berthnal gets higher ranking than Kalua in the credits???The style and sound of this film is fantastic and matches an extremely slick story.

Great performances in a gripping and entertaining film,"Emily Blunt ('Looper') plays Kate Mercer who is a US Police officer tracing down hostages. As the Mexican drug cartels up their game and bring death and destruction to mainland USA she gets picked to help an elite team to take on the bad guys.She is introduced to Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who takes her by, the proverbial, hand and they head off for a mission that she grows ever more uncomfortable with as she starts to realise they may not be playing strictly by the rules.**Mild spoiler Alert** Now this is a fairly mainstream and has had a lot more 'press' from my normal fare in films. However, for once the 'hype' is actually well deserved. Benicio Del Toro is sublime playing the avenging gun for hire. There is a palpable tension for a great majority of the film and whilst there is some violence it is actually fairly tame – on the whole that is. It is though a very well made film that will have you gripped. It makes a passing attempt at the 'victims' being everyone but mostly it is a 'them or us' scenario from the start and through out. This still comes up as being a rather good film – so I can easily recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Watch but drags in parts! 7/10,"Review: I must admit, I did think that this movie was going to be much better than it was. I loved the scenes at the end, when Del Toro became a one man army on a mission but the rest of the movie was slightly boring. Emily Blunt plays an FBI Agent, Kate Macer, who finds dozens of bodies hidden in the walls of a house in Arizona, along with her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya). The crime investigating team come across a shed in the backyard, which turns out to be a bomb and detonates, killing 2 officers. Her boss, Dave Jennings (Victor Barber) recommends her to a CIA undercover officer, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), who guarantees that she can get revenge the death of the 2 officers, so she volunteers to join there elite team. They then leave for El Paso in there private jet, we're Kate meets Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) for the first time. When they get to Juarez, they extradite one of Diaz's top men, his brother Guillermo but when they try and cross the border, they sight a group of hit men in a traffic jam, so the elite force kill them on the spot. When they get Guillermo back to base, they torture and interrogate him and he eventually tells them about a tunnel that Diaz uses to ferry drugs into the US. They then return to Arizona and question a group of Mexican migrants who give them some more information about the tunnel. Meanwhile, Reggie and Kate are fed up with being kept in the dark about everything, so Matt tells them that their goal is to cause a disruption in Diaz's drug operations so he will be called back to Mexico to meet his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo). After freezing Diaz's account, Kate tries to build a case against Diaz involving his money transactions but Matt isn't interested in using that route to catch Diaz. She then tries to go to her boss with the evidence but Jennings tells her that they outrank him and if she goes against them, there could be legal repercussions. After a night drinking in a bar, Kate goes home with Reggies friend, Ted (Jon Bertha) and she realises that he has a wristband which is used to bundle Diaz's laundered money. When Ted realises that she knows who he is, she puts up a struggle and tries to shoot him but he knocks the gun away and starts to strangle her. She is then saved by Alejandro, whose was close by, watching her because she exposed herself at the bank. Matt and Alejandro then torture Ted and threaten his friends and family which leads to them getting the names of corrupt cops who are working for Diaz. The next morning, Kate and Reggie realise that they are being used by the elite force, purely to give the CIA the legal ability to operate within US borders. Reggie doesn't want to go any further with the investigation but Kate wants to see the whole thing to the end. After finally getting through the tunnel, Alejandro sneaks through the Mexican side and he kidnaps one of Diaz's mules, whose a corrupt Mexican police officer. Kate follows Alejandro and attempts to arrest him but he shoots her in her bulletproof vest and tells her to return to the US. Matt then tells Kate that Alejandro is only working with them to avenge his murdered wife and daughter. Alejandro then uses the corrupt police officer to catch Diaz and then he kills him and wounds Diaz. Diaz then drives Alejandro to his bosses estate and then he kills Diaz and fights off Alarcon's henchmen. Alarcon is calmly eating dinner with his wife and children and he tells Alejandro that what happened to his family wasn't personal. After killing his family in front of him, he looks Alarcon in the eyes and he shoots him with no remorse. The following day, Alejandro goes to Kate's house and makes her to sign a waiver, by gunpoint, stating that everything that they done was by the book. Kate then attempts to shoot him from her balcony but she ends up letting him walk away. Del Toro is definitely the best character in this movie and his calm demeanour, even though his family was brutally murdered, was great. The only problem that I found with the film is that it takes some time to get going and you don't know what really is going on until the end, so you are kept in suspense through most of the film. Emily Blunt just wants to expose everything before she actually knows what's going on but I did like Josh Brolins character, who used brutal tactics to get the job done. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the ending and I can't wait to see how Del Toro's character will progress in the sequel. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Denis Villeneuve, 48, who brought you Prisoners in 2013, with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal and Enemy which also starred Jake Gyllenhaal. He's rumoured to be directing the next Blade Runner, along with Story of Your Life starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker so he's obviously gained some respect, due to the success of this movie. I liked the way that he showed the different points of view in this movie, like the corrupt cop with his family and there is a sense of authenticity which made it feel real. I just hope they don't mess up the sequel, if they ever do release one!Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $80.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas starring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Jon Bernthal, Victor Garber, Daniel Kaluuya and Jeffrey Donovan. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

More than meets the eye,"Sicario is an incredible thriller that denies you the usual pleasures found in stories of cops vs cartels as a slow burning narrative that's never anything less than thoroughly gripping with an unflinching depiction of both the brutal violence and the way it shows what life is like in a land of wolves. It's the rare film to be crafted by (at least) two distinct auteurs who's sensibilities merge pretty seamlessly.Emily Blunt is phenomenal in an extremely gruelling lead performance since her morality is tested in every way. She's pretty much the sole moral centre with her only backup coming from a reliably great Daniel Kaluuya. She's the perfect audience surrogate as you rarely get more information than her so when everything escalates well beyond her jurisdiction with the context only coming after the action, she's the only anchor.Benicio Del Toro has never been cooler, more intimidating or hard to pin down. He's not usually got this specific set of skills but he's thoroughly convincing here with an element of mystery to him that's only revealed at the very end and makes everything fall into place. Josh Brolin is terrific as someone having too much fun bending the rules however that blasé attitude is not to be tested as is revealed at the end.Dennis Villeneuve's direction can handle the darkest elements really well which is vital as they come thick and fast. The action is amazing because it can deliver visceral thrills without sacrificing the nuance, especially the border crossing sequence. Roger Deakins cinematography is just breathtaking in its compositions. Skylines have rarely been this beautiful and the use of night vision and CCTV is so clever.This screenplay is a perfect showcase for writer Taylor Sheridan's talent. He has a knack for blunt yet poetic dialogue that communicates the film's themes efficiently and spends its time on a seemingly unrelated small scale subplot that weaves back into the main plot at the ideal moment. Jóhann Jóhannsson delivers his best ever score thanks to its gradually building haunting nature that's unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
No simple good guys versus bad guys movie,"""Sicario"" is about the war on drugs in the borderregion between the United States and Mexico. On the part of the government of the Unites States this war is fought by a special task force.In relation to the activities of this task force several ethical questions are raised in ""Sicario"".1) To what extent does the goal justifies the means?2) To what extent can a government organisation ignore the rule of law?3) Which results can be obtained within the rule of law?These questions are explored using three main characters.A) Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who lost two colleagues in an action to free hostages. The wish to take revenge for these two colleagues is an important motivation to join the task force. Initially she knows very little about the specific mission of this task force.B) Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a Colombian who has lost his wife and daughter in the battle against the drug cartels. Private revenge is his main motivation to work with the task force. He is the hitman (sicaria in Mexico) from whom the film derives its title.C) Silvio (Maximiliano Hernandez), is a corrupt Mexican police officer. He is rather low in the ranks of the drugs maffia, so the revenues of his corruption are just enough to support his family.As will be obvious from the above discription ""Sicario"" gives us not a black and white story of good guys (the government) fighting against bad guys (the drug cartel). For that the chracters of especially Alejandro and Silvio contain too many shades of gray.While working out the chracters in some detail, the film doesn't really answer the questions posed above.With respect to question 1 (how much can you ingnore the law as governemt organisation and remain legitimate) it only shows a situation in which it is allowed to government officials to fight private vendetta's. It is obvious that this situation can't be the answer.Question 2 is only touched upon at the beginning of the movie (but not anwered) when an action according to the book causes two policemen to lose their lives.Requesting an anwer to the questions maybe is too high a standard expected from the film. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012, Kathryn Bigelow) poses more or less the same questions in relation to the hunt for Al Qaeda, and doesn't answer them either. In a philosophy course Yale professor Ian Shapiro rephrased the question as ""How to fight a bully without becoming one?"" and also didn't reach a definitive answer. Maybe only posing the question is already more than enough to give the movie credit for.Apart from this philosophical treatment of the film, the cinematography of Roger Deakins is (as usual) very beautiful. On top of that there are some very tense scenes. I am thinking especially of the prisoner transport scene at the beginning of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Drug war film views government action: sublime direction, acting, photography","Denis Villeneuve, the Canadian-born director of French background, is one of the finest directors in today's cinema - no mean feat, given that CGI has had an ever more devastating effect on film-making. One distinctive plus: Villeneuve seeks credible, well rounded characters - no flat ones, lacking logical cause and effect. Taylor Sheridan's script quite clearly provides a solid platform for achieving those aims.Acting rates top notch and it helps, too: Emily Blunt successfully portrays a rookie still imbued with righteous ideals in a US Government team determined to hit the drug cartels in Mexico. A completely factual, unfazed yet smiling Josh Brolin complete with slippers masterminds the operation, Benicio del Toro is Alejandro, the non-US member of the team who does the nitty gritty, driven by a desire to avenge his wife and daughter diluted in an acid vat by the cartel. The dinner scene where he carries out his revenge is truly unforgettable.Sublime direction by Villeneuve also rests on superior cinematography by Roger Deakins, editing by Joe Walker, and musical score by Johan Johannsson.I have watched SICARIO at least once every year since it came out in 2015, and I find it one of the best films to have come out of the first quarter of the 21st Century. It sequel, SICARIO- DAY OF THE SOLDADO, is not nearly as good. Though Brolin and del Toro post excellent performances, it misses the central figure of Emily Blunt, and it is not directed by Villeneuve. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

An intense and potent criminal thriller,"Sicario is an intense and potent criminal thriller that delves into the murky world of the drug cartels that operate along the border between the United States and Mexico. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio del Toro feature in the movie, which recounts the narrative of an idealistic FBI agent who is recruited to join a hidden task force on a mission to take down a formidable cartel boss. The film was directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars those three actors.As the film's main character, Blunt gives a performance that is powerful and subtle, while Brolin and del Toro also put in superb supporting performances to back her up. The action scenes are tight and well planned, and the cinematography, which was done by Roger Deakins, is just magnificent.However, what distinguishes Sicario from other crime thrillers is the film's investigation of intricate moral topics and the ambiguous boundaries between good and evil. The screenplay, written by Taylor Sheridan, is not only insightful but also very well written, and it forces the viewer to think about the effects of the choices made by the characters.Sicario is a noteworthy picture that is heightened by its outstanding acting, breathtaking cinematography, and thought-provoking writing. Overall, the film is a highlight. Fans of the subgenre, as well as everyone else interested in a suspenseful and thought-provoking thriller, absolutely must miss this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Flashy, exciting and perfectly portrayed? Yep. A bit disappointing? Yep.","""You're asking me how a watch works. For now, just keep an eye on the time.""""Sicario"" was kind of a disappointment for me. Despite my admiration for director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners"" was an excellent film), the presence of a high-profile and talented cast and an inviting trailer (although I scrupulously shun trailers), I thought this one wasn't really original and impressive. Maybe the trailer has put me on the wrong foot. That sinister and morbid beginning with those corpses stashed in plastic, made an immense impression on me. This combined with the flashy and clever scene where you see a convoy of pitch black SUV's making their way through a crowded highway with an action-packed ending subsequently, made sure I was eagerly looking forward to seeing this film.The film certainly is excellent. But haven't we seen this kind of ""war against seemingly elusive Mexican drug cartels"" before? Particularly the kind of movies where corruption and deliberate lies play a major role. With manipulative officials and field workers who have their own agenda. It's all exciting, hard and ominous in this realistic ""war on drugs"" film, set in the blistering hot deserts of Mexico. The three main characters are a mixture of different characters. Emily Blunt (who played outstanding in ""Edge of Tomorrow"", where she showed that she effortlessly could handle a physically grueling role) as the FBI agent Kate Macer, assisting two experts in this hopeless struggle. The first one is Josh ""Oldboy"" Brolin as the dead calm Matt digger who never shows the back of his tongue. And then there's also Benicio del Torro as the mysterious acting Alejandro. Three masterfully played leading roles who are dancing, on the sound of a mariachi band, a complicated and politically charged Mexican dance.But as mentioned earlier, it didn't impress me that much. Certainly not in the same way as ""Prisoners"". It's a rough and (figuratively) ugly film. But gorgeous and endlessly beautiful imaged. But the stereotypical characters are also introduced again. The head of a cartel enjoying a wonderful supper together with his family in a huge, imposing hacienda while his paltry and violent troops do the dirty work. A fragile FBI agent who again must stand her ground between the more robust and more imposing males. And finally it's just another divide and conquer story in which the boundaries of morality are shifted again. Nothing new under the blazing Mexican sun.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A tense and gripping thriller weighed down by its one-dimensional villains.,"Sicario is a slow-burning, intense thriller that delivers on tension but falls a bit short when it comes to depth. The story follows an idealistic FBI agent thrown into the brutal world of cartel warfare, where the lines between right and wrong blur fast. The setup is great, and the film builds tension well, but the lack of depth in the cartel, who are the driving force behind the protagonist's struggles, makes it hard to fully invest in the stakes. While some might appreciate the detached, shadowy approach to the villains, it left me feeling disconnected from the mission itself.Denis Villeneuve's direction is top-notch, making every scene feel deliberate and atmospheric. The cinematography, led by Roger Deakins, is absolutely stunning, using light, shadow, and vast landscapes to create a haunting visual experience. The action sequences are raw and realistic, with a standout border crossing scene that might be one of the best in modern thrillers. The script, while solid in terms of structure, doesn't fully flesh out the antagonists, making the conflict feel one-sided.The performances carry the film, with Emily Blunt doing a great job portraying a character out of her depth, even if her arc feels frustrating at times. Benicio del Toro is the real standout, bringing a cold, quiet intensity that dominates every scene he's in. Josh Brolin nails his role as the laid-back but ruthless government operative, adding just the right amount of charisma. The score, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, is heavy and ominous, perfectly complementing the film's mood. Overall, Sicario is technically brilliant, but its lack of depth in key areas holds it back from being truly great, for me, at least.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Land of Wolves,"Greetings again from the darkness. Really good thrillers – the kind that make our palms sweat and cause us to forget to blink - are increasingly rare in the world of cinema these days. Writer Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't choose the good guys, but instead highlights the terror and lack of rules and morality that guide the border wars and drug cartels. It turns out the border isn't the only line being crossed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) elevates Sheridan's excellent script further with a strong cast and some outstanding camera work from the best Director of Photography working today, Roger Deakins.The opening sequence is about as tense as anything we could ever hope for on screen, and it introduces us to FBI Agent Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. We soon learn Kate is a focused and dedicated tactical expert, who also happens to be idealistic enough to believe the raids conducted by her team are making a difference  at least until this belief is later challenged.Kate quickly finds herself ""volunteering"" for a special task force with muddled goals, uncertain tactics, and secretive leadership. Josh Brolin plays Matt, the leader of the team. He charms his way through answering Kate's questions without offering any substantive intel. When asked about the mission objective, Matt responds with ""to create chaos"" and a smirk. Adding to her confusion and wariness is the mysterious ""consultant"" Alejandro (the ""hitman"" of the title) played by Benecio Del Toro. Part of the brilliance of the script is that everyone seems to know what's happening except Kate and us (the viewers)! Our understanding comes through the slow-drip method and keeps us fully engaged.Similarities to both Zero Dark Thirty and Apocalypse Now struck me as the film progressed, but the sheer number of stress-inducing sequences set this apart as something different. A family dinner with a drug lord is one of the more fascinating and tension-packed scenes of the year. The moral complexity is thought-provoking, and the abundance of corruption and politics in relation to the cartels and war on drugs, leave us wondering not just whether this war can be won, but through what methods is it being fought.""Welcome to Juarez"", says Alejandro, as the SUV motorcade makes its way past the remnants of a brutal crime scene. Although there are some tremendous sequences of tactical raids (and the best traffic jam you've seen), this should not be labeled as an action film  it's so much more. Ms. Blunt's character is the conscience of the film, but it's Brolin's Matt that makes us curious as to his background and motivation. And as interesting as are those two characters, they pale in comparison to Benecio's man on a mission. Del Toro doesn't act frequently, but he possesses the gift that has him dominating the screen  forcing our eyes to follow his every movement. Rumors have a prequel in the works that will focus on Alejandro's roots. It's the ""land of wolves"", and Alejandro is an alpha.Lastly, it must be stated that the film is a technical treat. The unique score from Johann Johannsson is never overbearing, and often mimics our pounding hearts. It's worth taking note. Best of all is the work of the great Roger Deakins. His photography is astounding and this could be his best work yet. The desert landscapes are just as crucial as the claustrophobic raids or the impromptu strategy sessions, and Deakins puts us right where we need to be. As a companion piece to this excellent film, I would recommend Matthew Heineman's extraordinary documentary from earlier this year, Cartel Land.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Different Story Structure Creates Strong Tension,"This film is supposed to center on the FBI agent Emily Blunt being lured into an undercover drug operation. Her character represents the audience, and the screenplay toys with us (and her) hinting at larger things going on. With military interdictions on foreign soil, you will be reminded of recent films like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker"". This film can be rightly called a suspense film more than a thriller, because you are given clues to what the real story is, but are only given bread crumbs of information along the way. This film has more emotionally based photography (by the great Roger Deakins), and a very selective point-of-view as we stick to our vulnerable main character.Emily Blunt, recently seen as a fierce and fearless warrior in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" transforms herself quite believably to a competent but insecure law enforcement officer. The center of the real story is lead by Josh Brolin, who only needs to give you a wink and a smile to let you know that much more is happening, and frequently challenges Blunt to keep going along with the plan, even though the stakes are obviously getting higher.This is one of the better screenplays to be produced, where it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience (we know some kind of dark operation is going on). When danger comes to our main character, we are surprised as much as she is, being lulled into a sense of security. The screenplay seems to instinctively know at what point we need a piece of information to stay engaged. Benicio Del Toro, as always, threatens to steal the movie from our other like-able characters with his mannerisms and general mystique. The ensemble in general has plenty of moments to exert their influence. What is interesting about the structure of this film, is that it is setup to feel like an action flick, but instead finds nuance in the preparation for the big action moments more than the bang and booms usually associated with that type of film. As an outside observer, the photography floats and hovers around the edges, providing more of a glimpse of the meat of the scene. This type of photography wisely represents our main character, who eventually resorts to her own interpretation of what is going on, but struggles by being an outsider from having any control to what is going on.The screenplay creates a third act that is less about Blunt and more about Del Toro's character. What is great about the third act is that finally fleshes out who Del Toro really is, and is responsible for the fireworks that make up the climax. This can be surprising, because it doesn't involve Blunt's character at all. Which is fitting for the screenplay, since in order for it to succeed in maintaining unpredictability in regards to Blunt's exposure to danger, having her involved in the finale would remove that unpredictability. The music provides some good tension-building low tones. Although there are some grim images of violence, I would not consider this film as particularly violent, instead allowing the chatter of preparation and knowledge of the danger to fill the void.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who are you actually working for?,"Director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners"" 2013) crosses the U.S. boarder with under-the-radar agents Matt (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), as they enlist FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) and her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya - ""Johnny English Reborn"") to infiltrate the Mexican Cartel. Unfortunately for the by-the-books FBI agents, the mission is filled with more backstory then they are initially informed. Under Villeneuve's superb direction, the outstanding writing of Taylor Sheridan (""Sons of Anarchy Sons of Anarchy"" - FX), and supported by the eerie sound track of Jóhann Jóhannsson (Composer - ""The Theory of Everything""), Brolin and Del Toro are at their all time best. However, it is Emily Blunt's bad-ass agent persona, who takes all the hits, strives to stand up for her values, and is left to make a decision that may cost her her life. If Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" (2000) or Bryan Singers' ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) are your type of movie, ""Sicaro"" will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

2 interesting characters...dragged down by 1 weak one,"Brolin & Del Toro are the stars of the film, second half of the film is almost exclusively focused on Benny the Bull, and is the best part of the movie.Unfortunately, the first half spends far too much time with Blunt's barely competent FBI agent. Either sitting in dark hotel rooms talking about her bra. Or sitting in dark hotel rooms surfing Google Images, because, you know, that's how FBI agents research Mexican Cartels. Or just sitting in dark hotel rooms looking like she'll burst into tears at any minute. Well, that's how she looks for the whole film actually.But I can't completely blame Blunt for this, it's a poorly written character that is used as a clumsy exposition device for the first half of the movie. ""Who are you?"" ""Who is he?"" ""Where are we going?"" ""What are we doing?""
Once all that information has been passed to the viewer, there is no need for the character anymore, and she barely features after that. A better written role or a better actress, probably both, was needed to make this character interesting.The good parts of the film are all about Brolin & Del Toro. The two actors have great chemistry but sadly, Brolin is sorely under used. Benny gets his starring turn, and it is as majestic as it is brutal.Watch it for those two.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Once again, critics fawn over something that leaves audiences cold.","Whilst watching Sicario, I was reminded of American Hustle. Not that the two have a lot in common, plot or character-wise, but rather they are both movies that were given ridiculously great reviews by critics, but left myself and others wondering, why?The usually likable Emily Blunt has a dull character. She's one- dimensional, she has nothing distinct about her in any way, no quirks to suggest she's anything but a cardboard cut-out. This is a major problem when you feel that way about the lead character. How are you supposed to care about what happens in the story when you don't care about the lead?The directing, also, it felt very detached and uninvolving.

Grear War on Drugs movie.,"There have been many TV shows and films in recent years that look at the history of America's battle with drug cartels in foreign countries, be that Mexico or Colombia for example. Sicario looks at the darker side of the fight against drugs, when the United States government decides to fight back dirty, because sometimes when you are fighting a strong enemy that has zero regard for criminal law, then you have to stoop down to their level.The main character in the film is FBI agent Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt. After a shocking discovery she made while on an FBI mission she is requested by her superiors to join a task force to go into Mexico and extract a cartle member back to the United States. Joing her are the mysterious figure of Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) and task force leader Matt (Josh Brolin) along side
several others who basically act as the firepower.From there everything is chaotic and we see the grey nature of fighting a war where there aren't two traditional armies standing off, but rather a war where underhand tactics and shortcuts and needes and the is a hinderence. To this end the character of Kate acts like the moral compass but weirdly I couldn't relate to her as much as I could to the idea of underhand tactics for a underhanded enemy. In an ideal world everyone should receive a trail etc but not every corner of the world is ideal which is the journey kate takes.The story of Alejandro was very interesting as it shows what can happen to a person who has been shaped by the drug cartels and has decided to fight them. I felt much more empathy towards him throughout the course of the film than perhaps I did Kate.I watched this film not long after having Narcos Mexico and the only reason why I wouldn't rate Sicario as highly would be that Narcos had a better opportunity to show the war on drugs in Mexico from the view of many different types of people but alas one is a film and another is a tv show so maybe its not a fair comparison. Again I just didn't care for Kate. As maybe other people might have so that could have lowered my interest in the film.Other aspects of the film such as the cinematography and soundtrack were excellent.

"A movie directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, SIGN ME UP!!!!!","Before Arrival (2016), Blade Runner 2049 (2017) or the two Dune movies, Denis Villeneuve was just an up-and-coming guy who trying to get his footing in Hollywood. Nowadays, he is recognized as one of the best modern day filmmakers working in the business, but before that both he and writer Taylor Sheridan gave us a movie called Sicario (2015) and it is simply phenomenal.Positives for Sicario (2015):
First off, this movie gave me something that I didn't know I wanted until now and that was a collaboration between Denis Villeneuve and Taylor Sheridan. This movie is a phenomenal combination of Villeneuve's masterful direction and Sheridan's exceptional writing. While this movie was marketed as an action thriller, it is more focused on its characters and that is only elevated by Taylor Sheridan's writing and the performances from the cast. Speaking of that, everyone does a fantastic job with their performances particularly Emily Blunt as Kate Macer, Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick, Josh Brolin as Matt Graver and Daniel Kaluuya as Reggie Wayne. The other thing that makes this movie work is the constant sense of dread throughout every scene in the movie to where you know something is going to happen. I also love how the movie frames the mission as a mystery and the movie slowly starts to show you what is happening and why these people are doing to the thing that need to be done. And finally, I love the movie's ending gives us the payoff and satisfaction for our main characters while also making us question whether it's right or wrong.Overall, Sicario (2015) is one of the most masterfully crafted and thought-provoking action thriller movies I've seen in a long time.

This is not a typical action movie, and though it is rife with violence and mayhem it is quite the opposite of traditional blockbusters.

A Different Look at the War on Drugs,"An idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.Let me start with this: Officials of Ciudad Juárez criticized the depiction of that city, El Paso's cross-border twin, expressing their view that Sicario portrayed their city in a bad light, for instance in its sequences depicting nighttime firefights in the city, and tortured bodies of dead hanging from downtown viaducts.While the movie is not a true story, it is intended to send a message about a real situation: the violence associated with drugs. And because it intends to get a response, some level of realism ought to be encouraged. I have no idea if the CIA is doing border raids. I have real doubts that American soldiers can go within a mile of the border and kill citizens indiscriminately. If we are supposed to sympathize with Blunt's character, we ought to a) feel the violence by Americans is not justified and b) believe this is something that actually happens.But, even if it is an exaggeration, it still has a kernel of truth. El Paso is a nice city, but just over the border are slums. And we have to ask why that is. And while the film never touches on immigration directly, there is that topic always lurking in the background: can we blame Mexican citizens for illegally entering America if they are fleeing such violence and crippling levels of poverty? Legal or not, they could be said to have a moral right to defend their children by any means possible. (I am not advocating here or attempting to be political, but merely saying there are multiple issues and angles to consider.) The real breakout actor here was Benicio del Toro. This might have been Blunt's film, but del Toro really carries it in the second half. Rumors are that there will be a sequel that follows his character. Not sure how that is possible, but it could be interesting. He came off as a cross between Dirty Harry and Jason Bourne, one man against all the drug cartels. Could be an interesting story to follow if done right.The film received three Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Editing. As far as Best Sound Editing goes, I have no way to judge that properly, and cannot give an intelligent assessment one way or the other.Interestingly, on both Score and Cinematography, its biggest competitor is Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"". And if it were up to me, I would split the difference and give them each an award. While the score for ""Sicario"" is very distinct and stood out in my head as few others do, it is up against Ennio Morricone. Ho do you compete with a living legend, especially when this is likely his last chance at an Oscar? So I suspect that even if ""Sicario"" has the better score (which is debatable), ""Eight"" takes the statue.And we go the other way on Cinematography. What ""Eight"" has going for it is the unusual decision to release a film in 70mm. But because so few theaters can even show it, and so few scenes of the movie really need it, it comes off as a gimmick. In contrast, ""Sicario"" has great aerial shots, night vision shots, thermal shots... a whole range of ways to see the world not often used in one picture. And the man behind the camera is Roger Deakins, possibly the greatest cinematographer alive. So, give him the award.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A film so unethical it makes dirt look cleaner,"Sicario may be one of the most melancholic, morally bankrupt, and ethically vacuous mainstream films to be released this year; yet, such moroseness comes with the territory of the ongoing, politician- branded ""War on Drugs."" The story concerns an idealistic FBI Specials Weapons agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who, along with her partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), are recruited to work with the CIA in order to find a man responsible for savage murders in Mexico.Doing so involves extensive work with the CIA and infiltrating cartels in Mexico, so Macer and Wayne team up with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a Department of Justice adviser who leads the manhunt, and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), who are specifically targeting a cartel boss named Manuel Díaz (Bernardo P. Saracino). Díaz is believed to one of the main authorities behind Mexico's explicit involvement in the cartel. Upon arriving to Mexico and experiencing the practices of both Graver and Gillick, Macer is shocked at the amoral and corrupt nature of the CIA's practices, which have resorted to targeting innocent, often unarmed people in addition to working largely on hearsay rather than concrete evidence.Kate Macer is one of the year's most fascinating characters, and particularly one of the most compelling female characters of the year. Her presence initially rekindles thoughts of Maya in Zero Dark Thirty, who found herself nudging her way through the patriarchal CIA practices in order to further her belief as to where Osama Bin Laden was hiding out for over a decade. However, Kate is much more realistically written in a human sense. Maya felt more like an empty shell, ill-equipped to show emotion that wasn't determination or archetypal female toughness.What makes Kate Macer really interesting and believable is her mental toughness and willingness that turns into pure uncertainty and vulnerability upon arriving in Mexico. This doesn't mean she's weak, as I know some will take it, but it simply means that she's indeed human and conflicted. How does she maintain her idea of ethics and moral high-ground when everyone around her is abiding the ""what not to do"" section of the unwritten CIA playbook? The film asks us that through many scenes of Kate's blank stares, uncertain remarks, and general uneasiness throughout the film. She's one of the most fascinating and ambiguous characters I've seen all year.Aside from the layered characterization of Kate and Blunt's fascinating performance, Sicario is mostly a showcase for the stylish, limitless directing of Denis Villenueve (responsible for Prisoners, one of 2013's best films) and the masterful cinematography of Roger Deakins, arguably one of the best cinematographers working today alongside Tim Orr and Emmanuel Lubezki. Villenueve makes Mexico a landscape that pulsates with tension and danger, but not in a xenophobic manner, and Deakins captures the sunlit sand and the damaged landscape with an all- encompassing look at how the War on Drugs has left the country in economic and agricultural shambles.With Villenueve and Deakins at the helm, almost nothing else matters, and that's good, because Sicario is a film that benefits from the strength of its three strong components to sort of disguise the fact that the film is a largely unfocused and somewhat disconnected project. No matter how strong the performances are - particularly from Blunt and del Toro, who always has this delightful slowburn quality to most of his performances that doesn't get disguised here - the character relations are surprisingly weak, giving the film a rather cold and unfeeling element. I felt like I was always within arm's length of Sicario, and writer Taylor Sheridan was doing nothing to pull me in whatsoever.Films involving the CIA always seem to emphasize this element; they frustratingly focus on the masculine qualities of these films, no matter how observant they tend to be, and the result is either a cold film with lesser character relations, a piece of flag-waving trite, or a combination of both. Thankfully, some of this is at least attempted to be remedied through Villenueve's direction, which lingers on facial features and expressions in a manner similar to Scott Cooper's constant emphasis on the human face in Black Mass. This allows for some humanity to penetrate an otherwise vacant landscape about as desolate as some of Mexico's rural areas.Sicario, which is clarified as meaning ""hitman"" in Spanish, is a strong film aesthetically, but a weaker film structurally. It features the same kind of quips and disconnected elements we've grown accustomed to with films revolving around the CIA, and it unfortunately shortchanges those behind the war itself, on both sides, with the exception of the morally divided Kate. Thankfully, while Sheridan's writing may have been phoned-in to some degree, Villenueve and Deakins' work is anything but textbook-fare.Starring: Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Bernardo P. Saracino. Directed by: Denis Villenueve.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great talents coalesce in this epic drug saga,"Sicario is not just one of the best movies of the 20 teens, but one of the best since 2000. Everything in this movie contributes to its success--plot, dialog (amazing in its some of its simpler lines), cast (including extras), score, cinematography--all under the helm of living legend Denis Villeneuve. And DAMN if this isn't one dark story with a very grim message.It's not perfect (the Jon Bernthal bit was an unnecessary tangent) but man, this movie hits you in the gut from the opening scene, and just doesn't let up.What I love most is its cynical view toward the intractibility of the war on drugs, and on the futility of good governance in general, that bending the rules is an accepted path toward short wins. I don't know anything about this world, and yet there feels like an abundance of ugly truths in this movie.Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan has said that, in the end, it was Kate who was right. It's his script, but I'm not sure I agree. Everyone in this movie is both right and wrong.Don't expect to be mildly entertained.

What's it all about?,"Emily Blunt is kept in the dark... so are we. Very very weak reasons for her entanglement in this drug cartel movie. 6 American SUV's barrelling down the Juarez highway in a super- coordinated prisoner pickup, and then that convoy being held up by a vehicle broken down in the border line up is a bit hard to believe. But .. it's great scenery and it does have Josh Brolin in it so it must be good,right?Well let's put it this way, he's good because he slots into these type of roles easily and pulls it off. The movie is well shot and is a typical portrayal of the American perception of the best way to deal with those nasty purveyors of pollution. Shoot'em dead with no mercy is their answer and so they happily employ goons and psychos to slaughter people in the mistaken belief that the more you get rid of, the less there are to deal with.It's like stamping on ants at the entrance to their nest! In my innocent mind and in my little world, in my little circle of friends, I don't know any drug takers or dealers and the problem I have with the theme of this movie is the level of society's resources committed to stamp out the use of narcotics by maybe 3% of the population. Blowing the suppliers to smithereens doesn't make one iota of difference to the production line, it makes for good movie scenes, it makes for rough justice but it doesn't solve any problems at all. Even with these prejudices I got absorbed by Del Toro's ruthless character, I wasn't that impressed by Emily Blunt and it seemed to me that she spent most of the movie with her mouth open, gobsmacked by the stuff unfolding in front of her, not much in the way of building any empathy. I still can't get over the way these goons and thugs (the good guys I might add) wander into buildings , flit round a corner and think they're safe with a gun in their hand, I suppose it's necessary theatre but it's really stupid . To sum up , I was disappointed with a lazy script and a sub par performance from the cast, the scenery constantly outshines the rest of the project.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time to meet God.,"Sicario means ""Hitman"" in spanish. And that's all you need to know for the plot.Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBI agent specialized in SWAT work and heavy cases.But she finds herself wrapped in something much much more complex, a drug case of epic proportions without mercy affecting both sides of the border. She gives an oscar-worthy performance here, someone who knows so so much but at the same time so little. She portrays everything the audience feels and she is badass but with enough weakness for you to sympathize with her.Josh Brolin plays Matt, and he does an amazing job with his role as a DOD Advisor. Theres a lot of questions i have for his character, and i can't wait to see him more in Soldado.The visuals and soundtrack deserve praise, with the late Johan Johannson providing the soundtrack which is eerie and terrifiyng.And Benicio Del Toro. 
He gives a career-best performence as the ghost, the man without mercy. Alejandro is a perfect combination of writing and performance, and he steals every scene he is in.
Sicario is well worth the watch. A razor sharp thriller without mercy and its jawdropping visuals boost it higher then most.And when you see him, the wolf, the hitman, the one who ends it all.

I can't breath!,"Movie Love! #SicarioOn Sunday the 11th of October 2015 at 11.55 AMC cinema Manchester I embarked on what was to be an epic and intense journey. That journey was called Sicario!Sicario staring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and the immense Benicio Del Toro has easily made it into my top 10 films since the start of 2000.There are so many reasons why i think this but I refuse to name them all as i lack the imagination and English skills to do them any justice. But what I will say is from the Acting (everyone) stunning cinematography, musical score that builds the tension so much I could almost hear my arse tightening up! And also the plot and brutal story of the Mexican cartel gang world that just grips you by the throat, squeezes every ounce of air from your body and occasionally lets you breath gasps of air once each scene ends.This film was very much like my sex life, lasted around the 2 hour mark and yet felt like I had sat down, BLINKED, then I was told to leave. But with a great feeling that I have just been involved in something epic yet brutal.Ps. Even after seeing mutilated bodies, drug lords and corrupt police officers I still want to visit Mexico and eat there food.10/10 as intense as being blue balled, says ***the_beauman***",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A terrific movie,"What a pure masterpiece here. A terrific, outstanding movie, so powerful. A head hit in the face, I can't explain better. All away from clichés, a billion miles from everything you have already seen about the subject, with the usual scheme of the good American authorities fighting against the evil cartels. Nothing of that here. It's not good vs evil scheme, but evil vs ""eviler"". That's all. Period. Benicio Del Torro will forever be for drug cartel films what John Wayne was for westerns. And Del Torro's character's name in this feature is Medellin.... One more thing. This settings could have been Afghanistan or Irak where Special Forces would have to fight against Muslims terrorists. But instead of that, this movie takes place in Mexico, near the US border, and the fight in question against drug cartels instead. The kind of action film, busted with testosterone, that won't be forgotten, and also which makes you think long after the viewing. A pure true masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Crime
Intense Film That Puts You In The Fight Against Drug Cartels,"Director Dennis Villeneuve crashed the Hollywood directors scene in 2013 with the brutal (yet spectacular) ""Prisoners"". Later that same year, he crafted the ingenious mind-bender ""Enemy"". After those two films, I knew I had to see what he would come up with next. ""Sicario"" is a much different kind of movie than those previous two, but even so it still manages to showcase Villeneuve's talents behind the camera.For a basic plot summary, ""Sicario"" is a story about the Mexican drug cartels. Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a cop who deals with the drug problems caused by the cartels every day. After one particularly frustrating operation, Kate is given the opportunity by her boss (Josh Brolin) to strike at the heart of the problem in Mexico itself. This is a big-time operation, with the decisions being made in it equally as complex. Along for the ride is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a shadowy figure you get the feeling isn't quite who or what he seems.""Sicario"" is a solid movie on two levels:First, it really captures the tension of the drug cartel scene. It's like those kind of episodes from ""Breaking Bad"", but ratcheting up the intensity tenfold. This genre is not usually my cup of tea in the least, but there is such an atmosphere of tension that I couldn't help but be sucked into the action. There are scenes, like a tense border crossing and a shootout in dug-out cartel tunnels, that will literally have you on the edge of your seat. Not a boring moment in the entire film.Secondly, and perhaps equally as important, Villeneuve is able to take such a serious topic and layer great character narratives on top of it. There are even multiple surprises along the way, including an ending that you won't see coming and would traditionally seem out of place for a typical film of this subject matter. That's why I'm being pretty tight-lipped about the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything. When was the last time you had to worry about spoilers for a drug cartel film?!Thus, I have to say that ""Sicario"" was a great success for Villeneuve, as it proves that his unique style can translate into pretty much any kind of cinema format. He's that savvy. This is a great, tense, film that will hold your interest and never let it wane even for a moment. It doesn't matter if you prefer action, narratives, twist, etc., as ""Sicario"" provides them all in equal value. I'm very excited to see what this relatively new director can pull out of his bag of tricks next!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Emily Blunt character is unnecessary,"Overall it was a very good movie, acting, storyline, cinematography effects Etc...
The lead female character is completely unnecessary and annoying. Is absolutely no need for a female character in that role, they just pushed it in there for affirmative action. In reality there would be no need for a woman in that position in those scenarios anyway.... about as useless as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars.Would have been much better off having the black guy who was her partner, take the primary role and have her sit this one out back at the office.Benicio del Toro as usual was very good.Would have liked to have had a bit more back story on some of the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sheridan,"For me, this could have been a 10 as I like the movie overall & when you'll re-watch a movie & not be bored, it's usually a sign of a great movie.

I just hate holier-than-thou people who were told this operation was approved by DC, but they still think they know best. The movie is basically saying every law enforcement agency is bad except the FBI I guess.If you've watched enough Taylor Sheridan shows, you'll see he has a message in almost everything.

A Land of Wolves,"Sicario is a film which is impossible to capture in any brief synopsis. On the surface, it's a crime drama focusing on the battle between US Federal authorities and cross-border drug barons. It's also an investigation into the tactics and procedures used by those authorities. As with films such as Infernal Affairs, The Departed, Heat and the excellent TV series The Wire, it draws parallels between those who break the law and those who attempt to enforce it and it forces us to ask ourselves whether there is any moral distinction between the two. The ethical deconstructions do not stop there, however.We are thrown into the action via the central protagonist of Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. She is a relative ingenue of sorts having worked in the FBI for a short period of time, yet she demonstrates resilience, determination and a genuine desire to see justice done. After being part of an operation which makes a discovery of a hoard of dead bodies, she is alerted to Matt Graver, played by Josh Brolin, and offered the opportunity to go through the crime fighting looking glass in order to take on the high-level criminals more directly. What Kate is not prepared for are the ruthless, vicious tactics working on this new operation will involve. She will be entering the land of the wolves, but is this truly where she belongs?This is a subtle, complex film. Its phantasmagoric narrative requires both attention and intelligence from the viewer. There are visual clues and hints which Villeneuve uses to both tantalise and deepen the story. We are set up to see the film from Kate's perspective and, consequently, we are placed in a world filled with opacity, confusion and an absence of structure. We are constantly challenged to keep up with events and make sense of the chaos that engulfs the protagonist. As the film progresses, however, we begin to see a different perspective evolve, that of Matt Graver and his hired mercenary Alejandro, played by Benecio del Toro. Alejandro's character draws inspiration from Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh (No Country for Old Men) as a dead-eyed, relentless force of nature. Yet, there is a difference here: Alejandro is driven by a clear purpose, a purpose which makes him a scourge of the Mexican cartels but extremely useful to the American government.The final scene is crucial. It sees us re-enter Kate's world, at this point she is fearful, broken, struggling to cling to her sense of conviction. Alejandro puts that conviction to the test one final time, and in that moment we witness the meaning of all that has gone before: this was partly a test, to see if Kate could become what she needs to become to operate in a world dominated by chaos and ruthless slaughter. If she has not been able to do this, she no doubt reflects the vast majority of the film's audience. As a philosopher once said, if you stare into the abyss long enough, it will stare back into you. This film provides a glimpse of the abyss and it challenges us not to blink.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A B-movie in A-movie dress,"Featuring tough-as-nails C.I.A. agents freelancing in the drugs trade, 'Sicaro' follows a fairly well-worn path. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it's first half, with its disorienting but realistic feel. Further on, however, the plot goes downhill, starting with a hook-up that goes implausibly wrong, and ending with a deeply unconvincing conclusion. In between, the movie swaps protagonists, and abandons Emily Blunt's heroine to show the vigilante-style antics of another character, even though until this point the central mystery of the film was that she (but also us, the viewers) didn't know what to make of him. The film's final scene affects to show real concern for those who live in northern Mexico under the rule of the drugs barons; unfortunately, there's a B-movie not too far behind this superficially serious portrait of their reign.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

And the Oscar goes to ...,",,, Benicio Del Toro.This reviewer usually spends very little time in his reviews making Oscar predictions because usually the power and impact of a film is independent of any subsequent awards, so why bother...? Making an exception here. Leaving aside the compelling semi-documentary direction from Villeneuve (PRISONERS) and the other excellent performances, Del Toro doesn't merely ""star"" in this picture, he HAUNTS it. It is not until you leave the theatre that you realize he is often in the shadows, or often not in the scene at all, yet for the entire film you have been subconsciously keeping track of when and where his character appears. That, my friend, is star power.Also, if they gave an award for films that deal in Moral Ambiguity, this film would get that too. This is perhaps not the forum for such a discussion but the point is aptly made that there is as much moral ambiguity (and sub rosa activities) in the so-called War on Drugs as there was in Nazi Germany.

Great film with some flaws that hold it back,"I just saw this movie at the 1130PM showing at the Arc Light in Hollywood. There were previous screenings tonight but there was a decent turnout at this time. I believe it will stay in the 7.5-8 rating range after the full release. I give it a solid 8. I know that there is a lot of fear on this board about whitewashing and American exceptionalism ruining the film, but that is not the case. This is a movie about a lot of dangerous people battling for control. The US government and Mexican Cartels are both implicated in carrying out nefarious deeds. This was a huge relief, especially after seeing the trailer for new Michael Bay propaganda film before the movie.The movie is paced better than Denis's previous work. I had read the script prior to the filming and I was worried most about that. I was fully immersed the whole film and was wide awake/alert despite seeing it after a 12 hour workday. He has a gift for creating tension and it is in full effect in this movie. There were several tense set pieces that were well executed. The opening set piece was great and set the tone for the entire film.The cinematography was beautiful while also being restrained at the same time. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro, a complete savant with lighting, framing, and camera placement. I have worked as a DP on projects that were outside in a desert landscape and it can be absolute hell to deal with. He and Denis know when to keep it simple and when to really accentuate the scene with more stylistic lighting. The golden hour scenes in the desert were beautiful and made me nostalgic for my home state of Arizona.The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. When I read the script, I pictured this exact characterization for the character. Emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. Brolin has a smaller role, but plays it well. Ruthless, determined, yet calm under pressure.Emily Blunt nailed the archetypal cop just trying to do good role. I know the studio executives wanted a male to play the role, but it would have taken away from the movie. Her strength as well as her vulnerability gave more credibility to her character. Her physicality and emotional acting skills were on display at a high level.The movie has flaws. Emily is not given enough depth or development. Her character is just not written very well. Her actions are predictable and her reactions were clichéd. I wanted to know more about her. The plot is very familiar in terms of a crime drama/thriller and does not really do anything special or unique. I also wasn't a fan of the score, but that is just personal preference. It doesn't take away from the film at all. It had the potential to be something more special and it drops the ball. It is still a great film and I recommend you all to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Seriousness of Drug Trafficking----,"VERY GOOD MOVIE WITH LITTLE TO NO NUDITYThrough the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has caused.From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that ""Sicario"" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time that life nevertheless continues.Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using them in an extremely skillful manner.All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall.Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves"".Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic"" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario"" that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic"" held onto have been eviscerated.What now? One might ask.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Things aren't what they seem as she's kept out of the loop. Brolin's the head of the operation and Del Toro is an associate with a mysterious persona and few, choice words. We're with Blunt all the way, knowing just as little, but feeling just as restless. Some tense scenes make the heart stop. A stand off on the border shows Sicario's peak in tensity. When Blunt's not being shot at, she's collecting thoughts and gathering emotions.

"Deep, Dark and Tense","Sicario is gritty, dark and brutal. It is as intense as action-thrillers get.

Is the only one that holds attention. And that's when she's asking for a cigarette or looking helpless...Everyone else
Is ""I'm a tough guy, I have killed people, please respect my ability to be cold and distant"". Most of the characters in this film could be shot and killed on the fly and I would not care at all. That's a problem with the writing. How does everybody in this film have zero character development? It's almost like this film makes people that have to kill others so robotic that they have lost all sense of humanity and have become robots themselves. This film uses dark acts as an excuse to have actors contain zero empathy. Like oh ""my kill count is 69 so I no longer have conversations in the car that entertain the lay person. The audience needs to know how cruel and cold I am by not talking at all while I stare through my sunglasses"". It's kind of a lazy way out of developing characters that have any complexity or depth. This movie uses ""shocking the audience with violent realism"" as an excuse to not humanize or relate the characters with the viewer themselves. It relies so heavily on its own tension and action that it forgets the people watching are human freaking beings. EVEN when the main character becomes vindicated I didn't feel much sympathy for him. The act itself was so gruesome I had a hard time condoning it. However I respect that this movie is trying to tell us the hard truth of death is that it sucks. It's not pretty. It's gory and cold. But the problem is I think the viewer gets that message 20 minutes into the film, yet the film still finds a need to drill that message into your head over and over and over again.Regardless the action scenes are insane and provide awesome tension. And the cinematography is just so gorgeous that I can't give this movie anything less than a 6.

An intelligent and enthralling drama that just lacks big thrills,"This is another impressive film from the director of Prisoners and Enemy, Denis Villeneuve. Much like those two films, Sicario is extremely gritty, violent and dark, full of hopeless despair and horrifying crime, but it works brilliantly in making an intriguing story throughout, and although it may not be the most exhilarating thriller you'll see this year, it remains an intelligent and very solid movie overall.The story follows an FBI agent, acclaimed for her work in coping with cartel activity in Arizona, who is called up to take part in a much larger operation across the border in Mexico. The main reason that this film is so interesting, however, is that it doesn't look at the operation as a simple affair, but instead presents it in a very critical light.The CIA's activities in Mexico are notorious, but this film doesn't assume it's all good and about justice, and very cleverly blurs the line between what's right and what's wrong in a desperate situation such as this. As a result, you always have the opportunity throughout this film to think hard about the ethical and political consequences of what's being depicted, and it makes it a much more interesting watch than you would initially expect.That's another huge strength of this film, that it takes the story in so many different directions that you don't see coming. Shying away from a generic crime thriller, Sicario is hugely unpredictable, and although it doesn't necessarily succeed in making a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat experience, there are always surprises to come (very similar like the political thriller Zero Dark Thirty).One of the other most impressive parts of the story is the portrayal of Benicio Del Toro's character. Yes, Emily Blunt is technically the protagonist, but her character isn't the most dramatic or exciting to follow, it's actually Del Toro that will really hook you on this film, as he plays a man full of mystery.You really don't know where this guy's alliances lie, and as you're fed small pieces of information about him having seen some really bad stuff in the past, he just becomes absolutely fascinating, pulling you further into the drama of the story even more.Finally, the direction by Denis Villeneuve is excellent. Again, he makes the film appear completely without hope, increasing the stakes significantly and making for more intrigue, whilst it's also a simply beautifully-shot movie to watch, with epic wide shots of the Mexican landscape, as well as enticingly dark images of some of the more gritty and depressing areas.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Once in a Lifetime Performances,"I'm very surprised that this movie doesn't have higher user reviews. The acting is top rate across the board. I'm glad to see Josh Brolin getting these juicy roles...always thought he was underrated. Del Toro is always brilliant and but this is without question the performance of his career. As a men with nothing left to lose and nothing left to fear the tension lies in not knowing how much humanity is left in him. He is the embodiment of a soul damaged beyond repair. There is no hope, no repentance, no salvation and he knows it. He fulfills his destiny without pleasure or passion...he avenges his family with the cold exactitude of a surgeon performing his 100th surgery. Josh Brolin's character has a broader agenda with the Cartel as a whole while Del Toro has a singular objective. The juxtaposition between the Del Toro character and the young, new agent played by Blunt is subtle and nuanced. A lesser movie would have made the Blunt character MORE vulnerable and susceptible. She is definitely changed forever by her dealings with Del Toro and the movie allows you to question, momentarily, whether she will be able to touch a deeply buried crevice in his soul. Maybe she was...but he knows who and what he is and willfully doesn't allow access even to himself.",,Anonymous,Crime

Sicario,"When a domestic mission goes quite spectacularly, if quite innovatively, wrong the enthusiastic but somewhat naive FBI agent ""Kate"" (Emily Blunt) is offered a chance to sign up for a team that's going to avenge things. It's to be run by ""Graver"" (Josh Brolin) and feature the strong, silent and enigmatic type that is ""Alejandro"" (Benicio Del Toro). She doesn't much like the look of him, indeed she finds the whole operation a bit dodgy but off to El Paso they go to try to stop the war against the increasingly well armed and successful drug cartels. Their objective is not to tinker with the mechanics of these operations, but to identify the kingpins and remove them from the board. What she (and we) soon realise is that this is one of those missions far more clandestine than it is lawful. Plenty of rules are stretched, ignored or just downright broken as their team must fight with the weapons of the enemy if they are to have any chance of tracking down their primary target - ""Manuel Díaz"" (Bernardo Saracino). What she also comes to realise quite quickly is that she is not fully briefed, indeed she is being drip fed information in a fashion that frequently drives her to want to throw in the towel. She prevails, though, and as the plot unravels we are all exposed to a ruthless, efficient and internecine network that is easily a match for it's theoretically better armed and informed pursuers. It's also at this stage that we appreciate that ""Alejandro"" does have his own agenda, and woe betides anyone who gets between him and his self-appointed task. Though Brolin is really neither here nor there here, this features a strong effort from Blunt as ""Kate"" comes to terms with some fairly profound challenges to her morals and principles. Del Toro doesn't have too much to say, but again he delivers well in his usual less-is-more style. Little dialogue just a menacing style of characterisation that you just know is only on her side until, well, he might not be. It hits the ground running and takes care to establish characters that are plausible, if not especially likeable, whilst showing us what might be as true an assessment of the war for control of the billion dollar narcotics industry as we'll have seen on a big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Superb,"Sicario is a crime thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve who also made Prisoners and Enemy, both fantastic films.The movie begins with a short explanation of the word ""Sicario"". In ancient Palestine, the word described Jewish zealots who would kill roman invaders. However, in present day, in Mexico ""sicario"" means hit-man. The story follows Kate Macer, portrayed by Emily Blunt, an FBI agent who is dragged in a drug war that takes place at the border of Mexico and U.S. Emily Blunt is absolutely excellent in this role, one of the best female performance we've seen so far this year. Her character is smart and idealistic, however, we can see absolute fear in her eyes when she starts to realize that she entered in another world, a very dangerous world where the rules don't always apply. I will be honestly shocked if she won't be nominated for the Academy Award. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are also excellent in supporting roles, playing characters whose motivations are not fully clear until the end of the movie.The visuals in this movie are absolutely gorgeous, the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, did an amazing job and I can't wait to see him work again with Villeneuve in the Blade Runner sequel. We see some beautiful wide-shots of Mexico, with great lighting and colors. Also the action scenes are beautifully directed, there's no shaky cam or quick editing, everything looks perfect. There is also night-vision sequence that looks absolutely stunning.This movie is a great take on the war on drugs, with three- dimensional characters, with solid acting from the Blunt-Brolin-Del Toro trio, fantastic visuals and a very good script. All in all, this one of the best movies of this year! A must watch! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A hit with a purpose,"Sicario gives a first person account of FBI agent Kate Macy who although no stranger to the cruelty cause by the Mexican Cartel, is seemingly put over her head in a new assignment. With the support of superb cinematography there brings out a sense of loneliness and self reliance as Kate attempts to figure out her role and the end game scenario being worked out by the US bureaucrats.Director Denis Villeneuve gives a methodical crime thriller with a generous helping of suspense. Married to a constant stream of questions and mind wondering theories were surreal scenes of brutality coupled by imagery only observed when in deep thought. This style of cinematography created emotions of loneliness and self reliance as fears mounted towards how Kate was being used.A stellar performance by Benisio Del Toro playing the roll of a dauntless Alejandro further added to the films mystery. Born out of a world where human lives are worth more dead because they make a stronger statement, Alejandro seeks revenge against the cartel with the US government at his disposal.The questions to Kate's involvement become answered in a very matter of fact manner. Instead of keeping the level of suspense and concern for her safety the story drops the ball and although tries, can't quite grasp it as it bounces away. It was disappointing after being brought down the rabbit hole with Kate only to discover her roll was technical and minimally subversive. In an era of film making history where antiheroes are the new champions, this movie may have missed its opportunity for greatness by not basing the story more around Alejandro from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Realistic movie with a static leading character,"As a rule, I am not into films or series dealing with drug abuse and/or drug trafficking, but at times, in the event of distinct plot and good performances/direction, I find time. Sicario had good prerequisites, but it did not provide wow! experience as a whole; apparently due to realism maintenance, most of the plot was arid, and the main character FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) was strangely ""colorless"" and non-dynamic, falling down on, in particular, Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick and Josh Brolin as Matt Graver whose versatility bears the weight in the movie, following them maintain the thrill and cohesion of the plot. Besides, some twists were revealed too soon, thereafter one could guess how the things would go on and resolve. The very ending was too plain as well.All in all, Sicario is not a bad movie, but does not measure up to e.g. Blow or Traffic. Thus, ""only"" 7 points from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unrelenting Suspense,"This movie is certainly an interesting one, though it's not for everyone. On a technical level, the movie is very proficient, but the atmosphere it creates is both is biggest asset and weakness.The actors all do a great job making their characters feel very dimensional; they feel like they have pasts and lives outside of the events of the movie. Benicio Del Toro does an extraordinary job portraying a steely, reserved hit-man, his precision over the course of the movie being very captivating. Emily Blunt is also a standout, having the arguably tougher role of portraying a by-the-book officer who refuses to compromise her morals. I've seen others deriding her performance because of their dislike for the character, but Blunt does a magnificent job and helps elevate the movie.How much you will enjoy the movie is heavily based in how you interpret it's characters. If you believe that ends justify the means, then you will love Del Toro's character, and all he represents, while despising Blunt's. However if you believe that it's important to do things the correct, legal, and moral way, then you will appreciate what Blunt's character represents, and more likely get more out of the movie.Another strong aspect of the movie is the music, which does a perfect job conveying a suspenseful mood. Whether it's a subtle humming or ambient thumping that builds over time, it makes you feel the tenseness that the characters do. Similarly the cinematography is breathtaking. It's wonderfully varied, makes great use of darkness and color, and is easy to follow along with. The shots match what the character's feel, whether it makes you feel on edge or on like a calm to a cold degree.However how much you appreciate all these aspects is heavily dependent on if you enjoy the atmosphere of the film, which is a cold/distanced one. All of our characters are basically closed off people, which can make it difficult to connect or empathize with them. The plot isn't anything unique or especially captivating, so if you don't find the characters interesting and appreciate the movie's callous, unrelenting demeanor, it won't be enjoyable. The movie doesn't shy away from how it presents its subject matter, which makes it more difficult to get into, but all the more enjoyable if you do.Overall I enjoyed the movie, though I don't think I'll ever watch it again. However, I am glad to have experienced, and would recommend it to others.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tightly made thriller that keeps the audience involved,"In the lead up to the Oscar nominations being announced this year there was talk of 'Sicario' possibly sneaking in for a Best Picture nod. I held off seeing it until after the announcement for this reason. After seeing it I'm surprised it was really ever considered a contender. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just not really the type of film that would often find itself nominated (even with the now extended field). For me it often came across as a film more intent on style over substance. Every character had to be ice-cool and every line had to be delivered so suavely that it took the air of realism out of a lot of scenes.Oscar-worthiness aside though it's a very watchable and enjoyable film. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are terrific, but the real movie stealer is Benicio Del Toro (and I don't often like him in films). He doesn't have a lot of lines but when he does you listen, because whatever he said is either going to be very cool or very important - or both.A film dealing with the Mexican Cartel is always going to have its share of violence, but I never thought 'Sicario' delved into gratuitous levels. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for his handling of what can be a tricky balance to find. The movie has an air of mystery around it that keeps the audience wondering and there's never a boring scene in between things. It's a beautifully shot and very well made movie that won't disappoint audiences anywhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Action, Suspense, Thriller","Sicario portrays the world of a drug cartel and policing forces in a high-action, suspenseful set of events. The film relies heavily on in- action moments that keeps the audience on the edge while beautifully stringing together scenes in large settings. The tension builds from the characters at the very beginning of the opening sequence, where battle-ready troops prepare for an open assault in the hot, sandy desert village.This title resembles many characteristics from other titles such as the series ""24"" and ""The Equalizer"" where the atmosphere is within every second that goes by. Definitely a movie to watch with your friends, with great acting and scenery. It keeps you guessing until the very end, and questioning the motives of every person seen. Highly recommended for veterans of war and the regular movie-goer.Aside from the gun-play and explosions throughout, Sicario has a stunning performance of visual displays, even as a 2015 film. A top-quality 8-out-of-10 shot for a movie to enjoy during every second of the show. Characters that make cameo appearances are often found for the willing eye to catch, along with some large stars (my personal favorite in this one, from ""Burn Notice"") and to top it off, this film actually lowered the crime rate within the city it was depicted in after it was released.

One minute she wants to put an end to the whole thing and the next she wants in all the way. Yet, the other lead characters hold her hand all the way through the movie like she's relevant to the operation in some way, which she wasn't.The story line was was unrealistic, incoherent and weak.

A masterclass in acting (Del Toro) and directing (Villeneuve),"2015 was a very good year in films, and ""Sicario"" can be considered one of its highlights, but not one of the very best. First off, for me this movie was a great way to get to know for the first time two big names and talents in the industry: lead actor Benicio Del Toro and director Denis Villeneuve. The former did an outstanding job -maybe Oscar worthy, totally nomination worthy- at portraying a cold and expert man (I won't get into detail not to spoil anything), the latter made great use of the south-US/Mexico landscapes, but also of the focus on small details, to give a proper identity to the film, which eventually looks slick and classy while also portraying horrifying images (i.e. the amazing first scene). I also liked Josh Brolin's take as an eccentric, no-nonsense DoD consultant, though his character tended to turn darker and darker for no apparent reason. Probably (hopefully) he's gonna have a big role in the sequel. Jóhann Jóhannsson keeps up the good work with a simple, yet fitting soundtrack: he reminds me more and more of the mastermind, Hans Zimmer, in that sense. But let's get to the nay part. Before watching ""Sicario"" I'd heard that Emily Blunt's performance was the one to look after. It isn't. She really tries, and she does so hard she gets irritating. She's always swearing, crying, being disappointed, and all that in a desperate way, as if she needed to show us she's the lead actress in a boys' flick. Her partner does the same, or even worse. Finally, some words on the complicated plot. At the end of the story, everything fits well, and you won't be disappointed, but in the making it feels at times disorienting and excessively cryptic.A very good movie, an outstanding work by cast and crew, with one major disappointment. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
To fight evil we have to become evil,"Sicario is about the war against drugs and the drug cartels in Mexico. The FBI agent (Emily Blunt) gets hired by the CIA for a secret mission to bring down a drug lord. She will together with a special force working directly under CIA's special departments, cross the border into Mexico and bring back a powerful ally to a drug lord. Joshn Brolin plays a supporting character as a cocky CIA leader and Benicio Del Toro plays a mysterious hit-man whose participation for a long time remains a mystery. Sicario is raw and contains a brutal realism that really reflects the reality it is supposed to represent.The film starts immediately and Kate who works for the FBI, stumbles across a huge find that takes her to the CIA's special departments. Soon she works under strict secrecy and is forced to question her own morale values. It is here that Sicario starts to get really interesting. Everybody in the CIA has a pretty relaxed and cocky tone, despite the serious and sometimes brutal things they actually experience. I get the same thoughts and feeling as I got when I watched humans being tortured by relatively normal and not particularly affected people in the film Zero Dark Thirty. How far are we willing to go to defeat this evil, and can we come out of this with our ideals and values intact?Sicario goes on i a decent tempo with only a few slow parts here and there. There is an incredibly exciting car scene about halfway through the film that contains a lot of action, but besides that aren't there really that many action scenes. It is rather the politics and the questions of how to fight this brutal criminality, that are central for the film. Sicario is definitely a film worth watching for the problems and thoughts it takes up. The plot sort of twists itself by the end and I feel content afterward. All in all a solid film, a strong 6 out of 10.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Artistically...  it may be the best film of 2015...,"This film just looks amazing. A lot of care went into this.I wish our lead here(Emily Blunt) got the same development and fully-fleshed-out journey throughout the film as Melissa Desormeaux- Poulin did in Villeneuve's ""Incendies"".Blunt's character here is a little too weak for my tastes. It kinda messes with the plausibility and effectiveness here. One begs to ask the question why she would ever be asked to come along. I mean it seems obvious in the film that her character is in over her head, and it really makes things a bit of a mess for me as the viewer.Shame too because this film is quite simply amazing. The cinematography is incredible. Villenueve's grasp of moving action and steady, almost Mallick-like steady pans with vibrant color and attention to detail is truly amazing.If you've ever wanted a film to be the epitome of an incredible 'shooter game' - then this is it. SOme moments late in the film had me standing up in front of the television with anticipation and excitement.As a thriller, it works because the action is done so well, and because the 'revenge quotient"" is high.The film WILL do nothing but further excite those in anticipation of Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2"" project. He's the right man for the job. ANd this film does nothing to change the fact that he is EASILY one of the top 1 or 2 directors to watch right now.WHile the characters here lack a little depth, and the story doesn't really know where to put them most of the time, the film still works.One of the most visually stunning films in a few years. A couple of years ago, slammed behind his other film ""Prisoners"" and another film with similar strengths and weaknesses, ""Place Beyond the Pines"", ""Sicario"" may not even make the top 10, but for 2015 this is EASILY top 10, and sitting on the 're-watch as soon as possible' list.I saw a film that was also supported by it's look last night, ""The Walk"". It also lacked some character development and had some tonal issues.. and it looked good. BUT, ""Sicario"" went above the 'grand look"" and leaked way over into artistic masterpiece territory.I don't know how 'accurate' this is in terms of subject matter, but it certainly seems very realistic. I just wish they would have made Emily a little more of a tough-girl.He cared about this one. 83/100You'll like this if you liked:Babel(about even), Prisoners(a little better), Trade(not as good), or Eden(not quite as good but decent sleeper to try out).2015 has been slow to come around, but certainly it could be argued that ""Fury Road"" and ""Sicario"" are two of the more visually stunning films of this century.

"Del Toro, Roger Deakins and Johann Johannsson lift up the film's quality","Sicario would appeal to any ethical and sensitive viewer but falls short of being a masterpiece.Bernicio Del Toro's performance in the movie in the first appearance (shots in the aircraft) was stagey. As the movie progresses, you begin to admire him. It is definitely Del Toro's best role to date.Villeneuve as a director is above average but never raises stuns you. But I will continue to view his films in the firm hope that he will deliver a masterpiece down the line. You admire his ability to use visuals and music to build the mood with a certain maturity that is rarely encountered in Hollywood. But then he is a Canadian filmmaker first--and in Canada they use restraint with music and camera-work. Roger Deakins (cinematographer) and Johann Johannsson (composer of the music) contribute so much to raise the quality of the product.Made in Hollywood, on a US subject, ""Sicario"" for me is closer to Canadian cinema in style and production tastes. Cinephiles will note the parallels between this film and a real Canadian film, Larysa Kondracki's ""The Whistleblower"" (2010) that exhibit in the screenplay and development of characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A dark, fantastic movie that should not be missed!","I instantly became a fan of Denis Villeneuve after watching a Prisoner. When I heard Villeneuve's next movie would be exploring the war on drugs, I instantly got curious. And after coming out of the theatre, I can say that not only was I not disappointed, I was a bit shaken to my core. Felt like a mix between Zero Dark Thirty and No Country for Old Men. Sicario is one of top five favourite movies of this year.Just like Prisoners, Villeneuve takes the audience on a dark descent into a world of violence with the main character's morals being challenged. But whereas Prisoners was more self-contained, Sicario goes bigger by the exploring the harsh almost lawless landscape behind the Mexican border. Villeneuve does not shy away from the harsh reality of the violence that occurs throughout the story but doesn't try to shove it down your face. Before the violence is about to come, Villeneuve does a superb job of building up the tension so when it happens your jaw drops. And I even give Villeneuve, as well as the writer Taylor Sheridan, extra credit for focusing on a character that may have seemed unimportant throughout most of the movie but by the third act become very relevant in the end.The cast in this perfectly plays each of their roles. While Edge of Tomorrow shown that Emily Blunt can play a serious bad ass heroine, her performance in Sicario has officially proved that she can lead a role in a serious thriller. Blunt shows a character that is tough, loyal and obedient on the outside but within there is a vulnerability and question of morality within her. She shows a person who all she wants to do is bring justice but becomes conflicted as she goes deeper into the dark reality that she is in. And by the end of the film you can't help but to feel sorry for her. Josh Brolin becomes the ultimate contrast as a man who does not follow typical procedure from his cowboy-ish attitude, his choice of clothing to methods that border on the line between order and vigilantism. But the real star is the Sicario himself, Benicio Del Torro. Del Torro's display a great sense of quietness and sophistication but yet comes off very intimidating. His character carries a huge amount mystery that makes you want him to have more screen time. He is someone you can't tell if you want to root for and be totally scared of.Veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins really shows the bleakness and darkness of this world. His shots range from excellent wide shots of barren desert landscapes, slowly creeping zooms to tell we are about to see something horrific to avoiding lights during night-time sequence to take full advantage of the dark atmosphere. I will be shocked if Deakins does not get a nomination for best cinematographer at the Oscars.And finally, a big part of chilling atmosphere in this is in thanks to Johann Johansson's score. Johansson create a one of the darkest and creepiest soundtrack I have ever heard as it perfectly reflects the sense of dread the story creates but yet also creates an emotional response at the hopeless of the situations that go on.Overall, Sicario is a masterpiece that Dennis Villeneuve has created. It would be foolish to ignore this movie. I am looking more forward to more of what Villeneuve can bring like his next two movies, The Story of Your Life and the Blade Runner sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It was a good movie, except for the protagonist.","It's hard not to observe that the writer wants us to feel conflict and pity for Kate, the straight laced cop, but for an otherwise exceptional movie this character was just so poorly written inside and out. She's supposed to be this excellent super-cop, yet barely resembles one. She's supposed to be struggling to accept the ethical dilemma of questionable CIA activities, but it comes off as patent nativity to an absurd extreme. She cares too much about bureaucracy for someone who has watched the bad guys murder everyone around her for years.Don't get me wrong, the actress performed wonderfully and beautifully. Her script is just broken. Uncharacteristic of any police officer. Unbelievable of any regular human being. The viewer cannot connect with her.There's also a flaw near the beginning of the movie. A police officer is blown off his feet in an explosion. He flails his arms and legs wildly in front of him while flying backwards. In a real explosion, he would not have the strength to move his extremities against the force of the blast. I wish they'd stop wiggling so much.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sicario Has Style But Has It Intelligence?,"The introduction for this film gave initial promise by shrewdly adding a title that states: Sicario were early warriors of Jerusalem who hunted down Roman invaders, but then goes on to tell us Sicario: also means Hit-Man in Mexican (doesn't leave much to aspire to). It's a studied exercise in the ugliness of today's drug trade – its main claim to fame lies in its overall style, both visual and directorial. Denis Villeneuvie's direction is taut (reminiscent in style to the interesting John Guillermin from the mid 50s – late 80s). Much of Sicario's success at seducing the audience to overlook several plot implausibility's is gained from the superb work of British cinematographer/cameraman Roger Deakins. This brilliant director of photography is worthy of higher projects to better use his considerable talents. It would have been interesting to have had the opportunity for him work with the likes of David Lean or Carol Reed. To date, perhaps the most intelligent use of his talent may have been ""Defence of the Realm"" in '85 – with possibly the most stylish being ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" in '94. I credit this fellow with adding much to the success of Cohen Bros movies than perhaps the often overrated Cohens themselves. There's also an evocative 'soundscape' score by Icelandic artist Johann Johannsson to help it along.As for the screenplay by TV actor Taylor Sheridan - it adds little new ground to a heavily pre-trodden scenario and if not for the combination of smart direction, photography and slick editing its many plot deficiencies would be even more self evident. If modern movies are going to set themselves up as realistically true to life, then there has to be a greater level of believability, otherwise they remain simply the 'artificial recreations of reality' they always have been – except now of course, they just have to be overloaded with all the vile language and grotesque violent details that can be crammed into an average two hour plot. This work also has the feel of many TV series that stretch-out thin plots to fill endless episodes. Thankfully this is all over in two hours.Sheridan's characters are mostly made up of so-called 'elite' professionals - lead by an idealistic female SWAT team member played by Emily Blunt (who holds her implausible character quite well) but, for high profile professionals they tend to make so many foolish decisions – Not to mention the many silly plot set-ups:(some minor spoilers here if not already seen) Sequences such as the corrupt policeman who just happened to be in an obscure roadside bar that is 'randomly' visited (totally without plan) by our heroine - coupled with the sudden appearance of her 'protector' are just too much to overlook. To top it off the Del Toro character's involvement is reduced down to just another clichéd 'revenge' plot – complete with his being able to gain access to one of the biggest players in the business by single-handily murdering all the personal protectors (who just happen to be in earshot of his victims but miraculously no-one hears anything) its just another of many stretches of credibility (like Kate's ex-SWAT partner who just happens to always be there, despite being previously rejected by the current government undercover team). There's also an ugly start to this folly with drug dealers hiding numerous badly decomposing bodies in the plaster wall cavities of a house. What possible purpose was that intended to serve?For those who simply watch movies and go blindly with the flow - without thinking - this is seemingly good entertainment but, for a movie to be hailed as great or award winning, there has to be more depth. So, if you are looking for something offering intelligence, you may not find it here.Also most disappointing is the obvious re-introduction of excessive cigarette smoking into movies (throughout the world) don't tell me this isn't deadly commercial product placement at its unsubtle worst - this sets the integrity of today's movie industry back over 50 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie is worth your time.,"When I first watched "" Sicario "" I expected your prototypical action movie, and it has some. However this is not your cliche action film. The story is gritty and is aided by the harsh landscapes that dominate the scenery. Also the music soundtrack has a sense of dread to it. What this movie does is it gives you a realistic portrayal of the war on the Mexican drug cartels and the people who wage war against them. It is rough it is harsh and all actors involved in this movie are fantastic ! Benecio Del Toro is excellent as is Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin. The supporting cast is all top notch as well. I really cannot understand how anyone could not like this movie. And my favorite scene is not an action scene but a conversation between Blunt and Del Toro in the end of the film. It has one of my all time favorite lines for a movie. If you are like me it will be your go to when there is nothing much else to watch. Yes I have watched it multiple times.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

An intense somewhat raw dirty drama of doing whatever it takes to get it done.,"Just saw ""Sicario"" and I will say that certainly in my opinion it's not a great movie, yet still it's intense enough and raw with drama for any crime drama movie fan to view. As is so common in today's headlines from the news it's Mexico against the United States in the drug border war and a lot of those problems involve the Mexican drug cartel. This drama story centers around a young and hard working up and coming FBI agent named Kate(Emily Blunt)who joins a federal task force to go to the U.S. and Mexican border to fight the drug war. And from the start Kate sees that this is a brutal and blood like war with guns and body after body being discovered. Along the way good supporting help is provided from Matt Graver(Josh Brolin)yet the anti hero and key player in helping find the Mexican drug leader is a renegade named Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro). It proves that in life and war you don't always play by the rules as many times they are bent and broken, overall this movie is raw, gritty, and downright blunt!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a Gripping and Intense Journey,"Sicario is a masterfully crafted thriller that immerses viewers in the dark and gritty world of the drug war. The film's direction by Denis Villeneuve is exceptional, creating an atmosphere of tension and moral ambiguity that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Emily Blunt delivers a powerful performance as an idealistic FBI agent, navigating a complex landscape filled with danger and ethical dilemmas.The cinematography is stunning, capturing both the bleakness of the borderlands and the intensity of the action sequences. The haunting score further enhances the film's gripping tone.

War on drugs you do not control,"Kate is part of an FBI abduction task-force, dealing mostly with drug-related crime. She is invited to a joint operation to neutralize a major Mexican drug-lord, whose handiwork she has often seen in her career. During the operation her personal boundaries and beliefs are greatly challenged.The cast is good, especially Del Toro and Brolin are outstanding. Main character Kate, portrayed by Emily Blunt is a bit bland to my liking and gets overshadowed by her male counterparts. She also seems just a little bit too pretty for the part. The cinematography, editing and score are on par.Overall Sicario is a well constructed movie. The ambiguous US drug -and foreign affair policy and the tension between the various law enforcement parties makes this movie a fascinating view.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Best action film since Mission Impossible,"""Sicario"" opens with two indicators of a violent world, one a discovery and one an explosion, both setting the stage for the satisfying thriller that follows. This is a universe in which evidence of evil exists in plain sight, hiding in the walls of a house in suburban America. And it is a world in which violence can erupt in the blink of an eye, taking lives and shattering others. At times, ""Sicario"" is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. Part of the problem is that Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't really develop a protagonist. Kate is too often an observer, an unwilling and uninformed traveler on this journey. Brolin's Matt and Del Toro's Alejandro are so clearly in charge of what's happening that they're thinking of moves several machinations away while Kate is unclear of not only what role she's supposed to play but what roles everyone has as well. By the time ""Sicario"" gets to its final act, and Villeneuve and Deakins approach ""Zero Dark Thirty"" territory through strikes under the cover of darkness with night vision goggles, it's impossible to nitpick the screenplay. When life and death are in play, such as in that scene on the freeway, and really the entire final act, ""Sicario"" rises to the level I hoped it would maintain the entire time. It becomes an entire film of that opening scene-a movie of secrets and the threat of constant violence. It's about a world that we can't really even comprehend when it comes to its lack of order and degree of atrocities. And it's in our backyard. While Sicario may be guilty of exoticising the ""murder capital"" reputation of Juárez and its environs, it does so in a way that is horribly efficient, exploiting our anxieties and expectations with cruel precision. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, for whom this must surely secure a long overdue Academy Award, paints a land of brooding twilight skies and unforgiving deserts, crime scenes revealed in wide shots with unfashionably sparse edits, a recurrent motif of dust dancing in a shaft of light adding a touch of hyperreality. A key confrontation on the Bridge of the Americas border (painstakingly reconstructed by production designer Patrice Vermette) provides a nail-biting highlight; it's hard to remember the last time a traffic jam - rather than a car chase - was this tense.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

An interesting take on U.S's war on drugs,"In the lawless border area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted to aid in the escalating war against drugs.Also starring, Josh Brolin, Daniel Kaluuya, Benicio Del Toro, Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal.""Sicario"" was the only movie in English directed by Denis Villeneuve that I hadn't seen yet. All five (including ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"", ""Arrival"", ""Blade Runner 2049"") have been cult hits and among the most critically acclaimed screen works of given release year.Villeneuve's movies are emotionally distant, slow-burning, and usually more dependent on mood than sharp storytelling. I am not the fan of his style - it's too slow, rather uneventful, lacks sharp dialogue and character building - but I gotta admit that it always pays off.I could also say that ""Sicario"" doesn't really offer any intriguing characters except Del Toro's (good that he's gonna be back for sequel ""Soldado"") and the best drug war / trafficking stories are just more captivating (especially ""The Wire"" and ""Breaking Bad"")...But it doesn't change the fact that it's a solid thriller, and a cool movie which makes you gradually more and more thankful that you endured the rather slow first half.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Gritty, substantial, consequential and realistic","I have to admit, I'd avoided this for years because of the marketing which implied that it was a girlboss film. Oh, no, no, no, it's quite the opposite. Huge credit to Emily Blunt for taking on a role that shows the results of a petite, basically decent woman entering a world of very serious men and trying to front and flex. The consequences of that are shown with commendably unvarnished frankness.There's a solid plot here that credibly personalises the basic concept of ""drug wars"". Characterisation isn't its strong point, but that's fine, because all of the characters are presented as being focussed to the point of obsession on achieving their various goals - and for once, the woman blinks first. I honestly don't think this film could be made in CURRENT_YEAR.The sets, costumes, equipment, cinematography and score are all top notch, leading to real immersion in the story.I have to ding it just a little on the gunplay, which features too much super-accurate hip- and point-shooting. This is cinematic, almost a homage to Westerns, but you wouldn't see it on a properly advised production now.That aside, there's really very little to criticise here. I can thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for taut, compelling realism rather than The Message.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Captivating thriller,"The film offers an intense, slow-burn narrative that explores the human cost of this ongoing battle and questions the very ethics of the methods used to fight it. The film is hauntingly beautiful, thanks to the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose striking, often desolate landscapes echo the bleakness of the story. The use of natural light and sweeping desert vistas adds to the film's sense of isolation and danger. Sicario is a captivating and thought-provoking film that raises complex questions about the morality of the war on drugs and the blurred lines between right and wrong. With strong performances, a gripping narrative, and stunning cinematography, it is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great.  Del Toro is worth it alone.,"Really good movie. Benecio Del Toro is fantastic. Very laconic. A well written and played character. Emily Blunt's character is fairly typical but serves the story and her performance is great. Brolin is very good, character also a little typical but not necessarily predictable. He seems relaxed in his performance. He's been on a role, and being well cast since the Coen brothers put him in No Country for Old Men. Well, what I've seen of him.Great pacing. No drag. Good to great action that doesn't feel gratuitous. Great, believable sets, and settings. The action doesn't get too visually crowded which is hard to find.

"One of THEE worst movies you'd ever watch, you'd be better off going to the supermarket and compare biscuits","I would give it less than one if it wasn't for Del-Toro's part- which was the badass part. Other than that, usually I wouldn't write a review, but this movie annoyed me so much that i had to. No story whatsoever, The chick's part is a sexist chick's part, has no taste, has no meaning, only a waste of time and cigarettes. No action- maybe 50 shots fired, and maybe 10 people killed overall (nicely done by an Del-Toro). Other than that, I'd rather hear my grandma talk about knitting heart shapes on a green sweater, while watching the history channel on 3am. If it wasn't for the high rating and the awesome yet dull in this Del-Toro i would've never watched this movie or recommend anyone to ever watch it, ever. And ever and ever.

Eventually A Penetrating Look At The Dark Side,"13 May 2016. With strong elements from Traffic (2000) in which Benecio Del Toro won a best support actor Oscar and again gets to star in Sicario in a somewhat different role, Emily Blunt becomes our eyes and ears in this dark criminal drama. There are some great intense scenes that the audience participants in as observers to the efforts to make a difference in the war on drugs. Sicario has taken some hard-hitting actions scenes from Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Tony Scott's Spy Game (2001), and even Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker (2008).There are some weaknesses that appear in this movie. Emily Blunt's character without any character development seems to lack the depth of character to establish her persona and role that she presents on the screen. By the end of the movie, though, it becomes quite clear that even without Blunt's depth of character and backstory how the painful moral dilemma arose and becomes a sharp dagger against some's throat. There is a lack of balance between the American and Mexican characters, especially the important role of the Mexican police officer that is highlighted in the movie. There is also some fine landscape photography, especially of a jet taking off, but missing a similar opportunity to experience the wondrous sensation of its landing too. Finally, the mainstream photography of a high quality production seems to actually diminish the raw, jagged hard edge of the undertone of the movie.Even so, this movie as a whole is reflects a good attempt at pushing the envelope in quality, innovative ways of transporting the audience into the war zone of America's drug war.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unique Storytelling with different POV,"These are one of those movies which are silent and have no redemption, just cold thriller no banging background music. Denis's film style is easy to catch, with wide shots trying to capture the environment in the background, and kind of feels like a documentary. The story is shown to us through Emily Blunt's character 'Kate', and from that pov, we don't know what's actually happening or what's coming next, just feels real. Because Kate is never shot anybody and worst of worst brutal scenes so it actually feels terrifying when we see the things which shock us for a moment, I Denis's movie never hides anything, no matter how brutal it is, and tells a lot through simple visuals. I was shocked to see Jon Bernthal, it reminded me of Marvel-Netflix's Punisher, lol.I'm recently watching crime-thriller movies, maybe because I like how characters act in certain situations. I'll recommend this if you want to watch but it feels slow and maybe you'll feel bored because most of the we are just following the character who doesn't know what's next and where she's headed.

"Great cast, but lots of flaws in direction. Interesting storyline. Not a great film.","I had high hopes for this film which is winning awards and getting some Oscar buzz. The cast is amazing and the storyline is very interesting. However, there are some very gross flaws in the direction and characters in the film that caused me to give it a 7 (maybe even a 6) out of 10. The handful of great moments of intensity make it worth a 7, but this is not a best picture nominee. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say the following: THE BAD:* Emily Blunt character does (or fails to do) what you expect she would. She fails to ask questions or show some basic skills you would expect for someone in her position. * She is not believable in her professional or personal behavior. We don't really get her. Yes, she's conflicted, but there are 4-5 times where it makes no sense. * The story gets confusing and convoluted. Who are they going after and how and why and how does it all work out. Beyond implausible, it's like they edited 50% of the film away and left us with some gaping holes. * Governmental agencies are jumbled and confusing to an absurd level. * A few action scenes are absurd. * Random locations with random people where you do not know who they are nor why they are there.What I love about feature films in theaters is the level of realism, acting and storytelling is generally FAR superior to any TV show or movie. In this case, the director handles the character development and action scenes more like a TV movie. The cave scene being the most absurd and the main character (Emily Blunt) feeling like a poorly written TV character.Benicio and Josh Brolin have their moments of greatness, but their characters are too gruff to care much about them. There is another storyline about a Mexican police officer that is also poorly developed.THE GOOD: You will feel like you understand the complexity of the Mexico-US drug crisis. For those who feel doing illegal drugs does not harm anyone, this movie will give you a clear picture of the dangers to society and the corruption that exists along the border.

A naive FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is conned into volunteering for a Joint Task Force that is working at the Arizona-Mexico border against the Mexican Cartel. She quickly learns the force's tactics are unorthodox, illegal, and possibly even worse.Opinion:
PROS: Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro do an outstanding job as unflinching CIA men. The two men help paint a visceral picture of the unwinnable battle that often takes place on the border; and the toll it takes on those involved.CONS: My chief complaint of this film is that in a quest to keep certain motives and characters mysterious - it leaves too many doors unopened. From the opening scene of the horror-house in AZ to the bitter end with Del Toro in Blunt's room.. It would have been a net-positive to elaborate more on the back story + future implications.Bottom Line:

She doesn't know this, giving credence to my title.

"Violence, suspense and emotional depth","During large parts of this movie, lead character Kate Macer doesn't have a clue what she's gotten herself into. Neither does the viewer. And that's the strength of the film: you get drawn into a shady, murky world that never becomes very clear or transparent, but never stops to fascinate.Macer is a young FBI-agent who joins a special team of law enforcers, led by an outside 'adviser' and a Mexican ex-prosecutor, formed with only one purpose: eliminating an importing drugs smuggler. She is uncomfortable with the violent methods and unorthodox procedures of the group, but she is told that everything is cleared by the political powers that be.The film contains breathtaking scenes. One shows a convoy of black SUV's, transporting the law enforcers across the Mexican border to Juarez to pick up a criminal and get him back to the US. Director Denis Villeneuve perfectly captures the fear and nervousness of the group, which can be attacked by gang members any minute. The expected violence occurs at the border control on the way back, where they engage in a shooting amidst cars waiting to enter the US.There are many scenes like this, filled with suspense and violence. The perfect execution of these scenes is what makes this film special, more so than the script, which contains some sidelines and is not always easy to follow. A stroke of genius is the choice for a scrupulous woman as the lead character, trying to stand her ground in a masculine world without many scruples.

Decent movie but why the PC propaganda?,"Why does Hollywood deliberately make an obvious attempt to PC down the movies?Emily Blunt as a FBI task force agent? Really? It feels distracting and forced. There is no way Emily Blunt would be doing this in real life, nor did I believe for a second Blunt was a FBI agent.What did she add? Nothing. She was weak and not up for the task. There was ZERO reason to cast her other than to put a woman in.Everything she did made no sense. Questioning her superiors in front of other people, constantly calling them out for dong something ""wrong."" It grew tiresome very quickly. She claimed not to be a soldier but in the beginning she was part of a SWAT team during a raid. And are we really supposed to believe for one second she almost overpowered the big dude in the hotel? And the worst part of it is, she constantly says yes to the mission of getting the people she wants to get, but every step of the way she speaks against the mission. That is one fundamental flaw that takes this film down a few notches.Without Emily Blunt this would have been an awesome movie, but she brought it down, not her acting, but her character, decisions and her even being put in the situations.I don't even care that they used her.

Only in the movies.Also, does everyone in Hollywood have to be British nowadays? Why couldn't they find an American actress to play the part? And she had to be ""the one"" they went to? Come on, how dumb do they think we are? Stop casting people based on gender and race. And just cast whoever is best.Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are the best thing about this.

Not bad,"Sicario (2015), a gripping plunge into the shadows of the war on drugs that left me both breathless and contemplative. Emily Blunt's performance is a powerhouse, navigating the moral complexities of her character with a compelling intensity. The film editing is a visceral force, immersing the audience in the tension and unpredictability of the borderland operations. The film's strength lies in its unflinching portrayal of the moral ambiguity that shrouds the fight against cartels, leaving no room for easy answers. While the music subtly underscores the suspense, there are moments where the pacing feels deliberately disorienting, mirroring the chaos on-screen. Cinematography paints a haunting picture, capturing the vast landscapes and claustrophobic cityscapes with equal brilliance. At 7/10, Sicario is a gritty and thought-provoking thriller that delves into the shadows where justice and morality blur, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of contemporary crime cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Building a world, not just telling a story","This is the third villeneuve film I've watched this month after seeing Dune in theaters and fourth overall, and what impresses me the most
about his direction is his ability to immerse the viewer in a completely alien world. Of course, when we're talking sci fi, it's a requirement, but in the case of this film it's the aspect that really separates it from other films in the genre. There's not much character development here, only subtle indications, and more often, broad strokes so the viewer can grasp their motivations and not much else. In the case of Sicario, this is a good thing. It allows us to get lost in the world created for us on the screen. You feel the intensity, rage, hopelessness, and terror of the Mexican drug trade with such small, and relatively quiet bursts of any real action. All of the work goes into sound and picture, which leaves the viewer transfixed. This is not a blockbuster punch em/ shoot em up. This is a slow burn. Polar opposite of Nolan's films, which relies heavily on close action to keep the story going. A must watch for those looking for a film experience. Hard pass for a casual viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing Thriller with Underwhelming Character Depth,"Sicario is an experience with a great score by Johann Johannsson and incredible cinematography by Roger Deakins. The movie sound and looks spectacular. It was a joy to watch this movie, I was never bored other than a few scenes in the middle. The thrill in this movie is one of the bests of the decade thanks to Denis Villeneuve. He handles the action perfectly by taking his time to build up the scenes. The action is very subtle whereas the build-up is carefully planned. Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. I can't say the same for the story though. Don't get me wrong, it is good but it mostly does nothing special. Emily Blunt portrays Kate Macer very well, but the source material is not good enough. She meanders throughout the movie, and yes in a way she is like the audience in the movie: Trying to understand what is going on. That's not a bad idea in general but her character is so centralized that we expect something from her. Instead her storyline becomes a mediocre one in the middle when she meets Ted played by Jon Bernthal. I feel like there is about a 20 minute part in the middle which can be cut easily so that the plot could move smoother and in addition we could have seen more of Del Toro's character so that the ""narrator"" shift wouldn't feel so rushed and unexpected. The other side characters are just there for the plot purposes and are very stereotypical. Nevertheless, Sicario is a great movie and a must watch for thriller fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A definite worthy watch with just a tad of a flaw imho!,"The story was good but even in the early parts of the movie, I wondered why they treated Kate Mercer the way they did. They asked for her due to her tenacity and success, yet treated her rudely and forced her to proceed practically with a blindfold on. My guess is that her character was merely for viewers to latch onto and feel a bit timid and helpless through much of the movie. It's like her character was a whipping post of sorts. No offense to Emily Blunt as she played the role as well as anyone could for the character that she portrayed. In the end, her role perhaps provided the uneasy feeling for the audience/viewers, but I feel it took away a bit from the main story. All in all, it was a very solid movie, but definitely a different feel to it overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"It's good, but full of archetypes","After Enemy, Villeneuve returns to play with a higher budget and once again demonstrates his vision to make each scene (that allows it) impressive. This time the score wasn't as captivating as in ""Prisioners"", but it does its job. The performances are all good and Benicio del Toro stands out (he has the most compelling character by a mile).But, even if the script and style of this thriller is super realistic (it seems we are seeing the retelling of a true story like Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty""), we still end up with characters that in my opinion become archetypes already seen thousands of times, which ends up making the film quite predictable and somewhat less stimulating than it could've been.The problme of abusing these archetypes, which are well written and acted therefore do work, is that our protagonist (Emily Blunt) is without a doubt the most bland, flat and boring of them and like the film in general, stops the film to becoming truly memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thrilling but Nothing Groundbreaking,"Sicario is a film that brings back impressions and feelings of films like Silence of the Lambs and Zero Dark Thirty. It presents a change of scenery in Mexico and the border states which is refreshing. The action scenes are high-intensity but, like most action scenes do from viewing to viewing for me, tend to lose that thrill factor over time. The characters are written well but sometimes I felt as though the script misdiagnosed the problem(s) with the War on Drugs, especially in regards to the Mexican-American border crisis. Surely it is not as simple a fix as to place power back into the hands of the Colombians. The Sicario, who is revealed as the film progresses, is heartless and cold, doing whatever it takes to accomplish his mission. In some ways, the movie attempts to moralize his immorality which completely turns me off to the film. I prefer the approach of No Country for Old Men to such a hitman -- pure apathy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Grim, compelling thriller","I was curious about the Sicario films but I was in no worry to watch them. Sicario is a good movie but its really not for everyone.The acting is great mainly Emily Blunt, her character is the audience surrogate. Kate is an idealistic FBI agent who joins a task force to take down a Mexican cartel leader. The task force is shady, they fight dirty since the cartels are brutal. Josh Brolin's character Matt is a likeable tough guy, he is Kate's mentor in a sense. Benicio Del Toro's character Alejandro is a mysterious, brutal assassin.Sicario is a grim film, its not meant to be exciting or thrilling. Like any good movie, Sicario lets you know right off the bat what kind of movie you're in for. The film is brutal but the violence serves the story. If you're squeamish, avoid the film.The story is simple but morally gray. The film is elevated by the strong performances and great directing. The film is compelling so your eyes are glued to the screen. The cinematography is gorgeous but not glossy, I mean nighttime actually looks like nighttime.Overall, Sicario is another good thriller.

Worthy of several Academy Awards,"If you know nothing at all about this film, then the enigmatic title is hardly going to be a draw (in the opening moments, it is explained as Spanish cartel slang for hit-man). But the promotion for the movie puts British actress Emily Blunt - playing FBI agent Kate Macer - as the central attraction and she gives a terrific performance as someone tough and brave, but vulnerable and principled. It's good to see her being used more in action roles, following the success of ""Edge Of Tomorrow"". However, although Blunt gets top billing, Josh Brolin as an unorthodox CIA agent and Benicio Del Toro as a Columbian adviser on the drugs trade both offer superb support roles.This immensely stylish thriller is wonderfully crafted by (first time) Texan-born screenwriter Taylor Sheridan, Oscar-nominated, Quebec-born director Denis Villeneuve and (long-time) British cinematographer Roger Deakins. From the very opening, we have tense music and an action sequence that sets the tone for the whole movie. For quite some time, Kate - and the viewer - have little idea what's really going on, but plot-wise things gradually become clearer, while the moral ambiguity of the whole operation is never resolved. As with the film ""Traffic"" (which also starred Del Toro), this is all about American law enforcement agencies efforts to contain - if not combat - the smuggling of drugs in the face of widespread corruption and violence.In another recent film ""Good Kill"", a policeman asks a member of the military how the war on terror is going and receives the sardonic response that it's going as well as the war on drugs. At the conclusion of this thoroughly absorbing and hard-hitting film, you won't disagree.",,Anonymous,Crime
mostly good,"In the southwestern U.S. , an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is assigned to work for a CIA boss (Josh Brolin) and his associate (Benicio del Toro) in order to break into the leadership of a Mexican drug cartel that was responsible for a kidnapping operation in Arizona .Among the law enforcers, ""Sicario"" gives us the traditional battle between those who go by the book (Blunt) vs. those who just want to get things done (Brolin and del Toro). The performances are all good especially del Toro as a human-turned-animal whose presence is a force of nature. Sadly, the story lacks enough character development that might have added more heft in the conflicts involving principle.The true star of the film is the powerful direction by Denis Villeneuve. Every scene, even those with stillness, has an eerie edge that leaves viewers feeling like they've entered the dark side. There are also a few crowd/action scenes that are brilliantly executed with just the right amount of build-up tension leading to the action. While the film has the expected amount of violence, Villeneuve takes different approaches to minimize the effect such as scenes that show only the shooter but not the victims.Villeneuve has an impressive list of films highlighted by (in my opinion) ""Polytechnique"" (2009). ""Sicario"" is his second Hollywood film, ""Prisoners"" (2013) being the other. Both are good films but I feel each is a build-up to his eventual Hollywood masterpiece (maybe more than one) that is yet to come. I can hardly wait for the event.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Powerful Dread,"Sicario is a movie where you breathe danger. It paces quite long and slow, allowing you to linger a progress that may result to something horrifying in their case. This is an FBI versus cartel thriller, but it's not about the information between the feud. It's about showing how corruption tears this world apart and the people who still cares about their morals end up being helpless to get things right. This is a terribly bleak world and that's what makes Sicario a powerful experience. It establishes the dark side of their mission until there is no longer safety on their ground.The plot is basically a manhunt after a drug lord. And when FBI agent, Kate (Emily Blunt), joins with the CIA on this search, there is already something fishy about the operation, starting from introducing Alejandro (Benicio del Toro.) And it just keeps revealing more dirty strategies of finding their target, while the main character keeps getting annoyed by it. And that's pretty much the details you need to know about the story, because what this movie mainly offers is how things really go wrong with their decisions. Defeating their enemy isn't always triumphant when others get to die horribly, but their plan is their own justice and Kate has nothing to do about it, no matter how much she tries.And the simple merit here is Denis Villeneuve's direction. This is the filmmaker who knows how to create atmosphere. He made a movie, that you have no idea who exactly the villain is, feel terrifying, despite of not making any sense. In Sicario however, it's all over the place. Violence can occur at any turn ;the quieter the scene, the scarier it would be; because the director expertly designed it that way. It's as remarkable as the cinematography really taking you into the bleakness and the horror, from wider angles to something else. The opening scene, the highway scene and so one; it's just brims so much suspense that overpowers a lot of thrillers this year. The acting is equally subtle; Emily Blunt makes her role relatable enough, but it's Benicio del Toro who brings it to the table by making his role both intimidating and quietly human. Josh Brolin is just fun. That is all.Sicario is really about experiencing how things really go wrong and the moral complexities of their mission. The obvious, you won't find any good guys or heroes here. Good ideals will always struggle, violence will always be their easier justice; which makes the world a crueler place. And the movie pictures it terrifically; from imagery to atmosphere, we all know how its tension works: it's all ticking bomb. It takes you away from the comfort zone completely and lets you linger on uglier details and deadlier places. It's chilling, yet magnificent. It's an incredible kind of hopelessness that you'll have to swallow.",,Anonymous,Crime
The Vidiot Reviews...,"SicarioThe biggest importers of drugs across the Mexico/US border are seniors on fixed incomes.But as this crime-drama depicts anything stronger than blood-pressure medication is moved by the Mexican cartels.Asked to join a covert CIA task force after she uncovers a cartel graveyard on American soil, upright FBI agent Macer (Emily Blunt) finds her ethics compromised under the direction of her unlawful team leader Matt Graver (Josh Brolin).Joining their manhunt for the drug lord responsible for the corpses is the enigmatic Gillick (Benicio del Toro), who has ulterior motives for tagging along.Riddled with gritty performances from the entire cast and intense gunplay throughout, this brutal depiction of the drug war across the border, and the questionable characters involved in its continuance, is as eye opening as it is intriguing.Hopefully all this bloodshed will end when Mexico finally builds a wall to keep out American law enforcement.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
That's how to make an Action-Thriller,"At the beginning of Sicario, the definition of the title is explained. Sicario is the Spanish word for contract killer - a title that makes little sense for large parts of the film, as there is little or no hint of a hitman. But when the strands come together at the end and the final showdown takes place, you realise: this title is a bull's eye. Until it comes to that, an FBI agent is assisted by a mysterious association hired to help fight a Mexican drug cartel.Director Denis Villeneuve has done a great job with the cast. Emily Blunt finds herself in a moral dilemma over the mission as the ambitious but little respected Kate Macer within the male-dominated Force. The more she finds out about the organisation, the more suspicious and antagonistic she becomes. This leads to the point where, in the final act, she finds herself walking a fine line between life and death, entering interpersonal spirals. Blunt's performance is serious and tough, which makes Kate stand out as the only relevant female character. This is partly due to her chemistry with Benicio del Toro. He plays Alejandro, one of the group's top commanders. The two share great moments. Every dialogue and confrontation is tense and you never know what's coming next. Del Toro once again completely lives up to his reputation as a specialist in crime films. Like Blunt, he is very serious and at the beginning pretends to be the taciturn and mysterious justice fighter. Towards the end, however, the character takes on a new facet that makes him even more intriguing and fascinating. Alejandro's real intention is only revealed in the very last sequences of the film, resulting in the most memorable scenes and performance in the person of Del Toro. Josh Brolin, as the slightly lazy head of the organisation Matt Graver, stays rather in the background of the action. He is responsible for the comedic patter and wages a subtle small war of toxic masculinity against Blunt's character. Nevertheless, Graver is surprisingly likeable and is given additional elements by Brolin's acting, which then makes a basically generic character more remarkable.The stellar performances of the cast are not even Sicarios strongest points. Villeneuve once again manages to build a unique atmosphere. This time it is the irresistible suspense factor which leaves you riveted after the credits. This intensity is everything that a thriller should be about. In addition, there are brilliantly staged action scenes, most of which are very brief but insanely effective. Villeneuve does not skimp on bloodthirsty executions, but authentically presents the stark reality. The fact that these images have such an effect is also due to Roger Deakins' phenomenal camera work. Long shots of the Mexican desert mixed with quick cuts through hectic fight scenes. The only point where Sicario lacks something is in its story. As stirring and realistic as the protagonist's emotional conflict may be, the film often omits not unimportant details that could have made the plot more tangible. There is a need to catch up here, so I'd like to see more of it!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good kind of mystery,"A security operation through which a large number of corpses are explored reveals that there is a cartel war rising on the horizon, but in a hidden way, and ends with the formation of a team to eliminate the cartel in Mexico and target the big heads.The film focuses on the points of view of 3 people in the direction of the case, the first is Kate, a beginner who follows the laws strictly and considers that the mission is a moral responsibility, the second is Alejandro as Benicio Del Toro, who is experienced with mysterious intentions, and the third is Silvio (asiliano Maxim Hernandez), the Mexican policeman on his mission own.All of these personalities have their own side, who pulls the other into his world, and who is the correct point of view among them. The film focuses on questions and personalities, not events, in order to reach the Mexican cartel. Each character has a special direction to reach the goal, and this makes their opposing ideas cause a sharp collision between order and chaos, and between formulas that allow bad action and the fine line between good and evil.The film's opposing characters gave the film a mystery and made us wonder what exactly is happening and why it is implemented in this way. Then we quickly get to know the characters, but they are opposite through their actions and reactions. With these details, the director and writer were able to communicate their point of view to the viewer, and it was three things: how and when does information reach the viewer How do they hide this information, how do they benefit from this concealment, and finally how is tension built.Are Kate right or Matt and Alejandro right? Those who made Kate a marginalized role, so why did they choose her from the beginning until she abused her reactions, as if they were deliberately provoking her? We see the words of Matt and Alejandro and their side conversations, as well as their planning and movements with the mission and Kate, and we do not know what is happening, but when the information reached us, it reached us without value, as if they were taking advantage of Kate's ignorance and her presence for goals, but she is in the first place These targets are unknown.These vague goals are considered a problem in the subtraction, because when the viewer is not aware of what is happening, the matter becomes blurry and the events are considered vague, but Kate, since she is the character, has the same problem as the viewer, so she became a source of strength and is the basis of the course of the movie. It was wonderful when you see a mystery of this kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Confusing by Intention: the Anti-Story of Sicario,"Here we have Sicario. It's a film that twists and turns from its opening minutes, presenting a gritty tale of unprecedented carnage and deception. The world of the film is a smear of desert colors and rolling storm-clouds, high tech government labs and sprawling, dilapidated shanty towns. Sicario presents a striking visual style that cements the setting of the story.Emily Blunt's Kate is among the first of the characters we're introduced to. Their names we learn usually by proxy, and the film quickly introduces more characters than you can handle, all the while escalating the action and intensity as Kate is pulled back and forth along the Mexican border, which exposes two very contrasting territories. It's a story about catching the real bad-guys and making a difference in the drug war, or so we're led to believe. Of course, what unfolds is the proverbial ""tip of the iceberg"" scenario where everything Kate, our surrogate, considers to be right is turned on its head and left spinning as she makes the plunge.The film does have some problems, mainly with pacing. One entire subplot remains detached from the main thread until the climax of the film, and sees no real development despite reappearing multiple times throughout the film. The payoff is meant to be a shocker, but it ends up being fairly predictable by the standards the film had already set for the world. Having said that, the climax itself was gripping, as well as the minimalist score which is used to great effect. The ending leaves something to be desired, though I believe the effect is to leave one saying ""wait, that's it?"", just in the best possible way. The reality is that to this tale, there is no real resolution - to continue is a matter of resolve, to continue if one dares. In all, there are a few scenarios that make it difficult to uphold a suspension of disbelief, but keep in mind that this movie is designed to be a disturbing journey through and through. While it has its low points, the film never leaves your attention to wander for too long.Very good film, all in all.

Main actress role totally disposable,"This movie is a combination of several movies about the Mexico - USA drug traffic drama. It's a mix that works, however it falls short in several places and the plot leaves too many holes in the plot. You should just watch it and avoid to make too many questions. But the most surprising aspectof this movie is the way the director wasted the role of the main female character played by Emily Blunt. I still don't understand why she accepted this role after reading the script. Her role in the movie is just a first row spectator. With or without her the movie plot had developed exactly the same way and her character doesn't even get a full explanation why she was invited to join the team in the first place.

"a good thriller, Denis Villeneuve already is a reality.","Sicario is another movie most promising director of recent years, Denis Villeneuve, and he sends very well in the film, the film has great action scenes, and scenes dramatic too, Emily Blunt one of today's best actresses in my opinion this great , the cast is excellent, Benicio del Toro is well, Josh Brolin, Jon Bernthal, etc., the soundtrack fits the film, the script is good, the rhythm is good, I admit that I expected more of the film, especially the criticisms that I saw, the more I liked the movie, in addition to show the incredible potential director Denis Villeneuve driving very well, Sicario is highly recommended, especially those who like crime film.

Sicario,"I rated this film a 9/10. I should probably be considered a bit biased since one of the stars is an old friend, but I certainly wouldn't rate every film he's done before so high (a couple were downright awful). But if I'm being honest, I could've rated this a 10 and not felt like I was lying. The film's script is great, and the cinematography and direction really are as close to perfection as possible. And quick search on YouTube show that a couple of the scenes are already seen as legendary. Denis Villeneuve has made some fantastic films in his career and this is probably the one that's most overlooked and underrated. So when you sit down to watch a film, if you love a suspenseful action/thriller as much as I do, then you'll enjoy Sicario tremendously. It's one hell of a ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Masterpiece,"To me, this is the modern day ""Apocalypse Now"". The great thing about this film is that - not only is it incredibly suspenseful and thrilling to watch - it is also extremely philosophical. The film really is about ""Borders""; both literally and figuratively. Like Apocalypse Now, it really delves into what we become when we lose our sense of morality. It's just such a smart film. On top of all that, the acting is impeccable. Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin are outstanding.
I simply can't recommend this film enough.",,Anonymous,Crime
The Sicario of Denis Villeneuve retains the mystery.,"The Sicario of Denis Villeneuve retains the mystery. While not necessarily sprinting in at almost 2 hours, Sicario manages to maintain interest in what comes down in the final. In spite of the fact that the film tones and slows down after its intense introduction and first act, the story pushes to its conclusion. The work of the camera and the visuals selected help to animate what would be a very monotonous and laborious setting. The action keeps the film from becoming a bore, although not in gigantic bundles. While Emily Blunt takes the lead and delivers the most emotion throughout the picture, the more intriguing character Benicio Del Toro finds himself.Not much to argue with Josh Brolin completing the remaining major characters. Sicario lives up to his title as an action thriller. Run for the frontier.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good but not a masterpiece,"Lately I find highly rated movies that actually, and personally, do not involve and not excite me too much. One aspect that I find essential in a good movie, except the execution, is how it manages to surprise and arouse emotions.This film is technically good, the actors are fine, the story more or less interesting, but it not excited me, and even less surprised me.

Masterful direction of a mediocre story,"Epic cinematography with a phenomenal cast makes me wish this was all it could have been. Now, I admit I don't know much about drugs or drug trafficking, so I can't really speak to the realism of the premise but it contains a whole lot of things that seems highly implausible with a lot of questionable choices along the way.I don't know it the source material was this dumb or if Villeneuve made some very questionable choices but I can say that the end result is a bit of a mess. There are several phenomenal set pieces but even they don't really make any sense to me.The movie does keep the tension high and keeps us being worried about Emily Blunt's character as she is forced further and further out of her depth. But in the end nothing has really changed and none of the characters has grown or learned anything. We were just witness to an inconsequential part of a huge war on drugs.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
So simple but so effective!,"Taylor Sheridan has said he likes to write stories with simple plots so he can focus on characters. Boy does this strategy work for him!The storyline is simple but what makes the movie worth-watching is the writing, acting, and the execution.Roger Deakins once again proves himself to be a master of cinematography! And Villeneuve once again proves himself to be a director to keep your eyes on. He and Deakins really know how to bring out tension! When these two are together, they make gold!The music is fantastic. It's eerie, appropriately used, and does a great job at establishing and maintaining the tone, and building tension as much as the cinematography and direction do.The characters are well-defined, interesting, and likable. Kate doesn't go through much of a change but you like her character so much that you're glad she doesn't. (And I know some people have criticized her character for being weak. I think she's anything but weak. She's just totally out of her element and powerless. She wants to do the right thing at every turn but she can't, and eventually starts to question her ways like anybody in her situation would.)The use of visual storytelling was very much appreciated.Taylor Sheridan does an awesome job crafting complex characters and engaging dialogue scenes. He also does a great job at subverting expectations. I wasn't expecting the movie to take a turn into revenge territory. Or the reveal from Matt. All of these things are present in every piece of media he's written so far. (Except for ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" and I don't know about Sicario: Day of Soldado."" I need to watch that again. Haven't seen it since it came out.)All of the acting is great! Emily Blunt gives probably the best performance I've seen from her. (I remember her being great in ""Looper"" but it's been a while since I've seen it.) Josh Brolin helps to make his character goofy and shady. And Benicio is effortlessly cool and scary. (He's effortlessly cool by nature, though.)It's very disturbing. The horrific images get inside your head and you feel gross after seeing them.There is action that is restrained but effective. And the rest is bloody and makes for satisfying payoffs when the tension finally breaks.The tone is consistently dark and bleak.The editing is well-done.The pacing is slow but also consistent, which has been the case for all of the films I've seen from Villeneuve. There isn't really anything that makes me think, ""I'd probably cut that.""The only thing about the movie that bothered me was the shot of Kate getting strangled.

It's a great watch,"Have to say, I quite enjoyed this one to say the least. Performances were amazing by all involved, great characters, great plot, suspense kept throughout and best of all, it was entertaining.So, what I really liked about this movie is the plot. On the base of it, it seems really straight forward, but the almost 2 pronged attack to reach the end goal was fantastic. What I mean by this is that we follow Emily Blunt's character and we follow Del Toro's character. Both vastly different, but within the same FBI team. It's done really really well. It's not confusing at any stage, it includes some really good action shots and it keeps the suspense going throughout the 2 hours.Quick mention to the ending as well. It's not what you expect and it was such a fantastic way to end the movie. Really well thought out and ends the arcs of the characters well.I thought the characters were really well done. Of course the great performances by everyone helped, but the way each character had their own importance to the plot was just so good to watch. Too often there's a film, where most the characters serve little to no purpose. This isn't an issue here.But yeah, I don't need to go into any depth here really. If you like a thriller, if you like an action. This is a must watch movie. It has everything you need. Solid 8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Battling the Mexican Cartel,"Sicario is Denis Villeneuve's newest film revolving around the Mexican Drug War. The movie has many intriguing characters but the primary protagonist is Emily Blunt's character Kate Macer, an optimistic FBI agent recruited by a sort of ""Special Ops"" task force set to aid against the ongoing drug war along the border of the United States and Mexico. The movie bears strong performances from all the actors that are in it and has many contrasting character types that make the film a lot more enjoyable to watch, I was particularly impressed with Benicio Del Toro's performance. The movie has a very gritty and dark feel which may be a problem to some viewers because there never was a moment of the film that ever even portrayed a sliver of lightheartedness. The cinematography and the directing style like all of Villeneuve's films is beautiful and crisp and definitely an attractive aspect to the film. However as the movie goes on it seems to almost lose its driving force an seems to drag on without real intensity making the end of the film seem very weak and extended, however the ending was far from poor it just did not feel as impactful as it could have been. Overall Sicario is a good movie with stellar acting and beautiful cinematography with an interesting plot relating to the real world. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nuanced Conflict and Violence,"This one is absolutely terrific and is probably Denis Villeneuve's most underrated film in his history of directing. First, the score by Johann Johannsson was chilling through every scene and kept giving me goosebumps. The scenes were very tense and kept me on the edge of my seat. I also thought the cast and acting were superb. Benicio del Toro was amazing in this one along with Josh Brolin. I wish Daniel Kaluuya had a bit better role in this but he played a decent act for what they needed out of his character. Emily Blunt also did a fantastic job with her and Daniel showing some nuance into how deep US's role in the war against the drug cartel went and the lines they had to cross the further the story went. Fantastic film all around. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a poor film.,"Terribly dumb American propaganda with zero going for it. I actually registered just to vote this piece of trash film down. Benicio is just lovely but this whole film is pointless tosh, you'd really have to be a moron to enjoy it. Honestly cannot believe people are calling this film of the year. Really don't bother. I don't even have particularly high standards when it comes to films! It's like people will lap up anything that paints Americans in a good light even when it's nonsense over such a serious issue. Shame, such a shame. Fifteen minutes in and people were whispering about how surprisingly crap this film was, what amazed me is that it never improved. It just had sections that made no sense. Utterly lacking in realism, utterly unbelievable. People who think is at all an accurate story are living in some dumb ass fantasy land.

Gets better as it goes on.,"When i saw the first poster for this movie i decided to see it only because i really liked the design. But of course, i looked up who was involved in the creation of this film because i'm not made of money and decide very carefully which movie i pay to see at the theater.After finding out that the director is Denis Villeneuve i had a real, legitimate reason to pay for this movie because he has made a few great movies recently. Once again, he teamed up with cinematographer Roger Deakins who really knows how to do his job. The visual choices they made here are absolutely amazing and it gets better as the film goes on.I also have to give credit to Jóhann Jóhannsson who composed a great soundtrack which underlines the already great built up to the various action scenes which are also done very good.The characters and the dialogue are written very well and the performances of the actors are great. There are only few little details that really bother me.

I don't know if this would bother an average movie goer but for me it was really annoying.And this might not be any criticism about the film but during my view nobody in the room was competent enough to turn his or her phone off or at least turn it on silent mode because i heard ring tones at least five times during the film and there was also some worthless piece of trash two rows in front of me who checked Facebook almost the entire time.

Yawn...,"Poorly done - it's not character driven and has, until the 60 minute mark, no discernible plot, which, given it's a plot driven script, is difficult to watch.The first hour of this movie that could easily have fit into 12 minutes. 3 minutes if you just wanted dialogue ;) It's not quite an action flick at all - it's more suspense/thriller. The problem, for me, was that you can't have suspense without a story and you don't know, until 53 minutes into the movie, what, exactly, is going on.While the acting is good, I just can't bring myself to suffer through the entire ""greatness"" of this movie.I don't doubt that it may pick up and get better, but after an hour of ""wow, this is dragging and painful"" I just can't risk that it may continue on at the same pace. It's long periods of filler with moments of talking and Brolin smiling a lot, Blunt soul searching, and Benicio grumbling stuff.There was also a 3-4 minute scene, where hardly nothing was said, that this kid wakes up dad, mom is cooking, then we see the dad in his police uniform, and then nothing further with those charactersand that was about 15 minutes into the movieso 45 minutes go by with them not being seen again?

We Need More Films Like This,"Damn! This movie was something else. To start, I didn't know much of the film prior to seeing it. I watched the trailer once and didn't even finish it as to not ruin anything for myself when I saw it.This movie is labeled as an action drama, but may have just been labeled as a thriller for the palatable tension the movie created for the viewer. Similar to Everest, there were swathes of this movie where I was truly on the edge of my seat with my hands on each side of my face. The score creates this sickening tension that leaves you with the sensation that all hell could break loose at any second. The music coupled with the eerie and vast cinematography reminiscent of Seven and the 1st season of True Detective gave me a feeling of lost abandon and hopelessness throughout the film which of course, ties into the story.As for the story, do not expect your typical hand fed Hollywood plot. You will have to work to see all of the inter-workings and under-workings of the story that's being told. There is always a feeling in this film of something sinister working underneath it all. The story is only bolstered up by the complex and ever so cool characters that take the billing of this movie. And it's not just the three stars of the film that will draw your interest, the side characters and sub plots will have you rooting for or against anyone at any time.Every film has a complaint and this film is no exception. I did indeed have an issue with one character's particular development in the 3rd act of the film, but to avoid the risk of ruining anything for anyone, I'll leave my own reservations to myself. My only comments on the matter is that I felt the character's development did not seem to coincide with what was originally intended, but the development was perhaps an afterthought.Even with wrong turn, the film pulls out a work of art, a modern and fresh Traffic if you will, darker and more grand in scale. The content of the story is relevant and most will appreciate the content. The message, if there is one to be taken from the film can be interpreted two different ways I think. This is a cinephile's film. The pace of the film will be lost on most as the director builds his slow, albeit ever increasing beat to a crescendo that will leave you discussing the film afterwards for certain, as was my case.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Professionally done drug crime thriller with a lot of zeitgeist,"When film historians of the 2050's look back at the '10s, the style that Sicario represents will probably be a quite defining feeling of the era – a movie version of TV series like True Detective and Narcos. Droning soundtrack, cinematography pushing muted grey and brown and characters lost in their personal hopelessness. Drugs (or maybe terrorists), guns and technology. In this sense, Sicario is somewhat a textbook example.The film is well shot and has a rather good pacing for a thriller. In tone, it reminds me of Villeneuves earlier film Prisoners (2013) – throbbing soundtrack, world soaked in greys and desperation, broken people and morally ambiguous use of torture and violence. Sicario throws in techno thriller-stuff – drones, vehicle convoys and alphabet agencies. As for the cartels and the drug trade, Sicario doesn't seem to problematize or politicize the issue nor is it a lesson in history as for example Narcos is. I'm not American enough to recognize any hidden jabs about illegal immigration, either.The only thing hinting how ordinary people are just cogs (reminding us of Villeneuve's masterpiece Incendies[2010] which is basically about fate and misfortune) is the recurring scenes of the Mexican father who wakes up, eats his eggs and beans and goes off to work when his son only wants to play football.Emily Blunt does a good role as an idealist (or perhaps sane, if we are not to take the nihilist viewpoint as given) FBI agent who gets thrown in the deep end with the task force team led by rather stereotypical CIA-type guy Josh Brolin. The bunch is joined by Benicio del Toro who basically acts the enigmatic, Spanish speaking Benicio del Toro. Daniel Kaluuya is OK in his sidekick role.Some say that del Toro steals the show, but Blunt was my favourite with a strong female character who isn't a strong female character to the point of being a trope or unbelievable in the context. It was striking how similar the character was with 2nd season True Detective Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams). Then again, if this is the era of TV series getting more serious as a medium of telling stories to adults against infantile superhero fixated feature films, Sicario has a feature benefit of sparing us of longer escapades into relationship trust issues, something you essentially have to have when writing a 10+ hour TV series.All characters have a slight tinge of cliché, but hey – if this is the neoneonoir of the '10s, it is only to be expected. Sicario isn't anything new or mind blowing, but it is a skillfully crafted piece of film that delivers more than your average thriller, possibly because the subject matter is more interesting than your run-down-the-mill crime thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

What is right and what is wrong in such uncertain times?,"Sicario is a very decent action movie, with extremely tense and well-shot action sequences, superb directing by Dennis Villeneuve and AMAZING cinematography; this movie looks great. Regarding the story, it's an effective thriller, doesn't shy away from getting violent, but there's not much else. No big questions are attempting to get an answer.I must say the acting is very good. The stand-outs, for me, are Brolin and Del Toro. The latter's character is madly interesting. I must say that I hated it the first time I saw it, but second time I really got to like it. Maybe it helped that I'm now more familiar with Denis Villeneuve's work, thanks to his masterpiece Arrival. Or that my expectations changed (the marketing in my country was very different to the actual movie). So, if you didn't like it the first time around, give it another chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Riveting action thriller with a unbiased political twist,"Dennis Villeneuve seems to really be hitting his stride. With Sicario, the level of tension is cranked to 11, building on the tense atmosphere that defined his effort 'Prisoners' while adding some action and political commentary to spice things up.While the story is simple enough, as it unfolds the film is subtly commenting on the US-led War on Drugs, and not only its ineffectiveness, but what it can (and has) done to other countries caught in the crossfire. This is made especially clear in the final scenes. Sicario also must be commended for shining a light so intensely on what is in reality an ugly situation. None of us really know the true influence of their neighbours to the north over their country, but there is no doubt that Mexico is a violent place. In my humble opinion, leading a 'war' on drugs simply leads to more criminal activity – and this is certainly evident in the way Mexican Drug Cartels operate. Despite all this, this is not primarily a political film – it doesn't have an agenda. No sides are being taken here.This lack of bias affects the action in a positive way, as Sicario does not shy away from the often gruesome nature of what goes on in these situations, and doesn't attempt to place any political blame on anyone. The action simply continues to move.The plot is simple but effective. Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is a dedicated and loyal police officer. But at the start of the film her team stumble into a house whose walls are literally filled with rotting corpses; murders that are related to the actions of the Mexican cartel.If this film has a weak spot it is Blunt's character – she doesn't really progress from the green, idealistic officer that she is at the start of the film. Following the discovery of this house, she is offered a change of job – a chance to really make a difference. She is hesitant but is always motivated by what she thinks is right and accepts the new assignment.She is the moral compass of a movie that is filled with immoral behaviour, and despite the lack of development for her character, she does an excellent job.The new unit Kate begins to work for don't treat her seriously because of these idealistic attitudes and her 'rookie' status. The unit features a hilarious Josh Brolin as Matt, a mysterious man whose employer is never made clear, and who also is a man who often makes inappropriate comments given the context, causing me to laugh in a very similar way to the way violent Coen films make me giggle.But if we are talking about mysterious characters, we can't ignore a supremely intense turn by Benicio Del Toro – off the top of my head I can only think of 'Fear and Loathing' as a film where he played such an intense role and was so immersed in his character.He is known simply as Alejandro, and if the motives of Matt are shrouded in clouds, those of Alejandro are buried. It is this mystery that makes much of the movie a guessing game, as we try to pinpoint each characters' true intentions. All we know is that their operation has something to do with the southern US border and the Mexican Drug Cartels that seem to operate on both sides.After 'Prisoners', which suffered from a slightly overlong screenplay, Villeneuve has tightened the screws and has created a well-paced film, in fact the pacing feels perfect. When watching this film you get a sense that those behind the scenes really knew what they are doing.The cinematography is also something worth mentioning: thanks to DOP Richard Deakins, we are treated to many beautiful aerial shots of Mexico, as well as shots of the massive slums of the city, as if to hammer home the point of how many people this violence affects. I lost count of the different camera techniques that were used, with a lot of odd framing used, while there are other sections where the camera zooms in past the point of pixelation. Each scene, each shot feels purposeful. It may be a 2-hour movie but it flies by and it doesn't feel like a single shot was wasted. At one point we see what the agents are seeing: night-vision and thermal imaging devices dominate a couple of scenes and create an incredibly immersive experience that again ramps up that tension.The sound-editing/soundtrack here is also something that needs to be mentioned, as the work done is some of the best I have ever heard accompanying a film, period. Deafening silence dominates tense conversations where often barely a word is uttered as we wait on each word; while at other times the soundtrack booms and sounds truly dread-inducing, thanks to the work of Jóhann Jóhannsson, who also worked on 'Prisoners'The sound of gunfire sounded incredible also – there are a few violent set-pieces and they are executed as well as I have ever seen for a film of this nature. This movie doesn't mess around.Sicario is definitely one of the best so far this year. Go see it now!!www.epilepticmoondancer.net",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A great, solid, crime drama.","Sicario is the best film I've seen in theaters in 2015 thus far. Dennis Villeneuve returns once again with a complex, solid drama.This film calls upon a delicate balance between mainstream and art- house cinema, and is sure to hit a sweet spot with fans of either style. Benecio Del Toro knocks it out of the park with a dark performance that is striking in it's understated power. Emily Blunt proves solid as our lead character, who manages to give a fine performance despite having a slightly underdeveloped character. Josh Brolin proves himself great as always too, giving a charismatically unsettling performance.The cinematography in this film is gorgeous with Roger Deakins doing an (as per usual) fantastic job, particularly with his use of lighting in the nighttime scenes of the film. The soundtrack, by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson works well as the glue holding the film together, with perhaps his most haunting soundtrack to date.

Started and ended with death,"Personal/Plot: (What film was about/enjoyability?)
I enjoyed this movie, but somehow wish there was more action. There were two scenes that I thought were true action scenes, and everything else was suspense. Maybe I'm asking for a cliche from Villenueve, but maybe the movie is truly missing a huge action scene due to how the main character interacts/is naive with her surrounding environment. 1/2Aesthetic/Cinematography: (How film was made?) Villenueve is goated at cinematography and its shown here, My favorite scene was when the sun was setting, they were in tac gear, and moving down. Even there, visually you can make the connection in the color gradient that shows hell at the bottom (what they are entering and about to fight) and heaven above them (what they are moving away from to maintain the peace). He is extremely talented and its shown. 2/2Spiritual/Ending: (Beauty of film/inspire towards the transcendent) Beautiful examination of if the ends justify the means. This is most represented by the main character, played by Emilie Blunt, who struggles with crossing her own moral values to protect both Mexican and American lives. You can see that everyone else, even her FBI director, greenlights any and all tactics b/c there is a gruesome war (shown in the first scene and when she gets on the computer) that is all around her that she can't fight on American soil. It's also interesting that she doesn't grow throughout the entire film. Even in the end scene she resorts back to what she was in the beginning, struggling with her own values which cost lives. Alejandro is protagonist.Acting: (Can I do it better?) Wasn't terrible, and I liked how irritated the guy from 'Get Out' got when talking to Alejandro about who he is/what they doing. 1/1Score/Music: (Goosebumps/complement scenes?) Nothing stood out, lacking here FS. 0/1Recommend/Rewatch: 0/1 Good movie, not a great movie.Pacing: (Bearable?) Good pacing 1/1Total: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Sicario is a brilliant movie with extraordinary cinematography, amazing acting, a fantastic storyline and some impressive set pieces","Sicario is a brilliant movie with extraordinary cinematography, amazing acting, a fantastic storyline and some impressive set pieces. The aerial shots were just so good especially the ones that showed the convoy of cop-cars moving on the roads in Mexico. The director succeeds in building up the tension needed to fuel a thriller like Sicario. The horror unfolds as the plot thickens and this is why I would like to laud the director, Dennis Villeneuve. His movie will make the audience cringe and keep them entertained at the same time. Very few directors can actually pull this off. He did something similar with Prisoners. But whereas Prisoner's ending was ambiguous and mind-bending, Sicario's ending is extremely idealistic. The ending could have been a lot more brutal but I guess it's absolutely fine because the movie, as a whole, is really enjoyable. Emily Blunt's acting cannot be described in words. She is intense and the audience sees the movie from her character's perspective. She was brilliant as Rita Vratasky in Edge of Tomorrow and she is just as good in Sicario. She plays Kate Macer in this movie. Benicio Del Toro has hardly ever failed to disappoint. He plays the title role in this movie. Sicario means hit-man in Mexico. Benicio Del Toro plays the hit-man with unparalleled swagger and the right amount of shadiness. Josh Brolin plays a shameless cop and he does a great job.

Taking Aim at the Drug Wars,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: Another story about the drug wars that gives us more of the same but with styleGRADE: B-Sicario means hit-man. That is all you need to know to understand the underlying theme in this thriller about the drug wars. There will be much blood, carnage, revenge, and savagery. That is part of the territory in this crime genre and Sicario follows that proved formula and rarely strays off course. That is both its strength and its weakness. The literate screenplay by Taylor Sheridan shows the gritty and grisly side of the Mexican cartel and its ongoing success in illegal drug trafficking.￼We follow an idealistic F.B.I. recruit, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), as she undertakes an new assignment, meeting unsavory characters and slowly learning the corrupt system that is in place in this drug-infested borderland area between the USA and Mexico. In her baptism under fire, she partners with two old pros: Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a gruff but knowledgeable government agent in charge of the operation, and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a tough and intense policeman with many secrets and demons. The three actors are fine in their roles and make their characters very believable. Adding strong support are Daniel Kaluuya as Kate's partner and Jon Bernthal as Ted, a one-night stand.￼This is standard but effective storytelling. Nothing much surprises here plot-wise, but director Denis Villeneuve adds many nice visuals to this conventional tale. (The talented Roger Deakin's cinematography helps immensely.) The film's chief asset is the director's skill in contrasting the common lives of the Mexican people and their nonchalant attitude about the crime and violence that infects their everyday existence in the subtlest of ways. He doesn't shy away from the horror of decaying corpses or bloodied victims caught in the crossfires of the drug wars, sometimes lingering too long at the grotesque images he creates.￼Sicario takes us to an ugly and depressing world but it is not to every moviegoer's taste. While most of it is often predictable and unoriginal, the film remains interesting and compelling. Still, Villeneuve's technical expertise takes direct aim of its difficult subject and allows Sicario to hit the target at very close range more often than not.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Sicario"".  Merciless Means.  Yet is there an End?","At times (and it seems these times happen FAR too often) we all find ourselves checking to see how long a movie has until it ends, freeing us at long last from some manner of misery. And then there are cinematic gifts like ""Sicario"". Man, I NEVER wanted this brilliantly brutal masterpiece chronicling the down and dirty business of fighting Mexican drug trafficking to frickin' ever FINISH!Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Daniel Kaluuya. Uniformly exceptional performances from each of these TRUE pros in every sense of what this word stands for. One minor quibble. I REALLY would have liked to see Director Dennis Villeneuve focus in greater detail on Del Toro's agonizingly tormented character Alejandro. ""Sicario"", the exquisite model of top-tier movie making that it is, could have been considerably better served through more concentration invested in and close-ups of a man whose soul is condemned to be interminably tortured whether or not he exacts at last the vengeance he stalks with such fierce and unbridled commitment. Del Toro is certainly that class of actor who I believe could have given us even more to remember in an already tour de force performance.However unsavorily gained, U.S. law enforcement ultimately scores a major victory in ""Sicario"". The film's final images portray a seemingly innocent scene of a bunch of kids being cheered on by their moms while playing soccer in the Mexican dirt. The abrupt and menacing ""time out"" delivers a stark and sobering punch to the gut with the reality that this insidious war on drugs rages on.Brolin's character warns us earlier in this harrowing story that as long as 20% of Americans are consumers of the commodity at the core of this ruthless combat the fight must continue. Which leaves us to struggle with the enduring and deeply disturbing question...How, then, is it EVER going to end?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great action-thriller,"FBI field agent Kate Macer is approached to join a special anti- drugs task force that also involves the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice. She is given very little information about the methods or aims of the task force, except that it is going after senior members of a Mexican drug cartel. She soon realises that their methods are quite unorthodox, even potentially illegal, and the aim may be even more unconventional.Great action-thriller, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies). Slow-burning intensity with a great deal of intrigue. Not your average cops-and-drug-dealers story in that, like the lead character, the viewer is kept in the dark about much of the objectives of the mission. This keeps you guessing and makes the reveal even more profound in its impact.Great, realistic action scenes and good special effects.After showing herself to be a very good action performer in Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt gets another opportunity to further those credentials. Less action for her in this, but enough, and she does well. I can see her being the go-to female action star for a few years to come.Good support from Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and Daniel Kaluuya.The end message is a bit unsatisfactory and the target for derision too easy, and those would be the main negatives. Otherwise, a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Realistic but too many lengths,"As the title perfectly sums it up.I liked the very realistic side of the film: both in the actions of the characters, and in the often subjective way of filming, which gives us the impression of being part of the action.
Del Toro plays a dark role that fits him like a glove.Only one downside to ""heroin"" (the girl, not the drugs... :D) a little too ""teddy bear"" for my taste.
I find it hard to find credible that a SWAT team leader can still believe in Santa Claus and imagine that we're stopping and fighting a Mexican drug cartel scourge by the usual little legal procedures, filing files in court and pleading to a bar association...
And who, in his immense sense of infallible justice, persists and signs (or precisely would refrain from signing, even under the threat of a revolver under his chin) to think that one should stick to procedure, even after having seen all the ruthless methods that are the law in ""this universe""?
Mouais, and the marmot puts the chocolate in the tinfoil.But what bothered me the most was the multiple lengths.
However, it started off pretty strong with this SWAT arrest scene.
The tension comes down perfectly afterwards, as if to let the spectator and the characters breathe, who evacuate the tension of what they have just experienced.
And then after about a third of the film... It gets too much... you get bored with each one of these scenes that go on and on...
Any of them? Never mind. But then I come out with the feeling that it was always an exchange between a bit of action, and length... a bit of action... and length.... length... etc... etc....Several tens of seconds and almost ten different shots to film the desert seen from the sky from a jet in flight ... Is it really useful or was it to fill a lack of elements to hold a ""conventional"" film length?
Ditto with the surveillance camera images, before stopping a smuggler...Anyway, it's a pity.
It doesn't have to be a big fart to make a dynamic movie, but here, the overall action seems a bit too limited in favor of images and scenes not necessarily useful to the story, and, what's more, boring.To sum up, I liked the film, no doubt, but I was a bit disappointed by so many unjustified lengths in my opinion",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ordinary,"Sicario is about as ordinary a thriller as you can make without going too wrong. The acting is generally good and the photography is beautiful. Where the film goes wrong is in two places. (1) The direction fails to take advantage of two situations in which enormous tension could have been built and built - the scene on the line waiting to cross the border and the scene in the tunnel. Instead of being masterpieces, these scenes are merely OK. The setups are excellent, but the execution is merely ordinary. (2) The character played by Blunt is not true to herself, in the end, yet there is no real compelling reason to explain the transition. Films where the protagonist changes as a result of some fundamental reckoning are great, but in this case, it doesn't hold up for me. This is why the film ends as it does, because there is nothing to sustain the ending around the main character.All in all not a bad film, but highly predictable, not very subtle, and nothing you haven't seen already.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sicario (2015) - Review,"Well, this is my favourite film of the year so far.I loved this movie, more than that, I think Denis Villeneuve is becoming one of my favourite directors. I absolutely loved Prisoners and while Enemy was a bit too crazy for me it was still a masterfully made and very unique film. This film is maybe slightly below Prisoners in terms of quality but only very slightly.Emily Blunt is really proving herself to be very versatile these days, she was awesome in Edge of Tomorrow but she plays a different kind of badass here. She's the idealistic one, pulled into some really dirty stuff and the she gives the best performance of her career so far. Both Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Torro play great characters, you are never sure where you stand with them, you're never sure what they are going to do next which creates a great sense of unease a lot of the time.Speaking of unease, I feel like the highest compliment I can give a film is that it makes you feel something, be it sadness, happiness or in this case, extreme anxiousness. Villeneuve has some extreme skill at building tension, he did this in Prisoners too. There are some scenes in this that had me almost feeling sick I was so nervous, he drags these scenes out for just the right amount of time to build the tension and they never get boring.The plot, while maybe slightly familiar was really good, it kept me guessing and while this is by no means an action film, when action was utilized it was really well done. Both the way the action was filmed and the sound design gave it a really gritty and intense feel, loved it.Another masterful effort from one of the best filmmakers around today and my favourite film of the year so far, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"So far for me, the film of the year!","There are some films you just watch from beginning to end, completely enthralled when in the cinema, glued to your seat by a mixture of powerful performances, a gripping story and stand out photography. Sicario is one of those films. I saw this with my partner and they agreed wholeheartedly, this was a stand out movie from start to finish and will be making its way to my Blu-Ray collection as soon as available. Emily Blunt gives a solid performance as the lead, here she plays an idealistic FBI agent who wants to make a difference and is given the chance to do so against the Mexican drug cartels and their hit men, but just how far are you prepared to bend the law before you break it and become like them?While I cannot claim to be an expect on the Mexican Cartel drug trade or the complexities which must surround American attempts to police and control it I felt like we got pretty close to the truth with it here. No one is quite who they seem and every character has their own agenda to the end. One of the nice things about the film is the minimum use of dialogue. The actors really have room to breathe here in their performances and are well complimented by the haunting photography of Roger Deakins who does a visceral job of bringing the landscape of this world to life, with its brutal soaring heat combined with the darker and more shady tones. There's no weak links in the cast here, the stand out performance is Benicio Del Torro who conveys amazing menace with his character 'This is the land of wolves now'. Josh Brolin proves that his career has now soared above and beyond his own fathers with another assured performance as the Government Agent who is quite happy to use whatever tools he has to in order to achieve his objectives.While one might find plot holes if you really look I found this drama swept me completely away and was totally engaging.

Mix bag,"The first 30 minutes, and the final 30 minutes are great! The middle hour is rather boring, and it drags on and on. It is funny because Del Toro is mostly in the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes. He is the highlight of this movie and has the best action scenes. Speaking of action, this movie barely has any action. There is an intense and cool little shootout on a Mexican bridge, and then there is a cool final 20 minutes that have a lot of action and thrills, but overall this movie is actionless.Even if it didn't have action, I would mind if the characters were interesting. Del Toro and Brolin are the two most interesting in this movie, but they decide to focus on Blunt, whose character is so annoying. All she says is ""What is this? What is happening? What the hell? What are we doing?"" Her character is also poorly written because she is so scare and suspicious about what Del Toro and Brolin are doing in Mexico, but then she goes to a bar and hooks up with a dude without any suspicious thinking. She eventually gets attacked and almost raped by the man.Overall, the sounds of the guns are great, and the music is thrilling. I just wished this movie had more action and less of Blunt's character.

A simple premise delivered so effectively by Denis Villeneuve,"When settling down to watch Denis Villeneuve's Sicario, I was thinking back to his previous two films, Prisoners and Enemy. Both were extremely tense and Sicario is no different, in fact, Sicario is one of the most tense cinematic experiences you could have in 2015.Emily Blunt stars as Kate Macer, an FBI agent who does everything by the book, is recruited by government official, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), to join a task force in tracking down a drug lord responsible for bringing drugs across the border between the United States and Mexico.With the man they are chasing being directly responsible for the death of a number of her fellow agents in the kidnapping response team, Macer is more than keen to joint the hunt but when the truth begins to unravel, she finds herself in real danger.What makes Villeneuve such an enticing director is his ability to keep an audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish. Prisoners was emotionally draining while Enemy was downright weird, culminating in one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen.Sicario is neither emotionally draining or weird but Villeneuve's film perfectly builds tension around Macer's journey towards justice. It's a simple premise yet the film is so effective in its delivery that Villeneuve has warranted his place as one of the best directors of the thriller genre working today.Villeneuve manages to get the best from his cast in his films and Sicario is no different. Emily Blunt gives a career best performance as Kate Macer; brilliantly balancing both the experienced and naive sides to her character. Josh Brolin is his usual grizzled self, which is always great to watch, and Benicio del Toro gets his teeth into the mysterious Alejandro Gillick, a man who keeps Macer well and truly on her toes.As well as boasting some great performances, Sicario is also beautifully shot with some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins, somewhat a legend in his field. A story can be well told in a film but another dimension is added when the visuals are of such a high order. Deakin's camera work combined with Johann Johannsson's score makes for a real treat, in particular one tunnel sequence late in the film.Sicario may mean hit-man in Mexico but in cinema, Sicario simply means excellence.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unique.,"Sicario is one of those rare films that makes the 'Thriller' genre have meaning. Besides the tense moments and really strong character development, there lies a beautiful and yet hard shot film that keeps you glued to the screen.The film tells of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who works closely to raiding and putting down drug cartels across the US/Mexican border. Her handy work is enlisted by a government official Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and his crew including the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) to aid in a joint task force tracking down an anonymous drug lord. But it soon turns to more personal matters as Kate discovers why she is involved and why they are doing this without the book of rules.Directed by French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (who is behind the darkly gripping and acclaimed drama/thriller 'Prisoners') and with a solid script by Sons of Anarchy writer Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a standout thriller that lies in the sub-genre of drug and human trafficking, giving a close look into the people involved on both sides and what drives them to power. Not based on a true story in particular but it's a real life scenario that still occurs in the US and various parts of the world.The acting performances from Blunt, Brolin and del Toro are all strong throughout and it's possible that Blunt (or even the three of them) could get Golden Globe and Oscar attention. Blunt is such a great choice to be in this film, especially that her female cop role breaks the formula of the usual male lead and gives a different lead.The film's cinematography is beautiful, gritty and really well shot thanks to the work of Roger Deakins (Oscar nominee for No Country For Old Men and other works) and echoes the style and presentation of that film. I should mention as well that it's music score is also beautiful and really suits the film, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (Oscar nominee for The Theory of Everything) nails it and both of these men should get Oscar attention as well.Overall, Sicario is a slow burning, hard, gritty but yet beautifully shot thriller that will keep the fans of character built thrillers in their place.9/10 - Nick",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A boring, clichéd, dull, pointless and silly story about the drugs war.","An FBI Agent played by British actress Emily Blunt takes part in a raid that exposes drug-cartel activity. She then volunteers to join a joint task-force planning to disrupt the cartel by 'shaking the tree'. Other members of the task-force include Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.The trailer for the film looked promising, and the trailer is an accurate representation of the early scenes in the film. However, this action film is unbelievable as an accurate portrayal of the 'war on drugs'. Having said that, when assessing how the 'war on terror' was conducted, perhaps the film scenario cannot be completely ruled out. This would certainly have been a more accurate film if the cartel and the drugs were not in the film and it had just been a straight war film based on the 'war on terror'. If this is a true representation of the 'war on drugs', it is clear why that war is being lost. Those fighting the 'war on drugs', in this film, are plain stupid. The 'shaking of the tree' tactic, adopted at the start of the film, is bad enough. However, when the 'grand strategy' is finally revealed, it is laughable in it's simplicity and stupidity.The film itself consists of a number of scenes, each of which, whilst engaging enough in themselves, do not logically link up in any real way. The original scene is merely a McGuffin that is used to get the characters together and bears no relation to the following scene which is in the trailer. Then there is the bus scene, which again seems to have no connection with anything else. The bar-scene is unnecessary and the following scene is unbelievable. Most of the following scenes also seem unbelievable too.One saving grace for this film is that while this year's (2015) recent 'Solace' was a good story that was very badly filmed. 'Sicario' is a bad story, that at least is very well filmed. There is an authentically filmed night scene, however I have to admit that I just found it boring. On the other hand, one standout scene is the aerial film- shoot of the border. This was clearly a labour of love for Cinematographer Roger Deakins and interestingly shows that 'Donald Trump's Wall' is already partially built. There are also many vivid scenes of majestic mountains and run-down towns.The actors do their best. Miss Blunt acts her part well, showing much believable emotion. However, sadly her character is not believable. Her joining the task-force and going on the first mission is not believable. It takes her character an hour to realize what I realized at the start of this film. The film is shot from her POV, but the plot is so obvious that there are few, if any, surprises.Benicio Del Toro is a quiet brooding presence. Apparently, he requested, and got, a lot of his dialogue deleted. Good job too. Sadly though, again we have a completely unbelievable character. His back-story is meant to explain how he got to where he is. It merely contradicts. His actions in this film totally contradict the back- story. I was always expecting so much more from his character, but I got zilch. Nothing. There was just nothing to his character. However, when Mr Del Toro has some decent material to work with, he can give a very fine performance, such as his so well-rounded character in the drama 'Things We Lost in the Fire' (2007).2007 is also the year that Josh Brolin appeared in two drug-themed films, 'No Country for Old Men' and 'American Gangster' so this is familiar territory for Mr Brolin. In 'American Gangster', Josh played an abrasive cop with an easily discernible character. Here though, in 'Sicario' his character is much more laid-back and subdued, reminding me of John Malkovitch in 'Ripley's Game' (2002). Josh Brolin's career can be said to have peaked, and he reached the summit, in his fine performance in the recent 'Everest' (2015).British actor Daniel Kaluuya plays well his small part as an FBI Agent. However, Maximiliano Hernandez and Kim Larricho played two minor characters that we saw far too little of. What little they did, they did well. However, I am left thinking how much better this film would have been if their character-roles were much more central to the plot.Director Denis Villeneuve and Writer Taylor Sheridan have delivered up an unbelievable film and story. If it were true to life it would be a massive indictment of the 'war on drugs'. However, it is rather a massive indictment of poor and unbelievable story-telling. Action after action, and scene after scene, are just not believable. These things just would not happen. As improbability piles on top of improbability, perhaps people should just accept this as a silly action film.To see a much better film about drug-cartels, with real rounded three-dimensional characters, go and get a DVD of Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Collateral Damage' (2002), or the more recent 'End of Watch' (2012) starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pina.I thought 'Sicario' might have been a decent action film. Sadly, it just turned out to be unbelievable rubbish.Avoid! 5/10.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Troubling, in more ways than one","Disturbing, morally ambiguous, and tense. The subject, undercover ops fighting the drug war, is not one I gravitate towards, but this one had me riveted. Let's just say I was as uneasy as Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya's characters while watching it. They're trying to ensure things are done by the book (haha!), and also just trying to understand who all these people are and the real nature of their mission. Meanwhile a bunch of good ol' boys led by Josh Brolin and an ice cold special agent (Benicio del Toro) use advanced technology and violence to try to get to a drug kingpin.Maybe it's not too surprising that none of these characters on either side are virtuous, save the two who find themselves in one awful situation after another. The depths this takes are pretty horrifying though, and amidst all the ruthless executions Villeneuve manages some subtle moments that show us how morally depraved the two sides are. For example, the tendency to threaten family members, or the way Blunt is forcibly held down in much the same way by a corrupt cop and Brolin's character.For sheer tension and its brutally dark view of the drug war I probably would have rated it higher, but just how muscle bound the film was troubled me. I can't easily accept any film that shows torture as being necessary and effective, and that's what this one does, more than once. It gives us this nihilistic view of a ""land of the wolves,"" and yet, it seemed to me too accepting of Brolin and Del Toro's characters, as ""what it takes"" to be in this battle. If the point was to show how unwinnable and horrifying such a war is, and how effort should be spent instead on decriminalizing drugs or reducing demand, it should have spent at least a little energy there, instead of reveling in violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is a world where violence knows no distinction between the guilty and the innocent. It is one that will never be stopped by force. It is remarkable that any nation even tries. Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin enhance the story with wonderful performances. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"One of the very best, if also most brutal, movies of the year","""Sicario"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of the fight against a (fictional) Mexican drug cartel. As the movie opens, we are informed about the origin of the word sicario (zealots of Jerusalem) and that it is the Mexican term for hit man. Then we are immediately dropped into the action, as we see Kate and the rest of her FBI Special Weapons and Tactic Team overpower the tenants of a house in suburban Phoenix, only to make a gruesome discovery. It's not long before Kate, who wants to bring justice to whoever did that, is recruited to a joint task force with DOD to track down a drug lord in Mexico. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, who previously brought us the outstanding (and Oscar-nominated) film ""Incendies"" a few years ago. Here Villeneuve examines the battle(s) between the Mexican cartels and the US government. Second, as the movie started playing out, when things are quite complex to grasp all that is going on, we find ourselves in good company, as it turns out that the Kate character is equally confused herself. It all becomes clear later on. Third, this is one of the most tense movies I have seen in a long, long time. From the opening scenes, you are clammed up as you're watching what is unfolding, and the amazing thing is that the movie simply DOESN'T LET UP. There are some unbelievable scenes that will have your jaw drop to the floor (no worries, I won't spoil). Fourth, it also must be stated that this movie is unrelenting in its violence and brutality. If that is a potential issue for you (and you know yourself better than anyone), please do not tempt fate. This movie is simply not for the faint of heart, and then some. Fifth, kudos to some outstanding performances, including Emily Blunt (as Kate). Watch her face when she expresses doubts about the legality of what is happening, and her superior tells her ""If you fear you're out of bounds, you're not. The boundary has been moved"", wow. Benicio del Toro is equally top notch as the mysterious adviser to the joint task force. Last but not least, there is a fantastic orchestral score, courtesy of Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson ( who previously gave us the equally delightful score for ""The Theory of Everything""). Bottom line: ""Sicario"" is one of the best movies I have seen this year, and that is saying something, as I see a LOT of movies.""Sicario"" opened nationwide today and I couldn't wait to go see it. The evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was PACKED, much to my surprise. Guess there still is demand for a top-notch quality movie that doesn't involve comic action heroes. If you can stand the violence and the unrelenting tension, do yourself a favor and go check this out, be it in the theater, or VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Sicario"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Moral dilemmas abound in 'Sicario',"The Mexican drug cartels that are responsible for a large part of drug trafficking across the United States' southern border and the FBI that is responsible for pursuing them are front and center in Denis Villeneuve's thriller 'Sicario.' The cat-and-mouse chase that is widely known by many but understood by few makes for an interesting plot, but it's really the politics, red tape and difficult decisions that need to be made that are explored in the film.In 'Sicario,' an up-and-coming FBI agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is summoned to support a multi-agency effort to weed out a kingpin drug lord on the El Jason border - an effort led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and a chameleonesque Mexican agent played by Benicio Del Toro. As the sting gets underway, Macer quickly learns things are not quite how they appear on the surface, and through the process she is tasked with acting on her principles or what others believe is the appropriate thing to do. This set of moral dilemmas is what increases the interest level in 'Sicario,' rather than the action sequences that dominate the screen time.The film's strengths are namely the screenplay, cinematography (including earning an Academy Award nomination) and acting performances, particularly when it comes to Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro. The tug-of-war between the dueling priorities among the U.S. team's side makes for an exciting premise from an acting standpoint, as there is a lot of tough talk and tense situations that must be navigated. There are plenty of twists and turns before we get to the climax, and it's fair to say the resolution will leave many questions among audiences.'Sicario' is the kind of thriller that will fly under the radar but still be held in high regard among fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""In Mexico, Sicario means hit-man.""","Sicario is one of the darkest experiences I've had with a film since watching Se7en for the first time. However, this is also one of the best directed films of the entire year with outstanding performances from its main cast, as well as lush cinematography throughout its two hour runtime.This film was directed by Denis Villeneuve, the director of one of my top five favorite films of 2013, Prisoners. With Prisoners, Villeneuve proved how skillful he was with creating suspense through his direction. Here in Sicario, he solidifies himself as a master of tension. The film has an excellent buildup where scene-after-scene the film gets better, gets more suspenseful the longer the film runs.One thing that struck me about the way Sicario looked was that nighttime actually looked like it was nighttime. Something very common with films is that there's always weird lighting on actor's faces whenever a nighttime shot is being filmed. In this movie though, I never thought that a single time. And that just shows how brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins as director of photography. I don't know how he did it, but it its absolutely gorgeous.Emily Blunt is spectacular as an idealistic FBI agent who is recruited to pursue the leader of a major cartel in Mexico. This is the best work I've seen from her. We experience the film from her perspective, and the shock and bewilderment we see her experience, from the environment she's in, to certain things that take place, is where the emotional core of the film sits with the viewer. Josh Brolin does great work as an extremely likable agent who likes to relax, maybe doesn't always play by the rules, but is very good at his job. However, Benicio Del Toro is the best part about this movie. I'm not going to say much about his character, but I will say that he is truly Oscar-worthy in this film, and his performance is absolutely magnetic.Like Se7en, there is no hope to be found in Sicario. Everywhere you see these characters go, you're disgusted and haunted by what you see. Like the unknown land these characters cross into, you have no idea where the border is between right or wrong, black or white. Instead, everything falls into the gray area, and as a result, there are no limits on what these characters will do, and that is scary.Sicario has some of the best performances of the year, incredible cinematography, and, in my opinion, shows that Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today, and now I can't wait for Blade Runner 2. This film goes into wide release this Friday, so go see it, because it's among the best films of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thrilling mystery but a bit overrated,"The first thing I absolutely have to say is that thia movie is definitely tense. It really makes you glued to the screen and many scenes were just perfectly made . If I was to judge the movie by the way it was made , it would be 9/10 for sure but certain things just didn't click with me.Emily Blunt is a main character in this movie but her character is incredibly dull , I just didn't really care about her. I appreciate the tense scenes and if anyone instead of her was in that scene I would feel exactly the same way . She just doesn't stand out and THAT is my problem with this movie.Nothing really stands out except well done thrilling scenes. The plot is following 3 directions. One is Emily Blunt as an FBI agent that is still a rookie . I didn't like her character but if movie had focused a bit more on her I feel that would have been a better story. Instead of that we also follow long a border control guys fighting cartel and we also have a revenge story with a different character. It all eventually ties together by the end but when your story follows too many paths , you will get lost for no reason.I don't want to sound too negative , I still really liked this movie for what it is. It looks amazing and the whole world just feels real , maybe sometimes too real but that makes it soo thrilling. The acting is done perfectly , everyone did an amazing job especially Emily Blunt. I wish they did more with her character instead just throw her in situations and hearing her bitch about it thru the whole movie.Definitely don't miss this movie but don't be expecting a masterpiece because of so many 10/10 reviews. Go see it and judge by yourself. Everyone has a different opinion.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Enthralling, tense and immersive. A masterpiece.","Federal authorities carefully and silently approach a suburban home in Phoenix. They raid the house looking for a hostage; instead they find dozens of dead bodies packed inside the walls. This is Mexican drug cartel business, and it has now crept well over the border. Opening with this superbly crafted sequence, Sicario is an unrelenting portrayal of the seemingly unwinnable war against drugs and, more crucially, the ruthless cartel bosses who will do anything to strike fear in the people. Emily Blunt's FBI agent is our eyes and ears into this world, as she's pulled into a legally and morally cloudy task force supposedly given free reign to strike off the snake's head by any means necessary. Blunt is amazing, striking the perfect balance between the-way-it-ought-to-be idealism and the-way-it-actually-is practicality; never completely giving away which side she'll ultimately land. It's a ferociously gripping and uncompromisingly bleak story, as written by Taylor Sheridan, with Denis Villeneuve's direction raising the stakes even higher through taut, immersive and potent set pieces. There are at least three high-stakes sequences that are utterly exhilarating thanks to Villeneuve's unique vision and Roger Deakins' remarkable cinematography, yet the quieter moments are equally powerful due to a trio of scintillating performances. Along with Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro command the screen, the former as a charismatic but shady federal agent with a deep conviction, the latter as a mysterious ""contractor"" who is riddled with torment and anger. Sicario is a psychologically bruising film that offers no easy answers; it's also tense, enthralling and, quite simply, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tense intelligent filmmaking for 2010 decade,"If you desire a film to challenge your socio-political beliefs while delivering a powerfully presented message for the past decade, this is the film.This movie deals with how American security/LEO organizations are dealing with drug cartels in the present time frame. It's not a pretty or jingoistic presentation.Villanueve deftly gives the viewer all the particulars and let's the viewer draw their own conclusions given the story's background and present day situation. The movie explores the complexities that face the LEO and other government agencies trying to curb the multi-million dollar drug trade conducted in America from foreign actors. It's clear early on that the FBI is depicted as the naive child in this arrangement. CIA and other shadowy government officials are calling the shots.Once, the plot unfolds, the movie heads to its third act that really challenges the viewer's opinions how America should or should not be fighting the war against the drug traffickers. The acting, writing, directing are all outstanding. Of particular note, legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins is on the camera. This alone should drive any seasoned film buff to seek out this film.

Immediately you are swept into the intensity that continues all throughout this film.

Moral ambiguity has never been so blatant and all the while, a sense of truth for the story telling can be felt. Border disputes, drug cartels, and crooked governments are the plot and the tag line should read, ""Do the Best Thing or Do the Right Thing"". Outstanding performances by Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin.

For an experienced law official she was too unbelievable for me to buy into her role. Should have cut her out entirely. The only dumb female movie cliché they didn't have her do was run in the woods with heels on. Would give a nine except for Emily Blunt. Really hope if they make another they leave her out.

A hit!!!,"Director Denis Villeneuve has imported in a tour-de-force picture in ""Sicario"". The movie stars Emily Blunt as FBI Agent Kate Mercer. She is recruited by the mercy (sort of, kind of) of a U.S. government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. Half mercy on Mercer because even though she volunteered for the journey, this is not what she envisioned it to be. Josh Brolin co-stars as the Government Agent Matt Graver who does not want to dig his own grave in this dangerous mission, so he manipulates Mercer in ways I will not reveal. At the center of this mission, is the mysterious Alejandro played by Benicio Del Toro. Villeneuve marveled in his orchestration of ""Sicario"" by keeping it tense and unpredictable. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay was a little bit of a bust, but not so much to lessen the movie's strength. Blunt delivers the best performance of her career as Mercer; and Mercy, Mercy, Me why in the world was she not nominated for a Best Actress Oscar! Brolin was his usual steady self in his work as Graver. Del Toro was the scene stealer of the movie though, and there were plenty of hits to that statement; I will just leave it at that.

Sicario really packs a punch,"This gritty, violent thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve, the mastermind behind 'Prisoners' and 'The Place Beyond The Pines' sets a grounded story during the U.S/Mexican drug wars heightened in the U.S border where crime against society runs dangerously rampant and drug cartels dominate the streets. The film places Emily Blunt in the role of Kate Mercer, an idealistic DEA agent who volunteers for an operation to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel. Partnered up with veteran DEA agent Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Wilson (played by Benicio Del Toro) who is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and child, Kate travels through the brooding streets of El Paso in search of the cartel, only to witness harrowing events that while busting the suspects connected to the cartel. As Kate and her team dive deeper and deeper into the operation, she is faced with the grim reality of drug trafficking business and the complexities of capturing the cartel. As explained the title card during the opening credits, sicario is the Spanish word for hit-man.This thought-provoking thriller could be just your average action popcorn flick taxed with tense action sequences and special effects. However, it has a lot more thoughtful elements to bring to the table than flashy action set pieces; and it certainly digs deep. The film presses the story in the violent underworld of drug trafficking and the apparent corruption lead in the law enforcement, including characters who have blurred lines between right and wrong. This all begins with the opening scene set in Chandler, Arizona where a team of DEA agents are making a drug bust that results in an operation gone terribly wrong with innocent lives lost. Then there's a shot showing Emily Blunt's character in the shower washing off the blood resulted in the incident. These first ten minutes really set the tone of the film, and it gives a clear picture what the story will be diving into. From that point, the story focuses on the characters and their experiences drawing into the drug busting operation, and the scenes to follow get pretty violent and grim without being overly excessive. The characters are crucially developed and stand powerful throughout the picture, particularly Benicio Del Toro's character who is significantly complex, serves as a turning point for the story during its climax.Roger Deakins has been one of the most respected cinematographers in Hollywood, despite his lack of Oscar landings, and he delivers powerful cinematography this film. Each scene from start to finish to shot superbly and fits well with the atmosphere. The biggest gem comes with the characters driving through El Paso where we are treated sadistic views of the crime-ridden streets including four decapitated bodies hanging from an overpass and corpses mutilated and covered in blood. This scene is very difficult to look at, but makes crucial sense to the plot's dreary atmosphere. The performances are also quite the attention grabbers. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are both fantastic in their roles, and deserve immense amount of praise for their striving commitment they put in their characters.Sicario stands high as one of the best films of 2015 and perhaps, one of the best films of this decade so far. This film is exuberantly shot, very well acted, and paints an authentic picture of the reality of drug wars that go on in the U.S/Mexican border. Yes, the film is violent and difficult to watch at times, but at the same time, one that deserves your attention. It also shows a strong signal that director Denis Villenueve has a bright filmography ahead of him.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denis Villeneuve Scores Again with One of 2015's Best,"Denis Villeneuve continues to knock 'em dead with (in my opinion) his best film yet: SICARIO. I took interest in the man with his 2013 double-punch of PRISONERS and ENEMY (both of which are great films) but SICARIO was the only one I loved so much that I immediately texted a couple buddies and told them they need to watch. From the moment it started with the raid on a cartel stash house in an Arizona suburb, I was locked in and it never lost steam. I love this movie; it might be my favorite of 2015. Emily Blunt is FBI agent Kate Macer, a successful career woman who is given the opportunity to volunteer for an inter-agency operation that plans to go after some of the more powerful cartel heads. She's placed on a team run by CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) with assistance from a mysterious D.O.D. consultant named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Graver and Alejandro keep her in the dark on the overarching details of their operation but she begins to question the legality when the men seem to be bending the law in the name of justice. It all culminates in one final mission when Graver and his team have done enough damage to the cartel's local business to send a minor boss running back to Mexico, falling right into line with their plans to cripple the organization. When Graver's methods cross the line, Macer finds herself in a maelstrom of violence where the end may not justify the means.I love everything about SICARIO. The performances. The cinematography. The story. The music. Everything comes together so perfectly. Emily Blunt has proved in recent years that she's more than capable of handling the meatier roles with EDGE OF TOMORROW from 2014 proving she's an effective action hero and SICARIO giving her the chance to up the ante in a more realistic violent environment. Her character, Macer, acts as the audience surrogate in this world. She's seen some rough times in her career but she struggles with the cartel's level of brutality. When she begins to understand that the American task force has adapted some shady methods of its own to combat it, she's not ready to accept it as the best course of action. When she learns of Graver and Alejandro's objective and the truth behind her inclusion in the task force to begin with, it's a gut punch and Blunt nails all of it. Brolin does a fantastic job as the jovial Graver but he's overshadowed by Blunt and Del Toro. Del Toro is the other knockout performance in SICARIO. His character is an enigma. All we learn at the start is that he is a ""D.O.D. consultant"" but it's not readily made clear what his role is. He keeps to himself and seems to have a pretty good understanding of cartel operations, but his real mission doesn't come out until the end. He gets his big moment at the end and we learn this is a man in pain, and he's turned that pain into a weapon. Del Toro absolutely kills it in one of his best roles ever.Another aspect of SICARIO I thought was a great touch was how Villeneuve shows us both sides of the coin. Mexico isn't our enemy. The cartels are our enemy. The problem is how much the cartels have ingrained themselves in the Mexican economy. Throughout the movie, we occasionally cut away to a nondescript Mexican family. The father is a police officer and works odd hours, often missing out on time with his son. We're given a chance to invest a little in this quiet three-person family before we learn who this man is, how he plays into the main story and what his fate will be, and then we're left to wonder about the future of his family. SICARIO presents the war against the cartels as bad for everyone. Lives are ruined. Morals are abandoned. And worst of all, there appears to be no clear end in sight. Everyone loses. SICARIO is a seriously bleak film but I love that it doesn't pull any punches or try to sugarcoat its message. This isn't an action movie in line with the Bourne films or anything of that nature; SICARIO is very much a psychological drama. I watch this movie and it's rumbling around my head for a couple days after it's over. I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone and I can't wait to see what Villeneuve brings us next.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perfect in its own right,"This move is simply outstanding. The directing, the acting from the 3 main characters, being Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro is very believable. The story is very compelling. The cinematography is gorgeous. The futility of the drug war, and its literal elimination of morality, lingers throughout the film. Emily Blunt and Del Toro are flawless in tension together as their values clash, and Brolin fits the typical American bravado role seamlessly. It is one of its kind, a movie addressing the Mexican/US drug cartel concerns, and executing it with utter class, style and realism.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Loved it,"I can't be bothered to write detailed long reviews anymore (not in English at least, it's not my first language) since I don't have the time and or interest in writing them. But I like to blurt out stuff so here we go.I had waited for the movie a long time and it didn't disappoint. I liked pretty much everything in the movie. The acting, the direction, the suspense, the score, the visuals. The plot was not as amazing as the rest of the movie, but it was good.Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro were both amazing in the movie. Josh Brolin was good as well. I don't like Jon Bernthal, but he played a role that really suited him and he was surprisingly good.Directing and cinematography were great. The movie had a lot of great visuals. Sometimes it felt like I was watching a documentary about Mexican/Texan landscape, but I didn't mind that. It was great. It was something different. The direction really mixed well with the score. The score goes up and down and creates great tension and suspense.I'm gonna say that this is my favorite movie of the year.I have never seen a movie by Denis Villeneuve before. I will most likely check out his previous work.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated and slow; big disappointment,"I went to see sicario solely because of the 8.1 IMDb rating the film enjoyed - and boy was I disappointed.I have been let down by IMDb only a few times in many years and this was definitely one of those instances.The movie had an incredibly slow pace with nothing much really happening until almost halfway in; the plot was also confusing and poorly explained; and no it didn't lead to some massive mystery unraveling at the end when everything comes together; the end was as pithy as the rest of the movie with a dry feeling of ""this movie could've been so much better"" left in my mouth.The cast: Emily Blunt's role was so weak and confusing that I struggled to understand exactly what she was supposed to be doing in the film. Her character was completely out of place in almost every scene she was in; she did NOT portray an image of a competent professional tactical FBI agent; in most scenes it looked like she barely knew how to hold a gun let alone fire it. Josh Brolin was fine as always; but Benicio Del Toro was definitely the saving grace that prevented me from walking out of the movie hall before the end; he was exemplary playing his role perfectly.All in all: the movie was a major disappointment and waste of time. It could've been so much better with the cast and budget that it had; if only...",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tense and beautifully shot.,"This film is intense. It's a simple concept that does not follow the cliche plot lines of the genre it's in. Sicario is unpredictable and dark. Something you could see taking place in the real world.Roger Deakins is the cinematographer for this film. He lives up to his name, once again, and gives us a beautiful movie to look at. Some of the shots are breathtaking.The acting is also top notch. Emily Blunt, now perhaps my favorite actress, is flawless in this film and gives us a great character to see the story through. However, Del Toro is the star of the show...he is badass and nailed every scene he is in; definitely the most fascinating character in the movie.Sicario is yet another great movie from Denis. He is one of the most talented directors working today and this film illustrates that fact.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Superb ! Tense thriller !,"A must watch thriller based on crackdown efforts by US joint-agencies on the Mexican Drug mafia. Emily Blunt, playing the role of an idealistic FBI agent in the plot represents the general audience, through her actions and reactions to the out-of-the-book methods of the team.
One of those movies which are rightly paced at right moments, with excellent cinematography and background music score. The build-up to the tense moments, when the viewer knows something is about to happen but when and how, is the USP of this movie.
A must watch for those seeking tense, paced and realistic action thriller, with no over-the-top action sequences and silly dialogues.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fast and full of energy but missing a lot of points,"Sicario is a fast thriller pumped with a lot of energy. Makes the viewer sitting glued to her spot. Felt very realistic, as if I was right there, the lack of music in many parts only increased this feeling. I saw people complaining of the movie having no ""main story"" but I think this was its strength, getting an insight into a 2 w mission, not too dramatic, not too boring, it felt like a documentary turned movie and definitely got your heart rate up.
On the other hand there was a lot of  turndowns; especially Kate's character which is described as a green, sentimental, newbie. They could easily have chosen a man for that role but why bother? Additionally her partner is the only coloured in the movie and sadly he has to play a side role and chauffeur (even though he is a lawyer!).

Drug traffic and corruption,"This movie is different from those we use to see of this kind. It has other elements such as personal motivations and relationships, police corruption and the opposition between legal and illegal ways of fighting drug traffic. A CIA agent included in a SWAT team that is trying to find and arrest a drug traffic Mexican boss uses violent and illegal methods of dealing with traffickers while capturing and interrogating them to which an idealistic DEA lady agent who accompanies the team is opposed and refuses to collaborate. This leads to a conflict that is shown in some expressive and intense dramatic scenes. Besides this the usual violent scenes of chasing and shooting are appalling and very well filmed.

True Crime Juarez Style!!!!!,"OMFG. I can't emphasize enough in this review how much I absolutely loved this movie. I just finished watching this movie at 10pm and I had to get this review out ASAP. I will start with the story which is cliché but it's also indomitably told in real time. I know a handful of movies that use flashbacks to tell the story but this one doesn't and I enjoy that fact. I will say this much about the story that it's about an FBI agent tasked with helping a non-disclosed agency take down a Cartel. I will now move onto the acting which brought there A-Game for sure. The cast is incredibly strong with Emily Blunt,Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro being the main three characters. They are all fascinating but Del Toro in my opinion blows the movie out of the water with his character. They all have fantastic rapport. I will now move onto the action which while this isn't a Michael Bay movie the scenes that do take place are on point with excruciating detail that it boarders realism. The scenes are violent and bloody and are meant to invoke a certain feeling of awe and dread simultaneously. I must also talk about the cinematography which was done by Roger Deakins who is a mastermind when it comes to the angles and etc of the film and it's absolutely Phenomenal in every aspect and it brings the movie to life and the sounds of everything in the movie from the gunfire to the city aspect will leave you transfixed onto the screen. The banter between the characters including the Delta Force Operators is impeccably done. The director Denis Villeneuve was terrific and I applaud him for such a powerhouse of a motion picture. I will finish by saying this is my new favorite movie of 2015 which prior was ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" but this takes the whole bakery. I would recommend watching this movie without a doubt. A Masterpiece rapped in a bow.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Intense and compelling.,"Intense and compelling, this beautifully shot thriller features wonderful work from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, amongst others, and depicts a murky, morally vacuous war against drugs on the Mexican border.Blunt plays Kate Macer, an FBI agent who, fed on half truths and lies, slowly realises the nature of the mission she's a part of. It's a powerful and visceral turn, and has much to do with the success of the film. Similarly, del Toro is brilliantly inscrutable as Alejandro and Josh Brolin does fine work as Matt, the apparent architect of the chaos. These three leads work brilliantly together, the friction between their characters driving the film. However, it's Blunt's gilt-edged performance as the stories moral compass that forms the centrepiece.Roger Deakins cinematography is a highlight. The screen is filled with beautiful skyscapes and sunsets, the characters descending in silhouette to an underworld, a tunnel across the border. Denis Villenueve directs with verve and pace, never allowing the film to falter for a second. An early foray into Mexico is as taut and tense as anything you will find on film, and Villenueve, having grabbed you, simply doesn't let go.One of the best films of the year.

"Good, possibly great, but certainly not for the reasons you think","The cinematography was outstanding and the performances were great, but I did not like this film, yet I was compelled to give it a favorable rating. Either it was a cleverly devised piece of film work or an accidental genius, I do not know. I can't remember the last time I felt so conflicted about a film.The main character Kate Macer is played by Emily Blunt; she was dreadful, but not because of her acting, because of the inherent nature of the character. I can't imagine any feminist liking this movie at all. Not only is she kept in the dark by her male counterparts, but she is used, for their progressive purposes to do what she inherently is, a woman out of her league. At every turn of the movie she is is faced with insubordination by men; she is out matched and manhandled in physical confrontation by men and stuck trying to decide how she feels or what she should do instead of reacting to her environment using FBI trained field instincts - instead of shooting first and asking questions later. Take what you want from that. In short, she came off very weak. I am not an expert on FBI anti-drug tactics or what demographics comprise the elite agents who deal with this kind of warfare.Who's story is this? The direction of film changes to focus more on Benicio Del Toro who plays Alejandro - a man seeking revenge, but also in some kind of way helping the FBI tracking down a drug kingpin. The focus subtly shifts, yet the character development of Alejandro is never fully revealed, it is merely insinuated through Josh Brolin who plays Matt Graver and the audience is left watching the warpath reactions of Alejandro - who is the type of person who shoots first and ask questions later.This film, I feel is Oscar worthy, yet I really felt off put by who I thought the protagonist was - and I came to that assessment by how much screen time that character got - meaning Kate Macer received the most screen time. Because of this and the ending of the film, I felt truly conflicted, which is great that a film could garner this result - however, as I've stated before I did not like the main character.I will probably watch it again, because I feel like this is a film where you can't get all the innuendos and all the motives in one watching, however I will not be adding it to my collection.Overall I advise that movie fans watch this movie because it is certainly not a cookie cutter approach and invokes deeper introspection when viewing the film in it's entirety.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic suspense,"A tale of the dirty, dirty drug war taking place between the border of Mexico and the US. Emily Blunt plays the audience surrogate, an FBI agent who, after stumbling upon a horrifying scene of cartel violence in suburban Phoenix, is recruited by a mysterious, obviously important government figure (Josh Brolin) to help him get the top people who are really responsible for the crime, which is just one of many similar crimes that are encroaching further and further into ""civilized"" territories. Even if you end up finding the story a little too vague (I didn't, but I could easily imagine someone thinking that), you have to admit it's one of the most suspenseful films to come out in quite some time. The whole entrance into and exit from Juarez near the beginning of the film is a master class in creating anxiety. It's more terrifying than the vast majority of horror films. And that's just one sequence among several great set pieces. I do have some slight problems/questions about how Blunt fits into the whole picture. In the end, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of sense. I also think she comes off as a tad too naive. She's an FBI agent, not a small town police officer. I like her performance, but it may be a little too one-note to qualify as great. She is understandably in shock for most of the film, and the script has to resort to the old ""I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!"" shtick to have her emote. The best performance by far comes from Benicio del Toro, who plays Brolin's ""advisor"" who clearly has way more going on behind his shadowy mien. Any flaws are minor, though, and could perhaps be cleared up by a second viewing. This is most definitely a great picture.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Floored by Outstanding Performances and Edge-of-Your-Seat Plot Lines,"Oh my god.There is literally no better explanation for my reaction as I left the theater. (And I'm not one to throw around the term ""literally."") Not only was I amazed by the portrayals of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), and Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), but the plot of this film completely captivated me. I actually found myself wanting the film to continue on for hours.I have high hopes for this film winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Benicio Del Toro, who was absolutely breathtaking. Also, I would really like for Emily Blunt to win the Oscar for Best Actress, although I know that is not as likely with films such as Carol, Freeheld, and Joy coming out - all with extremely talented actresses as their leads.The first scene in this film, without giving anything away, was probably the most intense and well-shot scene I have ever had the pleasure to watch - and yet, it is not the most intense or best scene in the movie. During every moment I was waiting for something to happen, whether it be good or bad. One thing I especially loved about this film is that it is so realistic in its portrayal of the violence that takes place on the Mexican border; it isn't overly graphic or gory, but it does seem frighteningly blunt. (No pun intended :P)Along with having magnificent performances and an intriguing plot, this film also has a very important message that many US citizens would benefit from knowing. The issues with the drug war on the Mexican border are very real, and this movie does a very good job of bringing those problems to light. Before I saw this film, I had almost no knowledge on this subject, but now I feel well aware.I would highly recommend this film for anyone who is allowed to see R-Rated movies (I myself am only 13, so my parents barely let me watch it...) because even if you are not a huge fan of thrillers or suspense, I believe this film may be so phenomenal that you would change your whole perception of what it takes to make a solid, impressive movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Hit.........man!,"I was looking forward to this film. When I first saw the unusual title leap out at me, I knew that curiosity would get the better of my inquisitive mind. A brief research into 'Sicario' revealed the true meaning of the word, a smile grew across my face and the date of its release would be forever etched into my brain. In Mexico 'Sicario' is the name given to a hit-man but the true origins of the word go back two thousand years when the Roman's occupied Israel. Sicario was a term given to the hunters that tracked down Roman soldiers as their prey, and with this knowledge my excitement was only fueled at the anticipation of what this film would have install.I was not disappointed, as from the very first scene, the violent world of drug cartels, FBI agents, death and destruction graced the screen leaving my eyes hooked onto the thrilling story that was unraveling before my eyes. Denis Villeneuve has reintroduced me to a genre that always grabs my attention and he has done it in a way that gives the audience an authentic depiction of life where drug cartels are the only reality for many people living in the border communities of Mexico. As the film simmers through the early scenes, building up tension, you begin to realise that nobody is who they say they are and not everything is what it seems to be. For those that remember Steven Soderberg's 'Traffic', this is very much in the same mould, but, whereas 'Traffic' looked at the drug trade on a larger scale, this story is much more personal when dealing with the narrative and its characters.The audience is immediately thrust into an FBI operation lead by the tough but idealistic Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). After a brief but intense shootout, the agents realise that they have stumbled upon something much larger than they can handle. With the grim discovery still burning through her veins, Kate is introduced to Matt (Josh Brolin), a man that seems to work by a code that she does not fully understand. On the promise that real justice will be done Kate agrees to join Matt in a Task Force that sees them cross the border into Mexico. Accompanying them is a mysterious character going by the name of Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who says very little about his involvement but delivers big when needed to. Kate's suspicions grow as the Task Force goes deeper into dangerous territory but she finds herself compelled to find out the truth even if it costs her life.Villeneuve has recruited the very best talent to drive Taylor Sheridan's story with Emily Blunt holding her own in a world full of men that believe her presence is not in the best interests of the operation. She gives the story the opposition it needs. Her idealistic, righteous stance provides outstanding drama against the secretive and questionable constitution that Matt lives by. Josh Brolin adds the grit that the film strives for but Del Toro's performance is what gives the movie its thrilling underworld edge. He won the Oscar for his role in 'Traffic' and could get a nomination here as we watch the focus of the story move towards his characters clouded background. We are also treated to a memorably eerie score that compliments the essence of the film, keeping the audience suspended on the edge of their seats, knowing that something brilliant is about to happen.I want to give 'Sicario' full marks but I was left a little deflated by its conclusion as if it didn't really have a purpose but perhaps this is what Villeneuve is trying to bring out in his film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not my cup of tea though it's a unique one.,"Sicario is no doubt a very well made film with a director with a vision and imagination as he is always. The music written for the film along with the cinematography must be taught to those who want to make a good movie. The action scenes were done brilliantly by Villeneuve and made me in the middle of the action as If I were there along with the camera movement and it's live shooting with the direct gun shooting. However, despite the great performances , the movie lacked a powerful story and protagonist, by power I mean a solid story with more action scenes and not stretching in the drama and plot scenes that caused me some boring. Also Emily's character despite being the protagonist was completely restricted to it's fear , Ignorance of what's happening and being shocked. Even the movie's end didn't depend on her but gave her a scene in the end which was completely pointless for me and through her vision I couldn't feel the whole film as It suppose to be and it's pointless to have her neglected like that. I can tell that It's one of the weakest protagonist I have ever scene despite being a good character. Villeneuve's work and scenes are distinctive in the film , but the drama scenes that most of the film depended on it with a few action scenes wasn't that good. I say that I can be satisfied with cinematography , the music , the 3 or 4 action scenes including the beginning and ending and not satisfied about the rest even the screenplay that had good lines. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Where The Weak Have No Place,"Addressing an issue significantly disturbing and heavy, Sicario brings up the sad reality of the fear and terror brought by the drug war between the cartels and governments in the borders of U.S. and Mexico. This movie makes you realize that this subject is not just black and white but has much more layers to its cause and happenings. In this fight for the control, there is no good guys, but a constant contest of who's in the command, and as always, the most affected are those who have nothing to do with the situation.Sicario has some very repulsive scenes, they give a glimpse of the horrors that cartels are able to do in the places where they run. The partnership between Denis Villeneuve, director, and Roger Deakins, cinematographer, built a well-crafted film. As a result, the movie has a coherent and compelling story combined with some distinguished shots, such as aerial takes or outdoor scenes. The weight pressure in Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer, is always noticeable as she's the one who is the most unfamiliar to what is done in these trenches of the conflict. The tense soundtrack cooperates to immerse the public in this picture since the tension only grows as the film progresses. Kate Macer is a FBI Agent who has a strict mentality in following the rules to do her job and is caught up in a situation where the rules are put aside in order to achieve the objectives. Emily Blunt's performance is incredible, her performance made the character very interesting and believable, as she's in a place where she might not belong. Josh Brolin plays Matt Graver, a government agent in charge of a task force that aims to break the cartel from its core, he passes the idea of being an arrogant and presumptuous guy, but he's willing to do anything to reach his objective. Alejandro, Benicio Del Toro's character is the most intriguing much due to the mystery around the character seeing that his goals or who he respond for his acts remains a secret.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Dark, visceral stuff","Denis Villeneuve's previous films, 2010's Incendies and 2013's double-whammy of Prisoners and Enemy, delved into the darkness of the human psyche at its most primal level. Sicario, penned by actor- turned-writer Andrew Sheridan, continues the trend. While its setting demands something all the more high-octane to what we are used to from the Canadian director, Villeneuve makes sure to keep his primary focus on his lead trio, all who are suffering psychologically in some way from the extreme violence they witness on a regular basis. But Sicario delivers on the set-pieces too, sculpting a steady stream of intense set-pieces handled delicately and with a refreshing coherence.During a SWAT raid of a house believed to be hiding wanted kidnappers, strong-willed agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and her idealistic partner Reggie (Black Mirror's Daniel Kaluuya) make a gruesome discovery. Although the raid is a success, it doesn't come without casualties, and soon enough Kate and Reggie find themselves sitting outside an office where high-ranking officers from a variety of agencies are in deep discussion. Flip-flop wearing CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) wants Kate along with him as he and his team head out to Juarez, Mexico, to find the men truly responsible for the carnage and bring down cartel boss Manuel Diaz (Bernardo P. Saracino), with the hope that it will lead to an illusive drug lord.Just why Kate has been asked to tag along for the ride isn't made clear until near the very end, but Kate's stubbornness and natural curiosity means that she is determined to see it out, regardless of the questionable methods employed by Matt and another mysterious figure, the shadowy Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Sicario asks questions of whether bending the rules or using brutality can be justified when faced with an enemy willing to do anything to live another day. When the team first roll into the war-zone of Suarez, mutilated corpses dangle from a bridge to serve as a warning to anyone entering. How can you truly stay within the law when faced with an opponent so devoid of humanity? The psychological weight of these questions press down on Kate as the film progresses.The film often paces briskly from one set-piece to another, without forgetting to amp up the tension beforehand. A stand-out scene takes place on the Bridge of the Americas as the team are transporting one of Diaz's top men back to the United States. Caught in a traffic jam, they immediately sense danger as vehicles stocked with tattooed men slowly pull up nearby. It's a nerve-jangling moment, one of many in the film, and the action is dealt with clinically, not allowing any of the characters to be forgotten or blurred within the frenzy. Towering above everybody else is Del Toro as the mysterious Alejandro, a man Kate cannot truly unravel. His background and ultimate purpose is left in the dark for the most part of the film, but it soon becomes clear that this is in fact his story. This is dark, visceral stuff, bolstered by an outstanding cast and an intriguing tale to tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Such an overwhelming film experience,"Sicario Directed by Denis Villeneuve contains such a compelling story along side incredible performances. This film takes you on a journey from the perspective of Emily Blunt's character. You think and feel as she would during some of the most uneasy situations I've experienced in a film. For the entire runtime, I felt consistently torn between characters I could trust and those who where manipulators. This is a film which plays with your emotions, and leaves you feeling on edge consistently. When the credits rolled I honestly felt dirty, due to the gritty visuals and blurring of morals. This tone was all successfully achieved from Denis' amazing direction combined with Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. The beautiful natural shots with no artificial lighting, captures the most realistic darkness I've seen in film. Also Emily Blunt's performance was phenomenal. Her exhaustion, confusion, frustration and intense trauma was portrayed with such realism, that I genuinely forgot she was acting. Sicario was such an overwhelming film experience, containing such incredible filmmaking. So therefore I give It a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrific acting and a brutal story make this a haunting film.,"I've never really thought greatly of Emily Blunt until I saw this film. I've seen a few of her other films, Edge of Tomorrow for instance. And whilst she's definitely been good. I've never been captivated by her performance. That is until now. Unfortunately her character lacks a little strength that would otherwise make her not only a good FBI agent, but a powerful heroine. In a lot of scenes she's sort of just there. Not really doing much besides complaining. Which is understandable since she has virtually no clue what's happening. At the same time that's part of the fun of this film. We the audience are just like her. We're lost, confused, and quite scared. One 10 second shot, which I'll definitely remember, is when she and the other agents are driving through a slum in Mexico and they see four naked mutilated corpses hanging in plain view under an overpass. This is the kind of world Kate Macy (Emily Blunt) has entered. Its grim, bloody, and no one but the children care for one another. Its a world where I wouldn't want to spend even a second. Filled with gunfire, explosions, drugs, and death. The two strong points of this film are easily Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro's performances. They're exact opposites. Blunt is in deep water, afraid yet still moral. Whereas Del Toro is swimming gracefully through this film, controlling everyone and everything along with the help of his 'friends' who will forever remain in the shade. In short, this is a good film, filled with powerful, shivering scenes and gripping performances. I just wish Emily Blunt had more to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well made, didn't like it","The acting and setting of the movie are done well. The action feels raw and realistic and I have heard many good things about this movie. I didn't like it though.I feel like, as the protagonist vital information is withheld from us for much of the runtime. I guess if you just enjoy the setting and are generally interested in cartels, drug and human trafficking then you might cut the movie some slack and just go with the flow.Personally, I don't in particular find the cartel setting any more or less enticing than anything else. You wouldn't find me favouring a movie because of this topic and as such, I found the artistic choice to be kept in the dark rather tiring. While the protagonist is kept in the dark when it came to the plot, at least in universe she had some background knowledge and also information that was available to her, but not me as the audience. I found the first half therefore pretty confusing, and by the end when things were finally explained, I didn't care anymore.I can see people really loving this movie. I happen to love Memento where the point is that we are as confused as the protagonist is, but here it somehow just didn't click.

Welcome to Juarez,"There is no hope.Sicario comes to us from Denis Villeneuve and stars Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio del Toro. In Sicario we follow the twists and turns of trying to take down the leader of a cartel, and not all the methods are the most ethical. One thing is for sure. Don't go to Juarez.Denis brings a disgustingly beautiful world to our eyes, and even after seeing it, it's something I wouldn't like to know about. That isn't anything to do with the films quality, but with how messed up this world is. It's so dark and twisted and hopeless, but that's probably how it is in reality.The films strengths are vast, and the storytelling was the biggest highlight. We are following Emily Blunt's character, and she doesn't really know what the plan of her superiors are most of the time, but we know as little as she does. It works brilliantly because it limits pointless exposition and gives us credit as viewers. This isn't a story, it is just a viewing of events taking place. I NEED to mention the cinematography too. It was phenomenal from great Roger Deakins. At this point, Sicario is THE winner of the best cinematography Oscar.Minor Spoiler Below:My only real complaint about this film is that Emily Blunt isn't nearly as important to the story as she appears to be. I won't get into it any more than that..Verdict:A brilliantly crafted film with a tense story and breathtaking visuals. Other than a few character shortcomings and an overwhelmingly brutal world, the film was one of the best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The shocks along the way they expose you to keep you interested. The breach of what appears to be right or wrong. If you are not able to handle graphic violence this film is not for you. I dunno about Ms Blunt and her constant plunge into action flicks. I guess it is believable and I bought it for this film.

Sicario Film Review,"Sicario, a 2015 crime thriller, offers a promise of suspense that unfortunately falls flat. Its slow-paced narrative and lack of character development leave the viewer feeling disengaged.The film's music hints at a dramatic undercurrent, but the plot meanders aimlessly. The main characters, particularly Emily Blunt's FBI agent, feel one-dimensional, making it difficult to invest in their struggles. Despite the potential for a thought-provoking exploration of corruption and violence, Sicario fails to deliver a satisfying experience.One particularly jarring scene involves the seasoned FBI agent's sudden panic after realizing her involvement with a corrupt officer. It's a surprising lack of composure from a character of her experience. Ironically, the most compelling moments come from the peripheral characters: a young boy playing football and his father, who exhibit more depth than the leads.As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that the protagonist is little more than a pawn in a larger game. She's constantly manipulated by the male characters, reduced to tears and confusion. This lack of agency is particularly disappointing given Blunt's previous performances.Del Toro's character, while more compelling, falls into predictable revenge tropes. His performance is commendable, but it's overshadowed by the film's overall shortcomings. The story feels like a male power fantasy, wasting Blunt's talents.The film's pacing is sluggish, with a few well-executed action sequences that are ultimately overwhelmed by the monotonous narrative. The attempt to create a slow-burning tension falls short, leaving the viewer feeling bored and unfulfilled.Ultimately, Sicario fails to captivate. The plot is forgettable, the characters are underdeveloped, and the message is shallow. The film's ending, with civilians carrying on their lives amidst gunfire, feels like a cliché attempt to evoke sympathy. In the end, Sicario is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Denis, Deakins, Blunt, Benicio, Brolin.","And each reigns in their own way. One of the few thrillers in recent memory that does not drag, does not quiver, and firmly pulls the trigger only when needed. Blunt turns out one of the best performances of her eclectic career, with her go-getting, no-nonsense, (and frankly, blunt) character who ends up near-buried under the enmity of the Mexican drug war. Denis Villeneuve does not shy from showing the seemingly sempiternal rough edges of this world, highlighted exquisitely by a tracking shot through the Juárez slums, and a following scene at the border crossing which rivals the tension in the opening of ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""No Country for Old Men""'s coin toss. Deakins produces the best shots of the year, and Del Toro's frightening Alejandro steals the scene on several occasions. Much praise has to be placed on the writer, Taylor Sheridan, as scripting something original that is both taut and question-raising is certainly little seen nowadays. An excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Straight up incredible filmmaking.,"Almost every movie has one element of either its production or story that draws special attention away from everything else. Lord of the Rings' costume design, Jurassic Park's cutting-edge effects, the Sixth Sense's twist, Anton in No Country for Old Men etc.In Sicario, however, nothing stands out, but in the best way. Everything gels together, complimenting every aspect of the film. The characters are complex and rich with personality, the set design is a perfect recreation of the Mexican slums, the dialogue is natural, the cinematography by legend Roger Deakins is spectacular.

Villeneuve at his best,"No director around makes movies as good as Denis Villeneuve, perhaps the most hopeful voice of major cinema around. This is his 4th major movie and one of his best, combining the harsh reality of 2013's Prisoners with an even more devastating world of Juarez, Mexico. The drug war that rages on in that city alone is never ending, and any attempts to stop it or contain it may prove futile. That doesn't keep the US government from trying in this not-so-fictional tale of the sacrifices people make in the name of keeping the peace. There is brilliant scene after brilliant scene combined with a screenplay that makes you care about even the smallest characters (in some ways making the small characters the most tragic of all). The cinematography of Roger Deakins is just the icing on the cake, literally showing off a melting pot of USA/Mexico borders and terrain.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
This stunningly captured thriller is one of 2015's best,"If you've got nails before watching Sicario you certainly won't have after it, for this beautifully lensed and tension riddled Mexican cartel themed thriller is a nail-biting experience of a high order that from its explosive opening through to breathtaking night time finale will have you very much on the edge of your seat even if you don't know exactly what's happening or even care much for our main protagonists.The 4th film on the trot that has quickly established French/Canadian director Denis Villeneuve as one of the inform directors of Hollywood – his previous films where the incredible Incendies (please anyone that has yet to see this film do so now), Enemy and Prisoners – Sicario once more showcases the directors visual sensibilities and skill with creating an intensely crafted narrative and while Sicario may fall short on emotional sensibilities it's very likely it was another part of the reason why Villeneuve has been chosen to helm the soon to be shot Blade Runner sequel.The lack of emotion that runs through Sicario, from its characters through to its cold as ice handling of life and death, is likely a long thought about process that falls hand in hand into the way in which even our central character of Emily Blunt's dedicated and by the book FBI Agent Kate Macer is thrown into a world she knows far less about than she'd ever have thought and how the essence of her mission directives remain clouded by a murky world of politics and dastardly deeds.Viewers feel a sense of being overwhelmed much like Macer herself feels but through this quick-fire and often frenetic journey we get treated to a haunting Johann Johannsson score, some amazing scenery and sequences shot by legendary D.O.P Roger Deakin's (who in any other year not against The Revenant would've finally had his long overdue Oscar) and a Benicio Del Toro performance that can count itself very unlucky to have missed out on some more awards attention. It's a great reminder of Del Toro's talents and the arc of his mysterious character Alejandro is one that elevates the film whenever his on screen.Sicario is easily one of 2015's most accomplished thrillers and an uncompromising look at how the drama playing out daily in Mexico through its illegal activities is steadily finding its way into the land of America whether the nation acknowledges it or not. Cold as ice but on fire in many departments, Sicario is sleek Hollywood movie making and another win for director Denis Villeneuve in what's quickly and assuredly becoming quite the career behind camera.4 interrupted family dinners out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film's pacing is deliberate, building to a crescendo of brutality and despair that leaves a lasting impact.Sicario is a thought-provoking exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

Drawn out American Propiganda,"This movie is the slowest, most painful, piece of American propaganda & drivel that I have come across in recent memory. The characters are weak, inconsistent, and uninteresting. Scenes are intentionally drawn out to artificially build suspense but do nothing more than make you sit through 90 minutes of pointless footage to get at the meat of the story which amounts to a 30 minute short at best. Its attempts to somehow rationalize murder, torture, and vigilantism come off as propaganda for a failed US war on drugs. The only reason it gets more than 1 star from me is one of the later scenes which speaks some sense but has no connection to the rest of the narrative.I am incredibly disappointed in Emily Blunt for her abysmal choice of accepting this role. She makes women seem weak willed, immoral, smoke addicted waifs at the mercy of whatever men want of her. Truly shameful.

This movie shook me in a very real way.,"I went into this movie after watching only 1 trailer. I was prompted to see it by all the reviews people gave it. I noticed that the reviews are very polarized. People were either moved by it or repulsed. I had to see why. From the very first scene, I was drawn in. Having a peripheral involvement in law enforcement myself, I had more than a passing interest in this movie. I was not disappointed!!! Unlike many, I see the necessity of unconventional methods to stem the flow of drugs and to halt the violence created by it. This movie very graphically portrayed the nightmare that is Juarez, Mexico and its effect on the US. The acting of Del Toro, Brolin, Blunt and Kaluuya brought it all home in a very real way but I honestly think the first star of this movie was the cinematography. These images brought home by the type of photography used was pulse pounding and seemed as real as life itself. I was riveted to this movie from scene one not wanting to miss a moment.

Tense and Gritty,"I'm convinced that Denis Villeneuve can't make a bad movie. The man is a genius, and this film is a perfect showcase of his talents. The film is slow and methodical, building tension and dread as it moves towards its disturbing finale. This is perhaps the best drug trafficking movie since ""Traffic"" (2000), which, coincidentally, Benicio Del Toro won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. ""Sicario"" is a ruthless, violent, and grim thriller that is crafted with such skill and precision that it's darn near impossible to look away. Some people I've talked to complain about the pacing of this movie, or the way that the action scenes aren't actiony enough for them. I urge those people to watch this again.

A Great Looking Insulting Disposable Waste of Time,"Bad movies can be subdivided into the truly bad and those with heart, a world-view or something to say. ""Sicario"" sadly is merely bad. Though it certainly looks good with great locations, aerial shots and fine special effects, beneath its visual aesthetics, it is an empty vehicle. The story is the drug war on the US and Mexico border. It involves the interplay between local law enforcement, the Feds and other government entities. Though more details might also be spoilers, I have chosen to pass on illuminating more because the details matter little as the writer and director seemingly believe in nothing? This nihilism curses the film and makes every plot point, character and political statement vapid and disposable. From Mexico's corruption and America's drug use as enabler to this tragedy, everyone and everything are mere props used only to advance story and then willfully thrown away. The actors are skilled with Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin their usual quirky selves but Emily Blunt is used up as story vehicle / protagonist and like the rest of this film's caricatures; discarded once they are no longer of use. As one who loves bad film, there is a certain honor in an awful work where the creator failed but at least believed in something. Sicario was a bad film which frittered away a studio's money and the artistic abilities of actors and a film crew for nothing. The horrible real life tragedy that is the drug war and destruction of the once wonderful city of Juarez were treated as disposable shorthand for film maker's bereft of soul.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the finest movie about the raids on cartel gangs.,"This was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.The story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.The cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.His part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. One of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.8½/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Blunt and del Toro,"In my opinion Emily Blunt´s character is vital to the movie. Anyone who criticizes her being ""fake"" is wrong. She brings the necessary human point of view to the proceedings and is a person you can relate to. Without her this movie would be rather uninteresting.Benicio of course owns the movie. The script, principal photography, direction and score by Johanssen are perfect. My only gripe concerns the lack of ""soul"", which is rather common with technically brilliant movies and directors - say Christopher Nolan and Stanley Kubrick for instance. That is perhaps the only thing that hinders Sicario from entering the club of truly classic crime films like The French Connection and L.A Confidential.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

the borders of the country of law,"If you really need to put genre tags or labels on movies, 'Sicario' would belong to the 'psychological thriller', 'violent drug action', 'Mexican border' categories. While each of these naming would have its dose of justification, 'Sicario' succeeds to be more than these, actually it is one of the more interesting films in a pre-Oscar Awards season that does not make me too enthusiastic.The film directed by the Quebecois Denis Villeneuve starts and develops for a while on the lines of a violent well-made and fast-paced thriller about American drug enforcement agencies fighting a bloody war against the smuggling Mafia on the two sides of the Mexican-American border. As the story advances we realize that there is much more than a war of gangs going on, and the questions that are asked are not only about the number of victims or arrests, or the amount of drugs that is confiscated or makes its way to the 'customers' but about the balance between law and efficiency, the price of human life and the tragedy of families who are collateral victims of the violence.The quality of the film is built of the combination between the sure hand of the director, the music of Jóhann Jóhannsson and the splendid acting of Benicio Del Toro (in a role that fits him as a glove) and Emily Blunt who grows in the viewer eyes from a don-Quixotesque policewoman one can see only in movies to a key character for the whole story and a real person who carries on her shoulder the huge dilemmas of deciding between good and bad, between the rule of law and the need to win the war on crime by any means.If you like any of the genres I listed at the start, you will not be disappointed by this film. If you are not the fan of any you still can enjoy this powerful drama and professionally made film, which exceeds the borders of the genres.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Violent and Thought-provoking work of art,"Sicario is about Kate (Emily Blunt), a rising FBI agent that volunteers for a government task force charged with controlling the US/Mexico drug war. With the shady legality of the escalating actions of this government task force, Kate begins to doubt whether or not she's the right person for this war on drugs. Sicario is violent and thought- provoking, a rare combination that left me entertained but also thinking about the hard questions Sicario is not afraid to ask.Emily Blunt plays Kate and once again proves that she can carry a film. Her character is strong-willed but is pushed to brink with the many morally questionable actions this task force begins to take. Her mental and physical deterioration serves as an emotional anchor for the audience to latch onto while the brutal actions of Sicario unfold.Benicio Del Toro also gives a great performance as Alejandro, a secretive agent to this government task force. His character is damaged, and Del Toro does a great of conveying the darkness Alejandro possesses. Alejandro is also a very unique character and is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Josh Brolin is in this film, but the more and more I see from him, the less I am impressed. Brolin comes across very one-note in terms of his performances, and this is once again the case as he plays the leader of the government task force. He isn't bad but is very forgettable.The border war on drugs is ugly, and violent, and Sicario doesn't hold anything back. This film is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy), and he is one of my favorite directors working today. He again collaborated with 12 time Oscar-nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins for Sicario, and together they capture the brutal nature of the war on drugs without any gimmicks. There's no shaky, hand-held camera capturing the action, and there isn't an overuse of cuts during the intense sequences. The shocking action is seen perfectly clear, which is sharply contrasted to the moral uncertainty of the characters on both the American and Mexican sides.Mexicans are not just the bad guys, and Americans are not just the good guys. Sicario does such a great job of presenting all these characters on both sides and letting the audience decide for themselves who are the real ""bad"" guys. While Sicario makes you question the characters' moral decisions, it also brings up an important questions that comes with the border drug war. Do the ends justify the means? Questions like this kept me contemplating the film's stunning events long after its initial runtime.One gripe I do have with the film is it gets exposition heavy at points, particularly near the end. Sicario tells a great story and I wish the filmmakers would have trusted the audience a little more to understand what was going on rather than spoon-feeding information.Sicario is an adrenaline rush from start to finish, with standout performances from Blunt and Del Torro. This combined with thought- provoking storytelling makes for one of the best films of the year. Keep an eye on the film during award season. So if you were on the fence (pun intended), make the leap and go see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"An excellent examination of the morally foggy ""War on Drugs""","How far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of SICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The violence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one because of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film doesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to mentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort are explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into the heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel. Along for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's one weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately. While she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic conflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated to a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far the most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best moments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares well with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on PRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camera-work nicely complements the slow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally ambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film does extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching effects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying to provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law). I should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson, although a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If I had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top ten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent to be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
