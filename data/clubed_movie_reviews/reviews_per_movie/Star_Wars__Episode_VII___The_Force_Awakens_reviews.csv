Ghost of a Movie. Nothing more than a sociopathic superficial cash grab,"This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres.But after seeing it again, I realised something is off, something is not right about this movie.It's completely hollow with nothing beyond its visualsThe movie is well shot, I'll say that. It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath. The movie is nothing more than a shadow of the previous movies. Everything about it feels rushed. The characters are so aloof and seem almost brain dead. The dialogue is so shallow and paper thin, it's like the writers just gave up. The characters hardly develop or learn anything and Rey's transition to a Jedi is so fast and forced, you can see how how obvious that the writers were too lazy to even bother to give give her a proper arc and story and make her feel like an actual human we can care about. Because that would be too long and boring, wouldn't it... God forbid challenge people's short attention spans... Who even needs real developed characters... Nobody cares about that anymore... Just give them the razzle dazzle crap or whatever???It really is sad just how empty this movie is. The third time I watched it, it actually physically left a bad taste in my mouth, thank god for popcorn...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just doesn't work somehow,"I don't know what it is, but it just seems like the soul of the Star Wars universe is missing. There is an emptiness that was only emphasized by killing off one of the main characters. It was almost like the director knew something was missing, and had to do this dramatic stunt just to make a surprise/shocking ending to add some sort of life to this shallow film.It's an empty shell trying to galvanize itself to something greater. If the next movie somehow (miraculously) pulls all of this together (and possibly brings the deceased character back to life) they might be able to continue the series. Otherwise, it's just another MockingJay imo.The good news is, at least there is a story. Is it important enough to extend the series by three or four more films? It all depends on the next movie. If they blow it in the next film, it's over. In fact, they may actually kill the entire franchise if they pull another ""Force Awakens"". I feel like I've lost interest in the whole franchise after watching this attempt.This may seem a little harsh, but I just watched the film, and I am expressing my first impressions precisely. The new younger characters are okay, but not even close to the caliber of Ford, Hamill, Fisher. Maybe it's a problem with what this generation produces and accepts (like Hunger games et al). Shallow is the best way to describe it. And, second-rate seems to be good enough for some evidently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Recommended for viewing,"In general, I was satisfied with the viewing. The main thing that I liked was how the film was shot. First, the creators as much as possible embodied in it a visual image from old movies. Secondly, there were many actors and favorite characters from the old ""Star Wars"". Thirdly, the film has comical moments that fans of this space saga will certainly appreciate. Well, of course, a lot of shooting both on land and in space.In general, the continuation was possible, as an integral part of previous films. The film is quite dynamic and spectacular. I can not call it the best if compared with the rest of the ""Star Wars"", it can't be called the best.I was pleased with the schedule, and humor added its zest. The only thing that can be attributed to the shortcomings of the film is the absence of a pronounced story line. Of course, the plot is there, but it's some kind of blurry.I recommend watching this movie, but do not expect anything supernatural from him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars fans win again,"I don't need to pathetically hyper analyze it to love it. It was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike the godawful Lord of the Rings films, which are completely unwatchable.I really loved the movie, can't wait to watch it again. I wasn't sure what JJ Abrams would do with the film but he has been unbelievably great for the franchise.It gets really emotional at times and is just an absolute pleasure to watch. It felt like it was 1980 again. It's great to see this franchise resurrected and it was a beautifully natural continuation that delivered in spades! #TYJJ",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best film of the Star Wars saga. By......a.........MILE.,"I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work.Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers.J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. This film deserves every award and acclaim it received. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good, and yet........it is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"All Real Star Wars fans loved it, and clearly so did the average viewer. The inarguable facts (AKA the record-breaking box office) speaks for itself ; )","Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward.Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke.Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen.J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterful weaving of the old and new,"Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away.J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars.The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles.This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film.I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On a path of destruction,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that ""star-wars feel"". Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' ""the cool"". Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything we know and love about Star Wars,"I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed!Abrams is clearly a loyal, highly intelligent fan of the saga, and has done all Star Wars fans a great service. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. It is amazingly written and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date.I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villainPeople certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but it's factually obvious Abrams has completely delivered on all fronts in doing the saga justice!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fantastic, lost for words!","Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42 years old and a massive Star Wars fan. And if there's one reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes that I had when I was a young boy.They did it! They finally managed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. All the bad things from the prequels are gone, all the good parts from the originals are back. It's exciting, funny, spectacular, emotional and everything a Star Wars movie should be.What an achievement from the entire team of director, producers, cast and designers.

Greatest movie of all time,"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY?Let us get started.Number One: This movie is the first one to be in Sphero's ""Watch with me"" features with its BB-8. If you have a BB-8 from Sphero, you get what I mean if you have iPhone 5s or later.Number Two: The music by John Williams is FANTASTIC! I am so mad at the Academy that it did not give John Williams and Oscar for his music!!!!! This movie is his 50th Oscar nomination! WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT GIVE HIM AN Oscar!?!?!?!??!?!Number Three: The old characters finally return. Bad news, is that George Lucas is not there to help make it, so that is a bit a problem that does not matter.Number Four: This movie is similar to Star Wars: A New Hope.Number Five: Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey is GREAT! Even though she is not my favorite person, she really got her talent through and she made the production quicker. I agree with some people that she is fun to watch.Those are the five main reasons why this movie is the greatest movie of all time. May the force be with The Force Awakens.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Monument to Mediocrity,"From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain.I have nothing against diversifying the Star Wars universe, which is why I LOVED Star Wars 1, with its Oriental villains, Jamaican Gungan, Jewish scrap dealer, and more. It was a delight of indulgence which fleshed out characters of charm, making the experience vivid and interesting. But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It's fine that Leah has the force, and it's fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don't soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren's forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey's raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.What didn't I like about the plot? Well, first, aren't we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient ""having to recharge the cannon"" just long enough for the Resistance to ""win the day."" Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke's father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo's father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it's not, it doesn't have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does?But the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.I can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story.","In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it. Grade: A+++++,"The original cast is back and fits in beautifully with the new crew. The CGI are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action.And finally that brings me to the action. it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy.It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitively Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or fans of just incredible filmmaking period!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exactly as I expected.,"I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original. Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it.The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good, as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the pathetic haters, go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Far and way the greatest film of 2015!,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely perfect in everything it sets out to do.,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc).Along with the great use of practical effects, there are fantastically designed costumes all over the joint, with great designs ranging from the new-look storm troopers to Kylo Ren and his super cool outfit.Going back to character, though, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations than he's received for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope, and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action — with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light- hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, who I love – even though some people might think he's a bit of a snotty nosed dork. Kylo Ren is probably just as good a villain as Darth Maul in my opinion at least, but he's used much, much better, fortunately. Ah, yes. The Phantom Menace. Let's all remind ourselves of that excellent part of film history. Good for you and me, though, we can forget about that now, because we have the sequel trilogy, which could even be better than the original if they keep on getting things right like they did with this film.One more thing I'm grateful was done right was the score. A mixture of both classic tracks and new ones, it's fantastic in both providing towards all the drama and the overall feel of the film. Because, by using both old tracks and new ones it reminds you of the past (sparking your nostalgia) whilst also bringing something new, which the film does fantastically with every aspect; from the story to the cast to the sets to the action and to the (you guessed it) score. Other than being a tad ridiculous in some plot turns, and lacking quite the same grandness of scale in sets and cast that the original films did – but only just, mind you; it's pretty much perfect in what it has set out to do; providing excitement, enjoyment, drama, action and nostalgia in abundance. Enough for a boy like me to squeal.Verdict:The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film.So I give it: 94/100.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Real Star Wars fans got the sequel we always wanted. Therefore (as always) I win......you lose X- ),"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie garbage,"Well, where do I start.It's a parody of ANH.

Wooden acting for Rey, overacting for Finn.CGI is terrible for its time, that death star beam, terrible. That tentacle monster, terrible. Practical effects were hyped but barely used in the movie, when there were, CG were rendered on top. Looks crap.Sound, not much originality there. It's called in.It only broke records and box office because of the non stop hype nostalgia train, after people got on they soon realized what a sub par movie this is.Disney won't be so lucky next time.They will not get their $4b investment back.

Absolutely PERFECT.,"Let me just say that this film was sensational!To begin, the storyline is original and captivating. The acting from the newbies (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac) is excellent. The acting from the old heroes was also incredible - Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa, and they are better than ever! The villains are great too (Adam Driver as Kylo Ren) is great! The visuals - especially in IMAX 3D -- quite frankly blew my mind. Nothing looked overly fake like in the prequel trilogy - you really felt like you were part of the movie. The combination of practical and visual effects was brilliant! Another thing about this film, which you typically don't have in Star Wars films (especially the prequels) is humour - and The Force Awakens has plenty and it hits HARD!! And of course, the movie has many emotional moments, yes - I cried at some parts, and the pure nostalgia of it worked beautifully made it so much better! The final shot of the film was not just the best final shot of a Star Wars film - but one of (if not THE) best final shots of any film in cinematic history.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is more than I expected: it has the perfect blend of action, adventure, humour, some hints of romance, and emotion.By far the best film of 2015, the best Star Wars film, and one of the best movies of all time. Thank you JJ, we trusted you, and you delivered! Cannot wait for Episode 8!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Franchise is rescued!,"Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that, for many traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping.From the opening scene you realise that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a incredible treat!It is a return to what worked. The directing is solid as is the dialogue. In fact, it's the best dialogue in all eight films.5*",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Please Disney - don't do this again!!!,"Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.Long before this film arrived I claimed you couldn't do Star Wars over. This Disney remake has proved me right. It leaves me wondering if walking away from Lucas was a good thing to do. It's true he overreached himself with the prequels and botched the whole thing. But they could have done better with a proper director and screenwriter. Lucas had the vision, there's no doubt about that.Back to this film: I'm scratching my head. On the one hand it feels like a total remake of the first film with a few corny exceptions.After the last scene, I had to wonder if maybe there WAS a story sweep coming out of all this rehashed mess. Something original perhaps. That would be nice.That's the reason I advise Disney to never do this again. If they want to utilize Star Wars in their theme parks, well that's fine. Just don't ruin a classic syfy saga to do it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Utter Garbage.,"The single piece of laziest story telling i have ever seen in my life..If this is the new standard for Hollywood, then it's utterly disgusting..The story was pitifully bad...The characters were pointless and shallow..It was a dumb mary sue propaganda video with a few special effects thrown in..Disney and Abrams should be ashamed of themselves...This was a really bad ''any kind'' of movie. Let alone a good star wars movie...I bet the ones that hated on the prequels want to beg Lucas to direct the future movies now...DO NOT SEE THE NEXT MOVIE AT THE CINEMA OR Hollywood WON'T GET THE MESSAGE...ALSO..DO NOT BELIEVE TRAILERS..THEY JUST MAKE YOU THINK THE MOVIE WILL BE GOOD..IT'S CALLED HYPE, AND THE WORLD GOT CONNED BIG TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily the best Star Wars film.....by far.,"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by  far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas  Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl  appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you  with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely  make you wanting for more.  One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force. Disney has steered away from the boring 'push and pull'  concept and found ways you could never imagine the Force can be applied  and used on.  The presence of the old cast was monumental as it helped the old  audience transition to the new heroes  as they have similar (but also  diverse) qualities with their old counterparts. The ending, as  expected, is a major cliff-hanger. Expect to walk out of the cinema  dazed, amazed and confused as the movie, not only, answer the old  questions, but at the same time unfold new mysteries for the audience  to ponder on. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a movie this generation  should really see. I genuinely recommend you see it on IMAX so you may  experience the Force in a way that will leave you lost in thought in  the days to come.

I thought BB-8 was a humorous, cute character and can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming films.JJ Abrams did an amazing job creating easily the best film of the year.Out of all the Star Wars films, this is definitely the second best in the franchise (just BARELY behind The Empire Strikes Back)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Ever since I was 4 years old I've attended star wars openings. And the force awakens was no different. Was it like the old movies? No, of course not. But it was a new take on an ever expanding universe. Everyone on here throwing up 1 or 2 stars are just butthurt. They complain about Disney or JJ Abrams directing it.

"New Title - ""Nostalgia""","I knew going in to this film that it wasn't going to be as good as the first two films. Still, I did have high expectations for this film that unfortunately feel flat. This film seems like the first three films thrown together in a blender. With the all the similarities, I was surprised there were no ewoks in the film. Aside from the plot, I felt like the old characters were given too much screen time. While I do love Harrison Ford (My favorite actor), I feel that a lot of the time he doesn't fit into the plot. His relationship with Leia seems forced. These old characters overshadow the potential of Rey and Finn. I like the two new main characters along with Poe who is great in the film. But, this overshadowing wasn't just during the film. Mark Hamill was SECOND BILLED in the credits and didn't have a SINGLE line! He was more important in Kingsman as Professor Arnold than he was in his signature film series. The one thing that saved this film was the action. It may have been michael bay- esque, but at least it was awesome. Episode IV and V in my opinion are 10/10 movies, but this film just didn't cut it.

Is this the best Star Wars movie ever? Ummmmm Is the sky blue? Exactly.,"I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure after the horrible taste the prequels left us with.I watched the prequels before watching the movie.

George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the ""prequels"".But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning on so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theater. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping the original trilogy - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for two hours.Hope the same writers are involved with Episode 8 and find a way to mention that the prequels were ""some sort of mythology that never happened"", then i'll be a happy, true Star Wars fan!t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TEN!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The acting was pretty bad the guy they picked to play Kaylo was not very sinister looking and his voice was all wrong for this part. I did like the some of the characters BB-8 kinda grew on me as I felt sure from all I read about I might not like care for him.

J.J. Abrams Has Restored Hope to the Star Wars Universe,"I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat.Even now, 24 hours later, I'm still left in awe of what Abrams has done. He has ignited a passion in me that has lied dormant for a decade thanks to the dreadful prequel trilogy. After Episode III I vowed never to see another George Lucas Star Wars film ever again. The prequels were cheesy (and not in a good way) and lacked imagination. They borrowed heavily from the expanded universe (which flies in the face of his original assertion that he had planned out the prequels before Episode IV was even made) and spat in the face of Star Wars fans everywhere. Lucas is now (thankfully) out of the picture and in steps admitted Star Wars fan J.J. Abrams who is quickly establishing himself as this generations Steven Spielberg. Abrams intention was to reignite the franchise and call upon his own boyhood wonderment when seeing the original trilogy for the first time and try to recreate that with the sequel by meshing old and new to weave a new chapter in the saga. What Abrams has done so well here is he's managed to keep the older cast members relevant while also creating new characters who feel like they've always been part of the story. He's been able to expertly bridge the generation gap and bond the older cast members with the new ones to create a cohesive story that is not only enjoyable to watch, but really FEELS like a Star Wars film from the epic battle scenes, music, costumes, sets - every part of the film, even down to the bits and pieces that Rey scavenges oozes STAR WARS and it is fantastic.I won't delve into the plot for fear of spoiling it, but the film obviously revolves around a core of new characters in the Star Wars Universe - Rey, a young scavenger who lives on the desert planet of Jakku, Finn a former Stormtrooper who is desperate to escape the clutches of The First Order, Poe Dameron the top fighter pilot of the Resistance and his trusty droid BB-8, and Kylo Ren, a member of the First Order and a wannabe Sith who acts as the main antagonist of the film. There are other supporting cast including General Hux, a First Order General, Captain Phasma, the leader of the Stormtroopers, Maz Kanata, a pirate and collector of artifacts, and Supreme Leader Snoke who is the leader of the First Order. Several former characters are weaved into the film with Han Solo and Chewbacca seeing the majority of the screen time from that group. The connection between old and new is a constant theme in the film and it is pulled off masterfully. The film is an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end and is a movie that I will always cherish thanks to it's re- ignition of my love for the franchise. There isn't much more that I can say other than if you are even remotely a fan of the Star Wars Universe you owe it to yourself to see this. Even if you are not, there is a lot to keep you entertained here and you never know, it may turn you into a fan of the franchise if you're not careful, regardless quit reading this and go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply Amazing,"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began.Most everyone complains about how annoying the prequels were. I was more wondering how they ever got made with so much blatant bigoted stereotyping. I have a thick skin for that sort of stuff, and I was starting to get offended. On top of very thoroughly documented complaints already raised against those rejects.But this.... This brought back all the wonder, all the excitement of that little 5 year old looking through the back window, so many years ago. This IS the sequel we have been waiting 30 years for. And it was worth the wait.Old school effects mixed with CGI, the classic musical score, a director that knew where to go and why, actors new enough to push their roles, while still experienced enough to successfully play them.

Abrams destroys star wars,"So disappointed. Can only assume that the previous ratings are based on brain washed fans so happy to hear the anthem and see the yellow writing scroll up the screen that they didn't bother to watch what followed. The aforementioned opening was by far the highlight. 30 mins in and I had to nudge myself to stay awake. 60 mins in I would have walked out in disgust if I didn't think I would offend my wife and daughter who had decided to accompany me on my quest to re-capture my youth. The lack of a story was unbelievable. The main villain is a fluffy bunny next to Vader, Maul or Sidious. What rocket scientist decided that Stormtroopers were no longer clones. I'd be easily convinced that Abrams hadn't even watched the original movies, if it wasn't for the shameful way that every scene from Episode IV had been woefully reproduced.

It was comfortable to see Chewie and Hans Solo, like putting on a nice comfortable, well- work jacket.But there are chase scenes, and a bad guy who is eerily similar to Darth Vader, with again the father/son angle thrown in. Fighter jets attack a big bad warship. The computer robot has a special role. Does this all sound familiar? Oh, and at the end you are left hanging, knowing that the franchise will continue. Same old same old.Star Wars 7 was nothing special, except the hype, and seeing Harrison Ford again. Otherwise, I think this bridge to the next generation of SW fans might just be a bridge too far.

Lacks imagination,"Star Wars to me has always been about imagination.There's a lot that has been said about George Lucas in the last forty years, but there's one thing that can't be denied: he had imagination.JJ Abrams however does not and it shows in The Force Awakens. Besides the plot, which isn't original to say the least and has a lot of questionable elements, the visual design is very bland and derivative. The actual look and feel of the film reminds more of JJ's Star Trek films than of the original Star Wars trilogy, although luckily there are only a handful of lens flares to be seen.Even the music sounds uninspired. Which is a shame since the music was always one of the strongest parts of Star Wars.All in all it's an extremely average film, which would have been fine if it wasn't Star Wars. Star Wars is about pushing the limits and the only thing that was pushed here is your hype button.The prequel trilogy was a misstep in a lot of aspects, but at least George tried to innovate and create something new. The Force Awakens however is a big step backwards.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Episode VIII had better be fantastic.,"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A huge commercial success but a disappointment to hardcore star wars fans,When I watched this movie it looked good to me; better than most fiction movies I watched in 2005. I think it's 8.3 IMDb rating is justified but I didn't get why this movie has got so many bad reviews. I think I have never seen any movie which got so many bad reviews on IMDb and still enjoys 8.3 overall rating. This prompted me to watch the earlier star war episodes and I got my answer.This movie doesn't do justice with the original star wars trilogy. It lacks imagination as the plot is a mixture of the events from earlier episodes. And most importantly it failed to live up to spiritual essence of star wars saga. It is a huge commercial success but a disappointment to hardcore star wars fans. I hope the coming episode might be able to rescue this trilogy like the third episode did to some extent.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unoriginal Ideas Repackaged in PC with ""STAR WARS"" Label Attached to Milk the Franchise","There are plenty of YouTubers who have exposed this movie as being a low-quality rip off of many other great movies which won't be mentioned for the sake of avoiding spoilers. This movie is unoriginal and terrible compared to the original Star Wars trilogy. I would even rather watch The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith than this garbage.This movie is just a remake of older movies which were much better, coupled with a nauseating dose of political correctness to appease social justice warriors and their various special interest groups. Political correctness is no substitute for original thinking and new ideas. The media industry just repackaged ideas from other movies which were older and better in political correctness, slapped a ""STAR WARS"" label on the product, and are now hoping to milk the STAR WARS franchise for money while they ride it into the ground.I'd give this 0/10 if that was possible. This movie is a disgrace to the ""STAR WARS"" name.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I had a bad feeling about this,"Star Wars To Do List: 1. Throw lots of money at an already established franchise. 2. Give a director lots of money to ""reboot"" an already established franchise. 3. Throw lots of money at a good writer who couldn't care less at this point, tell him to just tweek the first episode, then throw even more money at him. 4. Get the old beloved characters back and throw lots of money at them so they'll show up. 5. Introduce some new actors to hopefully appeal to younger audiences. Throw lots more money at them. 6. CGI and LOTS OF IT!!! 7. Throw in a bigger, more explosive death star. Blow it up, then rebuild a bigger one to blow up in the next installment. 8. And the profits start rolling in.

The Force Is Strong With This One. {The negative reviews are wrong},"Whoever gave this a negative review clearly lost their minds or just doesn't have much going on upstairs to begin with. This film is exactly what all actual Star Wars fans wanted it to be.Daisy Ridley has a very successful career ahead of her and this film was a great way to kick start that. Oscar Isaac was just the right man for his role and Ford, as usual, was BRILLIANT.JJ did an amazing job in directing this project and the visual effects were as good as they get. If you liked the originals then you're gonna LOVE this.Anything else I can't reveal with giving away something or the other, but I'm gonna bet that if you loved Star Wars than you BETTER watch it or you'll honestly regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beyond Incredible! (Especially Compared To The Laughably Overrated Originals),"My expectations were very, very high for this movie.Starting with the opening scene, a typical Star Wars opening, I wondered how well it was done. I wondered how it would be different and yet new, rebooting some of the old and original without seeming stagnant.JJ delivered on the Star Trek reboot and he absolutely nailed this one as well.He made it his own movie, he engaged original characters by engaging the new and the old. He let the characters tell their own stories without pushing over the boundaries. The story flowed.John Williams does it again. Harrison Ford was spectacular. The newcomers were fun, engaging and ""cheer"" worthy.My only complaint is this: do I really have to wait 2 more years to see the next amazing one directed by Abrams?!Someone pass me the Xanax while I wait, please!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth the wait!!!,"For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken.There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you've been eagerly anticipating this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not.You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - seriously great. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Has to be the worst movie I have ever seen,"When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff.To be honest, I see no difference between this Star Wars movie or any average Michael Bay movie. Plot wise it's about as deep as Transformers.We have got Harisson Fordie back and Carrie Fisher and that weird blonde dude. Carrie used to be smoking in the 80's. I mean, she does look a bit like a farmer from 19th century, but in that slave outfit, even if the movie was bland as hell, I could still enjoy the sight of her cleavage. But now she's 60 and that sight isn't particularly attractive to me anymore.And Ford? He used to be such a man in the 80's. But now he's just an old man, who looks like he should be at a retirement home watching TV with other old people.And the blonde dude is just as annoying as he was. He ain't a Jedi. Just a farm boy.This movie really lacks in every department imaginable. How you suppose for me to enjoy a piece like this when there's nothing beyond the sparkling facade? Where's the emotion? Where's the depth?In my opinion Star Wars has to be one of the worst franchises imaginable and I will never associate myself with any person that belongs to it's fan base.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great,"This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.The characters are likable, the story is similar but with a fresh new take, and it pays homage to the original trilogy by mixing in ideas from the first three movies and combining them into this visual masterpiece.Personally, there is only one problem I have with this movie, the rathar chase.

One of My Favorite Films of ALL TIME,"First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are similar contrasts to it in parts, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything.I went in with high expectations, and I was blown away. It brought back everything I loved about the original movies. It was fantastic. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is amazing, and I'm excited to see her story continue in Episode VIII. I loved all of the characters actually (Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren were especially great). I thought the action scenes were spectacular. Disney really nailed it with this film.I was never a huge Star Wars fan before this film. I love the first films, but the prequel movies were lackluster at best. This film made me interested in this whole universe. I'm so excited to see what's to come. Kylo Ren and Rey have so much potential to be outstanding characters that'll be remembered forever. I'm incredibly excited for what's to come. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I don't like what this film is doing to Star Wars.,"Return of the Jedi had a solid ending and to continue this story you have to do better than (spoiler alert) give us no context in A New Hope Reboot that just happens to say Episode VII The force Awakens.There aren't any planets we haven't seen before. Jakku is Tatooine with war machines that crash landed on it's surface.(Spoiler Alert) A Coruscant TYPE planet get's destroyed along with 5 other planets with the Death Star 3 that takes energy from the sun. It get's blown up in the same way. All of our hero's efforts in the Original Trilogy is undone.The effort of our heroes being undone would be more acceptable if the enemy was completely different from the one in the OT. Another power arising as a threat would have been fine.(Spoiler alert) The point of the Prequels was to show how a war get's started and how power can be brought into the wrong hands by war. The Phantom Menace starts out with everything being fine and by ROTS everything goes downhill.Here everything goes downhill from a time where we are lead to think everything would be fine.If this was a different story I could accept this but it's not. I thought it was better than Attack of the Clones objectively. What get's me is they treated the movie like almost all ideas in the Prequels were terrible so don't have ideas. Don't try to expand the universe. (Sarcasm) It's not like Star Wars has endless potential or anything right? It's just the same thing over and over again.The Prequels made me expect too much I suppose. I mean we got Georges creative mind behind everything. We got PodRacing, Gungans (they're awesome forget about the overused character Jar Jar for a second), A giant war between what seems to be 2 disposable armies but it makes for some amazing footage, seeing what it means when Obi Wan told Luke your eyes can deceive you don't trust them with the saber fights, and the overall result ending with despair but a glimmer of hope.I felt like this film made the Original Trilogy look bad in making it completely irrelevant.Were there mistakes made with the prequels, well, yes but no one properly learned from them. Georges ideas with script doctoring and good execution that's how you do STAR WARS! That is how the Force works!I ""Hope"" Rouge One is stronger with it! They need a film to distract from this last one for a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Critics, Cast, Crew, and Disney executives need to be arrested for ruining film.","I thought after watching the first trailer, this 'thing' was going to be pretty mediocre. Only two days before the release, the critics on Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube gave the 'thing' an A. I thought I had to see this in theaters (I wasn't impressed with the audience's intelligence, and I'll start buying or renting instead.). Mediocre is an understatement. I'd rather have blood in my urine than watch this tripe again. Now I will give a review. ""The Force Awakens"" is a shameless, incoherent mess that does not deserve the word film. ""Battlefield Earth"" was more entertaining than this. I am not exaggerating. It lacks plot, character development, acting, cinematography, and, above all, inspiration. The plot is a dumb rehash of the very first Star Wars film. There is a third Death Star but this time it is a planet that is TEN TIMES BIGGER. Wow. A droid, BB-8, a Disney-fied version of R2- D2, has to bring a map to Luke Skywalker, who has vanished for no apparent reason, instead of blueprints of the new Deathstar, to the Resistance aka Rebels. This is beyond idiotic. Let's talk common sense. If you are going to vanish, are you going to leave breadcrumbs? Of course not unless you were my discrete mathematics professor. All the main characters run into each other by coincidence like I was watching ""Independence Day"" without the fun. This ""Starkiller Base"" is so IDIOTIC; including the name, ha! ""Mega Maid"" from Spaceballs actually is a better Death Star than ""Starkiller"". As the video game generation would say, LOL. This new base sucks energy from the closest sun while draining too, and, not just that, it has the exact same flaw as the other two Death Stars in which an X Wing can fire torpedoes down its shaft causing it to explode. This is unbelievably hilarious. Is this supposed to be a comedy? The characters lack any depth or development. Rey is a MARY SUE. She learns the Force within two minutes without the ""film"" giving any background to why she knows. By the way, she is not that hot! A solid 6/10! Finn, a black Stormtrooper, is a cowardly, idiotic buffoon who chases the white female protagonist trying to get laid. Did I mention he was a janitor?Wow, that is racially sensitive. Poe is wasted. Why include him in the movie. He only has 20 minutes of screen time. Oh yeah, to fill the diversity quota since he is Hispanic. This whole ""film"" was written by left-wing Disney executives. The original cast did not develop over the last 30 years. Han Solo is still a smuggler? WTF! He was a war hero! Leia is an idiot who gets Han killed. Chewbacca is there to sell toys. I saved the villain, Kylo Ren, for last. He is the biggest wimp I have ever seen in film history. He throws temper tantrums, murders a whole village like a mass murdering lunatic (how subtle), and wears a mask for fun. Awful. The acting is uninspired. Harrison Ford looks bored, confused, or embarrassed in almost every scene. I hope he enjoyed that money to fill his greed. The new ""actors"" need to go work at McDonald's especially the guy who plays Kylo Ren. Cinematography does not exist. Most of the locations used in the ""film"" look like golf courses. Jakoo is Tatoonine 2.0. CGI ranges from exceptional to laughable. The worst part is where Rey releases the god awful looking CGI monsters on the freighter ship. The cast and crew lied when they said they would use actual props as much as possible. Really, these people should be arrested. The editing is all over the place. The spaceships are uninspired and belong on Sci-Fi channel movie*. Everything happens in this ""film"" because... ""Whatever, we need to make a movie so we can make a bazillion dollars!"" None of this had a purpose but to make a quick buck. The original cast is way too old. That has already been stressed ENOUGH. John Williams score is so bland and that really breaks my heart. I cannot blame him. He is a gifted genius who at 87 really deserves better at his age. The guy was sick, and the ""movie"" already sucked so oh well. This ""director"" Jar Jar Abrams produces nothing rehash crap so he can make big bucks off of it. What a fuck1ng disgrace. The only saving grace for us all is Darwinism. Let nature eliminate those who are way too stupid including JJ Abrams. This is the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time. People are dumb and it is dragging society down!

But JJ did a fantastic job of making the film fresh and at the same time you knew it was a star wars film.I loved Rey and think that she is better than Anakin in the prequels, and I might even say she is on par if not better than Luke. i hope that the 2 other main movies and the spin off movies are just as good if not better than episode 7.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A cinematic piece of art that gets underrated by a fan-base that's never satisfied,"It's truly sad to see a minority of social rejects hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears.What most people want to know is what separates ""The Force Awakens"" from the prequels and it's actually easy to determine:The characters. There were almost no lovable characters in the prequels, but the new actors in 'Force Awakens' are not only doing a great job, but also conquer a place in your heart faster than you would ever think.Especially Daisy Ridley's performance was outstanding, even more so if you consider that she doesn't have much experience regarding big movie appearances. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are also doing a great job and you just do not get bored of their characters, but of course ... the most brilliant actor besides Daisy Ridley in this movie is definitely Adam Driver. I will not spoil any story details, but I will say this:The Force Awakens is a wonderfully crafted movie with such love for detail that it left me breathless and astounded!

Best Star Wars Yet - which will please both virgins and vets.,"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie?Do exactly what JJ Abrams did here, to a tee.My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ""'they' didn't mess it up"", but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists.

Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.Here Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie.Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.It's decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review(re-upload),"Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away.

Most overrated movie I've seen,"While this movie isn't bad per se, it's about as surface-level as a film can get. It's a cash grab. I hadn't heard a thing about the movie before watching it, so I went into the experience without any bias whatsoever.I don't think this even deserves a lengthy review which explains everything that's wrong with it. All you need to know is this movie isn't an evolution on Star Wars and I think that's what we all somewhat expected in 2016. It's basically a remake that failed.Events just happen in this movie because they do. That's why. There's no significant background or genuine emotion being projected from any of the characters.

"If you think this movie is bad, the Force is With You.","Aside from the Classic Star Wars aesthetic that was very well incorporated in this new installment, there is really not much else to look forward to.Most scenes felt like a repetition of the previous, with an exception to changes in atmosphere. Other than that, the same three- part pattern was there: Characters verbally narrate the ""Why's"" and ""How's"" of the story, nostalgic references or characters are thrown in to help the audience feel as if the story is more intricate or clever than it truly is. Finally, the characters find a way to transport themselves to another planet or place, and the pattern repeats itself over again.In a way, the entire thing felt like an experimental development of the Star Wars Universe. There are numerous settings with a diverse range of characters, but the writing is bland, and most of the acting, except from Rey and Fin is mediocre at most. Numerous wide shots expound on well-thought out atmospheres, but this in no way justifies the lack of narrative depth.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disney and Abrams bring Star Wars back to full glory.,"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?The film takes place 30 years after the events of Return of Jedi. Darth Vader is defeated, and the galaxy is at peace. Until a new threat named Kylo Ren tries to take over the galaxy. He's after a map that could tell us where Luke Skywalker is. Luke has disappeared over the last 30 years and both the First Order and the Resistance and searching for him. The plot is very basic, but definitely does scream Star Wars. Abrams and his other writers did a good job with the plot for the 7th installment in the Star Wars saga, as it continues where we left off, and leaves us wanting more in the end. The plot introduces us to new heroes such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley).Now Abrams brought back some of the old characters we loved in the original Star Wars trilogy. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, and even Chewbacca returns. Now they're introduced later on in the film, but Han and Chewie gets the most screen time. Now the new characters really carry this film. Poe is a Resistance pilot, Finn is a former Stormtrooper trying to change his ways, and Rey is a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who trades pieces of ships for reward. Of course, there's the little orange and white droid known as the BB-8 who plays as the trusty droid. The film focuses more on Rey and Finn the most as they team up with Han and Chewie in the second act of the film. They all serve the plot well, and the young good actors do a good job at portraying the heroes. Replacing Darth Vader is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who joined the Dark Side in a similar fashion as Darth Vader did. Adam Driver does a good job as playing the villainous Kylo Ren as he opposes as a threat to our new heroes in future movies.It's good to see Star Wars back on top. JJ Abrams brings the Star Wars saga back to life. We had to sit through George Lucas' prequel trilogy, but now we have a new trilogy we can enjoy and sit through. The hype was worth the wait, the old characters we all love are back, and the new characters are going to be loved by fans of this franchise. The story is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. It has everything we love about Star Wars, from the opening crawl to the classic John Williams score. I did have some nitpicks here and there. I did felt the second act did drove on for awhile, but that's mild criticism at best. Like Disney did with Marvel, Lucasfilms is in good hands as well, and I'll be looking forward to future Star Wars movies made by Disney. If you haven't check it out already, go check it out immediately. This is one expert if you don't want to miss on the big screen.This gets an easy 10/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Exciting Return to an Amazing Saga,"When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A forceful awakening...,"Watched the movie twice.I really tried to like it and find something at least half great as the advertising campaign behind it.The story might keep you interested although it's a recycled one.Its connections and references to the old movies take the spotlight in front of the narration.Sadly, this movie is not about its story.It's about its characters. Sadly(again), its characters are very weak in their construction.I understand that some of them can have a weak back story,or no back story at all but when you have a movie like this one on your hands though,you need to treat your characters with more respect.And your audience.Some of us are not willing to wait for another movie to find out who are they. No glimpse of their past,their motivation or purpose.Everything the two main characters do is forced out of their nature and context.The only one that is believable is the antagonist. He is the only one that has a clear reason to be in this movie and he seems quite determined to show it. He gets his motivation from Vader, whom he admires and reaches out to. We don't know all of his back story, but we understand that he was not like that from the beginning.You won't get an explanation for the strange light-saber from the trailer though.I'm sure everybody likes the music from Star Wars.I was glad to find out they got the same John Williams to do the soundtrack.In the theater I was disappointed to hear music on 85% of the movie.Excess is a trademark of bad taste.The music is very good, but it was too much for me and it had an unexpected effect.During one battle on a planet, there is no music.The sound design from that sequence might not be that bad, but when you play music from frame one till the end and leave a moment like that not covered by Williams,that moment seems much more weaker and the sound design really poor. I understood why they did it that way.It marks a moment when a character sees the other(at least for a long time), but doing it like this shows that Jar-Jar Abrams is a mediocre film school student director at best. There are more appealing ways to treat a moment like that one.He chose the least creative one and the safest way.Overall the movie is a safe-bet.People will like it although it's not groundbreaking.It's not even going in a slightly different direction.Star Wars has some good moments.I won't take those away from the movie.I enjoyed the action sequences.Fast paced editing, lots of tension and twists.They seem a bit singular in the whole context but they worked.The thing that bugged me were the jokes...the Disney Effect.I did not feel in the mood for small humor in a Star Wars movie.Han Solo made jokes in the old movies,but it was part of his character.Here, everybody has a small moment of cheap humor.Instant turn off.I don't know what I expected from a Star Wars movie directed by Abrams(several of his trademarks are here).I don't like his movies,and I'm sure that whatever I wanted from this movie, I did not get it.Just don't expect to see a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not so much innovative compared to original trilogy,"Alright, I would like to compare it to the original Lucas trilogy. Youngsters might find this movie very entertaining if they have not watched those old good movies. However, the older audience who ever watched the 1977, 1980 & 1983 movies would have much higher expectations.Plot: This move has nothing much to add to the 3 originals. Repeating the same old story. Only few twists, but let's not spoil them here.Special effects: The BB-8 droid is the greatest part in the entire movie. It is deserved to be called the lead character. All other space ships and fighters are getting old and boring. Same old TIE fighters and X-Wings.Cast: Good to see many of the old crew back in the movie.Overall: Fine for wasting some time, hanging out with youngsters to watch the movie together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The force has indeed awakened for Star Wars, and the haters continue to embarrass themselves. XD","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.After the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the prequel or original trilogy fanboys. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend.10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Awakens is an awesome flick.,"I saw some of these moronic reviews on IMDb for this movie from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated it.

If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.1 rating here? Why did this movie gross over $2 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that The Force Awakens it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their moms' home. I have seen the movie twice including IMAX and love it.

The best Star Wars movie ever!!!!,"At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish.What really made me happy to see was that lots of the problems found in previous movies wasn't a problem here. In episode 1 - 3, it bothered me that the special effects had taken over to such a degree, that any story and acting was strangled. This is not the case in TFA. Here the effects are balanced so that, there are enough to blow you away, but tempered so that the story shines through and the actors get to show what they can do. In episode 1-6 we mostly see either under- or overacting. Of course some did a great job. It was a joy to see a movie where the acting was as it should be. In short, JJ Abrams has made the movie Star Wars fans have deserved and waited for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not only that she also kicks the ever- living crap out of Ren with no prior jedi training at all compared to Ren that has experience of both the light and the dark side of the force.Leia Should have gotten way more screen time!Ren he should be renamed Darth Emo.It's a decent movie nice effect but it completely butchers the star wars lore.

"What movie did all the naysayers actually see? Don't listen, it's incredible!","So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more.I'm not sure what those who gave this 1 to 7 stars are thinking, it is FAR better than your average movie. Of course it was going to have throwbacks to the others, heck, it has several of the same characters in starring roles. I also thought the new characters were outstanding, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey.I don't want to give a play-by-play analysis of the movie, just that JJ Abrams is truly a great director, the movie is beautiful, the story is engrossing, sets are amazing, and the overall pace and feel of the movie is top notch! Does the movie feel familiar....well yes of course it does, because IT IS a Star Wars movie, and yes, it has some similar scenes to the other movies. That is a GOOD thing, and they are very well done, and the humor is very well done, but not overly done or corny.Again, the movie is a wonderful blend of everything good about Star Wars. I've noticed over the last 20-30 years, especially in the last 10, there is a percentage of the USA population that is so cynical and negative about EVERYTHING! Those people will never be happy, I see it all the time in movie reviews that are so ridiculously over hyper-critical, I see it life everyday.

"Anybody seen Southpark's ""Indiana Jones being raped""","I managed to fall asleep two times at the end of the movie. Today's art of movies is based on ""some guy behind the computer and CGI software"". Crews of many people who had jobs for making good movies are long gone. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a cartoon. Effects from 1977 are much better and realistic from these in 2000's - because people were making those effects, not some nerd behind the keyboard and a crappy software. Old crew from the movie is obviously tired from acting, being there just as a stone with a few dialogues. New crew is selectively taken to finish the movie at the beginning - no charm, no energy, nothing at all, starting from their looks, appearance and acting skills. Director of photography, screenplay, director and everything else is given free to a CGI ""mastermind"" as usual. With all the lost of creativity, this movie is ruined like many others were before - Terminator, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Rambo, YOU NAME IT !

They are both on the same level. Needless to say this movie is leaps and bounds beyond the prequels. Great job JJ!It's Funny - Remember watching Jar Jar Binks and wanting to punch a hole in something? There is none of that nonsense in this movie. There are lot's of laughs and it has the same comedic value of the originals.Great Action! Action, and more Action!There are a few twists and a few tears to be shed.

Luke had training for years, Anakin had training for years. Rey had none... she did not need it.The message is if you are an independent girl you can defeat a whoever you want even without practice, just believe it.Looks like Disney and Abrams want to sell toys to girls also in order to make more money and to do that they have to twist star wars agenda to the extreme.

An exhilarating continuation of the Star Wars saga and an homage to what made it special in the first place.,"If there's any movie you should see in theaters, The Force Awakens is it. From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater.The characters are easily relatable from the moment they're shown. Their stories are simple and to the point, allowing the audience to follow them in their journey every step of the way. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, and not the dopey kind either. It's clever and self-referential humor that suits the characters and their motivations while also being damn funny in context.It's hard to put this into words because if you're a fan, you're well aware that watching Star Wars is an experience. There's a rush of being back in the universe and seeing some of your favorite characters again. The threats are even bigger this time around. The First Order is what the Empire has become, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren. At first glance Kylo might seem like a second-rate Vader, but he has much more depth than that. Things are revealed in the movie that piece everything together, and when all is said and done, Kylo Ren is not only a great villain but a great character - charismatic but insecure, arrogant but unexperienced. You can empathize with him at times, but it's obvious there's great darkness within him, and not only because of his haunting mask. The heroes Rey and Finn are immediately likable and easy to root for, and when they start uncovering the bigger picture behind the First Order's sinister plot, they behave exactly as you'd expect them to. Not pompous or valiant but hesitant and curious, at least until their lives are on the line and the only way for them to survive is to band together. Then their inner heroism comes to light.Everything about The Force Awakens is phenomenal - the acting, directing, and writing are all on point, and it serves as a wonderful template for this new Star Wars era. I don't need to spoil anything because the fact is, if you loved the original trilogy you're going to love this. Hell, if you're a fan of good cinema you should love this. Episode VII is what Star Wars fans have been yearning for, and when all is said and done, I couldn't ask for anything more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars!,"This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying ""it's a remake"", or a ""rip-off"". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back.Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie.The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever.In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Last night, my wife attended a performance of the Santa Barbara Symphony where they ended with music from the original Star Wars (what my kids know as Episode 4). The conductor congratulated the musicians from that orchestra who made the music for this film! It was about half the orchestra that had been in the orchestra for the latest Star Wars movie!The music was entirely acoustic! That is to say, all the instruments of the orchestra were non- electronic instruments played by real people. You have to admit the music is fantastic. The conductor of the Santa Barbara Symphony pointed out that these were some of the most heard musicians on stage. Full disclosure: I am a professional musician myself with a degree from one of the great music schools (I play the pipe organ).While I was not impressed by the plot nor the visual effects, the music makes this film worthwhile.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Should have been left asleep for Arndt to finish the sricpt,"Hypocritical marketing and lazy writing took the magic from Star Wars.I'm not disappointed with this movie, I just move on.

But as they don't give a s---,I'm now ""forced"" to do the same.Funny thing is, I convinced my 10 year younger girlfriend to watch the midnight screening for this, because I had hoped after reading Disney is going to take this seriously, even with a whole story-group overlooking the new movies, where there are more women involved would be really interesting. Turns out some old guys like Ridley Scott, George Miller, a middle aged Tarantino and even George Lucas himself to some extent in his OT, are far more capable when it comes to write strong believable female characters.After Mad Max Fury Road we talked the whole night about that movie until we had sexual intercourse, after the Force awakens we proceeded right to the juicy bit, without much talk. I'm one of those guys who likes both intercourse and conversation, figure yourself which movie my girlfriend was really in awe with and in which she was bored to sleep.I loved JJ Abrams Star Trek for what it is, I can have fun with such stuff, if it's done right. But, well... He made such a fool of himself here, it's kinda funny really, because of the marketing, NOT because of the movie. Movie was average, nothing to talk about really, but because of the insulting marketing. Movie target group could be considered uneducated teenagers with a lot of money, the marketing not so. Should be remembered.The ""professional"" critics *cough* must not be forgotten. I imagine a hard life to be chained to whatever you think you're chained to.I'm so proud about my girlfriend now, even more than before, that I really have to thank Disney and JJ for this. As intended? Hehe, I don't think so. What does a Kiri Hart or Kathleen Kennedy see in their mirrors now? Well probably dollars or something, I guess.To all those,"" IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS!!1"" 10 stars reviews. You should watch some adds featuring Star Wars, they feel like Star Wars.

Belongs on Disney XD after Power Rangers,"THE FIRST MOVIE THAT I DEMANDED MY MONEY BACK--AND I GOT IT!There are 10 million things wrong with this movie. They totally Disney-fied it--TFA belongs on Disney XD after Power Rangers, not on the silver screen. The entire internet is now nothing but spam bots and sell-outs praising an Episode 4 raping better titled as ""A New Hype"".This will go down as the worst Stars Wars until 8 and 9 come out. I remember when TPM came out people were crying--literally full-on tear-streaming--and that had Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Darth Maul. This movie stars random unknowns confused about whether they are on stage doing a play (white girl, Ridley) or a Nickelodeon comedy-skit (black guy, Boyega).Spoiler Free Breakdown on the Suck-age:1 - No cool villains at all: only STUPID INCOMPETENT Disney villains.2 - No heroes: only ultra lucky/randomly successful Disney bumblers.3 - No story from Ep 6: it's like Vader/Luke/Han retired of old age after Ep 5 and The Emperor is just still around but he got senile and really stupid-looking.4 - No writing: Everything randomly happens and appears. The characters even have jokes about it.5 - No more Sci-Fi: Nothing makes even George-Lucas sense. Pointless machines (one the size of a planet), no advancement in technology. No A-wings, B-wings, Y-wings, freighters, command ships, or cool looking shuttles. If anything they went backwards from Ep 5, not forward 30 years from Ep 6.6 - Original trio never on screen together: Not even 1 second or a worthy flashback. No one even knows them as a trio. It's like Episodes 4-6 were just a completely dried-out/stale inside joke between granny Leia and Han.7 - The Force doesn't make any sense: Doesn't work like any of the other movies. Apparently it now just randomly makes you win or lose--nothing to train or study. Sometimes you have it, other times you don't.8 - Lots of poor CGI: THEY LIED.9 - The worst lightsabre battles of the series: Prepare for blurry/eye-hurting jump-cuts slapped together.10 - Stormtroopers aren't elite--in fact they aren't even soldiers anymore: Many of them now spend their time doing random chores you thought the Navy peons or a captured slave or droid would do.It was so bad it would have been better if Lucas remade Howard the Duck starring Jar Jar--literally. I came out of the theatre wishing the movie had starred/dir. by Kevin Smith and was called The Revenge of Cockknocker.Cockknocker is levels cooler than everything in this movie put together--and I hate Kevin Smith and that movie (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).At this point, only a full retcon like Wolverine: Origins (an ironically vastly-superior movie compared to this Jar Jar Abrams turd) can resurrect the franchise.Star Wars is DEAD.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"Loved it! Can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morningThe new characters are engaging, funny, and human, something I now see that was lacking from the prequelsI'm old enough to remember seeing A New Hope at the cinema when it was first released, I came of the cinema last night with the same sense of excitement.Glad to see that its dong well, and there will be lots more to come I see sadly there are a few folks on this list trolling the film, you guys need to let go of your hate, life is short, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, let go of your cynicism, and simply enjoy yourself, because if you let this film take you in, its simply stunning.....exciting and emotional...pure good old fashioned escapism...isn't that what it's all about?Well done JJ",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Movie I have ever seen!,"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh.,"A fun time at the theatre but not much else. I liked the additions, and how the Force worked, but it was kind of a mess. Weird pacing, hyperactive editing, and plot points straight out copied from A New Hope. Rey was okay, she was overacting at times and her performance felt a bit too artificial, in fact the whole movie felt artificial. The directing was just, too much! Too much intensity, overly polished and produced, out of place crooked camera angles and slow zooms to make everything intense when it's completely unnecessary. Good performances overall, fun action, I was eating my popcorn pretty fast. Well timed fan services and winks to the original trilogy, but when I left the theatre I told myself:""Meh, it was fine."" Better than the prequels obviously, but that is not saying much. They crammed so much in one movie, that the movie itself felt claustrophobic. Kids will LOVE it. I, personally, liked it for what it was, but I was disappointed considering the hype and fantastic reviews. NOT A BAD MOVIE, at all, it's a fairly competent big budget space movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Haters giving this 1 star are just lying. It is far from a bad movie, there was a lot of love and craftsmanship behind this film and it would never deserve a one star.6.5/10 :-)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular film for the old and new generation,"I can't believe it took someone 32 years to make a decent Star Wars movie. Finally, true fan and director J.J. Abrams gave us the film we have desperately been waiting for.The three main new characters were introduced in a great way that we loved them and cared for them in an instant. When any of the original characters showed up, everyone in the theater applauded.Everyone that reprises their role from the original trilogy were perfect, even the new coming leads did a great job.Remember those flashy, coordinated lightsaber duels we got in the previous six Star Wars films? Yeah, forget them cause the fight we got in The Force Awakens was brutal and dirty and excellent.It was everyone's dream to finally see The Millennium Falcon fly again with the use of the new technology of our time. I loved that the film respected the originals by using practical effects instead of special effects all the time (the prequels)Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is a great start to hopefully another trilogy (The Sequels) and even more Star Wars spin- offs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Something, something, something, Dark Side. Something, something, something, complete","It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That's the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who'd already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy's trio.Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of having a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her rescuing BB-8, a droid carrying something important). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for, but not without her faults, as she does make some mistakes (but not enough to hate her for it). She's flawed, but much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart/soul, she conveys a lot with just looks and even proves adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's *likable*, forming instant friendships with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be nitpicky/for petty reasons.Sharing Ridley's responsibility as one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn, a former Stormtrooper who refuses to go along with the rest in doing something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is, in large part, thanks to the actors, but also the dialogue being snappy/quick-witted. They share a fun friendship, becoming quite close, and the actors' enthusiasm/energy helps a lot, as they're truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades.Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to his burned mask). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the over-choreographed prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic tension-filled battle, which is a BIG plus with this movie, as we don't know what's going to happen.Naturally, it's good to see our old favourites back (Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon, all of which received applause at my screening). Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han is his usual charming, funny, ""scruffy-looking nerf-herder"" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the ""cutsie"" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There are genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks. He had the unenviable task of reinvigorating/re-energising the franchise after the prequels nearly killed it and has managed to do so successfully. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouty performance and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke. In most other instances, Abrams ensured that, along with story/character development, locations/miniatures/practical effects/make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. Some familiar musical themes appear on the score, but there are also some new ones which I appreciated were more restrained and not so 'in-your-face' as certain popular themes introduced in the prequels. There is also an abundance of excellent shots throughout the movie; quite a few are instantly iconic. It would be quite the feat for the following films to match this thrilling/exciting and enjoyable/satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga. If nothing else, at least The Force Awakens easily beats The Phantom Menace in being a great start to a new trilogy of films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Wonderful Return To A Galaxy We Missed Dearly!,"The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.This movie had all the ingredients of success right from the get go. A captivating opening crawl, fresh characters who were well written and well acted, humor for all ages, relatable heroes and villains, nostalgia moments, and an awesome soundtrack by the incomparable John Williams.It was the first time in over 30 years where we had character development in a Star Wars movie that actually made you care about the heroes you were watching.JJ Abrams had a very tough job in his attempt to basically reboot the series and wipe the terrible impression left by the Prequels on even the most loyal fans. Not only did he succeed, but he actually managed to surpass expectations while providing a perfect balance between old and new, taking big risks with the movie's villain and integrating the new cast with the established heroes.You will care about the characters, you will care about the story, and the ending will leave you craving more while answering some of the most burning questions fans were asking, and at the same time, creating new mysteries and questions to explore in the future.We missed THIS Star Wars, it's great to be back!

George Lucas: No no no no no!,"Why did I entitled the review this way? Because if I was George Lucas... this is what I would've said at the premiere of this film. Sad...I am a fan since I was a kid. I used to sneak in the cinemas to see the first 2 episodes over and over again. We used to fight with sticks that in our minds were shiny lightsabers. We grew up and we loved every episode that came out... but this one... It's a disappointment for me.I will have to say that I admire the acting and all the technology that went into it, the cast and crew and that it really hurts me to give it such a rate.I'll spell it in bullet points why and I will do my best to avoid spoilers.So: 1. They timed the episode so they can sync it to the age of the old cast to they can bring them back. Nothing wrong in that. I even liked it. It was really good to see the iconic faces. But what they did to the characters... I'll let you judge.2. I could smell the plot from a mile. Why? Because it wasn't something to keep you guessing all the way.3. The movie was focus on making a huge hype to people break the box office, not on carrying the story and the legendary characters, telling a series of exciting tales.4. Lots of scenes were done just to bring back memories as they were almost cloned from the older episodes... seriously. Watch carefully and you tell me if I'm right.5. I tried to understand who's the main character in this one and honestly they did a great job in confusing me. I did figure it out, but the fog they spread over the story made it so hard to identify who I should follow and relate and even care about.6. The shaking of a particular character made me single him out way before the reveal and his implication into the story... which started pretty slow.7. A lot of the Star Wars characters are missing... and honestly... I was hoping to bring them back at least for some moments... even in a flashback.8. The lightsaber fights are not spectacular at all. It's almost like watching a Medieval show or some Comic Con fans having fulling around.9. Someone is using the lightsaber like (he/she) had 7 lives to learn all that. I remember the tough times Like and the others had to go through to master the weapon and the other Jedi abilities.10. Someone is becoming a Jedi just by thinking is one. Again... I don't want to push spoilers on you, but it's happening. I hope you catch the moment.11. There is another reveal in the film that is totally ordinary. They are trying to build the moment... but it's too short and way too slim because we don't know the story behind the character and we didn't see anything epic happening to it to come to the situation he is in at the moment.12. The ending... no comment. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil it. Slow and way too ""epic"" for what it is. I was expecting something to finish the film to lead you into the other one... because you know that will start producing them on a conveyor belt once Disney put their hands on it.I'll stop here... there's a lot to talk about but I am sure a bunch of YouTUBErs jumped on it already.So... again. Disappointing. And I am disappointed that I am disappointed.

"Big disappointment as big as IMAX screen ""FAKE STAR WARS""","First; Watching this movie in 3D was big mistake. Most of the scenes was originally 2D except few Space scenes. So why to wear uncomfortable 3D glasses for long hours and try to focus on to fast scenes? My eyes still crossed. Shooting of movie was not intended for 3D (near objects unfocused, no real 3D, fast scene switching even at amazing scenes etc.)Second; Expecting something like original series without George Lucas and original scenario team was another mistake. There are serious integrity problems in the scenario.Waste your money and time but don't waste your original Star Wars taste and memories by watching this garbage. I only liked the scenes remind me original series. I can write more but it's too much to list them all and don't want to write any spoilers.

Memories Of The Past Attached To A Wonderful Film,"The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me.

Why this is my favourite Star Wars movie,"I'll start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I remember back to when I was 3 and watching the movies non stop, playing with my Star Wars Lego, action figures, lightsabers and costumes made by my mum and always loving every second of it. I'm a fan of many franchises from Marvel to DC to Doctor Who but the biggest fandom of all has always been Star Wars. I may not have been around when the original movies were released but I am honestly one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world.When I read online that Disney had bought Lucas Film and announced a third trilogy, I was mad excited, constantly wondering what it would be about and laughing at the fact George Lucas said in an old behind the scenes feature, without any hesitation, that there would never be an Episode 7. Ever since September 2012, I have been eagerly awaiting this new installment. incredibly excited at the release of every new trailer and then the moment finally came where I would watch the movie for the first time. I didn't know the plot, I avoided all the spoilers I could and when I saw it, my mind was blown up like a Deathstar. The movie was everything I'd hoped for. Thankfully, nothing was spoiled for me. JJ Abrams who directed the Star Trek films which are some of my top favourites along with the writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark, made a film I loved every second of. It felt great to have Star Wars back again. I had the most fun I've ever had watching a movie before and I'm not just saying that. I've given it a few days to sink in, I've seen it three times and my thoughts are still the same.Although I'm sorry to see on IMDb so many of the common reviews are the negative ones. People are saying this movie is a reboot of A New Hope (even though the original cast is obviously in it) but they also say this because the story is similar. I understand their points but they've blown it way out of proportion. For example, yes there is Star Killer base which is basically another Death Star, yes Kylo Ren is a strong, evil and memorable villain like Darth Vader, yes Rey is from a desert planet like Luke and put there for reasons unknown at the time but I didn't see the First Order take over a Resistance ship and kidnap Poe before he gave information to BB8 who went in an escape pod and was bought by Rey's Uncle Owen to later meet an old jedi who took Rey and BB8 with him on board a smuggler's ship to deliver BB8 to a planet destroyed by Star Killer base to wind up on the base, saving Poe, escaping, losing the Old Jedi to Kylo Ren so Rey can come back on an x-wing to blow up Star Killer base. I didn't see any of that. It's less similar to A New Hope than people say. A New Hope was the seed of the franchise so all films are a root grown from the seed, they all have their similarities. In fact, Star Wars has always been about an unlikely hero destined to become something greater to help the forces of good to stop an evil army. This movie is a new generation of that which is exactly what the fans said they want. So don't be fooled by people who say it's another A New Hope. But then again, you can't argue with the fanboys because one minute the prequels are too different and now The Force Awakens is too similar. Of course you just can't please everyone but don't be fooled into thinking this movie is everything the haters say it is.I'm a die hard fan and I love Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I love the acting from everyone especially the phenomenal Daisy Ridley, I loved all the characters, especially Kylo Ren, the very evil villain you love to hate, who I had bought posters, costumes and toys of months prior to seeing the movie, I loved the story, the humour and the directing. I loved the combination of practical and CGI effects. BB8 is not only believable because he's a practical prop, but he is an adorable character and always fun to watch. It felt like Star Wars and I loved it. I could have only wished to see a little more of Captain Phasma, R2, C3PO, Leia and the new Starkiller base but other than that, I loved this movie and I cannot wait to buy it on BluRay and I cannot wait for Episode VIII coming out in 2017. I am not sugar coating, I loved this movie. I give, without any hesitation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10/10. I do believe this is my favourite Star Wars film of all time so far.

Star Wars: episode whatever; The Force Can't be Arsed.,"*contains a good few spoilers!* I felt an initial thrill when the title screen and music came up, yet, despite some pleasing tense moments when I was on the edge of my seat, the well-worn familiarity made this whole film nothing more than a pleasant sepia amble down memory lane – a rehash of all I fondly remembered from the old days before everything went wrong and became a dry politics show/pantomime with Yoda leaping about in a fashion most unbecoming of a Jedi Warrior of his stature.So anyway, yep, we've seen it all before. The plot was tired and a bit straggly, like Mark Hamil's beard. Luke had apparently buggered off for some reason or other, and the Resistance needed to find him before the First Order did because hey, it's Luke man, and his Jedi Warrior status was the stuff of legend. In the meantime, naturally, they need to blow up a massive weapon that utilises the power of the sun to destroy stuff. How? By employing the cunning machinations of a very handy janitor who happens to know a thing or two about shield generators, they pop in and switch off the pesky shield like it's child's play and do what they do best, go in and bomb the heck outta the thing. Sorted.I found there to be too many plot holes to be satisfying. Why the force was so strong in the scavenger, Rey, for instance and without any training. Her lineage was not explained - if she's not a relative of someone with suitable Jedi leanings, it doesn't fit. The ease in which the Resistance penetrated enemy lines, battled and won was so easy as to feel like a redundant part of the plot.Although it was nice to see a nod to the original cast, they felt tired and redundant and the newbies didn't convince me. The new BB-8 bot reminded me strongly of Sooty the glove puppet (except less memorable) – alas he didn't hold anywhere near the magic of R2D2. General Leia Organa – what to say? Sweet as it was that she came back, her attire and countenance made her look more suited to a middle-class countryside lifestyle of pheasant shooting than of anything approaching being a working General. Kylo Ren as a wannabee Darth Vadar also fell short of being convincing, and he pranced and minced across the stage in a most un-Darth-like, manner. He'd have been stronger without the mask and the voice synthesiser; he has arresting facial features that would have packed more of a punch than the mask, which just made me compare him to Darth and it didn't work; he was like Darth's camp alter ego; a Frank N. Furter from the Rocky Horror Show (I think Adam Driver would make a *great* Frank N. Furter).So whilst I enjoyed it, I would rather have been left with 4,5 & 6 intact in my memory; with the stronger, far more charismatic, original actors playing vibrant, key roles. (Perhaps I do Rey a disservice – but the mythology of Han Solo and Leia is so great that any new actors seeking to take the baton need to be really strong in their own right – and I just didn't feel the force in her – I did quite like the character of Finn however.) Han Solo and Leia served as a misty-eyed nod to the good old days when characters were charismatic and the plots were less threadbare.Newcomers to the scene and younger people will probably love this – but to me it seems to exemplify all the things wrong with Hollywood, tired & creaky old franchises with ridiculous amounts of sequels that leech any remaining fragments of originality and credibility. It's alright, but stripped of the hype; instantly forgettable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Is Here - And It's Welcome To Stay,"The return of Star Wars has been long-awaited, and it's finally here. With so much hype surrounding the film, there was no-doubt some extreme nervousness about the turnout of the film. But put your nerves at ease, because J.J. and his team have delivered very solid, flawed, but exciting Sci-Fi adventure.There are many aspects to consider when critiquing this film: humour, story, performances, characters and technical achievements - which pinpoint the film's highs and lows.There is a surprising amount of humour in Episode VII. Each character, both old and new, appear to have a comic value of some degree. Han Solo and Chewbacca are their usual gimmicky, humorous selves. The charisma of our new little droid, BB-8 also adds to the fun energy of the movie. Some may argue that there is too much humour in this film to take seriously. Personally, I found it only added to the quality of the film, after all, what is Star Wars without humour?J.J. and Lawrence have done a fantastic job writing the movie. The story is refreshing, with plenty of nostalgic moments (and unfortunately some cliché ones too). The premise of The Force Awakens is definitely one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. After the crawl fades, the action begins, and it doesn't let down! We are greeted to all of the new characters in their seemingly inter-connected lives. We get a bit of an insight into their current lifestyles, motivations and even some of their ambitions. The plot is so event-focused that it demands total awareness and perhaps even repeat viewings. In my opinion, I feel there has been a little too much crammed in to this movie at once, however the unfolding events appear to be leading into what will hopefully be a very exciting sequel.Episode VII introduces many new characters, from Finn and Rey to Poe and Kylo Ren. It's so refreshing and exciting to see the new replace the old, as our next chapter in the Star Wars saga begins. Performance wise, all actors portray their characters well. It's honestly nothing spectacular, but it appears each actor is well invested in their character. Although something to note are our new leads, played by John Boyega (Finn) and Daisy Ridley (Rey). Both present us with fairly simple characters, experiencing a sudden turn in their casual lives. This is quite reminiscent of many characters from this film's predecessors. We'll also be looking forwards to Adam Driver in future, who plays the menacing and somewhat awkward character of Kylo Ren.In technical aspects, The Force Awakens holds up very well indeed. It's so beautifully crafted, and it's clear that this movie was made with lots of dedicated and hardworking hands. The visual effects are what you'd expect from J.J. Abrams - they're big, beautiful and seamless. There's a great balance between makeup prosthetics, practical effects and CGI. It's a welcome balance to the new trilogy. Other technicalities, such as cinematography, sound effects, film editing etc. are all pretty much flawless in their execution. However the most exciting technical aspect of the film I found was John Williams' score. Yes, there are a lot of reprising themes from the original trilogy, however there is a notable amount of new content. Perhaps nothing is quite so memorable as the opening credits music, or say the 'Imperial March', however the new themes are quite sweeping - a great addition to the Star Wars universe.Conclusively, I believe J.J. Abrams has got it right. Yes the film is definitely flawed, but he ultimately delivers us what we need - a fun, action packed, intense and humorous entry into the Star Wars universe. I wish I had payed more attention to the previous films so I could fairly rank them against The Force Awakens, however I can definitely agree that this is a very solid piece of entertainment. When watching this movie, go in with an open mind, but stay alert. The premise will have you on edge and the following revelations definitely deserve your attention! This is indeed a force to be reckoned with.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Ignore the negatives, this movie is AMAZING","Only people that ""think"" they are fans are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely incredible and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up.....and he did it!!For those of you bashing any of the story lines.. if you had the slightest idea of what you were talking about you would know George Lucas already had Most of this story written, and J.J. followed most of it. So complaining about the story is silly. You should sit back and enjoy the movie and appreciate you were given the opportunity in time to view it.So stop picking things apart and enjoy this movie, I saw it last night and cannot wait to see it again in a few hours!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disney = 0,"As we know Disney has bought the rights for the all next Star Wars films. The moment was right, the comic book movies are on top of the production and is expected to decline. George Lucas has enough of it. Disney see this as a very good chance to score.I speak here a little bit from my own experience because I worked for 10 years in Germany, the children show ""Die Sendung mit der Maus"". After so much time you got enough from this franchise. And if somebody gets to you with the money, You would not think twice. The same thing is with George Lucas. I do not wanna compare me with him but....The money has to be recovered and it is a huge amount of money. It is an investment of at least of following 12-15 years.Disney simply thought to copy the episode IV and to make a fresh start for the next generations. Sorry but we are old (44 years), yes and got the kid from my own. The story is the same as the episodes IV with the some old and the new characters, and is located some 30 years later in the future.But has anybody ever seen in the last 20 years a really good movie from Disney, not counting animation films???Easy answer. Nobody ! So, what did you expect???This is a simple answer to why the film has failed. Other people have already written in their reviews more about other stuff, so I do not want repeat all of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great continuum to Star Wars saga (No spoilers),"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steps into a big boots and fills them honorably. The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: ""This is what the Star Wars meant to be"".J.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.I watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In a word: Overrated,"If I had to describe Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a single word, it would be overrated. Or, perhaps, plagiarism. Or maybe nostalgia. All three apply pretty well.In the end, SWTFA borrows way too much from the original movie and cuts no new ground at all, including technically. This cannot be said of the original movies, where the first three minutes, consisting of a Star Destroyer chasing down Princess Leia's diplomatic shuttle, set the gold standard for science fiction movies for two decades and still is considered one of the most amazing openings in movie history.I have a lot to say about this movie, but my time is precious and I've decided to limit my critique to bullet points as wasting more time on SWTFA is not something I'm happy to do.* J.J. Abrams is VASTLY overrated as a director. Not as bad as M. Bay or that ilk, but really lacks vision and took no risks what-so-ever with this movie. One upside is that he is a marginally better story teller than Lucas is and does not sacrifice story telling for visuals as much as Lucas does.* Acting is largely wooden and stilted, even from the old veterans. Han is not the Han of old for instance. It is always a mistake to have too many old characters and settings appear in a spin off series such as this.* Way too much borrowed from the original A New Hope. New death star, new rebel alliance, new empire, yadda yadda yadda. Really, there are no new ideas at all in this movie and no risks are taken to advance the story or expand the universe.* Poor casting and poor use of the acting talent. The new Vader, Kylo Ren aka Adam Driver is about as intimidating as a kitten with a ball of yarn. He is supposed to be easily unhinged and loose control, but he comes off as silly. Every scene he was in reminded me of Severus Snape (from the Potter series) or Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves). Captain Phasma is hardly used at all.* Was there background music in this movie? I don't remember any and one of the great things about the originals was the incredible score by John Williams that set the scene transitions and really added dramatic emphasis.* Nothing really special in the special effects. None of the battles are all that spectacular or special. Many of the X-wings and tie-fighters seem to be physics free even in the atmosphere of a planet.* Poor pacing, especially in the middle of the movie. The most compelling story in the movie occurs when Rey is having flashbacks about the past and the Jedi. Expanding on this would have made a far far better movie. They should have also supplied some exposition or, better yet, actually shown the Battle of Jakku. Again, would have been much more compelling.* Splurged for 3D. Really not worth it. There was only one scene where 3D was impressive, and that was simply a stationary Star Destroyer.I'm glad Star Wars is seeing a rebirth, but this movie was a rough start. I'd say worse than the hated prequels. They did leave a direct lead in to the next movie and I hope that the mistakes made in The Force Awakens are examined and learned from to make better movies, but I doubt that will happen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Star Wars, The Force Awakens - Contains spoilers","** Update, I would like to say that I am extremely grateful that I did not spend the money on seeing this movie in a theater. I watched at home on a purchased DVD for about half the cost. And that my friends, is 3 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back. Lawrence Kasden ought to be ashamed of himself for the casting of this movie. Dude, you have done better.Let me start by saying I am NOT a Star Wars fanatic, role player, costume wearing geek. I am 55 years old and stood in line out in front of a theater in Seattle to watch the original episode 1(IV) like millions of other people and with it being the mid to late 70's, the excitement and the technology was unmatched by anything at the time.We all thought it was cool, revolutionary, uncharted territory. It was a space western with good vs bad I'll give you that nevertheless, it was still cool.I agree with a lot of the contributors, that this is more of a reboot than a sequel. This is also, not a movie that could stand on its own.You can definitely feel and see the absence of George Lucas. He belongs there. This is his property and he is the essence and spirit of Star Wars.My opinion on the story, concept was OK but not great. Again it was a rehash of Rey doing the Luke thing from a desert planet. Don't get me wrong, I did think the action was exciting, the weapons were cool, and the new ships were great. But I think that's where my enjoyment of the movie ended.The writers should have their pay chopped up into little pieces. The actors should have questioned the garbage they were told to speak. The casting director should be fired. The producers and directors should be embarrassed. And frankly, those statements are sugar coated.I think the choice of actors for some roles were way off the mark.Kylo Ren - Adam Driver had no resemblance or qualities of his parents whatsoever. The actor himself was totally unconvincing as a conflicting being moving ever further to the dark side. He was a let down.Finn - John Boyega was also not convincing in his role either. He really did not pull off the ""former"" storm trooper who was confused about his place in the universe, just that he ""did the right thing"" and that he needed to run. He definitely needs to return to acting school.Poe Dameron - While Oscar Isaac is adorable, he over acted every scene he was in. As if he was trying way too hard. And finding out, today, that he was the same guy in Ex-Machina?? Wow, uh, there are no words. Ever heard of Stella Adler Academy of acting and Theater? Or any other acting teachers?Lor San Tekka - Sometime during the next 2 or 3 movies, I hope they explain who and what he was. Otherwise it was a HUGE waste of an incredible talent in Max Von Sydow.My overall opinion on this episode is this. If the makers were looking for a comic book style, campy movie that was not to be taken too seriously, they succeeded swimmingly. If they were looking for it to have a more serious effect on the movie goers, it was an epic fail.One really cool standout character that I hope returns for other episodes is Maz Kanata. Lupita, you rocked that role.Daisy Ridley performed well and embodied Rey.Some of the old characters such a Admiral Ackbar were also nice to see again. Chewy, C3PO, and BB8 were pretty good.Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford phoned it in.I sure the hope the next movie is better. It's been a long road following the story since 1977. Don't wreck it for those of us that have been there since the beginning.Let's put it this way. Having been born in 1960, I grew up in a TV watching and movie going household. Saw every Disney movie ever made, and have spent thousands of dollars on others as well. So, as a longtime consumer, I feel that my opinion probably counts.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not as good as the originals, but light years better than the prequels","Another decade has past and J.J. Abrams, resurrector of franchises, has come to take his swing at bringing back a sense of movie magic to Star Wars. Did he succeed? I don't know yet. It's hard to judge such a hyped movie after a first viewing and this one leaves me with mixed, but positive feelings after watching it.I liked the new characters introduced in the movie and their acting was great (especially compared to the returning stars) and this fact leaves me with a lot of hope for the upcoming episodes. The movie also had a real sense of 'fun' to it which is good. Even if it's a dark subject matter at times it's also a fantastical and for many people uplifting story at the core of it. Sometimes I felt it was a bit too much fun but this is one of the things that will probably settle with further viewings.Onto the things I did not like as much. I thought the movie lost some of it's pacing a bit into the story. This might have had something to do with the weight all the intertwined characters and personal developments placed on the movie, I think that was the case at least, but this is also something I think will improve in the upcoming movies.In the end it's the Star Wars we probably needed right now. It's nowhere near the originals, but it's also light years from the prequels, and it sets us off on a journey towards a greater saga in episode eight and nine as well as within the extended universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It beats Empire!!!,"Being a long time fan of the original, prequel, and the EU I came into this movie expecting at movie that was sub par at best compared to the original trilogy but no. This film was far better than I could have anticipated! The almost spine chilling performance of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) is superb and can keep up with the original stars like Harrison ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (General Leia/ Princess Leia). The plot might have been a little sloppy at some moments when plot devices required it but the tension you feel in the movie is so moving. My feelings after the film have caused me to feel a mix of despair and love. Anyone who doesn't cry at least 3 times while watching this movie has no soul at all, that I can guarantee. This movie rocked me so hard that I had to sit at my local theater for 20 minutes afterwards so I could process all that happened and stop my hand from furiously shaking. EU plot points, great story elements, bone chilling acting are all part of your package deal my friends and I will be going back to see it another 3-5 times.

The Force awakens and reminisce the originals,"For many years that you have been aching for a good massage. You have been to Thailand many years back and had an excellent massage by the sea. The masseuse applied strange techniques, and you wondered she knew what she was doing. But as her finger touched your upper back, you cried. You cried with joy. It was a feeling like never before. It was something that you could never forget. And in your trip, you went for massage three times, till each muscle in your body and brain was filled with nostalgia.You tried getting the same feeling again at your local massage parlor. You tried three times, but all you got was disappointment, regret and more craving to visit Thailand again.Now you learned about opening of a new Thai massage parlor in your town. You are strangely excited, though also scared if it will be again a disappointment like the last three times. But you wait. You watch the shop getting setup with anticipation. You read their brochure - with staff from Thailand. Your hopes go up. On the day of opening you go there to have another full body massage.And from the first touch you know it's not like the last three times. It's different. It's like the original massage of the Thailand. It uses same everything. The steps of the massage, the scent of the room, even the masseuse looks the same(and then you remember it's racist to think all Asians looks the same).You tell the masseuse to do you more on the upper back and shoulders, but then you realizes that she doesn't speak English. You tell yourself that it's OK. Your muscles are still touched. Then she goes to your calves and pinch it like squeezing lemon. You remember that you didn't like it first time but it's not something that need to be repeated. But of course, you can't tell your masseuse. You fall into sleep while she's rubbing your head and you ponder about the new Star War movie you just saw.It got rid of all the bad things in the prequels (i.e. writer and director George Lucas) So you don't have bad dialogs, cardboard characters and dull acting. The fight scenes look real and there are people in the movie you care about. It's really good start to a new trilogy (or quadrilogy, depending on the studious decision to split last movie into two) The actors have acted very well an there are character arcs, which make the conflict so much engaging. There are cool fight scenes and some funny dialogs. It's like the director listened to every complain people had from the prequels and tried to fix it this time, which resulted in a really great movie.You wake up from your sleep. The massage is now over. You pay the fee and give some more money as tip. You walk out of the parlor feeling great. And as you walk, it comes to you that this massage was too similar to the massage you had in Thailand. It would have been better if they could have got rid of the calf squeezing thing, it doesn't work every time. Also, there were lot of things that didn't make sense. Why did she twisted your earlobes? There is no tension in earlobes to relieve. It took you only ten seconds to walk from counter to cabin, but when the masseuse went to get oil, it took her ten minutes. Lot more things come to your mind, but then you tell yourself that you enjoyed the massage, all these things doesn't matter. You think about your next trip to the parlor and feel excited.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Unnecessary, boring and juvenile","Did the world really need ANOTHER Star Wars movie? It depends on who you ask. Star Wars junkies don't count as they're a notoriously biased and juvenile bunch and obviously they can't get enough of all things star wars, no matter how bad or unnecessary they may be. To everybody else, like me, the answer is NO.This movie is totally unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars saga. To make matters worse, it's boring, predictable and simply juvenile. There's nothing original, good or memorable about it, other than the star wars label that attracts so much media attention and, therefore, sells so well. Harrison Ford looked jaded, bored and generally unconvincing. Everybody else was mediocre at best. The special effects are good, but if all a movie has going for it are special effects and no substance, then, no matter how ""prestigious"" the title and its history, one can't help but go away empty-handed and express a negative opinion.I've never been a star wars fan but I still went to see the movie with an open mind expecting to see, at least, a decent movie. As the clock ticked, though, I just got more and more bored, frustrated and disappointed. When I left the theater, I felt screwed by the Hollywood propaganda machine and by all the fake positive reviews I've read over the past few days pretty much everywhere. Rest assured this will be the first and last Star Wars movie I've ever paid to see.Do yourself a favor: if you want to see a truly memorable, meaningful movie, check out ""Bridge of Spies"" by Steven Spielberg.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Justifies the hype and awakens the Force that franchise lost in prequel trilogy,"There are very few people who won't admit this is the most anticipated movie of this decade. Taking all those expectations into account reviewing this title is quite a difficult and delicate thing but after seeing this movie on its release day it is impossible to hide all these positive emotions. Every fan will rediscover his inner child and get goosebumps at almost every reference to the galaxy far away.J.J. Abrams is one of the most acclaimed directors of his generation and putting him at the helm of this project was undoubtedly right decision. The way he handles this ultra-heavyweight burden of expectations and historical importance is just jaw-dropping. Throughout 135 minutes of the movie your mind travels through flurry of his impeccably executed ideas. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it still feels fresh despite (expectedly,I must admit) putting so many references to the previous installments. Those references are also the reason I didn't give 10 stars. Sometimes you get the feeling that it is all about refreshing all the stuff from 70s and 80s. Most likely that is the result of big corporation (Disney) standing behind high grossing project as Star Wars really are. But don't worry about that too soon because flaws are easily overshadowed by a decent plot and cinematography at its very highest.Cast consists of both rising stars and franchise veterans. And this combination never fails to amaze because the chemistry between characters is just like in the old days of Star Wars when Harrison Ford and co. were not that famous. Boyega and Ridley give their best and really live for this movie and their ambition about this project is almost palpable. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) may feel like Darth Vader 2.0 but he is somehow more intriguing. Queen Leia and Han Solo are just as good as ever and having them back here is a real joy. Luke,well his story is more of a mystery,that's all I can say.Whatever your attitude towards this one is,if you ever liked any of the six previous parts you should go for this one. Despite sometimes feeling a bit too familiar and serial it is more than welcome arrival in this franchise. Whole crew just put their hearts into this one and created a magnetic atmosphere that really makes this one of the most enjoyable movies of 2010s so far. I wouldn't dare to say it is the best of 2015 but it is definitely up there among the best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The force has awakened!,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bay's Star Wars,"Star Wars TFA is not a bad movie it's just meh. My biggest gripe with this movie is the blatant hypocrisy among movie goers, because this movie has more in common with the recent Transformer movies than Star Wars. It's a long winded awkwardly paced cgi fest with misplaced humor. When people say this ""captures the magic"" I really don't know what they're smoking...we must have saw different movies. One of the other major problems with the movie is that all the characters felt the same (few exceptions) this is due to the overly comedic script where people are constantly quipping back and forth and have an observational joke for literally everything. These forced comedic elements really took me out of the film, just by sheer volume alone. However the film has redeeming qualities like Kylo Ren he's just about the only innovation in it, everything else was been there done that better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars Episode Seven is a Force to be Reckoned With,"The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago.Acting heavy-weights, like Harrison Ford in his return as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, help revitalize the franchise, though their screen time is minimal in contrast with the new faces. Ford offers both a melancholic and nostalgic performance, that lends emotion to his scenes, as a former war hero turned smuggler, while his take charge attitude, and banter with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), remains as entertaining as ever. Max Von Sydow additionally has a cameo role, of significant import, though again, deserved more time on screen.Rey (Daisey Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, who scroungers desperately to survive, while awaiting the return of her lost family. When she encounters a droid, BB-8, she has no idea of the adventure, not to mention the danger, she has inadvertently put herself in. Holding information vital to both the Resistance, the protagonists in the film, and the First Order, the villainous group that has taken over from the Galactic Empire, it seems almost everyone in the galaxy is seeking its retrieval. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Sith with an interestingly poignant past, is one such character who pursues the droid, in the hopes of capturing the information contained within.Driver, most known for his comedic roles, is especially great, being as villainous as he is sentimental, brilliantly demonstrating a man with no control over his emotions. In contrast, fellow villains, including General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), don't appear as frequently, nor receive as much depth, which is unfortunate, considering how interesting their characters are.When Rey encounters Finn (John Boyega), a storm trooper, who despises the violent actions of the First Order, they are forced to make a series of difficult choices, that will lead them on a journey across the universe. Boyega and Ridley are equally terrific in their roles, and are great characters for the audience to follow, demonstrating acts of heroism and courage throughout the film.Furthermore, landscapes across the universe depict planets that have continued on after the war with the Galactic Empire, the remnants of fallen behemoths dotting the horizons. The vehicles and weaponry that are utilized, remind audiences of episodes four thought to six, and the moment the light sabre makes its appearance, I doubt a single person will be able to contain their excitement.The soundtrack is very much reminiscent of the franchise, and legitimizes the experience. The special effects are incredible, from battles in outer space, to fights on the ground, lasers and explosions littering the battlefield of the frequent, and fast paced, action scenes. Though Episodes Seven is basically one action scene after the next, the script provides enough emotional depth and characterization between these scenes, to keep audiences invested. Not only this, humor is well incorporated, the banter between characters, alongside the one-liners, bringing a series of laughs, beside the frenetic explosions.To view the film in 3D offers the viewer significant depth, though moments when characters, props, or the general setting, jump out at the audience, are quite minimal. When this does occur, often it is from the left, or the right of the screen, rather than from the very center, making the effect less impressive. If you were hoping to feel as though you might get hit at any moment by an incoming laser, sadly, that will not transpire here.Though a couple of moments during the plot are predictable, Star Wars Episode Seven is a brilliant return to a franchise that was originally only meant to house six episodes. If this new installment is what we ought to expect from the upcoming films, then the Star Wars universe is looking very bright indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Deep frustration,"Episode IV was seen on an European beach movie theater in 1978, real stars in the sky, fake stars on the screen. It was unbelievable, purely magic. 1981 ""the Empire strikes back"" was released, new creations, especially ""Yoda"" and the new empire spaceships, planet Hoth, the city in the clouds etc... Episode VI was a panting expectation. Released in 1983, many critics saw it as weak. Still, new creations like the Ewoks or the woods vehicles were to see. The saga was almost finished. The galaxy was at peace.Episode 1 to 3 were also an attempt to create, sometimes very clumsy though. A very poor Darth Vader young man, but good Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, new things were also to discover, like Boba Fett father, new space vehicles, undersea world...But what is wrong with Episode VII ? Everything. Nothing is new, no creation at all. You take the best of Episode IV to VI, remixes it with a couple of new characters like the wonderful Rey (she is really good), you add in your salad a new emperor and his new disciple, a pathetic Darth.. what ? Son of Han Solo. Then, a coloured actor who is fully lost (Finn), and a new cute robot. That's it. The technical side is of course perfect. It is indeed.I do not believe George Lucas has appreciated the finality.It is said that we are 30 years after episode VI. What has changed in 30 years ? Nothing, the spaceships are the same (my car brand has evolved in this long time), imperial destroyers, imperial fighters, rebel X-Wings fighters are identical. We add a new so called Jabba, a new Cantina and a new death star on top and the salad is done.Ridiculous at most.What is the target of the makers ? Money of course, they reach the kids and drag the original fans to the movie theaters, like me. From 7 to 77 as Hergé said. Good move, bad movie ! Seven points for the technique.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big Fat MEH.,"Currently this movie is sitting at an 8.4 on IMDb. Even with the ""new movie effect"", that score is pretty ludicrous.When I left the cinema, I said to my wife, ""I wouldn't give this movie anything more than a very generous 7"". Since then some of the post-theatre-euphoria has worn off and the more I actually think about this movie, the lower the score becomes.There are several reasons for this: the plot is derivative, I didn't care about any of the new characters, the characters that I DID care about, I only cared about because I know them from the original series, there were far too many convenient ""coincidences"" in the story and not enough background for any of the major factions (New Order? The Resistance? What happened to the Republic?). I also felt like overall the tone of the film was too comedic (lacked any real sense of drama, seriousness, or anticipation) and that the pacing was much, much too frenetic.Now I find myself wondering if I had never seen the original series-- i.e. if I were a blank slate -- would this film even make sense? I'm not really sure. It certainly doesn't stand up well on its own, and neither does it fit particularly well within the scope of the Star Wars universe.I tried my best to like this movie. I really, really wanted to; but in the end I think there was too much lazy writing on display and too many poor script choices.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Moron Director.,"This moron JJ, managed to single-handedly screw up an entire franchise. I'm not going to theatres for any future Starwars flicks, because of him. I was hugely disappointed. It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie... I really wonder how many episodes of lost this idiot truly worked on, probably just the pilot and that's it... Why he's such a big name in Hollywood is beyond me, absolutely terrible. The way this movie was hyped up, was just ridiculous... 2 billion box office... Highest grossed Star Wars film of all time...

"J.J. brought a balanced, not forced, return to the Star Wars saga","I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it.In The Force Awakens, as with other reboots and sequels of old franchises, it's a challenge to balance the old with the new. The two previous trilogies were both of their time, and different in many ways. This new one will also need to be of its time, and different from the other ones. Story wise, it's obviously more connected to the original trilogy. In addition to this, the structure of the movie itself is very much based on the older trilogy. Much of the movie acts like a parallel to episode IV, while at the same time feeling different enough to not be considered a remake or rehash of the same ideas.As in other sequels, the original cast - now old and weary - is back in this one. Without going into spoilers, I will say that they all did a superb job acting wise, and I liked the way their stories has progressed. What's more interesting, though, is that is the new characters you end up feeling most excited about. It's great to see the old cast, and they are very much involved in the plot, with important parts in regards to action and plot. But still, it's the new characters you come out of the cinema thinking about, and look forward to seeing again. Especially Kylo Ren was interesting. I like how they portrayed the conflict between the light and dark side of the force, it's much more believable than it feels in the other movies (especailly the prequel trilogy).The movie is much more busy than the previous films. I think that's natural in today's cinema environment, and that it works well. Watching it, the story just kept on giving, and there was great, fantastic scenes throughout. I wasn't bored for a second. I can see this disappointing some fans - but as mentioned before, I think that Star Wars movies should be of their time. The special effects were fantastic as well. The practical effects, like costumes and so, worked brilliantly in conjunction with the newer stuff. The few CGI/Mo-cap-characters that had big roles were maybe the weakest point SFX-wise, but they were by no means eyesores.The movie ends in a way that to me was satisfying. It's obviously the first part of a longer story, and there's many more questions to be answered. Some less significant questions I assume will not be answered in the big movies, but rather TV-shows or other media. The big questions will obviously come back in the later movies. Especially regarding the back story of certain new characters, and the whole situation in the galaxy. (On that note: I liked the opening crawl. Informative and to the point. Neiter the crawl nor the rest of the movie is too heavily focused on ""what happened in-between"" VI and VII.) A last note: I've seen people complain (and worry) about too much fan service. As a fan, I am mostly very happy with the choices they made.Take this review with a pinch of salt. I was very much a part of the hype leading up to this movie, and I might have other thoughts after a re-watch or two.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Action overshadows the Star Wars universe story,"Yes, the action and cgi are good. Sadly the movie drowns in it and leaves no room for the Star Wars story. As some other reviewer already pointed out, yes it is a remake of part IV. When part I came out the audience was not happy, they missed something. How is it possible that one can watch part 4 - 6 every year, part 1 - 3 every couple of years and part VII once every 10 years? Same thing with all the other movies like Star Trek: the future begins, the Tranformers trilogy, the latest Avanger movies, when does one get tired of 2 hours only action, action and more action? This movie just does not have the George Lucas touch, it is another mainstream brave Disney family action movie. Part 4 - 6 had some pretty daring scenes, Leila in exciting cloths, this movie everyone is wrapped from head to toe, so damn brave it makes you sick. I conclude to say it's another victim of Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
better on 2nd viewing,"Gave it a 2 after first viewing, but after a 2nd look I've changed my mind. i picked up on things I missed first time which has helped produce a more objective review. jj had to squeeze so much into this film to assist with the development of the next 2. he had to appeal to 2 sets of viewers - traditional fans whilst introducing new fans to the universe, a difficult balance, but think he just about did it. its exciting, it moves at pace and harrison ford and daisy ridley are excellent.I still have some issues with it, for instance i wish we weren't dealing with another death star, but there are also plenty of mysteries yet to unveil.I'm not a star trek fan and I went to see the new star trek films with star trek fans, they were disappointed on first viewing but I loved them. this is the same. go with a child's eyes without the past to colour your judgement and you'll feel better about judging it on its own merits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Force may be awakened, but its still in a daze.","The Force Awakens is fun and action-packed, if derivative, entertainment. It pays several homages to the original trilogy and introduces new characters, most of which are interesting. The story, as many have mentioned, is a rehash of Ep. IV, V, VI, to varying degrees, but I won't be stressing on that in this review since it's been validly stressed upon already. The CGI of course is great, and while it isn't used to add any new landscapes or settings, it does justice to the pre-established worlds of star wars. The background score is competent. I believe the acting has never been a forte of the Star Wars trilogy. Barring, Luke Skywalker there isn't really much in the way of brilliant 'acting' as opposed to mere 'reacting' to various situations and dangers. This is not to say that Darth Vader wasn't a villain of epic proportions, nor does it take away anything from the charismatic hero that was Han Solo, the only point being, that these characters were brought to life by brilliantly engaging story arcs, intelligent dialogue and individual peculiarities; Darth Vader's ominous voice, and Han Solo's rebellious charm. Yet, these have less to do with the more conventional sense of great acting; in the potent expression of emotions and thoughts, as wide as they may be. Heath Ledger's terrific performance in The Dark Knight is universally lauded, just as Jack Nicholson's in The Shining; that is the acting that levels great. And that is why, the acting in TFA does not specifically surprise me, it is only more of the same. The acting is good enough to serve the purpose.I don't think anyone has to be convinced to watch this movie, because all nostalgic fans of old will definitely flock to the theatre to relive their childhoods and younger generations will be attracted to this simply due to the overwhelming hype around the film, so instead of writing a review of why one should or shouldn't watch this film, I'd rather discuss what this film IS. I believe this movie is the bait, by which Disney is sizing up the audience that will stay loyal to it in the sequels sure to come. It adopts the role of passing on the baton, so to speak. Eclipsing the prequels, this movie is the first real visit to Star Wars in over 30 years and hence admittedly, there must be adequate portions of remembrance both in visuals and in sentiment, of what made the first trilogy so great while pleasantly setting up new story arcs and characters. This movie gives us a taste of the breadth of stories and character arcs that are inevitable in the movies to come.SPOILERS SPOILERS- I say this because the movie does not really have any exposition for particulars like- WHAT happened to the happy ending that was 'Return of the Jedi'? HOW and when did the 'First Order' come into existence? WHAT were the circumstances under which Rey was left abandoned on a desert planet? WHAT specifically led to Kylo Ren being seduced by the Dark side? WHY does the map to Luke even exist, if his location was after all supposed to be undisclosed?? WHAT Force after all, has been awakened?WHY did a hibernating R2D2 suddenly spring to life and save the day after years of being inactive? HOW did Rey, while being prisoner at Kylo's ship brainwash a guard to set her free, without the least bit of training? And for that matter, why would Kylo leave a single guard to watch over his most valued prisoner, and also, after she is set free, how is it that the stormtroopers are unable to locate her via cameras aboard the ship? Do they really NOT have any cameras on board despite all the amazing technology they have? HOW is Rey able to battle and defeat a Sith Lord mere hours after learning that she might have the Force within her?It is questions such as these, that are left unanswered, and while it does provide much fodder for the sequels, it leaves the movie itself achingly short of depth and clarity.END OF SPOILERKylo Ren was an intriguing villain upto the point at which he takes off his mask for no real reason. Finn was occasionally funny but not too real. Poe seemed like a great lead character but he was under used. Han Solo was good. Rey, however was the best of the crew in that she seemed to have an interesting backstory while also playing an important role in the progression of the movie itself. The action sequences are reminiscent of the those from the OT, and are well done.All in all, TFA is great nostalgia-fun for hardcore fans and laidback-fun for the rest. If only it brought some closure to even a couple of the questions that it leaves unanswered, it would have benefited gravely. And had it dared to venture new plot lines, of course.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of ""A New Hope"", but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material.

The Force Has Indeed Awoken,"We waited for years, and it's finally here. At 3 o'clock this morning I entered the cinema wide-eyed, full of hope. As was with many people's childhoods, Star Wars was a staple of mine, and to this day the original trilogy still stand as some of my favourite films. J.J. Abrams famously managed to reignite the Star Trek franchise with two fantastic films, so when tasked with doing similar to Star Wars, some people were sceptical, but nonetheless excited. The main questions is: did he deliver? Yes he damn well did!You know that tight throat feeling you get when you have a sudden urge of adrenaline, for the last hour of the film, I had that feeling, sitting there on the edge of my seat, heart pounding fast. What I was watching was exhilarating to say the least.Let's look more at the film (don't worry, there will be no spoilers featured). First off, the opening - the classic text followed by the panning shot to a planet (or death star) with a Star Destroyer emerging into the frame, it all features, as does the use of practical effects and puppets / robots over the extensive use of CGI that was utilised in the prequel trilogy, thus giving fans the old school style of Star Wars they wanted oh so much. The film is fast-paced, with stunning action scenes and spectacles, but not rushed, the shots linger and the camera moves gracefully, giving us a spectacular view of the situation at hand.The prequel trilogy shunted the franchise on a downward spiral, the overuse of CGI and the introduction of some of the most annoying characters in film (a-hem Jar Jar Binks), but Abrams, the finest choice of a director to reignite the franchise, did nothing more than show pure love for the films and has created a sequel that definitely exceeded my expectations. A film that features endless nostalgia with appearances from Ford (who is beyond fantastic), Fisher, Hamill even Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and constant references to the original trilogy.The only partial negative aspect is its somewhat lack of originality, it acts more as an homage to 'A New Hope' than an original tale. But if you overthink points like this when viewing it, you won't enjoy it, so just empty your head of that and watch the film for what it is: a space opera that acts as nothing more than a sheer piece of movie magic!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An Incredible Movie, Far Beyond All Expectations","This movie was fantastic. The new characters we receive are fun and interesting, and we are left to see them fleshed out more as the series continues, which is exciting. The movie is very reminiscent of the Original Trilogy. We have a decent amount of aliens (almost all of which are seen using costumes as opposed to CGI). The plot moves along at a great pace. Nothing is really dragged out, but at the same time it is not so fast that you are left confused. And speaking of confusion, there was none in this movie. It was all very straightforward and everything was very easy to understand. This movie absolutely pays homage to the original from 1977 in many ways, but at the same time I feel that you do not need an in depth knowledge of the previous movies to love this one. A general knowledge of the plot and main characters is all that is needed going into this movie. I will have to see it again to make sure, but at the moment this movie is vying for my favorite Star Wars movie ever with The Empire Strikes Back. But don't take my word for this - go out and experience it for yourself. You will have a delightful time filled with comedy, excitement, action, epic plot reveals, and an overall enjoyable time!EDIT SO I CAN RANT: The people who are giving this one or two stars (for the most part) are being overly critical of this movie. I understand not LOVING this movie, and even perhaps if you felt disappointed because it was not what you were hoping for. But regardless of that, it is impossible not to find SOME aspects you liked. There is comedy, action, and adventure. Even if you feel the movie is a reboot of the original (which to some degrees I may even agree), it was a good movie nonetheless. I have seen some comments dissing the acting, which I strongly disagree on. The acting was great! Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable. John Boyega blew me away, Oscar Isaac was fun, and I absolutely ADORE Daisy Ridley. Harrison Ford was AMAZING as always! He really recaptured Han Solo for this movie. Is this a perfect movie? No, it falls into some traps that all movies fall into. That being said, it is still a fantastic film! Is this a good Star Wars movie? It depends, if you are going into this without considering there will be two more, you will probably be upset and say you won't even bother to see the next two. I feel like this movie spent a lot of time recapturing the originals NOT to BE the originals, but to re-establish those feelings in order to set us up for the bigger picture which will be shown to us through two more movies. Some questions are not answered, but again, we have to wait for the next two to come out before we judge this first one for that. This movie deserves an average/above average rating, and by my personal feelings, I still stand by my 10/10. It DOES NOT deserve the 1, 2, 3 and 4 out of 10 scores I have been seeing. That is just being too judgmental and not open to the continuation of a great series. 5+ ratings, in my opinion, have the best reviews, and really help explain what they did and did not like. This movie has A LOT to offer, and if you go in with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A new story about old stories.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A new story about old stories. The obvious thing is that the new film of the new trilogy looks very nice, even when compared with the films of the 2000s, and especially when compared with the original trilogy. But, the story itself very strongly in some places begins to resemble the ""New Hope"". There are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and others in this film, but in a more different form, which is why history begins to repeat itself accordingly.

"Fantastic movie, excellent on nearly all fronts.","Let's get one thing straight: the plot is derivative. There are tons of parallels to Star Wars: A New Hope, and pretty much the same events are going on.But what I was most surprised about was that I didn't care. I've talked with friends who have also seen it, and our consensus was that that part was obvious, but that none of us care. The reason why is because it was so well executed, and the new stuff brought to the table was probably the best parts of the movie.For starters, let's talk the new characters, because they're the main focus: they're fantastic. Rey was an awesome and inspiring lead. Finn was fearless if not naive and brought so much enthusiasm to the movie throughout. BB-8 was surprisingly absolutely adorable--to give any examples of his behavior would be to spoil some really charming moments. Poe was a pleasant surprise, because the trailers didn't show him off much but he was an absolute joy to watch. Captain Phasma is my only complaint--heavily underutilized in this movie.The big standout for me, however, was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Let it be known: he is NOT Vader 2.0. He doesn't try to be Vader 2.0. To go any further would be to spoil the movie, but trust me, he's one of the most interesting characters to come out of Star Wars in a long time.The old cast returns and is given amazing justice. This isn't them returning right back to their characters--this is them embodying their characters as they are decades later. Harrison Ford in particular was brilliant in his role and mannerisms.Visual effects: Outstanding. For the most part, the movie uses practical effects, and it really shows, because the movie is super engaging throughout its duration. Try to compare some of these scenes to those in any in the Star Wars prequels, and you'll see what I mean. Once again, I can't spoil details. It's funny, because there are only a handful of creatures and moments that use CG effects, and those are the ones that end up sticking out.Writing: Also super well done. A big flaw in the prequels is that everything got mired in unnecessary and redundant details. The most quoted lines from the prequels are most often the ones that are so stupid it's hard not to forget them (the sand monologue, for example). Meanwhile, everyone I've seen can't stop quoting random pieces of dialogue from the new movie that are so well done and so memorable. The dialogue is interesting, feels real, and leaves for some amazing one-liners--super reminiscent of the original trilogy in that way.Story: As I mentioned, yes it's derivative, but that doesn't mean it's not done super well. Plus, the scenes that have no parallels to A New Hope are some of the best in the movie. Much of the final act, for example, is not easily paralleled, and I was kept on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire movie. People here seem to be criticizing the movie for it's ""plot holes"". Most of these aren't even plot holes though! They're so explicitly left as mysteries so they can be answered and expanded upon in the next movie! Which is what's making people super excited for the next movie already!Also, my biggest complaint with J.J. Abrams' other works is how convoluted and roundabout they get. But Star Wars is meant to have much more straightforward stories (also something the prequels with the exception of ROTS were not good at). J.J. Abrams seems to have acknowledged this because this movie definitely feels like Star Wars in its far more straightforward approach. It feels much less confused and mired in details, and always seems to keep the main plot line going.Music: It's John Williams. It's memorable. Especially after seeing the movie a second time. It feels like Star Wars, and it enhances every moment wonderfully.Lightsabers: Okay, so without spoiling anything, I will say that the lightsaber fights in this movie will blow you away. They're big, dangerous, brutal, emotive, natural, and use the environments in super interesting ways. The fights in this movie are some of the best fights I've seen in the series history.Conclusion: Like I said, the plot frame is the same as A New Hope's. In many respects, it is the same. But it feels different than ANH, and yet it still feels like Star Wars. And it is executed so well that it was hard to even care that it followed the same frame. And the best parts of the movie are the new parts. The movie is intended to return to the heart and soul that made Star Wars so great in the first place, and it succeeds at that with flying colors. Engaging dialogue, great one-liners, awesome action sequences, a great character-driven plot, and a general captivation by the galaxy far, far away.Also, keep in mind, I made sure to write this review only after a few days of heavily considering all of the elements of this movie, and after seeing the movie a second time. My opinion hasn't changed. In fact, it got even better (originally I gave this movie a 9).Note, however: Now that the series is re-grounded in excellency, it's up to Rian Johnson to create an Episode VIII that takes the series to completely new places with a brand new plot based on all the brand new things this movie has brought to the table. If it doesn't, then Episode VII will be remembered as the film that spawned a rehashed series. If it does, however, then Episode VII will be remembered as an excellently-executed reintroduction to the series that had been long lost in a ""meh"" prequel trilogy and some very questionable Expanded Universe decisions (with the exception of stories like Thrawn and Revan).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
5 reasons why SW is disappointment,"I had big expectations for this move, partly because of so many positive reviews. Unfortunately it was not a case. And I left puzzled why so many reviews omitted obvious shortcomings of this film.Therefore I offering my emotions free, impartial review, why this film is not such a great deal (unfortunately):1. Completely linear plot. If you expecting to see an unexpected shifts in plot - don't.2. Making old SW clone is bad idea. So many reviews about a ""fuse"" of new and old are embarrassment. This films biggest ""innovations"" are female main character and black trooper. Rest is already experienced old stuff without any innovations. For instance the main battle is almost 100% ""borrowed"" for the old part, so you already know Who, How, and When even before the battle itself.3. No chemistry between actors. Especially visible for Ford and Fisher. In general Ford delivered one of the poorest performance in his carrier.4. Where are the jokes? I agree that film *tries* to produce timely jokes, but there is difference between to try and actually deliver. There was only one joke which was more or less university accepted during my showing.5. Robots are annoying. Really, wholesale beeping is really annoying, likewise another chronically decease of SW - inaccurate and useless ""plastic"" troopers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars roars back to life,"The fate of a foot soldier, an ageing pirate (and his loyal sidekick), a young girl, a star pilot and the leader of an enemy army, all collide and intertwine in this highly anticipated return of the Star Wars series.It was with apprehension that I approached The Force Awakens. Having invested a great deal of expectation and anticipation into the prequels during my formative adult years, I approached TFA with a sense of withdrawal. This stemmed from the fear I have that any amount of hype would eventually just leave me in another state of devastation and possible resignation to the knowledge that our heroes (George Lucas, I'm looking at you) will always remain all too human, a state which I have never quite recovered from. Well TFA has somehow restored my faith in movie-making, and possibly in life itself, from the first moment when the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the second when the ubiquitous blue credits started rolling at the end. For the whole duration I was taken back to my youth, more specifically, the heady days of the early nineties, not to a time when I yearned for adventure and sought mystical powers to defeat my enemies, but to a time when all that I demanded from certain sci-fi adventure movies was that they were as good as Star Wars.TFA is most certainly a movie that can stand quite proudly amongst the original trilogy. J.J Abrams vision shows a director who has a deft eye for the spectacular whilst equally comfortable paying homage to his predecessors. A good clue to this movies retro roots is in the title itself, ""The Force Awakens"", the director J.J Abrams definitely reclaims the power and mysticism of 'the force'. In the prequels ""the force"" became a throwaway trope, everybody had the force in the prequels and it was used so flagrantly that we forgot it's true intangible qualities. In TFA, as the name suggests 'the force' is used sparingly, but to great effect (there was one particular scene where I had to fight the urge to applaud in the cinema). J.J Abrams clearly understands the text that he has be given along with it's wider fandom, and rather than shrink, he has rose to the occasion and brought us something great, spectacular and touching epochal.In terms of story telling, the characters of Rey and Finn carry the lions share of the plot, whilst characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia return to add some much appreciated gravitas to proceedings. Also there should be a mention for the actor Adam Driver playing the latest antagonist Kylo Renn. Driver plays this role well and is convincing in his troubled persona, appearing evil yet at the same time angst ridden. In previous instalments both Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader carried this duality inside of them, but Kylo Renn truly embodies this fear (and rage) as an integral part of his character. Through his portrayal of Kylo Renn, Driver elevates what could have so easily been a poor mans Darth Vader to a character that is fresh and suitably imperious.Now to address some of the criticisms directed at the movie. Some may argue that rather than paying homage TFA is in effect a reboot/re-telling of the original trilogy, twists and turn and all, WITH the inclusion of a Death Star and a masked villain who has more than a passing resemblance to Darth Vader. You could even go further and say that whole characters along with their personality traits have been cut and pasted from the original trilogy and plonked square onto a whole host of characters in TFA. Whilst this is undeniable and some might argue all too obvious, the only defence that I can give to this is that TFA is the first of a new trilogy. The faint whiff of a movie making process that is hedging it's bets on how to develop it's character, and what direction to take it in, has not quite come about fully formed.To take it to another discussion I think Hollywood has learnt that introducing new characters to a well known and beloved movie series (I hate the term franchise) can be a precarious one, Jar Jar Binks being the go to model of new characters that did not quite resonate with an audience. So it is very likely that the writers erred on the side of caution and made certain characters from TFA a composite of what was great about previous characters in the original/prequels. Is it noticeable, yes, is it enough to distract and cause this audience member to cry foul, no.Ultimately, once all the analysis has been done, The Force Awaken succeeds in reinvigorating and restoring the lustre of the original trilogy. A lustre that had been besmirched by the god awful George Lucas prequels. It has been noted by many commentators that the prequel trilogy was too explanatory, telling the story in a way which was both lacking in subtlety, yet somehow at the same time convoluted and bogged down in some civil war/trade politics that nobody could quite explain nor care for. The Force Awakens dispenses with all the faux political subtexts that effectively ruined the prequels and takes the story back to the heart of the original trilogy. That heart being the story of an everyday young hero longing for adventure, who is then taken on a fantastical journey and on the way meet an unlikely crew of bandits and mis-fit companions.

Very unsinspiring,"I liked the first trilogy when I was a kid. I still think that it is the best. The second trilogy was watchable but now that !! I stopped watching at the moment of Harry Han meets Sally Leia, but it was not exactly like this, in fact we were entering the geriatric service of Star Wars. The plot is very similar to the first trilogy. It must be the force that always forces the writers to find one lost soul in the middle of nowhere among all the planets of that solar system of all the galaxies and universes that can exist. It is not just finding the needle in the hay, more the nanoparticle Jane Doe of the needle in that hay. Hey, what's the hell.

Best possible resurrection of STAR WARS,"The movie is undoubtedly made with a lot of details and attention, scenes are well crafted and the dialogues are well written. There's a classic feel of the old Star Wars movies to this and also the visuals of the new world. 
The old cast mark, Carrie, Harrison and the rest are as good as they've ever been and also the new crew Daisy and John are amazing. 
The score of the movie is the best I've heard in a long long time. The movie made over 2 billion dollars and well it desverved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hard to rate,"I saw it on the big screen back when it first released and I thouht to myself: WOW! They actually ressurected Star Wars!! After the worthless prequels I thought Star Wars was done, didn't think they had the guts to make more of them but apparently they did and it actually worked!!.. But not really, they blew it with episode 8 and 9 as we all know.. They started something good here but they coudn't finish it, ergo it's hard to rate this.. As a stand-alone movie it might have worked but knowing it spawned two sequels that practically made me fall asleep in the movie theater.. And I haven't seen them since, it's hard to take this movie seriously now.. Only thing I can give it credit for is the music. Can't go wrong with a world class composer like John Williams but it's not enough to save it... And I guess the visual effects are quite impressive but other than that I can't think of anything positive to say.Star Wars is dead to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good mixture of nostalgia and new,"Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters.The original storyline parts mesh well with borrowed aspects, Disney played safe for sure when making the movie, regardless it came out well. Although some of the new acting choices are questionable, its still an enjoyable beginning of a new trilogy.Both new and old Star Wars fans will enjoy this new addition to the Star Wars universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars this wasn't,"The Force Awakens was held down by the objective of introducing new characters (many of them unnecessary) and leaving many unanswered plot elements with the seeming intention to expand the series sidewards through spin-offs. It banks on nostalgia by bringing back many of the old players and themes, but too often mishandles the talent and material on hand, respectively.Huge, hurriedly-made and gratuitous (commercial), The Force Awakens is devoid of originality and is unabashedly formulaic. The plot, lifted wholesale from A New Hope, reboots the saga but reverses key themes and alters the look and feel of the original trilogy to come out completely unfamiliar and unrecognizable to the loyal fan base.Produced to please newcomers to the series, it will crush the box office but have limited replay value because a classic, The Force Awakens just isn't.

Miles better than the prequels,"Just ignore the haters and toxic fanboys who just love to hate a star wars film and enjoy this movie, it's way more fun than those horribly aged prequels
yes it's similar to a new hope but it's not a remake of it because the characters and story its different, it's what this franchise needed the fans wanted a classic simple star wars and jj did just that and much more.the only two negatives i have is that it there is another death star again... and carrie fishers acting other than that it's a pretty decent star wars movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
People that are hating this film are sheeps,This is actually better than the originals i love all star wars films but im watching back the originals and honestly they are so boring the prequels and the new sequel trilogy so far are way better honestly this film is better than a new hope and honestly its not even that much of a remake its kinda different there are some bits the same but this is way better than all 3 of the originals. So people who are saying this is rubbish ur just being ungrateful coping what those few other people are saying and making up little stories bout other people hating it because your all low lifes this is one of the best star wars films only behind ROTS and LJ.

"If you're a true fan of the franchise, just don't watch this","The best thing I could say about this movie, is that it has set itself up for a better sequel. I'm just going to go ahead and list my grievances, without giving anything away: -""Knowledge of the force"" was a very important factor in how good a Jedi was at fighting over the first six movies. There was years of training, infinite hurdles. That all goes out the window. Apparently, anyone can beat a Sith lord. -The premise of the main characters, their motives and backgrounds, was so much less believable (even as a fictitious storyline). -The fight scenes were less like the epic battles of Episodes I, II, and III, and more like the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. -The villain was so boring. Abrams didn't pull any brain muscles thinking him up. -The story altogether was extremely weak -Finally but most importantly, this was less of a sequel and more of a remake of Episode IV. I won't tell you how, but you'll see it.Good things about this movie: -Stunning 3D visuals -The imperial starships are as cool as ever -Han Solo is still a bossI want to tell readers to just go watch it with lowered expectations.. but there are no expectations low enough to make this movie a good watch. Just don't bother going",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Puts Star Wars back in its proper place,"As a huge Star Wars fan from a young age, writing an objective review of this movie is almost impossible. It's evident from the reviews here on IMDb that people are either adoring this movie, or they're vastly disappointed by it.Like most other fans, I was thrilled to hear this movie announced and even more thrilled that George Lucas would no longer be involved. I do not appreciate the prequel movies and had high hopes for this movie, considering the new team behind it.Considering the disappointed responses from some fans, I believe I fall in the category of people that can really appreciate this movie for what it is, which is a good old fashioned Star Wars movie. It's got some flaws, but, in my opinion, there is far more to love than there is to hate.You've got to commend JJ Abrams and his team for the work they've put in. It's almost like they were consciously trying to mend some of the ""hurt"" the prequels caused in this aspect: the sets, the puppets, the effects are all overwhelmingly present, in a good way. That hated plastic, artificial feel from the prequels is gone.The fun doesn't stop there.The actors did a solid job, too. Whether it's the newcomers (whom you fear might not be up to the task) or the oldies (whom you fear might just be doing it for the heck of it) I wasn't once distracted by their acting, which means they're doing a fine job of it.I enjoyed the new characters and I feel the existing characters were done justice by their parts.Without revealing anything about the plot, suffice to say it's not the most original of plots. That being said, there is still enough to leave you wondering and a couple of surprises in there. In short, I don't really get the hate, even if the overall plot is probably the movie's weakest point.All in all, I feel this movie has redeemed Star Wars and put it back in its proper place. I will absolutely be seeing it again once it's been released on BluRay and I can't wait to show it to my kids in a few years.Go see it, I'm pretty sure you'll love it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Welcome Back, Star Wars","A perfectly balanced blend of charming love-letter to the style and structure of the original trilogy, infused with an emphatic freshness of humour and new ideas, creates what could be argued to be the purest straight Star Wars film of the entire saga. Paced to perfection as it hits the familiar narrative beats we come to expect, Awakens is alive with the over-the-top action and stirring sentimentality of the films we grew up with while also casting very modern shadow of intrigue and mystery that sets the mind whirring with possibilities as the story moves forward; a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart of the Star Wars fan in all of us that had laid dormant for ten years since Lucas completed his prequel trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A fantastic return to a galaxy far far away,"Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star wars rebels from time to time.This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Starting with the actors, Star Wars The Force Awakens has a star-studded cast. John Boyega, who I have followed since his role in the film Attack the Block, stars as Finn alongside actress Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. They are very likable as the main protagonists, with Finn wanting to leave his life behind as a stormtrooper and Rey being a self-reliant person from the planet Jakku. I also very much enjoyed Oscar Isaac's role as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron; and I hope we see more of his character in the future Star Wars films. It was nice to see the return of characters like Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and seeing Harrison Ford make his return as Han Solo garnered a round of applause from the audience and myself. Andy Serkis stars as Supreme Leader Snoke and does a nice job, while Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma. Domhnall Gleeson makes his character General Hux a memorably vocal antagonist. But perhaps most satisfying of all the characters is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. My friends and I discussed Star Wars: The Force Awakens well before its release, and though our opinions differed, we all agreed that the movie absolutely needed a imposing and memorable villain. And Kylo Ren is just that. I enjoyed how much Star Wars: The Force Awakens explored Kylo's persona and duality; while at the same time giving explanation as to how he came to be just who he is.The story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens adds new elements but has constant reminders that will delight Star Wars fans(as they did me) of why they are fans of the popular space opera in the first place. JJ Abrams incorporates humour into Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but it works very well. And there are numerous surprises , and some moments that hit your emotional side.And even better, the action scenes in the movie are absolutely wonderful. The lightsaber battles are noticeably different here than previous films, and the familiar theme music that we all know and love will definitely be heard in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Taking over the directorial duties for a Star Wars film is no easy task, but JJ Abrams has done an impressive job creating this film.I'd like to point out that the ONLY problem I had with Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that there were certain characters I would have like to have seen have more screen time. But even still, Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers spectacle, and wonder thanks to the talented cast, the direction of JJ Abrams, and the likable combination of old/new elements to the I sincerely hope everyone enjoys Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as I did. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a nice reminder that this is why we go to the movies. And truthfully, I am excited to see where the franchise goes next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Return of Star Wars,"It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force is still Asleep,"Dear Star Wars fans, this comment is meant for you. Did you expect, as I did, the long waited rebirth of the greatest fantasy saga of all time? Then I assume you also felt a huge sense of disappointment. The unexpressed potential of this movie reaches frustratingly high levels : shallow jokes, clichés, bad visual effects... This really couldn't have been worse. We should all consider the opportunities given to directors nowadays : unlimited budget, amazing technological means and countless examples of awful science fiction to avoid. How many artists wish they had this miraculous set of tools back in the Seventies of the Eighties? However these gifts are still wrapped up and hidden, no one chose to see what's inside the packages, but, in my opinion, the omission wasn't caused by lack of curiosity or audacity. Somehow the public still demands a taste of tradition, even in science fiction, and the producers' only desire is to fulfill the expectations of the audience (even if, in order to achieve their goal, they managed to conceal a remake under the ""sequel"" label).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The definitive Star Wars Sequel: Episode VII is a new start and a new hope indeed!,"Whether you watched it or not, loved it or not, the original Star Wars Saga (episodes 4,5,6) defined and changed sci-fi movies forever, and came to be a defining moment in the history of Film Making. One that had a fandom that may surpassed all other movies in the history of cinema, becoming the biggest movie franchise ever and a cultural phenomenon like no other.The later prequel trilogy (episodes 1,2,3) offered more material fo the hungry fan base, but ended up upsetting as many fans, as it successfully drew to it new comers. And it didn't add any new dimensions to the star wars saga, it just expanded on the older one.J. J. Abrams' new sequel did just that. And it did it in the most brilliant and monumental manner.The Force Awakens offers a new fresh take, one that is more serious, more emotional and more diverse. All the while keeping enough of the older saga elements and themes to ensure a faithful and smooth Continuum.The CG of course is much better and more grand, the battle scenes (whether one on one light saber fights, or space battles) are brilliantly shot and directed.The cast did a remarkable job in conveying the depth and emotions of the different characters. The old cast were amazing, and the new actors lived up to the challenge.But more than anything, while episode VII is still playing largely on the nostalgia towards the original 70s saga, it also has new themes and fresh energy that ensure that that subsequent films will be a more contemporary, creative and dynamic saga.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I just don't get the hatred???,I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go.

I have never had a more delightful experience in the theater,"I have never been so excited for a movie as I was with TFA. Everyday leading up to the movie, I never neglected in keeping myself up to date with fresh news concerning the film such as trailers, promotional videos and articles about the cast members, (avoiding spoilers, of course). I could have never been more excited for this film. Yet, I had some doubts that it wouldn't live up to the hype. How could it possibly please Star Wars fans enough that their expectations would be fulfilled? Well, all I can say is that this movie completely lives up to the crazy hype. Simply put: it's visually stunning. It's positively delightful. It's immensely enthralling. It's emotionally strong. And most importantly, it feels like a Star Wars film, it is a Star Wars film. I have never been more delighted at a theater. While I experienced this remarkable movie, there were times when the fun made me smile so much that my cheeks hurt. There were also times when the emotion made my throat choke up and my eyes swell up with tears. You could tell that there was so much thought and love put into every scene, and every single character in the film understood the importance of their roles they were playing and delivered perfectly, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is undoubtedly extraordinary.Of course, it has some faults. Since J.J Abrams wanted to play it safe, The plot does follow very closely with A New Hope, sometimes even mirroring some of the scenes. This appears to be the main source of criticism for the movie. There is also a lot of questions that I wished the movie would have answered concerning certain character back stories and particularly how the First Order grew to become so menacing and powerful. But even so, this movie to me still feels like a worthy sequel to the original trilogy, and I can't wait to see how the story will play out in the next two movies.Overall, an amazing movie, even with it's minor faults. Definitely deserves a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It all depends on the way you look at it.,"Many of us loved the original trilogy. It was one of the greatest things to happen to cinema. Later, we all had to deal with the prequel trilogy that some liked, but most were disappointed. We then waited a few more years for the 3rd trilogy to come out, and most were ecstatic!So it's finally here and I have finally watched it. I was not disappointed, but I was too hyped and because of that, it fell a little short of my expectations. The movie itself was great in aspects of story line and characters, but I think they tried to be like the original trilogy a tad too much. Because of this, there were only a very few parts i wasn't able to predict, or that stood out to me as unexpected.This movie is definitely a good start for moving into a larger story, so i'm definitely looking forward to the next one.One thing I have noticed from others was that if they were really hyped, they were disappointed. Those who went in cautiously, actually really enjoyed it. So don't go in too hyped. It won't be as good as the original trilogy, but i'm pretty nothing could ever compare to the original. It will be interesting to see where Rian Johnson goes with episode 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars is DEAD! Say hello to a new Disney princess & her journey,"I will tell you what I liked, didn't like and then talk spoilers in this order.The force has definitely been awakened and yes you will feel it in the theatre. I was clapping and cheering, people were doing it and you will too. I absolutely loved the new characters Fin, Kylo Ren and Rey. My favourite was Rey but I'm sure everyone will have their own favourite out of the trio. The other character I liked was Snoke and the New order commander. It is hard to make new characters extremely likable especially with the previous legendary cast being around but they did it. There is a surprisingly big amount of comedy in this film and I found myself laughing a lot. Obviously we know the old cast are in the movie and they do not disappoint (with minor exception that does not apply). Han solo was Han damn Solo and that was amazing! The film has beautiful scenery and new cool creatures which is a nice addition to the Star Wars galaxy.Now by all means, going into this movie I lowered my expectations and told myself I shouldn't judge the movie negatively just because the 'old Star Wars' feeling isn't there but that is not the issue. The movie has technical issues and Star Wars related issues. The technical issues are that the film is incomplete - leaves more questions than answered and a cliffhanger. The other technical issue is the plot is too similar to previous films. The Star Wars related issues are that: there was a lack of original score for the characters which is something Star Wars always has done. Some characters have such a small average role that really makes you question all that marketing and hype behind them. There is little or no dialogue at some critical scenes which I feel like there should have been. But the main issue here is that this movie would be really good if you watch the coming episodes back to back because it feels more like a serial on Netflix and it shouldn't be like that, it should be a full movie on it's own and continue the saga in the coming episodes.Now for the ******SPOILERS*******Did I just watch an extended trailer or was that the movie?!!! The movie is too short! The shots in the trailers with the knights of Ren and Luke with R2D2 are a vision scene in the movie which last the same amount of time as in the trailers!!!!! Thats it...a few seconds!!! The new death star was amazing, it was badass it looked invincible the New Order looked like the new big thing and all of a sudden the rebels come up with a plan to blow up the death star in mere seconds send in like a few x-wings and they blow it up along with every new order on it.....um WHAT?!!! seriously?! The victory for the rebels was so unrewarding, I could not believe they actually did it all again and expected us to cheer. So many inconsistency with characters in the movie like is Fin a Jedi or not if not then how does he battle Kylo Ren so well and even injure him!!! If yes he is a Jedi, how did he learn how to use a light saber so fast and match Kylo Ren who has had training as a Jedi from Luke his uncle and as a sith from Snoke. How does Rey learn the ways of the force and so well?! Just because she is strong with the force doesn't automatically make her a master Jedi fighter! Anakin Skywalker was the strongest Force sensitive person in the galaxy and he needed years of training to match other Jedi and Sith. Rey was too powerful! To the point where did didn't make sense and you start to realize it's not supposed to because Diney is trying to make a Disney princess out of her!!! What happened to Kylo Ren?? did he survive the blast explosion of the new death star?! snoke told the commander to bring him but they never show that he survives and thats not how it should have been addressed. That is not how you do anticipation for the next film. they should have shown him flying out injured on a craft, thats it! Are they trying to make us think that he's dead and surprise us by bringing him back?! how cliché would that be!!! Captain phasma was such a disappointment because she is there just as a cameo!!! she barely has any role! They cast an amazing actress and give her an amazing look and they don't even use her, she could have playing a stormtrooper and we wouldn't have felt the difference. Luke Skywalker is NOT in the movie!!! just at the very end he turns stares into Rey and the credits role...what?! what ever happened to C3PO's hand!!!?? I thought we were gonna know!! so basically we have to watch episode 8 to see Star Wars!!! this movie was just a trailer tease for Episode 8. We still don't know if snoke is Darth Plagueis but I don't have a problem with that, he looked badass. What was all that marketing with Ray's staff?! she has it in the beginning, then doesn't have it through out the movie and then at the end she magically has it again. Is that staff something special?! they didn't tell us anything so basically all that marketing was not for this movie but the next if her staff is actually something special like light saber or Darth plagueis's Saber. You know now I question the studio for putting a sudden embargo on the reviews for the movie after the premiere. I thought they were doing that for spoilers but apparently they were doing it because they sensed bad reviews would hurt the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How is this rated 8.8/10?,"There is no way this film should be rated so highly. You're telling me it's as good as Lord of The rings, the original Star wars films, The Dark Knight, Fight Club etc....? No way... the plot was an exact rehash of Episode IV. Unoriginal, uninspiring, and lackluster all round. The only good thing about it was performances and the nostalgic music, sounds etc. As a stand alone film i'd give it like a 6/10, but since it's being rated so highly I'm going to give it a 1/10. An 8.8/10 film should be original, not a film that is an exact copy and paste of another movie from 30 years ago. I will say, it was better than the prequels in terms of acting, production etc. But even the prequels had better ideas, and MUCH better music. The music wasn't special at all in this - no Dual of The Fates etc etc. Overall im disappointed. Over-hyped to the max.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A new hype,"1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Coming Home,"Rey, a scavenger barely eking out a living, needs to go home. She will do what she can to support the resistance, but she needs to come back to her planet. Nothing remains there for her but a hope that something or someone will find her.Fate decides otherwise. A force, maybe even ""the force,"" compels her otherwise to abandon home. Her awakening, though not completed by film's end, is what makes this film a triumph. And the cliff-hanger ending leaves you puzzled, yet satisfied that there are more revelations ahead. While you might think you have the answers, do not be surprised if you're surprised by next installment.Some have said that this episode is a reboot of ""A New Hope."" On the surface that might be a fair comment, but it seems to miss the point.Rey wanted to stay home-bound, hoping ""something"" or ""someone"" would find her. Away from home, she is now in a galaxy so very far, far away . . . .Now, so far away, has she found what she lost so long ago?Cue John Williams, buy your ticket and wait in your seats for Episode VIII.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great film but you can see the consequence of Lucas selling out to Disney,"I have to say I liked the fact this film follows on from the originals and maintains some of its appeal. However there is a true lack of Originality.My first issue is that since Lucas has sold the rights to this, you can see this is a typical Disney style film. By selling out this franchise he has sacrificed a cult classic. The Villain Ren for example, has no evil appeal. He is a soft character and reminds me of a typical Harry Potter style Villain. When you look at characters such as Darth Vader and Darth Maul, this new guy is just weird teenager geek type character reminding me of the villain in KickAss, Red Mist.Secondly Disney is clearly aiming this movie at a younger generation age range 8-15. They are also more concerned with profits than widening the appeal to the masses.Thirdly they used a safe bet storyline rather than using any originality, they have used similar ideas concepts used in the Original Empire strikes back movie.I personally think the Prequels are quite good in comparison to this new generation Star Wars. Especially because I liked the Prequels Originality and new story lines, as well as a wider understanding of new planets in the wider galactic empire.With Force Awakens, be prepared to not feel the same surprise factors felt in all the previous Star Wars movies.On a more positive note, I like that a lot of the Original cast has made a comeback to recreate the epic that was created many decades ago. Apart from that, I hope Lucas found all that extra money worth it because Disney has robbed you man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We let the force in... and it was goood.,"My intention is always to keep my reviews spoiler-free, and this will be no exception.Since January 2013, when it was announced that J.J. Abrams would take on the onerous job of directing Star Wars 7, Star Wars fans have held their collective breath. You could feel the nervous tension, mixed with fervent anticipation, as the lights dimmed at the packed midnight showing at 00:01 on 17th December 2015. Could Abrams deliver or would the Disney-powered hype dissolve in a lens-flared dissipation of metaclorians? Well, the wait is over and the result is in. And it's a triumphant victory prepare to be gushed at! I would normally recap the basic plot at this point in my review, but to do so could potentially ruin some of the monumental twists and surprises of the story, which is both simple but Shakespearean in its breadth. The film has been a masterclass in marketing, throwing up feverish debate in the fan-world: why was Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) absent from both the trailers and the poster? Why is one of the heroes, Finn (John Boyega), seen wearing a stormtrooper outfit? Who is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? No answers here, but all great questions skillfully answered through the screenplay.So I will stick to the well-worn facts of the pre-publicity: that the film is set some 30 years after the historic events of ""Return of the Jedi"" (but still a ""Long Time Ago""), and centres on talented yet frustrated starship mechanic Rey (Daisy Ridley) stranded in a dead-beat job on the desert planet of Yakku (which all feels nostalgically familiar to someone who is old enough to have been there at the start of it all). Through the intervention of a droid with an embedded secret (ditto) she is dragged into the workings of the Republic's fight against a resurgent dark-side in the form of ""The First Order"", going 100% Hitler including an alien Nuremberg-style rally that is all red, black and white.What makes the film succeed is a strong emphasis back on story and character over effects (with the latter of course still being awesome). All of the acting is fine, with Oscar Isaac's heroic pilot Poe Dameron being particularly strong and Domhnall Gleeson (""Brooklyn"", ""Ex Machina"") almost unrecognizable to me as General Hux, mouthpiece to the First Order. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega both impress as the 'unknowns' in the cast, albeit with (particularly in the case of Ridley's Rey) a few rough acting edges in some of the dialogue that will smooth with age and fame.Rey is a wonderful female character at the heart of the film, the strongest role model for women in action films since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in ""Alien"". Athletic and tough, yet still showing a feminine grace and beauty in her Greek goddess-inspired apparel.It's also fabulous to see the original trilogy cast again, all older and nicely wizened, with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) being delightfully crusty and only Carrie Fisher's Leia perhaps suggesting that even with all the high tech that existed back then, they still hadn't quite mastered cosmetic surgery. Even the inside of the Millennium Falcon – queue audience cheer as the rust-bucket hoves into view – looks like its had a chip-fat fire or ten too many and could do with the hire of a steam cleaner. (And Abrams judiciously resists the urge to lens flare it, which is a plus!) What a treat also that the 'hidden' originals of Anthony Daniels (C3PO), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) all had the chance to reprise their roles again. They are joined in the ""I was in Star Wars not that you'd know it"" club by Lupita Nyong'o (from ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Non-Stop"") as a sort of alien commune leader (reminiscent to me of The Simpson's Professor Frink), Mo-cap expert Andy Serkis (""The Lord of the Rings""; ""Planet of the Apes"") as supreme leader Snoke and the very lofty Gwendeline Christie (""Game of Thrones"") as the stormtrooper Captain Phasma.In fact it's almost impossible to criticize this film. It's as near a thing to perfection as I could imagine. It has obviously been lovingly crafted by people (and a lot of British production talent) that clearly had to pinch themselves that THEY were getting to work on a Star Wars film. The script by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt zings along like an express train, with some great snatches of appropriate humour delivering laugh out loud moments. It certainly avoids a lot of the cheesy lines that were one of the few things you could criticize the previous Star Wars masterpiece ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for.John Williams delivers a stonkingly powerful score, with new themes for the new characters mixed with a nostalgia-filled return to the classic old themes, all deserving of a proper listen-to via the soundtrack album.After this experience, I'm personally sorry that Abrams is not doing the next one too: Colin Trevorrow (""Jurassic World"") has a challenge on his hands and a high-bar to reach.I feared Abrams might make a cack-up of Jar Jar proportions with this one, but I am truly delighted to be proved wrong. I predict that all fans of Star Wars of whatever age will love it, and wish that Hamill, Fisher and Ford would all go on to star in Episodes VIII and IX. Fantastic cinema. Go see it, and ideally before any spoilers emerge.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You had an easy job and you blew it,"This new Star Wars movie looks like the uninteresting saga of Transformers which includes everything that any Star Wars fan hates: lots of explosions, poor CGI and bad timing jokes. I am in fact surprised that Rey was not wearing a hot cleavage.The movie had a lot of potential but the producers were not able to use them.For example, the producers turned the Imperial Troops more human with the desertion of Finn. Also, the blood on his white helmet was something never seen before and thus very well achieved.However, the desertion could be much more exploited. Why? Finn helps someone of the resistance to escape and suddenly he is a hero. No! He could be trying to infiltrate into the Resistance. The idea was excellent but the producers should give more attention regarding Finn's decision to abandon the Empire.Kylo Ren is the worst Villain ever. I know he had a hard task to replace the best Villain ever: Darth Vader. But his acting was horrible. Also, he has not a face of a Villain. He has a face (and hair) of a disturbed kid. I was expecting a horrifying or a cold expression.Also, some secrets like knowing that he is the son of Han and Leia should only be revealed in episode VIII or IX.Finn should not fight with Kylo Ren... Specially using a lightsaber. Lightsabers are for Jedi. This means that any regular person can fight against a Jedi or Sith evenly. So, those years of Jedi training are irrelevant!? One Death Star is excellent (Episode IV), two is OK (Episode VI) but three is too much (Episode VII).Those last minutes of the movie (travelling to Luke) were extremely forced. The movie should have ended with the location of Luke. But Disney decided that Luke (Leia and Han) should make an appearance on Episode VII just for Nostalgia. I will not be surprised if Lando appears on Episode VIII.Ending the movie in suspense, that is, leaving Luke for the next episode would drive fans crazy to watch the next episode. Like what the producers did to Han Solo: frozen on carbonite on Episode V and unfrozen on Episode VI).To conclude, this movie is OK for a non Star Wars movie. But for a sequel of Star Wars you should have done more much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Disney, what a tragedy...","This post doesn't contain spoilers.I always valued a good story and character development more than all the rest. The previous movies were not perfect, but I become fond of them in a way. Today I witnessed how money is once again the only thing that matters.Before I even saw the movie I predicted 70% of the story, which is a truly disturbing fact. Cheap jokes and all the unnecessary dialogs were turning the movie second by second into uninteresting and boring adaptation of the previous series. Harrison Jones is a great actor, but his time in Star Wars is over. Time to move on, focus on new heroes, tell us how they feel deep inside, picture their emotions and actions from a different side of view, not just Disney fairy tale, we had enough of this already.I tried to like it, I truly did, but it is too shallow, too simple...

Incredible reboot,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an incredible reboot/sequel that successfully combines the new with the old in an emotional, consistently funny and thrilling revitalisation of the Skywalker saga.

Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are also incredible with their returning characters having grown and evolved since episode VI. It's expertly paced without a single scene dragging or being boring.

Boring and predictable story.,The story looks like they wrote it in a day they took the same idea as before and to get the fans back they though in the old cast. Each shot was cut down to the minimum typical Attention defect disorder public can keep their attention. It jumps from one scene to another with minimal dialogue just enough to follow the story. The acting is horrible in some scenes. I hate JJ Abrams movies his style is nothing more then computer aided action blasted at you every few seconds. He cuts the scene down so bad the actors say a few words then cut say a few words cut. George Lucas should have left it alone and never sold it as much as I didn't like his last 2 Star Wars he made this is 100 times worse then anything George Lucas ever made.

First Star Wars Movie I've ever Seen. I'm 29,"It's an awful film, I'm just giving it a 2 because it actually had a beginning, a middle and an end.I haven't watched any of the Star Wars movies. This was my first.Objectively, as a movie, this was exactly like any of the recent blockbusters I've wasted my money on the last decade.Vehicles chasing each other and blowing stuff up, villains unable to find the target, actions that defy all laws of physics, cliché dialogue with no depth and stupid one-liners, and basically a film designed for IQ's anywhere between 0 and 50.If there was a unique story behind all this, I failed to see it.This film was plain bad.8.7Really IMDb?

Superb,"Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid!Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to ""the force"", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past.Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best star wars since Empire,"Seems that everyone either loves or hates this movie. While some people think it's the best star wars, others think it's the worst. I'm in the middle. It's a great film, but far from the best star wars. Better than the prequels, and I even thought it was better than ROTJ. So for me it's the 3rd best star wars film, but it's still a really well made film. It's acted and wrote well, which Rouge one is not. The series needed this refresh, which is why I am mostly okay with the rehashed story. Still, the characters are well written and acted, and the visual effects are stunning",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Star Wars Movie!,"Firstly it's obvious most people rating this film 1-2 stars are simply just saying ""tHiS iS a ReBoOt gO wAtCh tHe OrIgiNaL hurrr durrr"". It's simply blind hatred and it's clear most haven't seen THIS movie! Don't listen to the blind hate reviews!! They all have nostalgia goggles on from the original Star Wars movies! It's such a shame cuz I imagine it's angry 50 year olds just hate bombing the reviews cuz they have nothing better to do with their day lmfao.I put off watching this movie for so long because of all the negative reviews people were leaving, but man have I missed out. The first time I saw this movie was today on Disney+ January 2020, so 5 years after release. The only reason I decided to watch it was because now that Rise of Skywalker is out I figured it'd be a good time to watch the new trilogy. I LOVE all the Star Wars movies, the original 3 ep 4-6, + the new eps they made at the beginning of the century ep 1-3. IMO all the movies have been great sci-fi/action movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is another great sci-fi/action movie. I went into this with an open mind, not trying to look for comparisons between this movie and the original ""a new hope."" If you go into this movie looking to compare every single scene between the 2 movies you will probably not like this movie because you will nit-pick every single scene! But if you're like me and just turn your brain off and just enjoy the show the movie is very thoroughly entertaining! Tons of action and great story development.I'm 24 years old and found this movie very entertaining, and please understand I found the original Star Wars movies equally as entertaining when I was a little kid even though others would say they're boring. Also I didn't feel like they ""shove"" the woman main character into our faces as many others have stated. I usually hate when they force women/minorities into major roles of tv/movies simply to say ""look a woman could do this too"" or ""look this woman is so strong & independent just like a man"". This movie wasn't that. The female did a great job as well as Fin the black guy, they played their roles without  garbage being shoved down our throats.Finally the reason I wrote this review is to hopefully sway someone to watch this movie who was on the fence just like me. Please don't listen to the 1-2 star ratings. Sure some people may have actually hated the movie that much, but if you scroll through enough you will see that most super low ratings are just saying, ""screw this movie, watch the original"" lmfao, very constructive guys.

Made for the Money,"Part of what made the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes such good films is that they were episodes within a larger story _and_ good films in their own right.The Force Awakens would make an excellent pilot for a 13 episode series on Netflix, but it's not a good film. Too much of The Force Awakens was merely set up for the next two films. It's one-third of a story rather than a whole which is part of something larger. It exists to create revenue for the rights holder, not to produce a good film.I couldn't make myself care much about the new characters, although they are likable. If this weren't a Star Wars film, I'm not sure I'd want to see the next two films in the theater. I find myself saying, ""meh..."" when I think about the film, the characters, their struggles... The film was made for fans who type ""The Feels!"" on Twitter rather than for children of all ages.This make me I wonder if we even need Star Wars anymore.When Star Wars first came out, there was nothing like it. Imitations like Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers were good but not great. Empire was also great, and despite the episode with the little bears, the series was the best of its kind in the world. And the fans knew it. Yes, Star Trek had the intellect, and Doctor Who had the magic, but Star Wars was a force (pun intended) unto itself.But while I was watching The Force Awakens, I was saying to myself, ""Oh, this is like that scene in Episode I""; ""Oh, this is like Firefly.""; ""Oh, this is like that scene in Empire.""; ""Oh, that actress was in Empire"". It was about as special as a fan film. In fact, it was less interesting than that Boba Fett fan film from the 90's.It was even less entertaining than Bad Lip Reading's rendition of Episode IV.The makers of this film were not original -- they just retooled Star Wars using the existing 21st century SF milieu, wrote a screenplay with the usual Hollywood parallels, gender roles, and tricks, and waved a large paycheck in front of the original actors. Why should they care if it's not as good as Episodes IV or V? They're there to look good and say the lines.Out of seven films in this series, two succeeded spectacularly, three are OK (including The Force Awakens), and two were awful.The idea of Jedi Knights may still grip SF fans, but this new film series did little for me -- and I may not be the only one. Someone competent needs to write and direct Episode 8, not someone who knows how to paint-by-numbers in the most generic Hollywood style. Otherwise, we may end up with two mediocre Star Wars films in a row.It's sad that no one wanted to make a good Star Wars film. They just wanted a new trilogy, because... money. The Force Awakens is more about Disney owning all the IP than about good film-making..Oh well. Nothing lasts forever, not even Star Wars' exalted status in science-fiction film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything we know and love about Star Wars!,"I'll be honest, I'm the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly sceptical about his ability to do the film justice. But let me tell you after the midnight screening last night I was very impressed! Abrams (and everyone who worked on the film) are clearly loyal fans of the saga, and have done it a great justice. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. Masterfully written and directed with amazing visuals and cinematography, the film introduces a cast of new and soon very familiar stars that do a great justice to their roles. The return of the original cast had the audience up in cheers and almost brought a nostalgic tear to my eye.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villain (seduced by the dark side and very similar to the last days of anakin sky walker). Without spoiling anything, the twist in this movie left me breathless and the shock confrontation at the end gasping! People certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but I believe Abrams has totally delivered and has done a masterful job of doing the saga justice. Give it a watch! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Do not see in IMAX 3D,"I made an IMDb account just to say this: Even if you like 3D movies, do not see _The Force Awakens_ in 3D. This movie was not shot with 3D cameras. Not even the special effects shots were rendered in actual stereoscopic 3D. The whole thing is converted, and it's terrible. Characters often have the appearance of living cardboard cutouts. Sense of scale is horribly, horribly messed up. For example, we see a huge ship and part of it is made to look closer even though it is so far away that you shouldn't be able to see that effect (like how in real life, when you look at clouds near the horizon, they don't appear to have depth). Similarly with planets and other stuff. Instead of just looking natural, like movies shot or computer-rendered in 3D, the 3D is a distracting layer on top of what the cinematographer intended, drawing attention to whatever the people who did the conversion decided to push out or pull in from the screen. Combined with the usual drawbacks of the 3D technology (glasses darken the image and seem to ""box in"" the screen, etc.), it really got on my nerves, affecting my experience much more than I expected.Because of this distraction, I don't want to go in-depth on my opinion of the actual movie since it might very well have been different had I seen it in the original format. My feelings are ambivalent. On one hand it's mostly a rehash of the original trilogy with weaker characters and drama; on the other I can't deny that I (as someone who likes but is not super enthusiastic about _Star Wars_) had fun and was entertained. But I was hoping for something new and imaginative that would add to _Star Wars_, not just continue it.One of the reasons I saw it in 3D even though I would have preferred non-3D is that there are no IMAX showings (at least anywhere near me) that are not IMAX 3D. That's right, post-converted 3D is being forced on IMAX viewers, I presume so they can bump up the ticket price and because 3D attendance has been on the decline. Some parts of the film were shot in IMAX, and this means you can't see those parts in unadulterated IMAX.I feel bad that I already rewarded Disney and the theaters for this crap (not the film itself, just the way they're showing it) by shelling out extra for IMAX 3D. Please, don't reward them any more. If you see _The Force Awakens_, see it without 3D. You can save money (it's not like this movie needs more support) *and* have a better viewing experience.Edit: I found out that the IMAX 3D for this movie basically isn't even IMAX, in the vast majority of theaters (in the US at least). Can't link to articles; just google ""'the force awakens' 'IMAX 3D'"" and they should come up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Proof Of Concept,"Well 30 years have passed since the last, ""GOOD"" star wars movie, and with the current fashion of going back to a franchise that was meant to end a long time ago (more star puns coming) here comes episode 7 , the 7th entry to this franchise that seems to be having a mixed opinion amongst it's viewers. Before starting up with this review let me be really clear about the fact , that the force is strong with this one , and we are back in to the good ol' Star wars. This movie is definitely not the best star wars movie made, but it isn't a movie worth slashes of 1 and 2 ratings either. And in this review I will explain and justify my opinion with absolutely no spoilers.1)Story :- It is apparent and absolutely obvious , that most of the concerns that people have with this movie , is the fact that this is a re-hash or re-telling of episode 5 – a new hope. While that is probably a good way to explain the story, I believe that force awakens has a plot that rises way above that assumption. Now the first 10 minutes of this movie might feel extremely and creepily similar to a new hope with a lot of recurring events , but a whole new setting and a whole new motivation for both new and returning characters make this movie a surprisingly different story telling experience , with obviously lot of notable flaws. One of the biggest concerns I have with this movie is the now obvious presence of a yet another death star. But on my second viewing it is pretty much apparent that a new death star like object was a necessary plot device used by JJ Abrams to actually bind the team to fight against an actual threat to the galaxy. Not just that , the story being written by a fan and not the creationist , opens varied opportunities to add elements to the plot that not just benefit the viewer on an artistic level , but makes the world feel more burst out with familiar details and focused lore building ideas. The story does a fantastic job in slowly carrying in the new cast to hold the franchise for it's future releases , and is a great and exciting start to the now post Lucas trilogy , and feels like this movie was made and tailored perfectly for a new generation of star wars fans.2)Casting and Characters :- Now bringing in the old cast and crew into the story was a bold and perfect choice , as we know exactly how a star wars movie devoid of the original cast strength faired amongst the audience. While the performances of the returning cast is superb as usual , what really caught my eye was the new team. Daisy Ridley as Rey , John Boyega as Finn and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and also my favorite Poe played by Oscar Isaac were all brilliant with the character that they portrayed on screen. The 1000 word limit and the presence of some serious spoilers really restrict me from over explaining these characters , but I am sure that every viewer would love the way these new characters take up and share screen space during the entire runtime of this movie. Now moving on to the returning cast , the only 2 people that really stood out was Han Solo and Chewbacca. These 2 people were not just phoned into the script for some nostalgic run but actually stood by the new generation to take them around the world of star wars and show them the galaxy far far away. Han Solo acts as the bridge between the old and new generation and is Han Solo at his best. Not to worry though , this is not the case of Crystal Skull. Lupita was good with the role that was given to her too acting as Maz Kanata. And finally do not expect much from Captain Phasma or Supreme Leader Snoke as these are characters that were just introduced into the plot and hopefully will be used responsibly in the future movies. While many of the side characters did not receive justifiable screen time , it is to rightfully experience and develop the characters of the new generation that will potentially lead the franchise for the next 2 movies of this trilogy. On a whole , both the returning and the new cast gel well to provide an all good performance to make us feel like we are back home.3)Direction:- What I was extremely scared about when I heard JJ Abrams was the director of this movie was that he might Abrafy this movie with quick cuts , shaky cams and lens flare. But the first 10 minutes of this movie provided me with some much needed re- assurance. JJ Abrams directs some beautiful set-pieces, and this movie does not lack that. There are plenty of wide shots with the sky and other subtle elementary backgrounds with the proper clean and practical colour and light choices that ultimately grounds the movie to reality unlike the CGI garbage in the prequels. Also, the use of practical effects makes this movie much more real and obviously sings the song of return thus making this movie closer and closer to the masterpieces that the original movies were. A lot of modifications done by JJ Abrams to the script runs in combination with his direction and idea of the next generation of this franchise , whose take is absolutely appreciated. His direction and his keen liking of the franchise as a fan makes this movie a fan made passion project that every fan would love.Ultimately , this is a movie that is better than the trash prequels and goes way above the CGI overkill to live close with the original trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Epic!,"My childhood was filled with the original trio of Star Wars movies, numbers IV/V/VI in the series, and they blew me away. A New Hope (IV) remains one of my all-time favourite movies. As a result, I found the prequels a complete letdown, as did many others. So I approached The Force Awakens (VII) with some reservations.We saw it in the IMAX, best seats in the centre, and the 3D effects were excellent, as was the audio.The acting was top-notch, from new and old cast members. The script was snappy and there was some great humour interspersed with some really touching moments.The different generations of actors really meshed well and there was obvious chemistry between them all.The story moved along at a cracking pace (the two hours+ flashed past in no time!). The CGI was well used and meshed well with the traditional effects.

Had its fun moments but otherwise nothing new.,"While it was good to see a new Star Wars movie on the big screen I strongly felt that despite some fun scenes overall it was not that memorable. To sum up my experience, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was nothing new. I feel conflicted here. Yes it was a good time filler. Yes it was good to see a new entry into the Star Wars franchise. But the movie just felt like it was going over old ground, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before.Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star which occurred in Return of the Jedi (1983). Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared. The First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate Luke and the Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by Luke's twin sister, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposes them while searching for Luke to enlist his aid.Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is captured and interrogated by Kylo Ren following an unsuccessful operation to capture Poe's droid BB-8 which is carrying vital information on the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. A storm trooper who wants to leave his past behind named Finn (John Boyega) helps Poe escape and crash lands onto planet Jakku where he runs into BB-8 and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a resourceful scavenger. After escaping in the iconic Millennium Falcon following an air strike Rey, Finn and BB-8 encounter Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca where they embark on a quest to locate Luke Skywalker as well as evading Kylo Ren and the First Order.It was a trip down nostalgic lane catching up with Han Solo, Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-P30. The franchise receives a welcome injection of new blood with Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. Out of the new characters I liked Rey the most, and I hope to see her again in the franchise should there be a sequel. She's resourceful, adventurous, and appealing. I liked Finn but I must have missed why he grew tired of becoming a storm trooper. Kylo Ren was just another version of Darth Vader and Darth Maul but I thought his lightsaber looked more intimidating that the character itself.The plot was just like the same old path that has been taken before. It was good to see JJ Abrams take on the Star Wars franchise but I missed George Lucas' midas touch that he gave the previous Star Wars movies. John Williams returns as the composer and his musical score gave the movie an energetic feel.There was a large amount of hype surrounding the movie and rightfully so. Most people have raved about how good it was and there is a small minority that dislike the movie. I'm sitting firmly in the category of people who thought it was good but not great. While Star Wars The Force Awakens was worth a watch overall I felt as if it was rehashing old ground with a touch of nostalgia thrown in with the characters from the original movies. But nonetheless, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a decent time filler.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some people are just plain spoiled brats,"OK I went to this movie with my wife a few days ago and have to tell you that this was so much better than I ever thought possible. All these people that want to compare this to episode 1V are just the type of people I am sure that just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. Wake up people with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that raged on this movie so bad did see it, right? not so sure. Please continue this story for years to come. This has made me a bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was Top notch especially Harrison Ford. I mean he stepped right back in that roll perfectly. Some people said this was predictable, Really people this is Star Wars not Forrest Gump . Relax spoiled brats and enjoy a good movie for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I missed the Force.,"This movie is a well made ""sequel"". I agree with many comments on this site: this is not a sequel, but a - to much commercially inspired - remake. The visual effects are perfect, the music is excellent, the actors are doing a perfect job. But still... the real Star Wars spirit is missing so much. The storyline is unidimensional and simplistic, the emotions are rather flat... Maybe the story was to complete after episode VI, and maybe it's just not possible to continue to milk this cow in a sensible way. I feel a bit betrayed in my expectations. For Episodes VIII, IX, X, .... till IC, I will wait for the BR-disk to be available instead of going to the movie theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What happened to screen writing these days?,"First of all, the movie is not as bad as many others review it here. But the essence of these reviews is true: It just mirrors what Hollywood has become today. Episode VII is a uninspired ripoff of somebody else's ideas and therefore has no soul. But what is really annoying, considering the professionals involved, it has a poorly written script. It feels like a first draft that has been rushed into production. Abrams knows his job, he wrote Super 8, which is a well written movie. And Kasdan co-wrote Empire Strikes Back, which is the best star wars ever. I don't know what happened, maybe they tried to make it great and some studio boss messed it up. Or they didn't have enough time to make it right. Probably Abrams is just too busy producing. I wonder how the movie had turned out if a writer with a master skill set like Aaaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarrantino had written the script. Writers who really know their craft and can build up scenes that work for the story. This movie had, except a couple of good punchlines, not one well written scene. And that's too bad as Abrams knows how to direct a well written script.But there is something else missing in the writing than technical skills. What made the original trilogy great? Lucas did his research about ancient myths, archetypes, he referenced masterpieces of legend filmmakers (e.g. Kurosawa), he dug really deep and put all his creativity and passion into building a breathtaking world full of ideas. He was taking risks. But episode 7 just repeats what has worked before, without inventing something new.But maybe there is hope: Ryan Johnson could at least fix some of it and make a reasonable movie as he is also one of those talented writers out there. If they let him. Please do. Maybe the new trilogy becomes something like the matrix in reverse by starting terrible (matrix 3) and becoming really great (matrix 1). But there is one BIG problem now: the falcon is empty.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Walked in hoping it would be decent, walked out smiling","Well Mr Abrams sure succeeded on this one, walked in slightly skeptical cause of how disappointing the first two prequels in particular were. But man did I get blown away! It felt like Star Wars, you could see the attention to detail and the lack of CGI for the sake of CGI, the old cast were stellar and the new cast were really really good too as the new main characters. Never looked at the time once and never took my eyes of the beautiful worlds we were shown. Really gave me that feeling of exploring that galaxy far away again that I got back when I were a kid.And to those complaining about similarities to episode IV I just have this to say: What do you call episode VI then? ""return to death star""? It does not have to be 100% original to still be a great movie, barely nothing is original anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong,"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is the long-awaited seventh installment in the Star Wars film series and the beginning of the brand new Sequel Trilogy. Without giving away too much, I'll say that it is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong.Normally, I would write a synopsis here. This time I refuse to do so. There are so many secrets and twists in this film that revealing the smallest plot point could potentially spoil the entire movie. All I will say is that it takes place 30 years after the Original Trilogy. I will leave it at that.The whole film felt like a breath of fresh air to anyone wanting to see a new Star Wars movie. Almost everything in this film worked really well. The characters, new and old, lent themselves to so many memorable moments and even some great comic relief. Unlike the Prequels, which focused too much on politics, this film focuses more on the action and story. J. J. Abrams has proved that the Star Wars series is in the right hands at Disney, he was the perfect choice as the film's director. I already can't wait for Episode 8.I rate it a very high 9.5/10, the same rating as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Roller-coaster on an excellent return-to-franchise,"I entered the cinema complex with absolute no knowledge about the movie, the only thing I saw was one trailer, that's it. Even if you did watch all of the trailers, shots,... you can't know what will happen to you in the following 2hours and 15 minutes...First of all, the actors are really good, there's a fantastic dynamic between old and new characters. Second, there's a fantastic mix of different things happening. You have, obviously, the action. But besides that the movie also tries (and succeeds) to give you a deeper look in the emotions of the characters. Third, plot twists, plot twists plot twists.I think it is safe to say that this movie will go down as one of the best in the franchise. The director really does live up to the expectations!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"a decent movie, but weak story and nowhere near the hype","From a neutral perspective i would say its an OK movie. However the plot is mostly just a copy of Episode IV's plot. I didn't mind that the movie was a bit predictable, since the movie is still a Disney production - therefore also meant for children. But i did miss the force in all the fights - why not use it more, if you have it?The new characters had a decent enough backstory, but the lack of depth in the story was painful. If someone told this was supposed to be the best movie of all time, i would burst out laughing - it doesn't even deserve to be in the top 250 - Unfortunately the Screenwriters aren't as talented as the marketing managers of Disney.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not much more than a badly disguised version of the first movie (ep IV),"JJ did a great job. Especial effects look great. This movie takes you back to the style of the first 3 movies. Less digital, more realistic. I liked that a lot.The problem is the story.When you watch the movie you already seen all of that in the first movie of George Lucas (ep IV). They remix the characters, the landscape change, but what happens in the story is basically all very alike the first movie.There is no new ideas on how to continue the story, so they scrambled and gave it again.Another problem is the lack of dept of the characters. Princess Leia wasn't amazing in the first movies, but really has nothing special to bring in this movie.The new pretty face of the movie does an awesome job, but the story doesn't help her, and makes her do some not believable things for those how know the SW universe.Is still a good movie to watch, but again, not something that gets the SW fans satisfied.If only the story was as good as the special effects...PS. The new dark lord. Bad, really bad. PS2. A good thing: You would never say this is a Disney movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great addition to the star wars family,"We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm.The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor.The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were welcome.Add some terrific space battles, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it.Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is a nostalgia fest.,Not going to spoil anything.In my opinion the force awakens is more of a nostalgia fest than a really good movie. It seems like J.J Abrahams really did everything in his power to please the star wars fans. This is also a negative point though because the movie can have a bit of a recycled feel instead of a good fresh feeling of watching a new story. Nevertheless i enjoyed it and wasn't bored for a moment.It is also a good thing they have casted a lot of the old Star Wars cast which will really give you the feeling of watching a Star Wars movie. This also of course gives some really nice options for good plot twists with multiple generations in one film (not going into detail but obviously being star wars there are a few plot twists in the movie!).A must see for every star wars fan!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Last Jedi by a mile,A lot of people complained about the similarities between this and the original but I thought it was kind of a fun ode but still its own sort of thing.

JJ Abrams clearly loves it and you can feel that and I think it's pretty great.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Comfy like an old pair of slippers meets 21st Century awesomeness,"17 December 2015 Film of Choice at Just After Midnight at The Plaza Dorchester - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. With much shushing there was silence in the auditorium, a dark screen filled only with stars........then those two wondrous words written in yellow and the familiar blast of music......every single person clapped and cheered and we were immediately thrust into a comfortable familiar place which was presented in a whole new 21st Century way. As the credits were rolling at the end I overheard someone say ""there are no words to describe how good that film was!"" I totally agree but I will do my best. When I first heard Disney had assumed the mantle of this beloved franchise I must admit my heart sank, I'm of the generation who queued for the very first film in the very first week back in the seventies and I was dreading how this latest edition would turn out. As filming progressed and stories were being leaked I became more hopeful, and as of this evening I can only say what a completely marvellous job has been made of this film. Following the story was a mixture of emotions, we met new characters who slotted in easily with old favourites, and the appearance of each of said old favourites was like wearing your old slippers and a big floppy jumper it was so familiar. New technologies were apparent which appeared side by side with 21st century mannerisms and behaviour yet there were many references to the previous films in the form of phrases, looks, actions or merely set design and props. There was also much humour, at points the audience were laughing out loud. I watched this latest episode just after midnight and wondered if I would stay awake.......I never moved a muscle throughout and thoroughly approved of the huge round of applause that accompanied the closing credits. Only one character I must bring to your attention........the new droid BB8......I want to take him home!

Star Wars have awakened,"1977 people saw for the first time the big title of Star Wars on the big screen, and after Star Wars: The Revenge of The Sith came out 2005 the world known franchise went disappearing. I saw The Force Awakened 2015 on its premiere night and it was clear that people had been waiting long for Star Wars to return to the big screen, and there is no doubt that J.J Abrams must have felt much pressure taking this franchise back to the big screen as it is certainly one of the most loved and respected movie franchises in the world.Much has changed between 1977-2015 and the world we humans live in daily have changed much both for good and for bad. But one of the great changes that have happened in the world is that women and colored people are allowed a bigger role in movie production both in front of the camera and behind it.To see Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the two main protagonists was an amazing experience as they both looked like they truly enjoyed themselves and both delivered their performances with nothing but excellence. Adam Driver also delivered a solid performance and it was a complete joy to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher return to the big screen and to the galaxy far far away. The movie itself was an amazing space adventure form the beginning to end and I thought that J.J Abrams really captured the magic and feeling of Star Wars just as George Lucas did for the first time in 1977.The movie had a very good balance and it had many things that could be enjoyed by the longtime fans but also much new for the new generation whom some witnessed Star Wars for the first time.And yeah I'll admit it. I was one of those guys who suddenly ""got something in his eye"" when Han Solo & Chewbacca came into the shot and Han said: ""Chewie we're home""A must see for all fans of space adventure and definitely for all who love Star Wars!10/10 Amazing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why Star Wars: The Force Awakens succeeds (NO SPOILERS),"While there won't be any spoilers here, you may want to not read this if you haven't yet seen the film and you're wanting to have a truly unbiased first viewing.First of all, storytelling thing here. What makes the best story? One that leaves you asking questions. It's what pulls you in as a reader/watcher and makes you invested in the environment/world the story takes place in. This is why, in part, Star Wars (1977) did so well. It left you asking questions, like:The Empire? what's that?whats a lightsaber? (that was a question at one point) who are the jedi?who are Luke's parents? why does this Ben dude know him?what's the rebellion? how did this all start?han solo himself, an air of mysteryvarious questions raised by the size of the universe, planets, alien species, etcThen there's the steampunk feel of the original Star Wars movies.tatooine: dirty, gritty, old, broken, bleak, organic, rusteddeath star: shiny, metallic, obsidian, visual weightforest places: wooden, organic, stoneoverall: things built into the environment, like Luke's home on tattoine and the yavin 4 base/templeThen story/character development: lost, isolated, ""nobody"" characters getting swept up into a larger story and finding purpose, meaning, and hope. You might even say destiny. A small subset of this was the consistent casting of up-and-coming/no-name actors as the character leads in the following films.In my opinion, all of the above is what DEFINES Star Wars. This is why, when they announced the new films in 2012, I was particularly interested in seeing them hold to these ideals. As I followed the production process, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to those ideals, or at least hopefully wayyyyyyy more than Lucas' prequel trilogy.Going into the new film, I was mostly concerned with them capturing the look and feel of the original movies. I determined that if they got that right, the story could be appreciated more. Since they got Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the Empire Strikes Back, my favorite movie) on board with writing credits along with JJ Abrams and Michael Arndt (both huge Star Wars fans), I was less concerned with the story they wrote than they means they chose to convey it. I was a little concerned about the reprisal of characters from the original trilogy that are WELL on in years, but I didn't put much thought into it because I knew the story wasn't going to be about them.I'm happy to say: JJ ABRAMS AND CO DID NOT LET US DOWN.The look and feel of the original movies has been captured here. They built real sets and props, by hand, but weren't afraid to lean on the use of digital technology as needed. The result is a movie filled with gritty, organic places that just plain and simple...feel real. The digital effects, are soooooooo good too. Probably the most real-looking lightsaber effects I've ever seen.The newest cast members, while no-namers, are FANTASTIC. The older actors really shine through as well, a lot more than I thought, honestly. Especially Harrison Ford, he really manages to still capture the same spirit that makes him Han Solo, despite being considerably older.The new story raises plenty of questions as well, really setting the stage for the following films and what's to come. But, as I've hinted at, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the film on the look and feel alone.Let's also not forget NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. The newest John Williams score is fantastic, and is essential to capturing the magic of what Star Wars feels like. The only criticism I have for the OST release is that we don't get to hear the main character themes fleshed out quite as much as we do in the movie, mostly cause of the prevalence of action-carrying motifs and sequences.I give it a 10/10, some people might give it 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Basics,"Being a fan of the original Star Wars films, and then having the franchise all but ruin it with I, II, and III, I had high expectations with this film. But with J.J. Abrams and Disney, they came in swinging, and hit a home run. The story line goes back to the basics of what made the original excellent! It had an ""old Star Wars"" feel from the beginning, and that was just perfect! We saw old friends, and met new ones. There were twists, moments revealed, moments of shock, moments of cheering. The writing was excellent and I thought they played the story out well enough to give you enough of a taste to fill your empty Star Wars stomach. At the end of the movie I wanted to jump up for joy - but as it was the entire audience cheered, and whooped, and fell in love with Star Wars all over again.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Star Wars: The Force AwakensDespite its liberation years ago, the Galaxy is once more under the control of a new Sith Lord: Darth Disney.And while the Dark Mouse doesn't make an appearance in this sci-fi movie, his presence is felt.A forager, Rey (Daisy Ridley), befriends a droid transporting the whereabouts of the last Jedi (Mark Hamill) to the resistance General (Carrie Fisher). But an overzealous member of The First Order (Adam Driver) wants the droid too, so Rey must flee with help from an ex-stormtrooper (John Boyega).Later, they align themselves with a grizzled smuggler (Harrison Ford) with knowledge of Rey's newfound abilities.With stunning effects and organic worlds, Disney's continuation returns the franchise back to basics.Unfortunately, that also includes familiar menaces, similar plot points and a plagiaristic ending.

Fresh and as exciting as watching the first Star Wars 38 Years Ago,"Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between.Probably makes me a geek & definitely a Star Wars fan, however I did go to this viewing with some trepidation. New director, main characters, different studio.... could they keep it fresh and maintain the well worked recipe of success the previous six, George Lucas had conjured up?The answer is J. J. Abrams & crew produced a total success,obviously created with love and affection of watching previous versions. Great story with continuity of the Star Wars saga, new graphics / CGI, but with a perfect blend of old characters with new, yet the familiar Star Wars places and technology.A must see on the big screen, especially in 3d, for young and old whether a fan of the previous films or not.

"Thrill, Excitement and Magic","I wasn't around yet when the Original Trilogy was in the cinema's. I discovered the stories on my on the television in the living room of my parental house.

I remember every detail of the feelings I got from discovering Darth Vader was Luke's Father. I remember the death of old Ben and Anakin more than all the fighting scenes.The magic wasn't there with the Special Editions. I saw them all on the big screen and enjoyed them, but they weren't magical.The prequels did the same to me. I was thrilled, I looked forward to them, but they gave me no feelings, no emotions, only thrill and excitement. They lacked the emotion from the Original Trilogy.Today I felt the original emotion again I got when I was young. It wasn't just thrill or excitement; it felt like coming home. There was a lot of emotion. I didn't feel dragged in a rush for action, there was time to cope with the feelings brought to you on the screen. But most of all there was the magic again.

"It's STAR WARS, jerks!!","This movie was tremendous. After the first 40 minutes, I was glued to my seat, mainly because the theater staff did a bad job cleaning up after the previous screening. But still, I found myself totally engrossed in this adventure before realizing what was ahead... the original cast!! For the first time in over 30 years, I was actually able to be reunited with the set of iconic characters who'd been such a huge part of my young life. I don't care if this story was in some ways a rehash of the original Star Wars. After years of being mired in prequel hell, it was just so great to watch the characters I could root for again. And the new characters are interesting, funny, and charming as well. Besides, if you're gonna rehash any movie, Star Wars is a great pick!!
So what the hell is everybody's problem??

A worthy sequel worth loving!!!,"I will not spoil anything, don't worry!I've been a fan since 1977,when I saw the original Star Wars with my dad at a cinema theater (exactly where I actually 20 years later would eat lunch with David Prowse...but that's another story!). It changed me from a 7-year old kid to a 7-year old film fan! And, for sentimental and nostalgic reason, nothing can be compared to the original trilogy (1977-1983) if you ask me!Still, I ""kind of"" like the prequel trilogy (1999-2005), even if it can't be compared to the original ones. Maybe a generation thing but they lacked ""fascination"".BUT the new sequel trilogy is on a whole different level! It IS really good! Damn good!!! Why? Because the script has ""feeling"", it introduces new characters that I care for - and that is the most important thing! It's a great script - told with speed like a roller-coaster but JJ Abrams is never forgetting the drama!It's not easy (duuh!) to fulfill all our fan dreams, it's impossible, but hell this is making me long already for the next Episode 8! You understand when you've seen it!Harrison Ford is my favorite actor of all time, actually since 1977 when I first saw Han Solo in action chasing those stormtroopers...so of course it's great to see him return to that galaxy far away a long ago! THAT alone got me SO excited! Hell, the whole planet loves Harrison Ford as Han Solo! He is still going strong, making me wish and hope for INDY 5! Harrison Ford delivers a surprisingly new depth to the saga, he is just great and give the aging Han Solo more ""weight"" (no, he is still in good shape dammit, but you know what I mean!)...but as we all (should) understand this new sequel trilogy is not about the old characters, they are just the link to the new ones. I understand that. Everyone watching it, with certain nostalgic expectations, MUST understand that!Because, seriously,the new star of the Star Wars Saga is the (lovely!) Rey!!! She is just awesome!!! Really really AWESOME!!! I can't believe it, she is the best, most well written female action hero ever!!! Yes! I kid you not. She is interesting and kicking ass! The beautiful and charismatic Daisy Ridley is a new favorite, a new star is born for sure!Hmm. It's night here in Sweden. And I realize now, as I write this about 14 hours after I've seen it here in Sweden, that it's just too much to talk about. So...if anyone is skeptical, just go and see it! I will actually see it again tomorrow - take that as a hint! ;)It's 10/10 for sure! The best film of the year for sure! A worthy sequel for sure! AND best of all, it makes me really honestly ""feel something"" again for this beloved saga, for the first time since 1983!So, yes, the force is wide awake again!!!

A slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series.,"I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of ""The Force Awakens""-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Twizard Rating: 100,"The good news is you don't really need to watch the original Star Wars films in order to follow along with this film. But then honestly, why wouldn't you have seen the original Star Wars films? Star Wars is really an amazing franchise, starting in 1977 with the very first film. Can you imagine watching that in its inception? All these years later, you're still in awe of the characters, the story, the effects, the set pieces--the whole universe. The sets don't even look that different in this one than the ones from the '70s. Yet, we're still in awe.Without giving too much away, Star Wars: The Force Awakens revolves around the First Order (the dark side) trying to control the galaxy while racing against the Resistance (the light side) to find the disappeared Luke Skywalker. The film mixes old characters with a band of new characters--characters that you're going to love--and doesn't stray from what was so charismatic about the original movies.The film truly has that classic feel to it--from the scene cuts to the camera-work to the dialogue. This isn't your Marvel movie, folks. In fact, it makes us rethink what exactly we love about those films to begin with. I mean, we have Star Wars back now. What more could we want? But there is a different kind of levity brought here that we actually may be able to actually thank Marvel for. It's not too much, but the perfect amount. In the originals, they would have never dared make light of any scene involving Darth Vader, but here we are given one surprising, yet heedful laugh during a bit that involves the neo-Darth Vader, Kylo Ren--who is just as bit of creepy and sinister as Vader.The newcomers, John Boyega as an ex-stormtrooper, Finn, and Daisy Ridley as a orphaned scavenger, Rey, will have no problems being the new faces of the franchise. Their characters have a lot of depth already, with much more yet to be explored.Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, and he's better than he's ever been. His performance is actually award-worthy. I mean, just give the guy an Oscar already (he's only had 1 nomination ever--seriously).And what is Star Wars without a couple twists? The ones that we're given are great, and you know they're stringing you along for more. They don't answer every question in this film. They answer a lot, but still leave you talking afterwards and speculating. It teaches us to be patient and we're surprisingly okay with that. The film doesn't give in to the immediate gratification that the Avengers culture usually demands.It runs at 135 minutes, but feels no longer than 100. The pacing is basically near-perfect, which attributes to it's deceptive length.I truly didn't want it to end. It's the year's best film and perhaps the best one I've seen in at least 5 years. It gave me the happy chills about eleven different times. I can't even begin to explain how good it is. I guess you're just going to have to see it for yourself. Who am I kidding? Everyone's about to watch this movie. But that's Star Wars for ya.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
STAR WARS IS BACK!!!,"A perfect beginning. I remember when the trailer of this came out. I was so hyped. ""STAR WARS IS BACK!!"" I said, and I was right. This movie is what star wars is about. And I never quite understood the ""A New Hope Rehash"" comments. Sure I get it sometimes. But come on, this is Star Wars. Most of the times the basic concepts are the same. Villain, hero, wise master who guides hero, end fight with fighters. Also the death of one character didn't feel forced, it felt right for the character and i love it.

"Recycled and uninspired,","I feel like writers and directors who are attached to big name revivals of some of histories greatest cinematic entries, don't even bother to watch the originals and try to improve upon them.This movie, without adding a bunch of spoilers, barely... and i mean BARELY... separates itself from the previous entries in this movie, by failing to come up with anything original in the Star Wars universe. JJ Abrams (although I'm sure he put a lot of effort into this film) smashes his style into as much of the opening 15 minutes of this movie as possible (with lens flares galore), and perhaps due to advice from his studio, tones it down and tries to match the feel and nostalgia of the originals for the remainder of the film. He didn't succeed.Plot wise, the whole film is a carbon copy of Episode 4: A New Hope event for event. There are VERY few original scenes, even though I know a few were trying to pay homage to the first three films (like the canteen for instance), and the giant star-killer death-star planet thingy, but couldn't they have finally gone in a different direction? . Why copy something when you can inspire a new and different understanding? The only thing that makes this movie different at all is the dialogue, but there are so many terrible holes in the plot, unexplained scene changes and co-incidental events, that true fans will be frustrated by the end of this film.Personally, I found the characters in this movie much too similar to others from the series. Many of the new characters are just recycled husks from the previous films. The lead, a young girl stranded on a desert planet, hoping to one day leave and find her purpose (change the gender, and there's Luke), a young man struggling with the dark side within himself and sides with the imperialists (Ren literally trying to be Anakin throughout the film), a loud mouthed cocky fighter pilot (a Han wannabee), and of course there has got to be some comic relief, so they give us an imperial janitor turned soldier, who has plenty of attitude and stumbles his way through most of the battles (Finn = the new Jar Jar).Criticism aside, I'm sure people will think I'm being harsh, but think about this: The original trilogy was something that has lasted the test of time, and the prequels (although some are terrible) are still Lucas's story. This film is something else entirely. Another director with permission to tell another man's story... and it feels exactly like it. A version of events told by someone who wasn't there, rather than from the witness himself. Like when your best friend tells you a story you told him only the week before. You smile, but you also want to punch him in the face for stealing it. Abrams bring nothing new in this film, when he could have focused more than just the plight of the Rebelion again.This movie is only slightly better than Phantom Menace, and that's as good as I'm willing to go with this one. I certainly didn't leave the theater with the sense of excitement to see the next instalment in 2017...but I'll watch it, of course...6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Honestly a misunderstood Star Wars movie/trilogy,I just recently re-watched it force awakens and honestly the criticisms of the film are just bull crap specially the whole thing that feels like a new hope. It feels more like return of the Jedi but even then it's just a Star Wars movie it's ambition's the only criticism that really works is that sometimes it's to safe but it's really ambitious.sometimes people seem to forgot tiny details especially about things that don't match with there bias/head canon. There's like a lot foreshadowing people miss especially with snoke like most theories that are about him were trash . A great start to a good/great trilogy.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars is back with a vengeance!,"Set many years after Return of the Jedi this continues the story, introducing us to new characters as well as bringing back some of the old.Visually stunning, the studio continues to refine their special effects.

JJ Abrams made Star  Wars cool again!,"JJ made something that previous trilogy missed; strong characters! Star Wars are back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are future of saga! BB-8 had same effect that R2D2 had in original trilogy and known characters fit in well.Maybe Adam Driver as Kylo Ren wasn't something that I am thrilled about, but it's probably because of bias I have about him (watching ""Girls""). But generally I think he will be okay in the next movies in this trilogy.All in all, Star Wars are back to its best! Pure 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The force definitely strong with this one,"I will warn you all now that I am a little bit biased when it comes to Star Wars. But not even I can fully defend the prequel trilogy. There were some good moments in and acting them (McGregor for one). But they were in essence just about trying to tell us what we already knew i.e. that Darth Vader was going to the dark side. Not much more was gained than that unfortunately.So 32 years after what I would consider the last really good star wars film (Return of the Jedi), The Force Awakens(TFA) has been released, but is it actually any good. Well from my already stated viewpoint (A bit biased) I would say it was absolutely brilliant. I will not give any spoilers away today. Another review will be coming next week after my 2nd viewing. So this review will just cover basics about the Director, cast etc.When I heard that J.J. Abrams was hired as the director I was very happy. Though some people (Mainly Trekkies) did not like his take on Star Trek, I thought they were very good re-envisioned films. I also like most of what he did on Lost. You can tell he decided to make the films as Lucas did with the original films and should have done the prequels i.e. with some TLC. From having an actual Millennium Falcon built to using actual locations as per the original and not all CGI led. Most importantly, He hired Lawrence Kasdan (responsible for scripting Empire Strike Back), this was a master stroke as this guy knows how to write a good script. The vistas are also beautiful thanks to cinematographer Daniel Mindel.The sound effects and the score (John Williams) is as ever brilliant. In fact Williams score is one of the things that is great about the prequels and he does not disappoint again here and is one area that may get an Oscar nod along with special effects and cinematography.The most important part (along with the script) Abram's had to play along with the producers was to hire a good cast. This is an area I was very worried about as Lucas got this very wrong with his main character on 2 occasions in the prequels. Both Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen were poor as Anakin. Here in TFA there are lots of new characters, so trying to blend them all in with the older established characters (Han, Leia et al), would not be an easy task.I am very happy to say that casting is not an issue. From 2 young British actors in Daisy Ridley and John Boyega (Attack the Block) as well as Oscar Isaac (Ex Machina), to the more established Ford and Fisher. They even manage to fit in a General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson (also Ex Machina and Harry Potter)), to keep me happy.It is plain to see that there is brilliant chemistry between the cast, it is difficult to fake that on-screen. I have sometimes found Ford looking disinterested in recent roles, but there must be something about the role of Solo that has brought the best out in him again as he was excellent, he with Ridley and Boyega are the stand-outs for me (On the Light-side anyway). Though Isaac is again brilliant as he in most of his films. One final mention has to also go to Adam Driver as Kylo Ren (TFA's villain), I will go more into his performance in part two if this review next week. But suffice to say he is an excellent heir to Vader and he also has a great lightsaber :).I would highly recommend going to the to see this (Though maybe not at midnight), its one of those films that needs to be seen in the cinema. It is a fun thrill ride of a movie with all the right Star Wars ingredients. Yes it does pander a little bit to fans (That's the only spoiler I will give), but there is plenty here for all to enjoy and love. The one issue you may have is you will most likely have to have seen the original trilogy before coming to see this (If you haven't already).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wake up!!!,"The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent.The scenery was so amazing, and the new planets, while the terrain was not exactly original, Jakku was kind of a clone to Tatooine, but the village was vastly different to that of anything from the originals, or the prequels. If the fans will be very honest with themselves, these planets were refreshing in a very, very grim way.Then there's the story, while it was not entirely original, it did bring about the necessary setting and development to help us along with our new characters and their full introductions, as well as a deeper look into their psyches. Not to mention a revisit from our main cast in the originals. Though it may seem a little forced (no pun intended), it did not hinder the story in any way, in fact much of it was very much needed.The film itself was gripping in every positive manner, and there were even some genuinely hysterical moments! It didn't need to dumb it down for children, as there is proof that even some of the younger kids liked, even loved this movie, and there were sounds of begging for their mothers to bring them back to see it again. Take that Jar Jar, you old HACK!Now, let's get down to brass tax, was it good? Yes. Was it great? YES! Was it as good as the first one? Well, break my skull if you want, but YES YES YES it was actually just as good as the first trilogy, and that is coming from someone who grew up with the original trilogy on VHS. It was amazing. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in theaters, and own it on Blu-Ray, and we much NOT let that chance get away from us. So what are you doing still reading this review? GO SEE IT!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Chewie, We're Home""","After first leaving Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I remarked that it was the most fun I had watching a movie since first seeing a VHS copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark at age eight. (Though in truth I couldn't decide between Raiders, or The Empire Strikes Back which I saw the same year - unaltered.) The next morning, I stand by this statement.I had to pee for the entire last hour of the movie, and didn't even entertain the idea that I would get up and go to the bathroom. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a gripping, action adventure packed spectacle.The Force Awakens hits the big screen ten years after 2005's Revenge of the Sith. Yet, it shares it's true cinematic lineage with the earlier films ending in 1983. Because while the prequels felt like drawn out space soap operas, The Force Awakens actually feels like Star Wars.This overall ""feeling"" is caused by a number of reasons. The settings and locations are littered with creatures that look and feel like Star Wars baddies. The action, large space battles and tight shoot-outs alike, share the same fantastical charm of the originals. The more personal battles especially feel right here, with the perfect blend of practical effects and added visual flare. Gone are the prequel days of meaningless rubber-band cgi Jedi, the lightsaber battles feel real again!It's not just the way the movie looks either, the script is top notch, well specifically the dialogue and themes. The moments that unravel in the film are superb. Each perilous snapshot is so fun that you think it can't get any better, and it always does. The dialogue matches these moments perfectly. Frequent and hilarious one liners make a comeback, but never veer toward being overboard. When the movie takes more serious paths, the dialogue is there to match it. The dramatic dialogue is never overdone like in Attack of the Clones' ""I hate sand"" speech.The plot, is the weak point here. The truth, please don't kill me fan boys, is that Star Wars never had the best plots. Even the original movie expects us to believe that two droids crash land on a planet that just happens to have not only one of the last Jedis, but also the son of Darth Vader? It works, because it's awesome, but it doesn't mean it's very logical. So in The Force Awakens, no the plot isn't it's strong suit. There are minor plot inconsistencies and leaps of faith, but really who cares?The cast, which is thoroughly excellent, is genius and is the corner stone to how the movie comes together so well.As was heavily publicized, much of the original cast shows up this time around. Carrie Fisher reprises her role as Leia, in a depiction that feels right for the character and received loud applause from the audience. Both droids, C-3P0 and R2-D2 return again as well, albeit for much less screen time than they had in the original trilogy. (BTW, With the shoehorning they received in the prequel trilogy, especially in the case of an Anakin-as-a-child-built- Threepio, this makes them the last remaining characters to appear in every single Star Wars movie to date.) Luke Skywalker is mentioned throughout, including the opening scroll, however it's best to keep his role, if any, a secret. Rounding out the list of returning characters is Chewbacca and a certain calamari admiral, who are both great. Oh and then there's...Han Solo. Played by Harrison Ford, Solo is back and he steals the show. Ford returned to the iconic role of Indiana Jones in 2007's, meh-""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" but in this movie, eight years after that one, Ford feels twenty years younger and brings the role of Han Solo to life perfectly. The swagger, the dialogue, the look; are all portrayed expertly here by Ford and truly gives the character the right feel. Love it.Of the newcomers on the light side we have Rey, who is my favorite. Played by Daisy Ridley, her character is the most intriguing and gives interesting possibilities moving forward. John Boyega's Finn is also great. Here we see a good example of a protagonist the audience can connect with, feeling lost in a strange world. (Something the prequels were sorely lacking) Last of the three is Poe Dameron, played by Oscar Isaac. Dameron seems to be the most underutilized, hopefully meaning a much bigger role in the upcoming movies. We also have some others, such as Lupita Nyong'o as Maz, which was not all that memorable.On the villains side we have an equally amazing cast. Chief bad guy with a black cape this time around, Kylo Ren is played expertly by Adam Driver. I was a bit worried initially with his very Vader-esque appearance and reliance on old tropes, however he put my worries at ease with an excellent portrayal of a dark-sider struggling to find his place in the ways of the force. Supreme Leader Snoke, portrayed by the always ingenious Andy Serkis, was (to me) a mixed bag but presents good possibilities leading forward. The biggest surprise came from the excellent Domhnall Gleeson, who portrays the evil General Hux. Here we see the calm evil nature of the original Generall Tarkin repeating itself.Anyway I could go on and on, but it's simple. If you love Star Wars then go see it immediately. If you don't love Star Wars, then you are a sick person who needs helps so really I'm not qualified to give you advice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A gorgeous disappointment.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was an auditory and visual masterpiece. Unfortunately it was ruined by poor acting, poor actor choice, and a story that felt rushed and didn't make much sense when taking into account the previous movies and the lore of the series as a whole.I will now briefly list a few of this movie's most glaring issues: First of all, Kylo Ren just isn't as intimidating with his mask off. Secondly, When did Rey and Finn learn how to use a lightsaber? Thirdly, Luke lost his father's lightsaber in The Empire Strikes Back. And Finally, way too many potentially interesting characters were introduced all at once, giving the main characters not enough screen time to make me actually care about them.All in all, an absolutely beautiful sandwich that doesn't taste nearly as good as it looks or smells.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Overly familiar, flawed, but tons of fun!","First of all, I will say this movie is great fun. Abrams does a great job with the action scenes and the pace is great. Rey is perhaps the greatest character in the series so far, I thought she was even better than Han Solo. Also I think Kylo Ren is a great character.So yes, the movie is a great experience and absolutely worth seeing, but there are a lot of problems, the major one being how familiar it is. From the first scene of the film, beats and plot points feel extremely familiar to the OT. The movie tries so hard to be the originals that it never really establishes anything new. People accusing it of being a remake are not as far off as I would like to say. I was also disappointed with the character of Finn, Boyega does a great job, but his character is a bit all over the place and extremely underdeveloped. Felt almost more like comic relief than anything which is a shame as he is almost a lead character. That's all I will say, there are more flaws, but they generally involve plot points and spoilers.

Worth waiting for,"1977 i was 8. In Sweden u needed to be 11 to see the first one. Since then i've seen all the movies several times. Been waiting many years for this seventh movie and was expecting a lot. I got it all and maybe even more than i expected. The first 90 minutes was extremely enjoyable and the spirit of the Star Wars galaxy was all around with quite a few quiet laughs in the audience when certain scenes provided items from the past. A strong performance from all of the new young lead characters and an OK from the older ones. Time cant pass quick enough until the next part in the saga has premiere, still a lot of marvelous scenes to expect from part 8 and 9.

Just go watch it, if you are a fan of star wars and have knowledge of the first trilogy (you will need it), go watch it, if you are new to star wars... you are so gonna be hooked. New Heroes, Old heroes all lovable and doing credit to this fantastic franchise. CGI are awesome especially combat scene, but what was the best part of it? The awaken... The awaken of what? Well, you'll have to see it to answer this question. What I am sure about, it's the awaken of a new trilogy, mark my word.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a load of crap!,"Lousy movie, stupid, shallow, even more childish than ever. Same sh@t, different outdated gimmicks piled on an ancient concept that never evolved to graduate from a child care center.The young black actor, John Boyega, is a terrible cast and a very bad actor, looks stupid and very unlikable. Since Obama, Hollywood and TV industries had stupidly jumped on the Politically Correct Wagon, putting many unnecessary and inappropriate black actors as leading roles. This young guy's face looked just retarded and moronically pathetic! His acting in this film had undoubtedly further jeopardized this already childish film even more painful to watch.Another politically correct must-have role was the white female leading role to match up the black role for the inter-racial relationship and/or romance is cool social agenda and the feminine and the women rights is the right time to join together with the ever demanding minority rights. By using this film to tell the public that these two minorities are far superior to the dominant white majority power.This Star Wars new flick just looked very childish and outdated with laughable story-line and scenarios, the screenplay looked like written by a bunch of Star Wars fans in junior high or high school dropouts, patching up a half-baked childish game plan to fool around.The graphics and special effects in this lousy film also looked terribly outdated and primitive, just blindly borrowed from the old flicks and never renewed even a bit. The only change was the rolling new droid. Nothing more and nothing else.Verdict: What a bomber!

Out of this world!,"This film generates interest in the minds of fantasy lovers from all generations. You do not need to be a fan of Star Wars to experience the hysteria and utmost joy that this movie allows a movie goer to appreciate. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not simply a movie created for the box office, nor was it created for Star Wars fans. This movie is the seventh installment for the hype that Star Wars has developed over the years. Star Wars: The Force Awakens proves yet again that cinema is not just a movie, but a culture. This movie allows all of its audience to remain on the edge of their seats and experience a roller coaster of emotions in each and every scene.

Star Wars is back,"Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams have delivered the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and it may be the best one ever. This is the Star Wars movie fans in 2015 have longed for.All of the actors knocked it out of the park. Daisy Ridley was wonderful as the lead. John Boyega had a great mix of confidence and reluctance. I wasn't expecting to care much for Oscar Isaac's character, but I was pleasantly surprised at how likable he was.Adam Driver: wow! I loved the inner conflict he brought. The fact that he lost his temper a couple of times was great. You feel like anything is possible with a villain like that. Unlike Hayden Christiansen who came across as a whiny, baby in the prequels, Driver plays it wonderfully.This movie had the perfect blend of drama, humor, and action. The humor was more in line with the original trilogy, but slightly updated for a modern age. The action was the same as the humor in that it felt like the original trilogy but was slightly updated; there were some great action shots like the Millennium Falcon grazing the sand during takeoff on Jakku and the turnaround the Falcon made just before it went into the exhaust port on an old Imperial ship.I have so many thoughts about this movie, and I can probably articulate them more completely after I've had a second viewing. For now, I'll just say that Star Wars is back, and not in the sad, pathetic way it was back in 1999, 2002, and 2005; I mean it is really back!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago,"As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the future of film making looks depressing,"my god has the bar for film making today become so low and more importantly the bar for making a good star wars film become that low after the disappointing prequels that so many people actually really like and appreciate this poor excuse for a film (poor remake of the first film and bits taken from empire talk about no new original ideas, forced clunky dialogue that was embarrassing, forced humour that took away any depth and substance to many scenes and pretty much the whole tone of the film, forced introductions of legacy characters and forced interactions between the legacy characters that where cringe worthy to have to sit through, not to mention new characters that looked like teenagers to appeal to the younger and newer audience that made it feel more like harry potter twilight and hunger games than star wars which of course was the intention as those other film franchises made money must play it safe now although there is playing it safe and just copying), I so fear for the future of the film industry and the future of star wars and the direction that both are heading or maybe just maybe that I am already living that shallow soulless cooperate future here now in the present and have been for some time and have only now just woken up probably to late which i take full responsibility for. has or will anyone else awaken ?

For the third time we are treated to a Death Star but its called a Star-killer and its a planet this time that drains Suns.As a result i felt no suspense, no awe and worst of all no interest for this movie. This movie felt like a Star Wars movie ill give it that, but it also felt extremely lazy, the easy option for Disney in this situation would be to pander to the Nostalgia crowd. They certainly did not waste that opportunity.If your part of the crowd that just wants to see Han Solo fly the Millennium falcon, bring up lines like the Kessel Run, cheap star wars humour and decent star wars visuals than this movie is great for you.

Don't give in to hate!,"I seriously don't understand all the negative reviews on here. People who claim to be Star Wars fans are giving this movie a score lower than the average rating of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This movie is not only competently made, it is filled with wonderful, interesting new characters and breathtaking action sequences. The story has real heart. I was completely captivated and along for the ride within the first few minutes of the film. Folks are complaining of too many call backs to the original trilogy. Some very small elements are admittedly a little over the top, but the nods to the past are implemented with infinitely greater taste than than they were in the prequels. If you're a fan of the original films then you will love this movie. If you're obsessed with the extended universe and are butt-hurt that they killed it off, then no movie made 30 years after the originals will ever satisfy you. Turn off your computer and go read your Star Wars books. You're blood pressure will thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A remake of episode IV,"Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in ""New Hope"" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships.Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so.Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the ""Return of the Jedi"". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight.Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of ""Revenge of the Sith""'s final act.Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure.Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This viewer is in neither the ""love it"" nor the ""loathe it"" camp.","Basically adequate reboot of this legendary film series offers up a reasonably entertaining story, but one without much resonance. The special effects often tend to take over, and there's not really that much threat from the villains on hand. While it is a treat to see veterans of the franchise return to their beloved roles, they mostly take a back seat to the new characters. Yes, the yarn concocted here by director J.J. Abrams and original series screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan feels awfully familiar at times; there's no denying that. ""The Force Awakens"" also tends to get a little overly precious, as it concerns the new droid character BB-8.30 years after the Rebels helped to eliminate the Empire and destroy their second Death Star, a new evil entity has emerged to take the Empires' place. They're the ""First Order"", and one of their number is a moody young Jedi named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Not helping matters is the fact that original hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has disappeared at this time when he's needed the most. The Rebels are now re-christened The Resistance, and Leia, now a general with this organization, seeks to find her missing brother. Drawn into the fray are Finn (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block""), a former Stormtrooper who experienced a change of heart, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger.""The Force Awakens"" yields adequate entertainment, and attempts to deliver some genuine emotion, but it fails to be completely engaging. It's got a breathless pace to it, and lots of action. The cast features a number of familiar faces, but they've been better utilized in other things. Harrison Fords' Han Solo, who's gone back to his mercenary ways, gets the lions' share of screen time compared to his fellow alumni of Episodes IV to VI. He, at least, is in fine form. But Kylo Ren is an underwhelming villain, as is the all-powerful figure Snoke from whom he takes his orders. He's a pipsqueak compared to Darth Vader. It's also a real shame to have the legendary Max von Sydow on hand in the opening minutes, in such a regrettably brief cameo appearance. Fortunately, Boyega and Ridley are appealing heroes and anchor this stage of the saga pretty well. And the expected abundance of CGI is complemented by a respectable amount of practical effects.Overall, a well intentioned but uninspired continuation of Episodes I to VI.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Star Wars movie,"Great plot, great actors, everything is so amazing",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In short, A New Hope patch 2.0","Disney decided to tread safely, and financially, it makes absolute sense. The problem is, art always suffers from ""safe"". Then again, if you want art, don't seek it in a blockbuster. On the other hand, the reason Star Wars is so popular is because one guy decided to risk, mixing art with pop culture and risked again years later, introducing Shakespearean moral themes, deliberately strange dialogue reflecting Homer's techniques used in his epics to convey ""hidden"" messages to further emphasize the passive precognition of the Jedi. Not all the risks pay off or are noticed. Still, an artist takes those risks, and for that I am grateful they were taken by Lucas. Disney's approach on the other hand, while does have good elements in it, ultimately feels shallow.The pacing of the movie is perfect. It never drags; it always holds you interested, even if you have no prior knowledge of the universe. No fight scene takes too long or feels too short and the movie takes its time to describe locations, providing a well-developed atmosphere.For the first time ever I see a lead female character in this genre to be interesting because of what she does and how she develops as a character, not because of how archetypically feminine she should be.I like that the antagonist is of the ""same level"" as the protagonists. The movie creates an antithesis, pondering ""what if the bad guy was just another ""Joe"", seemingly powerful, yet growing simultaneously with the good guys"", showing us what is to make a conscious decision to follow the dark side, much similar to Luke's decisions to follow the path of the Jedi. He is powerful but has no control of himself and is emotionally unstable, all traits that are very welcome.The ""interrogation scene"" is absolutely brilliant and has one of the best displays of Force powers in any Star Wars film. The pacing, the dialog, the emotions, the atmosphere, everything about this scene is really magnificent.I always viewed the droids as filler characters, homage to Akira Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress. This time, the new droid is something I enjoyed. Just a simple moving ball, but manages to carry a pet-like emotional quality, in contrast to the two original droids which were there because we just had to put them in.Finn is a much welcome character. He never does anything spectacular, and that is the point. His role is to be surpassed by all the others, yet choose the right things to do, time and again, despite his odds being not that great. It shows strength to decide the difficult, albeit moral path, knowing that everything around you points to the fundamentally opposite decision.Battles don't feel sterile, choreographed, but interesting and intense. The lightsabre duels look raw, the participants untrained, lacking skill, which works brilliantly in the movie.I understand that Disney wants to milk the original trilogy cow, but that went a little too far. I don't need A New Hope patch 2.0. I've seen that already. You want certain elements to return? Fine, do you have to literally return to exactly the same things we saw back then just because ""they look cool""?""Looking cool"" is my biggest problem with this movie. Showing us the same but different ruins all the good elements mentioned above. You weren't afraid to risk showing us a troubled ""kid"" behind a mask, yet thought it would be great for us to see another rendition of the ""Death Star"" trench run?The only reason Han, Leia, Luke, Chewie, the whole ""Empire vs Rebels 2.0"" are in this movie is for pure fan service; unnecessary to a plot, which would have been otherwise very fine with the new characters alone. Some new characters suffer from being forced to remind us the old, like Poe (a bloke with no development that shoots at stuff with precision) and captain Phasma (the only skill she displays, other than looking menacing in a chrome armour, is remembering Finn's number correctly. Seriously, that is all she does).We most certainly don't need a family tie-in for the sake of there being one, especially as bluntly delivered as it was, halfway through the movie with no emotional weight, supposedly to show ""deliberate choice"".For the cinematography versed, Star Wars has a signature camera movement in all six films: passive and slow. This is deliberate to show us the movies from the ""point of view"" of the Force, to emphasize at the antithesis between the intensity of the events and the serene, almost indifferent flow of the Force that is ever-present, yet non interfering. Abrams did not respect that in favour of an action-oriented shaky-cam style over substance.The true disappointment comes from the film's music. Not a single memorable theme. That was a big let-down.In the end, is it any good? It depends on your definition of ""good"". Would you buy vinyl because you have a good audio system and want to listen to high fidelity analogue music; or would you buy digitally recorded, compressed audio on vinyl to play on a system that ""looks retro"" but is made for mp3? In other words, if you want to see ""hipster"" Star Wars, yes, it is very good. I can, with certainty say it is exactly the movie all the ""Lucas-bashing, original trilogy worshipers for the wrong reasons"" deserve to see.My wife enjoyed it, and I don't see why she shouldn't have. My wife, however, is not a Star Wars fan and couldn't care less, she just wanted to have a good time, so take what you want from this statement. If ""having a good time"" is your primary reason for seeing it, yes, you will have a good time.

The Force Awakens captures the Spirit and Magic of Star Wars,"In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure.The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it.

A great movie,A good start for the sequel trilogy keep up the good work,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The brand is strong with this one. 65%,"""Star Wars: The force awakens"" could easily be retitled ""Star Wars: The next generation"" because this long time coming sequel to the original trilogy introduces a new cast of characters, as well as some familiar ones. Providing a lot of fan service to those who've seen the original trilogy, those who see this new chapter in the franchise will find a lot of this fan service goes over their head if they haven't caught up with the original trilogy (a cynic might say that the movie is a rehash though). It seems pitched at a young audience at times ('cute' new robots etc.) but occasionally I'd say that the action is more suitable to young teenagers.I'll refrain from giving away too many details about this movie, apart from the basic plot concerning the search for Luke Skywalker (the hero of the original trilogy) in order to restore ""balance to the force""...or some such.Becoming a key player in the search for Luke is our heroine, young Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). She's not far from being this movie's analogue to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy, as in it seems to be her journey that we will be following the most, although other new characters are a focus of this movie. Rey comes across as potentially a character to root for but I'm not convinced that the story or script has done Daisy any justice in accomplishing this.Towards the end of the movie, it was tracking to score 60% but I quite liked the last 30 odd minutes of this movie and so pushed my score up to 65%. You can tell from that score that this movie didn't really excite me that much. Maybe that is due to it being a recycling of story and references from the original movie? No, not that. Here's my biggest fault for this film: it's designed to push your buttons, to manipulate you into a state of euphoria...and fails. It's this failure which sees my score so low. In other words, I don't have a problem with movies trying to push your buttons or to manipulate you...but please, just be good at what you're trying to do!The brand is strong with this one, though, as worldwide box office receipts are showing. Maybe this movie could become the highest grossing movie of all time...or enter the top 5 or even top 3 spots. That it's having this impact speaks volumes for the work of George Lucas, whose first movie in this franchise (""Star Wars: A new hope"", which is episode IV in the series!) created the ""Star Wars"" brand, from nothing. If that film had bombed at the box office, we'd have heard no more of this space opera.Maybe I'm nostalgic for the original trilogy and this colours my views on the revival of this franchise by Disney Inc.? I doubt it. Ordinarily, I don't see movies more than once, but I have returned to the original trilogy more than I have for most other movies (from memory, I've seen the first ever Star Wars movie maybe about half a dozen times or so). To tell you the truth, the prequels to Star Wars I've only ever seen once. They were that mediocre. ""The force awakens"" is roughly in the same league as the very last of the Star Wars prequels, and that was the only good one in that prequel trilogy. That being said, I can't imagine returning to this current movie. If this current movie repeats its founding movie's status as the highest grossing movie of all time, will it have the same repeat viewing value? THAT is the test of its worth, in my view. Lacks that, it does. Reminds me of those reports about blind taste test between various colas...when you know you're drinking Coke, you rate it the best, but when blindfolded, you prefer the taste of other colas...not even brand names, necessarily. I suspect that that's the case with this new Star Wars movie...the brand is selling it.The movie walks a tightrope between being ponderous (and therefore uninteresting) and intending to be euphoric with its action. Characters are 'hothoused' (like Rey) and not allowed to grow as characters over time. Other characters are foisted upon us with metaphorical cardboard signs around their necks, telling us how to relate to them. E.g. one X-wing fighter pilot is spotlighted as being ""the best pilot in the resistance"". As if we couldn't be SHOWN that. And what I did see wasn't that remarkable. There's a huge contrast between this tightrope balancing act when compared to the great TV shows of recent years...even shows which have no action to speak of, like Mad Men. Sure, nothing much thrilling happens, but it sure is engrossing. And even a great show like ""Dexter"" had some characters remain static for years, only to suddenly evolve to great effect near the end of the series. It's a pity that Rey's evolution was fast tracked.Back to failing to push the right buttons...the fate of one character should have moved me but...no...I was indifferent to it.A very minor gripe...the cheesy dissolves between scenes in this movie.I saw this movie in 3D. Barely noticed the effect...except for a few stunning scenes which demonstrated vast scales. It's a pity that more couldn't have been done with this, e.g. exploring the huge battle cruisers.Speaking of failing to manipulate...the final scene didn't even rate as unintentionally funny, with that long, soapy gaze from an old character.On a positive note, the villain of this piece becomes interestingly complex in the last 30 odd minutes of this film, contributing to my higher score.Lastly, I'm surprised that the bad guys don't go broke in this galaxy...expensive infrastructure is a favourite of theirs!Disney's Neverending Story? I may lose interest in this franchise at some point then.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Awakens With Joy,"I am coming from a place of honesty, and for some reason people just hate on other's opinions. Growing up with Star Wars since I was little, the franchise has held a special place in my heart. And as I grew up, I recognized there are flaws in both the original trilogy and the prequels.The sequels are by far no means perfect but that cannot take away from the love and dedication that a collaborative group of people made on screen in 2015. The Force Awakens might follow similar beats to the 1977 original but it is a film that truly captures the tone and hope that George Lucas created back 40 years prior.It seems cool now to hate Disney and what they did with this trilogy. Again, this is no perfect film and its sequels are not perfect either. But the rewatch-ability and the experience of seeing this film with multiple generations coming together in a theater will never be topped.The Force Awakens is not the best Star Wars movie but I think in a few years time... it will be looked on more fondly for the spark of excitement and wonder it created in the fandom upon first release.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I don't need to even provide spoilers because it was pretty obvious what was going to happen before it happened. I was incredibly disappointed but not surprised, seeing as the minute Disney bought this movie, all semblance of ""star wars"" was replaced with ""cash cow"".

OK let me break down my EXACT feeling through the movie...So it started off with a big nostalgic title STAR WARS EPISODE VII with its summary i felt pretty good, it was nostalgic and classic and i had no complaints or whatsoever and the movie began. it looked promising so i kept watching with high hopes and expectations (Im not gonna put the ACTUAL parts of the movie since i don't wanna give spoilers in case you wanna watch this abomination) and stuff happened droid ran with info of new and huge Death star (So far i was like 'okay i'll overlook that') and the environment was nice and kinda nostalgic but after a little bit i was like 'well this is kinda getting bad' , after a bit more later 'wat?' and really funky stuff started to happen i went 'this is awful, is this an attempt to make a remake or sequel?, either way it failed miserably' and closing down to 'final' act i was like 'please just end it or kill me' and after wards the movie ended and i woke up on my bed... nope sadly no.A more short and accurate version of my opinion would be: It tried to milk the fan base of the old movies, its pretty much a lousy and awful recap of episode IV and V. It tried make people feel see the movie as good by making them feel nostalgic, f.cked up the old characters(In a really dumb Way) and the ending was RIDICULOUS.This movie is just.....

The Geek Awakens,"OK, first thing's first, I wasn't too excited about the prospect of a new star wars movie back when it was first announced that they were planning to make another ""trilogy"". The original, episodes **IV-VI** as they are called now, were released at a time when I was just a rug rat. I got to watch them some time around the mid-80s as syndicated shows on local TV, then after wards on every format from Betamax to DVDs.They were awesome. It jump-started this kid's movie-watching habit. To experience them then, I would like to think, is similar to how it impacted the rest of the world when it first came out in cinemas. There were nothing like it before. Episodes IV-VI did to movie-making what **Jimi Hendrix**'s guitar-playing did to rock & roll and **Michael Jackson**'s *""Thriller""* album to the music business.Then came the prequels, which came out during my, let's say, formative years. This if you will, I'd like to compare to **Metallica**'s career back in the 90s with their *""Load""* and *""ReLoad""* albums. If you were also into them at some point in your life then you might get the analogy. If not, then it's suffice to say that the experience is kinda like having that ex- girlfriend whom you hated the most suddenly turn up and learning you had a kid with her. Nuff said.Now going back.So I really wasn't excited for a new **Star Wars** movie, let alone another trilogy. The announcement happened at a time when I was full-on geeking out with **Marvel** and its planned cinematic universe which was gradually building up. By this point, I felt that I've already outgrown the Star Wars franchise the way you outgrow **Mickey Mouse** or mainstream porn (whooops...).And so the years passed after the announcement and I wasn't really following any news or development regarding the new movie. But it didn't mean that I wasn't planning on seeing it. Let's just say I was more of just curious how it turns out, realizing that **Lucasfilm** and my beloved Marvel are now both under the **Disney** umbrella.So last night I finally got around to seeing it, braving a torrential Monsoon downpour and risk of catching the flu. And what do I think of it? Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back onboard. The force definitely awakened in this one.What the movie did is reconnected me to beloved characters which I thought were long buried beneath my stressed adult mind. During moments whenever the old characters share the screen with the new, so much unspoken history reverberates in the scene and fills the air that I wanted to cry. Our new generation of heroes in the form of **Rey**, **Finn**, and **Poe** definitely pass the coolness test for me. They have been weighed and found worthy to finally push those **Katnisses** and **Edward Cullens** off the Hollywood stage.Off with the trying-hard mythos of half-cooked contemporary fiction. Make way for the greatest fairy tale ever told in any generation. And you know what else this movie did? It's made light sabers fashionable again. X-wing/TIE fighter dogfights are freakin' awesome again. And death stars? Yes, obsolete but never uncool. Star-freakin-killer bases though? They're definitely the rebel-busting way to go.And so my attention is now divided between a universe of flying tin men and soldiers with shields instead of guns, and the continuing story of the most dysfunctional family in a galaxy far, far away. I'm geeking out on Star Wars all over again. This is such a good time to be a geek. I'm psyched. Now that the Star Wars franchise is in a lot better hands away from its daddy, the saga has taken on a form worth taking seriously again. And you know what? No lens flares from **JJ Abrams** in this movie. Amazing! Proof that Star Wars don't need no friggin lens flares. All it really needed was a dose of good characterization, permeating mystery, genuine laughs, and good ol' Millennium Falcon action.What did I like about the movie the most? Falling in love with Ray. I know. Finally, a character in the franchise that you can again root for. That was the problem with the prequels, you couldn't really root for anybody, not even **Obi Wan**. Back in the old trilogy, I had a childhood crush on **Leia** and was seriously jealous of **Han Solo**, and ergo, heavily sympathized with **Luke**. Then **Return Of The Jedi** made me all go, ""ewww, gross!"" with the whole fraternal twins reveal, but it's all good. With The Force Awakens I'm emotionally invested in the characters again. Everyone had a chance to shine, and Ray's was definitely the brightest. You'd want the series to continue just for her story alone and it would be enough. Same could be said about Finn or Poe, and it's all a good thing as well because we were given such great characters this time around.So far, it seems that the biggest criticism about the movie is that it was derivative of the original trilogy. To me, they felt more like tributes, which to a true fan, should have further enriched the experience of watching. It certainly did the job for me.There were also big questions raised, and some minor plot holes that needs filling, like the sudden turnaround of Finn early in the film. Another is Kylo Ren turning out to be just another delinquent kid with parent issues. But I'm not complaining. We're getting another trilogy after all, so mysteries are definitely essential and there's a lot of room for the next movies for villain development.All in all, it's a great feeling to finally have a new movie that's truly worthy of the franchise. **Star Wars: The Force Awakens** puts the meaning on why this movie franchise is called ""Star Wars"" in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back,"J.J. Abrams did a masterful job with this Star Wars films. I won't mention anything in the film. I'm mainly writing this in response to the huge amount of reviewers on this site that claim it is a terrible movie. You are either art house movie goons or you are an aspiring movie critic who thinks they are smarter than the masses(and real movie critics, who by the way loved the movie).The main complaints I see is that they think this film is a remake of the first Star Wars film. It is a completely different story. Yes, it does pay homage to all three previous Star Wars films at different points. But that is something Lucas never did with his garbage prequels. But that doesn't make it a remake. J.J. is reminding us what is was we loved about the original trilogy. And if you want to talk about a remake, how about Return of the Jedi.Others reviewers claim it is worse than the prequel trilogy. My only response is to ask, ""Have you seen the prequels?"" First off, the characters are not blocks of wood saying the most awkward dialogue know to man. ""I wish that I could wish my feelings away."" (Actual line of dialogue.) And the acting is unbelievably better. Second, this film actually had humor that worked. Third, the new story flowed well and actually showed us things instead of telling us things, which is the first rule of storytelling. Thirdly, no aliens who are racial stereotype of Asians, Africans or Semitic people. I mean how offensive are the Trade Federation, Boss Nass and Watto? Fourth, special effects that actually felt more like reality and not like some neon computer generated fantasy land like the prequels. Lastly, and most importantly, no-sa Jar Jar Bink-sa. That alone makes it one billion times better.Finally, I read a review that hated the fact that it appealed to the masses. Yes, that is called mass appeal. It means that it is something enjoyable for everyone. If you claim this is a bad thing, then you probably pretend to like art house movies and like to feel ""cultured"" all the time, while discussing the ""issues of the day"" at a coffeehouse. So because Star Wars doesn't rely on a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, you think it's stupid.J.J. Abrams brought back Star Wars the way it was meant to be. Exciting and fun to watch. Not a labor to get through. My main worry is if the sequels can possibly reach similar heights as The Force Awakens. Take it from someone who is only a year and a half younger than the original Star Wars film and grew up with the movies. This is what the prequels should have been.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why all the hate?,"I really liked this movie! Yes it's plot is similar to ""A New Hope"", but the execution is different enough to make it feel fresh. I've seen it twice. In Theaters in 2015 and today. I wanna quickly mention, that the cinematography by Dan Mindel is extremely underrated! It should at least have gotten an Oscar nomination. The score by John Williams is great as always, though not many original cues. ""Rey's Theme"" and ""March of the Resistance"" are however exceptions. Overall a really great experience, great characters, dialogue and a flowing pace delivered by J. J. Abrams. A 4/5 stars from me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps it should have been titled 'Star Wars: The Forgery Awakens' or 'SW: The Force Cloned',"The Force Awakens is an exciting new chapter to the SW saga. But there are problems, which it would be easy to get overly critical about. First off, what they got right about this film. New characters: on the surface they're different and compelling enough to enjoy. But at times they lack depth (and maybe even maturity). Perhaps that was by design to appeal more to kids. Next (what I like to call) environmental moments! An example of that is in #1 when Anakin is pod racing, a group of sand people are watching & take a shot at one of the pod racers, causing him to crash. Or in #4 when on Tatooine, they enter Mos Eisley in Luke's land speeder, a Jawa can be seen struggling to control a Rhonto beast. It seems like unimportant details, but it goes a long way to making SW seem real (and not just some visually impressive trip thru a fantasy universe)! While not achieving a George Lucas level, JJ Abrams did a respectable job at this, and frankly I don't know if other directors would've even grasped that. As always, the special effects & sound effects are top notch. The action and pace of the movie are done well too. If anything it could've slowed down in a few spots to help add a little more depth to some of the characters. The visual look of the film is commendable. Traditional SW but tweaked just enough to convey a newness to it (examples: storm trooper outfits, TIE fighters, etc)... And now for what's wrong with this movie!! Large holes in character background. While this seems to be a big source of complaint from fans, especially because it lends to unexplained inconsistencies in some of the major characters. Everyone should try and chill out!! Some of this will be covered in the next movie (probably). Some of it will be revealed in the commercial empire of the SW after market (in such things as toys, games, collectors cards, and possibly TV shows & cartoons). We will have to wait and see if it covers all the significant inconsistencies... Having said that, the sheer volume of it is annoying!! More than any other SW movie. Next issue: disappointing performances by the old cast. Han is Han! One of the strongpoints of the film. Leia, at times seems like she's coming down off a hangover, but at other times gives a convincing performance. Even Chewbacca gives a deadpan performance at one important point in the movie.The villain, Kylo Ren, while not being a big disappointment, is a mixed bag. The biggest flaw by far is the plot. The plot is heavily, heavily, heavily recycled!! So much so that it can't be overstated! (Hence the title of this review)! Hopefully the next SW will fix some of the character background issues. But unless they correct the totally unoriginal plot... then, just like in this movie... great visual effects, a great pace, and somewhat compelling characters will not be enough to make up for it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
JJ Did It!,"JJ Abrams nailed it. The movie had extremely high expectations. Considering the hype, I would say I was satisfied. The visuals were very well done and did not make your head spin (like most high speed CG movies today). Daisy and Boyega performed very well and I look forward to their performance in next installment of the franchise.But the best part to me was the background score. It really evoked the feeling of pure joy that the prequels could not. Watch the trailer again after seeing the film and you will be amazed at how cleverly they managed to keep the film under the wraps.Great end to a stellar year Hollywood.

"Haters will hate, no cure for that :)","I spent last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The star wars essence has awaken,"Just want to say out first, that this is my first review. I always enjoy all the ones from others.So it's time i contribute my part. I specially want to thank to all the reviewers out there for helping me choose the good movies ""for me"" and not make me loose precious time on the bad movies ""for me"". I was a little kid when i saw Star wars the first time. It was on a VHS. But still it was one of those films that touched me, and i bet many others. Then came the other two episodes, and they were awesome. Than came a long silence and 3 more episodes where out. Now, i always thought it was me that grew up and did not see the movies the same way. The magic was some how gone! Now,with the force awakens i was ""shocked"", not because of the story, not because of the special effects. It was because i felt something again. I found out that this film does what the title says, ""it awakens the force"" what i felt in episodes 4,5 and 6. I think one of the reasons is that the filming of the movie was done exactly like the other 3. They did not abuse of the digital panoramic scenes and took more real footage and put ""feelings"" into the film. And one really nice touch is bringing back some star wars memories. I will definitely go to see it again",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't listen to jaded haters. (No Spoilers),"As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. I have been frustrated with the amount of lukewarm reviews this movie has been receiving from fans. This is one time I think the critics are on track, as evidenced by the 95% fresh rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. I know, I know, we're sitting at 89% here on IMDb, and that's actually higher, (for now) than any previous Star Wars movie--including the much praised Empire. My advice is this: Try to sit in the theater and enjoy this movie. If you try to dislike it... you might just succeed. But I can honestly say this is the most fun I've had watching ANY movie in a long time.

The best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back',"There has been an awakening and it is awesome! No offense to those Ewoks, but STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' This film is exciting, it's fun, but it's also heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. Clearly the result of a work done with care.Now this a spoiler-free review, I'm going to keep it that way because this film does have a pivotal plot point that if you spoil it, it would certainly ruin the entire experience. So the secret must be kept until you see it for yourself, it is that crucial.The story is set years after the events in ""Return Of The Jedi,"" Leia is now a general leading the resistance, and Luke Skywalker has gone missing, the mystery of his whereabouts is constant throughout the film, it is what drives the good guys and the first order, finding Luke becomes their cause. Oscar Isaac plays a great pilot named Poe Dameron who gets captured by the villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a stormtrooper with a conscience, Finn (John Boyega) helps Finn escape, a situation which then leads to Finn encountering Rey, (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger who's just trying to get by and survive each day. A new adorable droid, BB8, enters their lives and gives them a mission which leads them to Millennium Falcon and Han Solo. These young ones learn about the past, that the jedi and the force are all real. Meanwhile a threat far more sinister and much larger than the death star is wreaking havoc. These new characters will ultimately have to choose whether to stay as who they are or become something more.What's awesome about STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is that J.J. brought back everything we loved about the old original ""Star Wars"" films. He brought back all the fun and excitement that the prequels lacked because those episodes I,II, and III were too busy trying too hard to be political thrillers. J.J. brought back the Millennium falcon and the thrill of aerial fight. Even the light saber fights on the ground are extremely well-choreographed, they keep you on the edge of your seat.I think the new kids on the block, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Ridley, all did a fantastic job, and they can go toe-to-toe with the legends, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Luke Skywalker. I think the writers, J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt smartly written the film in a way that would bridge the gap between these two generations. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is nostalgic for us who've been fans ever since we could remember, but it embraces new fans who may not know much but will now learn more because of this film. It's a great way to pass the baton, it also makes way for the next installment, EPISODE VIII and IX.This is a very well thought-out film, not a single boring note, nothing about it seems hasty or abrupt, it's well-structured and well-crafted from start to finish. I love how Rey and Finn start out not having a purpose but they end up choosing their own, this is not about destiny placed upon you, it's still up to them in the end, just like how it's my choice to plan on watching this film again and again until I memorize every single line and dialogue.You geek out when you see something familiar, you geek out when you see something new, you laugh, you cry, you can feel your pulse pounding through the action sequences, STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is why you go to the theaters. Any of us who had doubts when Disney bought Lucasfilm can now admit that that may have actually been a pretty smart move on their part, definitely a good thing that happened to this property.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Storyline Fatigue meets Political Correctness,"I am a big Star Wars fan and have watched every movie in the theaters since 1977.

Although the movie spoilers were kept secret, you can easily see everything coming a mile away. Still, some parts and with good acting can draw a ""feel"". But, many other parts are tiring.

The Next Gen Star Wars We Need,"I was seven when I first watched Star Wars (1977). Like many nineties kids' I watched the beloved first trilogy on VHS, in the days before George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic had its way with the ""Deluxe DVD"" modified version. The space saga of Luke an Leia was never bestowed upon me by my parents with fond memories of the premiere. My mother, though fond of musicals, was not much for sci-fi or action movies; my father even less so. It was my older brothers who first sat me down to gaze upon its glory and since those days, every space adventure I have watched over the years lives or dies on the standard of the Star Wars.I say all this not only to lay out my fandom bonafides but also to highlight that my thoughts of Star Wars: The Force Awakens comes from a contemplative place and not the blather of a movie snob or a knee- jerk reaction to the whims of the crowd. I, among others have been burned by this franchise before and repeated viewings of the prequels only serves to underline a simple truth; not everything your loved when you were a teenager was good. So the question now is will this continuation of a long time ago, in a galaxy far away be re-watchable a decade from now?I short yes. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a glorious epic of enormous beauty and scale. The pulse-pounding action, the unabashedly sincere characters and the small smatterings of brevity work to be the kick in the pants movies of this ilk have needed for decades. The welcome return of familiar faces liberally mixed with new and interesting characters gives the franchise all the ammo it needs to become the primary movie franchise for a whole new generations of padawans. The stakes are just as high, the acting is just as strong and the direction is just as flawless.The fact that everything works is no accident either. Director J.J. Abrams very purposely set up all the pieces of his puzzle with similar aplomb as the original creators (George Lucas, Gay Kurtz, Gilbert Taylor et al.). In many cases Abrams even used the same pieces. The score is still provided by the illustrious John Williams, the film itself was shot in the same aspect ration on 35mm film and emphasis was given to practical special effects over computer generated. Also on-board was original scribe for The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Lawrence Kasdan who co-wrote Force Awakens with Abrams.This is where there are some unfortunate kinks in the armor however. As irreproachable as we feel the originals are, they are not in-fact flawless. Thus much of the problems that plague the originals also plague Force Awakens specifically the dialogue and characterization. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do a fine job finding the deeper meanings of the force/dark side, even when the story needs them to act against their own self interest (their love patter leave much to be desired however). Adam Driver's Kylo Ren on the other hand seems to falter not just under the wait of the franchises most iconic villain, Darth Vader but under the weight of his character's conflicts. Darth Vader never needed to throw a hissy fit with a lightsaber; a cold dead look was enough to make us think he was serious. My guess is in the sequels to come, a rift between him and Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux will solidify Kylo Ren as the sinister force he needs to be.In that lies the future success of the Star Wars franchise; what happens next? J.J. Abrams has a tendency to leave absolutely everything out on the field thus the reason why Alias (2001-2006), Lost (2004-2010) and Fringe (2008-2013) all petered into rambling shadows of their former selves. Likewise, the fantastical wonder that was Star Trek (2009) hit a creative deja vu by the time Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) arrived on the scene. In this case however, I think there's more, much more to the saga than an almost surgical emulation of the originals. Abrams is building something, something big and it's going places.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Force's failure,"I think this movie is the worst Star Wars sequel ever made so far. The absence of George Lucas among the ""written by"" credits is so evident that you might think you're watching a movie that has plagiarized the Star Wars saga I'm going to tell you the why without spoiling anything.The story would like to be a tribute to the original one and the manifest for a new Star Wars generation but it fails in both the objectives.There are too much ""I've already seen this scene before"" and all the major points of the story are literally copied from the original Saga; they are the same, in the same order. And what about the original stuff?Well, it is not original at all: a new mask is introduced but the mask has no reason to exist except to give a ""bad voice"" to the ""bad guy"". Also, the bad guy itself is unlikely and you have to accept him just because it exists even if you can feel that he has no reason to exist. The only original thing that I appreciated is the Droid BB-08.And what about the ""Force awakening""? There's absolutely no feeling of a new generation of Jedi ready to start, on the contrary it seems to be that anyone who can swing a light-saber can appear a Jedi.Really, without spoiling anything is hard to convey how much this movie has failed. I don't think I'll wait the next sequel with the same expectations I had for this one...and it's a pity because I really wanted a new generation for Star Wars.Luca",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"I watched every Star Wars movie in a row and I think Star Wars The Force Awakens is a great continuation of the sequel. There's new characters which makes The Force Awakens a little more interesting. Plus there are some original characters in the movie which of course is very awesome. FN-2187 (Finn), Rey, Poe and BB-8 are the new big characters. There's also the new character Kylo Ren. He's the new antagonist of The First Order in The Star Wars Sequel. My favorite scene is definitely where Han Solo and Chewbacca walks into the Millennium Falcon and Han says "" Chewie, were home"". I think the Star Wars Saga isn't something for elderly people. At least most of em'. But could imagine that people from the age of 9-50 year old likes The Star Wars Saga. There's a lot of easter eggs in the movie. For example FN-2187. 2187 is the prison cell Princess Leia was in on the Death Star, in the previous movie. Fantastic movie in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese!","'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the immensely popular space opera film series; and the first chapter in over ten years. It takes place 30 years after the events of 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'; when the Galactic Empire has now become 'The First Order', and the rebel alliance has now become the 'Resistance'. The story deals with a First Order stormtrooper, named Finn, who's looking for redemption; after gaining possession of a map, to Luke Skywaler's whereabouts. The film was directed by J.J. Abrams; and it was written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' and 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker all reprise their roles, from the original trilogy; and they're joined by newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. The series creator, George Lucas, returned as a creative consultant; and John Williams once again scored the music (as he did all six previous chapters, in the franchise). I think it's the most entertaining movie, I've seen, in 35 years!We first learn that Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has gone missing; and due to his absence, the ruthless First Order has gained power, and control, over the galaxy. Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) is now a general, of the Resistance, and she believes finding Luke is humanity's only hope. She sends her best X-wing fighter pilot, named Poe Dameron (Isaac), to the desert planet of Jakku; in order to locate a map, which can lead to her brother's whereabouts. On his mission Poe meets a stormtrooper, looking for redemption, named Finn (Boyega). Finn joins Poe in his adventure; he also later teams up with a scavenger, named Rey (Ridley), and a veteran war hero, named Han Solo (Ford).The film is definitely the best written, of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time, in the series). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama (I cried multiple times). It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserves several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action-packed. All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! It's at least the best in the series since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/149466777",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Copy of A New Hope.,"**Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Review (6/10 Stars)**""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"" directed by J. J. Abrams and released in 2015, reintroduces the Star Wars franchise to a new generation while paying homage to the original trilogy. The film follows Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) as they face off against the First Order, led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).The film's strengths lie in its captivating visuals, energetic action sequences, and the chemistry of its new cast. Ridley and Boyega deliver strong performances, and the return of familiar faces like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) adds a nostalgic touch. The film effectively captures the spirit of the original trilogy, blending new and old elements.However, ""The Force Awakens"" has faced criticism for its reliance on familiar plot structures and tropes from ""A New Hope,"" which some feel makes it feel more like a rehash than a fresh chapter. The pacing can also feel uneven, with some characters and plotlines not fully developed. Additionally, the film introduces intriguing new elements and questions that it doesn't fully address or resolve, setting up expectations for future installments.Overall, ""The Force Awakens"" is an entertaining and visually impressive film that successfully revives interest in the Star Wars saga but falls short of the emotional and narrative depth of its predecessors. It serves as a solid foundation for the new trilogy, despite its shortcomings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mediocre at best, absurd at worst","Episode VII is a movie that was massively hyped up before release. As a result, it was extremely disappointing to many. I was skeptical but hopeful before watching this movie once I learned JJ Abrams and Disney would be taking the helm (Disney certainly has the funding and I thought Abrams did a decent job with the Star Trek movies). Sadly, I feel this movie really did fail to live up to its potential overall.Here are some of the bright spots:-The movie features a couple of the actors from the first trilogy, most notably, Harrison Ford! He plays a prominent role in the movie and does a pretty good job of reprising his role as Han Solo.-The special effects are great!Unfortunately, that's about it for the pros.Here is the list of reasons this movie failed to impress me:-The story isn't original or well-thought out at all. There will be numerous occasions where something will happen, but seemingly for no reason at all other than to conveniently advance the plot.-As many people have pointed out, the plot borrows far too heavily from the story lines of the previous movies.-JJ Abrams was extremely liberal with his interpretation of Jedi lore and use of the Force. This leads to some pretty absurd plot developments and scenes involving the lead characters demonstrating mind-boggling proficiency in using the Force/lightsaber. I mean, these scenes make no sense at all and there is NO attempt to explain or provide backstory as to how said lead characters developed their skills; it's like suddenly they become superheroes within a week, with no training whatsoever.-The villains are largely forgettable. The main villain looks and acts like a wuss. He is not intimidating at all after his introductory scene. The other villains have barely any backstory or character development.Overall this movie was a disappointment. I can only hope that the next director doesn't continue in Abram's footsteps, as Episode VII was nothing more than a hollow shell of a Star Wars movie to me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"#TheForceAwakens is something old, something borrowed, something new, something blue.","But that's what makes this J.J Abrams Star Wars movie so great. It borrowed heavily from the original trilogy, making us all feel like kids again and feeling nostalgic. It lays down the same groundwork, the same plots, and allows us to explore the same galaxies/ environments and settings for this galactic space drama for the upcoming sequels.Yet it introduces us to brand new characters that will carry this franchise forward to the new future of star wars.I love Daisey Ridley portrayal of Rey as a down on her luck scruffy scavenger who had a very tough upbringing being all alone and forced to survive based on instincts. I like John Boyega who provided a convincing portrayal of a storm trooper that has gone rogue and who have renounced the First Order evil ways. I like how Lupito animates the smuggler queen, Maz Kanata with her intelligence and yet warmth towards old friends and those in need.Overall the plot points are very similar to Star Wars: A New Hope and it plays out almost the same way except with less star ships? (Whats up with that?)It leaves me wanting more and leaves me with that warm fuzzy feeling of being back in my childhood and relieving that star wars grand story and setting again to be in a fantasy world.SO yes it is absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of it and i would highly recommend the movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Defending This Movie,"Let me say this right off the bat: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is not a horrible film. I'm sure most people in their right minds will agree with this statement. I personally think that people have the wrong idea about what makes ""Star Wars"" great in the first place. It's a simple, straightforward, and fast-moving story. There are clear villains and heroes. Frenetic action that is spectacle and also suspenseful. ""Star Wars"" is not a thinking man's franchise. It never has been. So for anyone who criticizes this movie for being unoriginal and just derivative of the original trilogy: the original trilogy itself was unoriginal and derivative of fairy tales, science fiction serials, and Japanese cinema. George Lucas was a visionary in terms of bringing us an interesting and unique universe as dressing for a simple fairy tale story, and also by bringing us ground-breaking special effects. He was never a terrific storyteller, so people who come to a ""Star Wars"" movie expecting to see something that will move you or make you think, I'm sorry that you have that impression of the franchise.""The Force Awakens"" is set about thirty years after the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" In that span of time, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) began training a new generation of Jedi Knights. After his academy was destroyed, Luke went into hiding somewhere within unknown space. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order, who are the remnants of the Galactic Empire, are looking for a map that will lead to the location of Luke, but Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a pilot for the Resistance, hides the map inside his droid, BB-8. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku. She finds BB-8 and also runs into Finn (John Boyega), an ex-stormtrooper who fled to the surface, and the trio escape the planet on board the Millennium Falcon. They are eventually tracked down by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo), who lead them to the Resistance base.I will admit, this movie is flawed. Rey is probably the worst part of this movie. It's incredibly un-dramatic to have a main character that can literally do everything by herself and never fail. Also, the story beat where we have yet another planet-killing super weapon is very dull. The forced Marvel-esque humor also feels really out of place in this franchise. This movie also has the misfortune of being followed by two of the most controversial films in the saga. I think that people will unfairly group this movie with those in a package critique of the sequel trilogy for many years to come. Which is unfortunate, because I actually think this movie shines in a lot of places.Harrison Ford absolutely steals the show in his most iconic role. It's so awesome to see him slip back into being Han Solo after thirty years. And there's some heartfelt character development here as well. He's much more mature and wise this time around. I love how he's still making and breaking deals with the low-life riff raff of the galaxy. Kylo Ren is also really cool too. It's interesting to see a ""Star Wars"" villain who struggles with the pull to the light side. We're often just shown the pull of the dark side from the perspective of our heroes, but I really like the concept that Kylo Ren is a lost individual who might not be as evil as he would like to be, and that certain actions he takes in the film don't necessarily satisfy him in the ways that he would like. This is good character writing.Finn is slightly less compelling. I like the idea of one of our heroes being an ex-stormtrooper, but this concept never really goes anywhere after he initially leaves the First Order. I like the scene where he fights one of the other stormtroopers, but I wish we were given more scenes where we may have been shown the impact that the First Order had on him. Maybe if he had a good friend that he had to leave behind or something like that.The plot is always straightforward and very easy to follow, which is a lot more than can be said for other ""Star Wars"" movies. Like I said earlier, this franchise is not meant to be taken so seriously. They're light-hearted adventure movies. Action scenes are visually engaging. The lightsaber duel at the end is visceral and brutal; it feels much more like an actual sword fight than the highly choreographed ballerina-twirling of the prequel trilogy. And that can be said of this movie in general; there seems to be so much more life and energy here than in the entire prequel trilogy that preceded it.The ""Star Wars"" saga had a definitive ending with ""Return of the Jedi."" There didn't need to be any other movies expanding the story beyond the destruction of the Empire. There's also the sad reality to contend with that ""The Force Awakens"" will always be attached to the abysmal mess that was ""The Rise of Skywalker."" But if you take this movie alone on its own; if you sit down with a bowl of popcorn and dim the lights and just shut off your brain for two and a half hours, you're going to be surprised by how much you actually like this movie. The energy and life and fun that it has with itself propel it beyond its confines within a larger saga. People really need to just chill about ""Star Wars"" and learn how to enjoy a fun movie. This is a fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Strong Sequel,"As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.
I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.
Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.
I await a new episode and hope they will prove more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Star Wars Movie,"So here's the thing.... Abrams made a very decent Star Wars movie, with a great story line, with a strong male lead and a strong female lead. Yes, it certainly had elements of A New Hope, but that is to be expected because we have a new villain who had to be introduced, and new characters.The end.Y'all can stop hating now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Formulaic,"If you are not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you won't exactly be amazed with this new episode. A lot of stuff is really predictable and formulaic. It is OK as entertainment. Newer generations will probably get a kick from this, but not someone who liked the first trilogy and is expecting something new here.There was far more drama in previous installations of the franchise, far more powerful scenes, emotional scenes, engaging and more believable characters, dialogue and yes, even fight and action scenes.It is nice to see the old familiar faces again, but that's it. Nothing spectacular or innovative. Abrams is far from Lucas' genius and this can be seen all throughout this film. It is hard to believe that Harrison Ford can't bring out Han Solo properly.If all the other movies that get churned out in these times weren't so utterly bad, I would have given this one even 5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Let me understand this...,"I never wrote a single review in this website before but some kind of moral obligation told me to let the world know about my opinion. I red 20+ pages of user reviews about this movie and not a single one was positive, not even close. So let me understand this...is IMDb working with Disney to buy some credibility about this mediocre work of cinema? It wasn't good and everybody are telling you this so how the holy heavens get such high score? It is pretty clear to me that Disney is powerful enough to buy everybody but this is above ridiculous! I'm not against J.J. Abrams in fact I thought the Star Trek reboot was a good show....but this? Boring and awful. People are right to say the prequels were slightly better because at least were trying to stay focus on the story. God only knows why with such incredible material they decided to make this movie so sloppy and boring. CGI doesn't count because even a video game can look perfect and be a disaster at the same time nowadays. I saw all the previous movies at least 5 times, included the prequels, but I really cannot play again this one one more time because it's above disappointment. And it's really ridiculous this kind of result.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best SW movie since ROTJ,"I have read a lot of the negative comments about TFA.

There are many unanswered questions as the curtain closes on this Episode. I eagerly await the answers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"After my second viewing, the flaws become much more apparent... Great characters but not enough plot or development.","First of all, I have to say like mostly everyone I loved the new characters especially Rey and Finn. I think they'll be a great addition to the SW universe and I'm looking forward to where future films take them. After the first time I watched this movie on opening night, I was ecstatic. I left the theater with a huge grin on my face because I knew that JJ Abrams made a movie that was better than any of the Lucas-directed prequels. Unfortunately after seeing it a second time, I noticed the flaws A LOT more because now I could focus more on the plot and pick up on anything I may have missed the first time.As many have already pointed out, at times this film is very similar to Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. Sometimes it feels TOO similar to the point where it just gets distracting and you can't help but feel the writers/director just wanted to play on the audience's nostalgia. I would compare it to a used car salesman trying to sweet talk me into buying a car he knows is in bad shape but plays on my emotions to get me to buy it. Similarly, JJ tries to play on the audience's love of the original trilogy to somehow make us forget that really nothing much happens in this movie. By the end of it I was left wanting more and not in a good way but more of a ""that's it?"" kind of way.This movie's primary purpose was to introduce us to this new group of characters and get us to love them so that we buy tickets to see the next films. It succeeds in doing so, but fans of Star Wars deserve a lot more than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Awakens Should You?,"I like Star Wars. I have seen them all and enjoyed them when they came out. Yes to the flaws, inconsistencies, less than stellar performances and story-lines. Those things didn't stop me from having a good time. They still don't. Now, that being all said, let me let you in on a little secret that has been used on you and you don't know it yet THE JEDI MIND TRICK at work. You will go see Star Wars. You will love it. You will tell all your friends. You will relive your childhood or late blooming. You will return to the days of yesteryear. You will get your monies worth. You will & you will and you will. Whew...Come out from under the Jedi Mind Trick for just one moment please....If you want to have the time of your life, spend good money on an investment/keepsake and instead of going to see this current release right away, go purchase the original movies. YOU WILL not be disappointed. YOU WILL get your monies worth etc etc. This is no Jedi Mind Trick! Here's the thing...I expected new ground. I honestly believed this movie would cover new ground but instead it covered where we have all been before. Furthermore, you have to make some effort to allow for an elderly Hans Solo, Leia and of course for old times sake say hello to some of the old favorites you have seen before but here is the question..Why go down memory lane? Why should you? Why not take us where Star Trek took us which is where no man has been before? Instead, its memory Lane and don't get me wrong, it is not punishment but instead disappointing that with all this technology and ideas floating around in the Star Wars Galaxy, they couldn't capture an original story? This should be called the Return of the Four Billion episode. Did someone at Disney say...Play it safe! We need to get our 4 billion back that we paid Lucas. Just rehash some things, add some music to it, big screen it, turn up the hype and yes, we will need the old Jedi Mind Trick if we are ever to get our 4 billion back right away. You will get the money back. You will not stop until you do. You will follow this formula...The Jedi Mind Trick...works every-time. The reasoning at Disney? All prior movies pulled in a total of billions. Merchandise is pulling in hundreds of millions. Why mess with success? Guaranteed sure thing out of the box, can't lose is the rehash concept. Think: same medicine different bottle with same effect. If I wanted to see the same storyline minus the different faces or so slight changes, buy the old box set and revisit what you already saw and have come to love as mentioned previously. This current movie can be added to the treasure trove later on. Its not a we have to rush out and go see this at all costs type of movie...unless it is. Again, the Jedi Mind trick. You must see this. You have to see this. Imagine visiting with new ideas, story-lines, concepts that take us into that Galaxy a long time ago and far far away. If done properly, the movie becomes a must see again. Saying that, there are no memorable scenes here meaning that you want to see them again. I respect the other point of view so relax, do not argue and just enjoy (if you can), my point of view. In effect, Disney is milking the Star Wars cow. We loved them, we saw them and we accepted them. Now, Disney, needs to prep the current generation and the one coming after this one and the one after that to accept it all over again. Why? They are spending more billions to redo Disneyland with the Star Wars theme and they like getting their monies worth and then some. I am in support of that too but keep it fresh. So here's to the next Star Wars movie. May it be original, exciting, have depth, break new ground, hire the best writers, and be of such a high quality movie going experience that no JEDI MIND TRICK is necessary. Let the love of the entertainment well done... beckon us all. No Tricks either!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Beautiful crafted shell, hollow movie.","I've researched the ""making of"" of the first trilogy, episodes IV to VI. Those were turbulent times. My conclusion about that is that George Lucas had a big heart, full of ideas, but lacked the ability to properly portray them. That period was packed full of changes to the script recommended by his friends, coworkers and professionals of the movie business. He had years to prepare and craft his final work. His powerful, raw and creative ideas were shaped by the input and help of innumerous professionals who assisted in tailoring and shape the movies we love so much. It was the love of one man portrayed with the help of many, and it was improved for it. Impressive core, with a beautiful and crafted shell.Then, George Lucas became famous, proud, and rich. So much that he acquired all creative and producing rights to the episodes I to III trilogy. He had no need to follow instructions and shape his ideas according to other professionals. He still had his raw and creative ideas, but lacked the knowledge and input of so many others who could have helped make his story achieve its full potentials. He couldn't go wrong, could he? Not the ""creator of Star Wars"", even through his original work had so much from others. So, we get episodes I to III: original and full of creative ideas, but who weren't as prepared and constructed as the previous trilogy was. No people to tell him he used too much CGI. No friends to tell him to improve on certain areas. No professionals who helped him shape it. And that is why we got those raw display of heart, with so many good ideas, but which failed as good movies. Beautiful core, but with a poorly shaped and disorganized shell. Things go wrong. Then comes the new trilogy. Disney acquired it and decided to profit on it as fast as possible. No time to properly prepare it. Gone was the original heart and soul of the trilogy, and George Lucas input was discarded. His original ideas, gone. The Star Wars expanded universe, gone. No heart left. The burden is so heavy and expectations are so high, they contact one of the best movie directors of our age. His responsibilities are so great that he has to make a PERFECT STAR WARS MOVIE. He plays safe. The studio plays safe. They cannot have another bad movie. People loved the original trilogy, and hated the new one, so let us give them what they want. Blend episodes IV to VI, process them in a fruit blender, filter it for all its good and ""star wars ideas"", add what you think the audience wants, keep it in a 2 hour summer blockbuster packaged, and sell it. All perfectly tailored and processed by a top cast of professionals in their prime, who were meant not to make a movie, but a Star Wars movie. And there is a big difference there. But gone was the creativity, originality, magic and art that we expected. The lore gets destroyed. The universe story barely moves forward. The plot is recycled, and we got another similar plot to previous movies. The characters are paper thin, and only created to look nice and fit the requirements for the story to move forward and repeat itself, without barely a moment left for them to grow and acquire importance. So many scenes are repeated from the first trilogy just because they were expected to be there. So many moments repeated for the desired effect, but which sound and look hollow because they weren't a consequence of the plot, but a cheap attempt at repeating previous successes. No core at all, no heart at all. Just a ""perfect"" designed ""Star Wars"" shell to a hollow movie.Yes, it is a good ""Star Wars movie"", because it recycled everything good about the previous ones. But it is not a good movie, and unlike every single previous one from the series, it adds nothing new. Unlike even the somewhat bad prequel trilogy, that actually added anything story wise to the universe lore, this one adds nothing. Absolutely nothing. And it is a shame, and it just isn't worse than Episode I because that movie was god damn awful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie review,"With the upcoming release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" i've decided to make a review of this movie.
""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a movie directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and many more. This movie takes place after ""Return of the jedi"" back in 1983 and is about the resistance has to complete a very important mission for the destiny of the galaxy and the first order has to stop it. 
Let's talk about the positive things, the visual effects are fantastic. J.J. is a director that is known for his ability to combine the CGI effects and the practical ones at just the right level, and it shows. By the way this is a very well directed movie and very well edited too. All this together with John Williams's score, you do feel like Star Wars is more than back into the big screen.
The performances in this movie are some of the best of the entire saga with out a dude. John Boyega as Finn is fantastic and Daisy Ridley is magnificent as Rey. She is easily the best part of this movie. Adam Driver was awesome as Kylo Ren, one of the best movie villains in recent years. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is very good, and the friendship between Han and Chewie still there and is very fresh.
This is a very funny movie, in my opinion this is the funniest movie of the entire saga. And almost all the comedy comes from BB-8, which is awesome and i loved it in this film.
""Episode VII"" has some very good battle sequences and the sound mixing was great, you feel the action almost directly in your face and is awesome to see.
The easter eggs and references to the other Star Wars movies were also great, and there are shown with respect to the saga and the fans of the source material. I like the fact that the references there are not in the entire movie, which i'm very happy. Because this movie had a danger to doing that like ""Jurassic World"" did it that year, but thanks to the force, that didn't happened.
I loved this movie,but it does have some flaws. For example, Snoke and Maz Kanata. This movie has this two CGI characters here, but they don't matter all that much. There are scenes when we see Snoke talking to some people and is not that interesting or important. The same thing happened with Maz, she was and old lady who sometimes talks about other Star Wars things, but is not interesting. But, don't worry, there are not in the entire movie.
This movie is one for my favorites movies of Star Wars and it is i the 4th place in my ranking of the Star Wars movies. I've already watched ""The Last Jedi"" and is amazing, but I need to watch it a second time before i do the review. Those are my thoughts of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" and thats way i'm going to give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not as good as I had expected,"OK I am a fan, but not a fanatic! to begin with, the movie is solely carried on the tiny shoulders of Daisy Ridley (Rey), the rest did not hold a candle to her (including Harrison Ford & Oscar Issac), so well done miss Ridley, you saved the movie. Special effects and action are all very good, story? well 'aaay ' acceptable - but my beef is mainly else where. I watched this movie at Empire - Leicester Sq. in London, which to my knowledge is the only IMAX-Laser theatre currently in UK. The cinema is supposed to be the state-of- the-art with 4K resolution, 3D and the latest incarnation of IMAX which uses laser- beams to create images brighter than anything before, with better contrast blah- blah. But it failed miserably! I have seen sharper & cleaner pictures from a £500 TV set, Picture was awash with dot-crawl noise, contrast was terrible, motion-judder almost made me sick, and if that was not enough, the crappy 3D-glasses were so hazy, slightest ambient light would turn them gray, destroying any blacks! the space scenes background was not black, it was an annoying gray. Do yourself a favour, watch it on 2D and don't waste your money on IMAX-laser 3D , it is just a hype. Otherwise the movie is watchable, but not great! ---------------------------UPDATE------------------------ Just watched it again on bluray release, and I haven't changed my mind. I still find it ""Not-Good-Enough"" to do justice to previous movies. They need to really concentrate on a STORY first, a movie is nothing without a proper story - re-using previous stories is no good - no matter how much you throw Special-Effects at it. StarWars did not become a classic because of it's special effects alone. Needs a better story teller (as in both writer and director).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Force Has awoken... (Spoiler Free),"When the prequels were initially released I was just a baby. Not until a decade later would I be introduced to the Star Wars universe. While visiting my uncle in Dallas, he was taking me through memory lane of his childhood. While doing so, he mentioned Star Wars. I didn't grow up under a rock, so I was familiar with the name, and a few of the main characters. He explained to me his experiences watching the Original trilogy, and what it was like in the theatre when Vader proclaimed to Luke he was his father in ESB. He told me what the movies meant to him, and this instantly made me wanna see what he was trying to sell to me.Unfortunately, he didn't have the Original Trilogy on DVD. But for substitute, he took out his movie collection the prequels. One day while the house was empty, I sat down and watched all three. My uncle and I talked in detail about the movies a couple days later. He made sure I knew that what I had watched days earlier , was nowhere as good as the movies he watched as a kid. What surprises me now, is that my uncle never had anything really negative to say about the prequels, only that Original Trilogy was a lot better. He never had hate towards Jar Jar, or the fact that Grievous had four f-kin light sabers. That's possibly why after seeing both the prequels and originals countless times, I can find enjoyment in the prequels. With that being said, I'm not blind to the weaknesses of the prequels. I know that the best of the prequels (Revenge) isn't better than the worst of the Originals (Return).Fast forward to three years ago. I am full fledge Star Wars fan boy. I refer to myself as Darth Maul. I know all there is to know of Star Wars. I say that because of everything that's official canon now, I knew it... Back to the point.Disney buys the rights to Star Wars and announces plans of new movies and etc. I remember being ecstatic but frustrated because of how long the wait would be. Then gradually as time past, Details of Episode 7 started making it's around the internet. Word of J.J Abrams directing the movie and co-writing the script had me very optimistic of what was to come.Fast forward to a year ago when the first teaser was released. As soon as I saw the opening shot of Finn (John Boyega) I knew that The Force Awakens would be a love or hate movie. Also, that J.J Abrams was aware of the cultural impact of Star Wars.As many of you all reading this know or will agree with me when I say that the trailers and marketing for Episode 7 was near perfection. Balancing nostalgia with enticing visuals and promising ideas and concepts (ex. Kylo Ren's cross guard saber). I will say that, all I wanted was for a good movie.Now for the Review.Depending on the context your watching the movie, ""good movie"" is an understatement. Is it perfect, no, no movie is. With an abundance of great qualities, I find it easier to acknowledge the small errors in this vast ocean of goodness. For those who are looking for faults in the Force Awakens, they can point to the mirroring plot points of Episode 7 to that of Episode 4: A New Hope. Not that Episode 7 is a complete retelling of Episode 4, but it is easy to identify the parallels of the two. Other than that, I had no problems with the film, and was intrigued throughout the entire movie. Visually, the Force Awakens is perhaps the best of the Saga. Character development and portrayal was great. Not to discredit any other characters, but Rey(Daisy Ridley) was astonishing. The feel of the movie felt like Star Wars. Han Solo (Ford) and Leia (Fisher) provide the movie with nostalgia, at the same time not forcing it...pun intended. The score while not the best of the Saga, was very pleasing. All in all, Episode 7 was phenomenal.. GO SEE IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans.,"The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked!I'm not surprised at all with some of the hate filled reviews on here, I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time – only the vast majority of the developed world who can afford a ticket. Admittedly nostalgia levels were very high, but I felt as though they were warranted when I watched the finish article, as all boxes were ticked.*Potential very small spoiler* I particularly enjoyed the quite literal 'Force Awakening' scenes with the main force sensitive characters (not yet Jedi or Sith), who in some cases were literally fighting for their lives with zero training and a yet unknown midichlorian count.I'm looking forward to being able to share the experience with my 6 year old son one day soon, I'm sure he won't be dissecting the plot, drawing parallels with the originals and complaining about a ""lack of vision"".The torch as finally been passed to a new generation, well done JJ and company!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fantastic, lost for words!!!","Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42yrs old and a massive Star Wars fan. A hard thing since my wife just cannot understand why. Well, if there's ONE reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes than I had when I was a young boy.They did it! They finally managed to bring the SW universe to life. All the bad things from the prequels are gone, all the good things from the originals is back. It's exciting, funny, spectacular, emotional and everything a Star Wars movie has to be.The last 30secs show more acting genius than the whole 3 prequels together. What an achievement from both director, producers, cast and designers. So many things to love about this, it's just impossible to say.

A Brand New Hope,"After months of eagerly awaiting the star wars franchise to return and with mostly high hopes from the director ""J.J.Abrams"" I returned home from the midnight release of this classic movie with feelings a movie hasn't made me feel in a very long time. I returned home quickly removing my t shirt to cool down from the sweaty grip of the cinema screen, feeling almost relieved that it was over but desperately wanting more. The curtains widened and the classic rolling yellow letters appeared on screen accompanied by ""John Williams"" iconic soundtrack and after that everything fell into place. The return of everyone's favorite characters created immense amounts of nostalgia and I couldn't help but have a big cheesy grin on my face every time a familiar face appeared. The new cast were equally as good as the oldies and an exceptional performance from ""Oscar Isaac"" as to be expected, these new performances really held the movie together. The characters the new cast played were brilliant and fitted in great with the star wars story. The main winning point for this movie is the sheer fact that it most definitely is Star Wars, from start to finish it was good old Star Wars, Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I literally loved everything about this movie,"I am not a Star Wars fanatic but I was excited to see this with my kids. I always worry that when a movie has this much hype that it will fail miserably. I couldn't help it... the more people built it up the more I looked forward to seeing it. Could it possibly be that great? Yes. I loved it, my kids loved it. This movie is above any beyond everything I had been hoping for. As a person old enough to have seen the original Star Wars in the theater, I cannot say enough about this film. Star Wars has gone back to it's roots. I don't want to have any spoilers in my review so I won't list any details. It goes without saying that the cinematography, special effects,etc are phenomenal. The cast is excellent, the plot is gripping, the plot twists are awesome, the use of humor is perfect. Seeing this was like coming home. I realize it sounds like I am a much bigger Star Wars fan than I knew. But the truth is I am a big fan of well done movies. I love all the little things they put in the script. I would like to go back and see this again just to pick up on all of the little things you miss the first time around. I just have to say, this movie is SO well done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When George Lucas sees this...,"...he'll want to smash the prequels with a large sledgehammer. If he's honest about his work, that is. Now he has the time because he's not involved in Star Wars fist hand... and ostensibly enough money to buy an appropriately large devastating device.Seeing this made me wish I never laid my eyes on the ""CGI, pseudoscience and politics masturbation"" that were the so called prequels. Because ""The Force Awakens"" is back to the roots for the franchise. There is the sense of adventure again, there is the sense of scope and the convincing journey from small to great for the main character. It also looks like the film again, not like a televised theater. Thanks to Mr. Abrams and the crew, they didn't let down by any means! The lengths they went to to make this as meaty and good and ""starwars-ish"" as it once used to be are obvious and only the most jaded fans, ""traumatized"" by recent experiences and firmly entrenched in their own preconceptions of what ""their"" franchise should be will disagree.After scanning through some reviews here on IMDb, I can see that there are quite a lot of disappointed folks. Two main objections to the new film is that it's derivative (""ripoff"") and that it has many illogical plot points (""stupid""). Well, excuse me, people, what show are we talking about? Show me one single episode of the ""Star Wars"" franchise that isn't both a ripoff and stupid, including the first one (or ""fourth"", if you will)! All are, but that fact didn't take anything off of the pleasure of seeing them until Mr. Lucas went overboard with his out-of-touch ideas of where to take the story next. It just goes to show that you can never please everyone, especially people who got exactly what they wanted but are so used to complaining by now that complaining entertains them more than the film itself.In a way, this new outing does feel like ""the best of Star Wars"" compilation and it does feel like retelling of ""A New Hope"" with some elements from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". However, Lucas himself had this concept of the trilogies ""rhyming with each other"" which makes it legitimate and it seems that the crew honored it well here. But there is a bigger purpose to that, because if this franchise is to be reinvigorated for a long period of time it has to put a firm statement of where it stands compared to the legacy. And the statement is ""we're putting it back where it was when people were genuinely attracted to the whole thing"". This is allowed by the position of this episode in the general timeline and made possible by the sure hand of a director that knows film-making inside out and is also clearly a fan.And obviously, since new people do bring new ideas, many things from the lore are rethought and revised in a very refreshing way, and while you may not find it in the storyline, you'll certainly find it in little amusing details, my favorite being the scene where the new main villain has a fit of rage and his underlings quietly avoid him until he settles down. Yes, that's right: the characters finally feel like human beings again.Is this all good for the future of ""Star Wars""? In this age of remakes, sequels and reboots this franchise isn't a vanguard anymore and can't really open new frontiers. It now has to compete for the middle ground with a fiercely stiff competition. And despite its zealous following, I believe that ordinary audience sees it by now as something of a relic from a bygone era. Taking this as an advantage, and making it look and feel like it used to be, and refreshing it where it was needed, could be a good way to not only set it apart from other blockbusters but to retain respect for something that once made a profound cultural impact, and the production took solid steps in that direction. So, yeah, it's like restoration of a vintage car. And it works and it will still roll for quite some time.All in all, ""Star Wars"" is really back. Back with all its poignance and back with all its silliness. And they do look good! I take two marks off of ten because... well, because it's ""Star Wars""! It's my own thing, don't be bothered by it. I lost the taste for them a long time ago in a childhood far, far away. But I do admit that something in this made me feel like looking forward to sequels just like I did after I saw ""Episode V"" in cinema at the tender age of six.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Old story with new effects,"It starts well but it soon suffers from less creative dialogues, jokes at inappropriate moments or scenes that could be completely cut with no impact on the story.And the plot itself is the in my opinion the weakness of the movie.Spoiler alert: Just the ex trooper tells a new thing, and I liked how the son kills his father. The kill does not have to be heroic in my opinion, it feels authentic and was one moment which I didn't expect.The rest is neither surprising nor innovative. It is entertaining of course with nice effects but I expected more from another, new Star Wars episode.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The story weakens the film.,"(No Spoilers) Star Wars, The force awakens.Better than the prequels but not as good as the original. The movie feels incredibly rushed and as a result some of the acting/writing seems forced and unnatural. The story is too similar to the original movie (A new hope). The ending is a bit frustrating. Other than that, I was very pleased with the film. JJ Abrams did a good job telling another story within this masterpiece science fiction galaxy that George Lucas created in the 1970s. The new droid, BB 8, stole the show. Ray, played by Daisy Ridley, was the best new comer to the story. This film should have been the 4th one made and it should have been made in 1999, not 2015. Many of us Generation Xers who grew up with the original trilogy will forever be messed up with our expectations of the Star Wars Universe. This film wasn't bad and it wasn't spectacular either. It was exciting to go to the movies to see a new Star Wars film and I left wanting more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very solid entry into the Star Wars franchise,"It's a Star Wars movie through and through. Fans (and others) can rejoice, this is a watch you won't regret.Episode 7 has well done CGI and effects, great fighting and ship battle scenes and is an overall good experience.That said and since I'd rather focus on the little bit of criticism I have (since much of the praise would really just end up in spoiling things), it is not quite without flaws. In my opinion they really went overboard with the references to the original trilogy. The first third or so of the movie is also full of silly and funny one-liners. Not a new thing for the franchise, but it does feel like it's a bit over the top.The movie does leave you wondering about a few things and how it ended up that way, there are certainly a few plot holes.As mentioned before, it is anything but unfamiliar. Many tropes you've long since known you'll once again find present and at some point it does make you wonder just how often they can keep doing it before it gets ridiculous.All in all, a very solid entry. It'll take a while yet for it to settle with me and I don't think I'd end up rating it higher than episode 5 or maybe 6, but I do like it a lot and I'm thankful to JJ and the entire crew for doing such a good job. I hope the rest of the new trilogy will manage to keep the high level of quality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Average,"I find the Movie not above average.The new director did a pleasant work for the audience, is an easy film to digest using the whole Star Wars history as leverage backup.Han and Cheewie are by far the best two characters of this sequel. Making a big change from their first appearance.The villain, is a very weak character that ends up been a clown if you compare him with the rest villains of the saga. The use of the mask is a Joke and his master is a full copy of the lord of the rings.I don't believe the new director understood the history behind the film and that he had to take some risks to make this film a master piece as the previous saga. He just backed up and did the job that was pleasant for Disney and the current industry. What in fact was part was the opposite what Star Wars stood for on their first releases. This could be a Sequel for Harry Potter.Additionally, One thing I think makes this movie bad sequel is that blood is shown, whereas in the rest of the saga is not, not even at the end of the second trilogy. Makes you think you are watching the Hunger Games or Twiligt",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You cannot stop change anymore than you can stop the suns from setting,"Since the arrival of J.J Abrams to the star wars saga, it was clear that some; if not a lot was going to change.This change has been much unapreciated in the IMDb community, spawning a great number of negative reviews, calling it a remake rather than a sequel, however; this is not the case: the shared plotpoints and familiar themes from the original star wars trilogy are there to appeal to old star wars fans seeking a renassaince in the star wars saga after the disappointment of the prequels.J.J Abrams not only fooled most of the speculating media (example: Luke= Kylo Ren theory) but also gave us one of the best installments in the saga. Before you prepare your keyboards to make an immediate counterpoint, let me explain: ""The force awakens"" isn't anything incredibly new but rather refreshing, it bought a new approach at action sequences: awesome X-Wing piloting sequences, Dirty lightsaber fights and more blaster action (""nothing beats a good blaster at your side,kid"" -Han Solo). It gave us realistic and likable characters: Poe Dameron is a synonym of likable, Kylo Ren is a vulnerable human being under the mask; unlike darth vader and the emperor, and many beloved characters make a heartwarming return to the saga.The force awakens is innovative, but returns to the roots of the saga, taking out many ideas and themes from a new hope, empire strikes back and even return of the jedi. It's a breath of fresh air in the sci- fi and action department, a much needed one. Star wars: The force awakens is one of the best sci-fi/action flicks of 2015 and I hope to see more Star wars soon.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bloody marvelous,"The force is strong with this film. Bloody marvelous. proper Star Wars is back!!! Can't wait to see it again.Better than the prequels? With a doubt by a country mile and then some (but that ain't hard)Better than Return of the Jedi? I think soBetter than new hope? Hmmm need to see it a few more times but maybe, just maybe.Better than Empire? Well probably not but that's almost impossible. (even for a computer)There are some shocks and one genuine nooooooo moment. But also some good humour but not of the puerile jar jar binks stepping in poo type. Harrison Fords ""grumpy old man solo"" is a big source of the funny moments and is just brilliant.There are several spine tingling ""the force will be with you always"" type moments. That just took me right back to being a kid and feeling the magic of the original films.The action sequences are spectacular but without the whole ""cramming as much cgi crap as you can on the screen"" nonsense that helped ruin the prequels.The light sabre battles are not the overly choreographed, emotionless dance routines of the prequals but neither are they they somewhat wooden fights from the originals. They are a good blend of quality action and the emotion that was sorely lacking in espiodes 1-3. Basically you actually care when the fights are happening and the fight sequences are more about the character interaction than prating about looking cool with a light saber.There is plenty of fan service but without any of the stupid stuff like having Darth Vader making c3po. Just some good nods to the old films that make you smile.So yay Star Wars is back!

The Force has Awakened,"This is my review for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (spoiler free).This film delivers well to fans of all ages and is the sequel fans have been waiting for, for 32 years. With amazing dialogue and explosive special effects I promise that when you leave the theater you won't be disappointed.Let's start with some the good points of why I think this is the film of the year:1. Characters: This film has some new characters like Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) these characters deliver the plot of the film well along with some the older characters like Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chebacca and C-3PO.2. Plot: This films plot follows the plot form Episode VI Return of the Jedi and is a very good continuation to the story.3. Special Effects: The special effects are explosive and are a key element to the film to make this a hell of a sci-fi epic.Those are the good points on why I think you should watch this film and the bad points well there are none because this film was enjoyable from beginning to end.I think that the force has truly awakened in this film but that's for you to judge. If you are a Star Wars fan old or new this film should be at the top of your list. 10/10 an excellent must see bring on Dec 2017 for Episode VIII. Must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The plot was structured like A New Hope which is fine by me and I think every Star Wars fan will find nostalgia in its well fleshed out and stellar plot. The First Order lead by three new antagonists feels like a force to be reckoned with and Boyega is great at conveying those emotions (not that their actions throughout convey any less). All in all, I would watch this movie every day if given the choice and will view it many many times in the theater because it would be a shame not too.

"A crowd-pleaser, but one with the full power of the Force!","Let me start by saying: Wow! J.J. Abrams did it again! Like Star Trek before it, Star Wars is ready to take old and new generations of fans on a new journey. This is probably THE Star Wars movie that most people have waited for since Return of the Jedi.But I have to be frank: I liked the prequels. Don't hold it against me. They have their fans, despite what some say and think. It was George Lucas' attempt to show the bigger picture, the politics of this Galaxy Far Far Away; how it not only revolved around the actions of a few individuals but entire populations and governments. And most importantly, how it could have become an evil Empire. At the very least it enabled us to look at the original films and Darth Vader from another perspective. Unfortunately, the depiction of that era took away a bit of the rugged, dirty and lived in environments and the small, personal storyline that hallmarked the old trilogy. And let's be clear: it is hard to make prequels very surprising and fresh, since we know how they end. Even Peter Jackson had to find that out the hard way.But, that said, I am very pleased to say that the old feeling is back in full Force. J.J. Abrams always said that he wanted to make a successor in the spirit of the old trilogy, and he succeeded. From Lost, Star Trek, Cloverfield and Super 8, we know how J.J. Abrams is a master in taking old and familiar elements and putting them back together in surprisingly fresh ways, which is exactly what he did here. We are back to a story of exploration, where unassuming heroes venture into unfamiliar territory, the same elements that made the original trilogy so exiting. Fans will be pleased that the road is paved with familiar sights, old friends, and dark, ominous locations which seem far removed from the clean look of the prequels. Politics are conspicuously left out, and the threat of danger is tangible throughout the movie. And a great cast of not-too-well-known actors understands the B- movie nature of the movie without overdoing it (somethings the prequels were notorious for, I'll admit).If I have to make one obvious point of criticism, it is that it may all feel a bit too familiar. In approaching the old atmosphere and plotting of the original Star Wars, the makers have spared no expense to hint, nod, wink, reference and pay homage to their favorite episodes. The prequels dared to take risks and got into directions that alienated a lot of fans. This episode is playing it much more safe, perhaps a bit too much. If I had a checklist, my guess would be that half the scenes contain a direct reference or re-used plot point from earlier in the series (some more blatant than others). The hardcore fans are guaranteed a nerdgasm virtually every 5 minutes, which explains the extremely favorable first reactions to the movie. At certain points it just becomes a bit too obvious that they want to remind us how cool they are by trying to imitate the cool kids.But, in all fairness, in the key scenes, it works just fine. There are unforgettable moments that make great use of the previously established legacy that is Star Wars, such as the chillingly solemn epilogue. And they haven't forgotten to bring it with a light touch (leave it to Han Solo and his hairy sidekick!). Some of the crowd-pleasing moments had me laugh, some were so über-geeky that they made me think AND laugh, and others made me cheer like a 9-year-old. And in the truly unique scenes, they manage to find a beating heart in the story, remind us of all the great moments that came before, and present things to keep us guessing for what is to come.This movie is a good continuation, a great stand-alone movie, as well as a promise for what is to come. Past, present and future well balanced. Can't wait for Episode VIII!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Galaxy Far Far Away From the Originals...,"*SPOILERS* The film alone is watchable, although there is certainly nothing remarkable about it whatsoever. I wont be re-seeing it. A major flaw with the movie is the rather poor story, which includes the usual Abrams plot holes and zero subtleties which are what hold peoples imagination as he seems on a mission that the everything be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. That the plot actually shares many parts nearly identically with SW ANH cannot be denied, and it was probably done intentionally as a slight tribute/""re-dedication for a new generation"" - oh yay!hooray for nostalgia!... or rather, how about a new story?! Character development: none. Yes, everyone knows they can't give the audience all the information, but really that lack of information on the back story in this film was bizarre and off-putting. The pacing: disjointed. Completely missing is the ""Star Wars feel"" with the intense battle of the Dark and Light side, that even the much-maligned prequels still manage (see ""Duel of the Fates etc). Also, I cannot remember any of the soundtrack after seeing the movie - even the Phantom Menace featured unbelievable scores.Among the most unforgivable of the film are the plot holes that will even have the casual Star Wars fans in disbelief:Here are a few a can still remember: It's all well and good Disney and Abrams slapped the Star Wars fan base in the face by ""un-canonizing"" all of the Expanded Universe literature...but they can't use that excuse for this oneWHERE DID THE NEW Sith Lord come from? FROM THE MOVIES, we know there can only be 2 Sith at a time, so where was this rather old-looking and dark-side eroded master while the Emperor and Vader were around - who trained him?-Luke Skywalker would never run away from a Sith that he is responsible for training, especially his nephew.-a ZERO-trained very powerful force user - just nope...I mean, even Anakin Skywalker had to train and there was a Force prophecy about him!-Non-force user non-clone storm trooper using a lightsaber for the first time rather spectacularly against a Sith trained by Luke Skywalker!-non-trained powerful force user, also a lightsaber novice, also manages to defeat a trained Sith lord...folks, do we remember SW ANH where Vader strikes down Obi Wan or SW TPM, where Darth Maul strikes down Qui Gon and almost defeats Obi Wan - yeah, Force Awakens lightsaber duels are a total insult to those...-Kylo Rens light saber not only looks like a joke, but it's design would actually lead to the saber's destruction during a duel as the perpendicular beams are emitted from nodes sticking out at the base of the main blade...ie. as soon as an opponents blade grinds down to the hilt it will be naturally directed to slicing into the lightsaber handle...and also nobody asked for a cheesy lightsaber...Small squadron of old beat up fighters beating an Armada - nopeHow does the resistance all of a sudden no where the weapon planet is? And why didn't they try to destroy it WAY before!!!Aside from the lead, she was pretty good, the acting was sub-par, especially the actor going on about imaginary complaints about a black Storm Trooper...(it was ironic HE was the one making the biggest deal about it!). His ""coming to morality"" killing the village scene nearly ruined the movie for me it was so bad - not only the acting but the 3 finger blood streak was also lame cliché and looked really fake bad.Acting:7 CGI:7 Soundtrack:6 Script:5 Plot:5.5 Character Development:4 Pacing:4Who will bring balance to the Force now?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Force put me to sleep,"Director J.J. Abrams (""Lost,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" ""Mission: Impossible III"") steps into the future (again) to bring the latest of the Star Wars trilogy to the big screen. Not seeing any of the prior movies, I was poised and ready for an exciting film experience. Unfortunately, I feel asleep twice due to boredom. Sure, the spaceships are cool, the futuristic characters are interesting, and traveling through the galaxy looks like fun, but I've seen this all done before in any number of other space travel films/TV series. With something new to look for out of the question, I turned my attention to just enjoying the film for what it was and getting to know the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogue was so basic, I found it hard to stay interested. I was, however, amused to see Harrison Fords' character filled with so much dry-humor, and I now finally understand the attraction of the light-saber. Maybe if some new film technology had been introduced, the overall film would have meant more to this first timer. But, since that didn't happen, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just bored me with its familiarity. One of the highlights of the film was to see Adam Driver (""GIRLS"") step into such an iconic role within the film.

The movie fans have been waiting for,"Often, being an artist who creates something immensely popular is a tricky situation. A work of art, like a certain movie that a young twenty-something director by the name of George Lucas created in 1974, merges with the public consciousness and becomes part of the Zeitgeist.The problem is, artists are human beings. They grow and change and the way they see the world changes. But their art is frozen in time, a ""finished"" product that endures in peoples minds. Given sufficient time between their works, artists who come back to earlier projects have very different views, and that is reflected in their work.Fans, on the other hand, still remember and idolize the original works locked in the time when they grew to love them. When they hear that the artist is producing something new they want and expect a new work that brings them back to who they were when they fell in love with the original.Which brought us to Star Wars episodes I, II, and III. I think it would be fair to say a lot of fans were unhappy with, or at least less than thrilled with, those movies. The movies reflected Lucas' vision of his universe through his eyes twenty some years after he made the first trilogy, and it was different than what fans fell in love with.But for this new trilogy Lucas stepped aside to let a fan create the next chapter of his creation. J.J. Abrams grew up as a fan of the original three films like the rest of us and his work shows it. The new movie is very similar in themes and tone to the original works.Abrams eschews growth for comfort. If he was a chef it would be like forgoing a menu built by practicing molecular gastronomy for a menu with just perfect pizzas. I don't mean this as a knock at all; sometimes all you want is a great slice, and that's what Abrams has made. A perfect slice of the themes and visuals from the original trilogy.Daisy Ridley steps into Mark Hamill's shoes as the child about to start their journey into adulthood (and the force) very capably. With all respect to Mr Hamill, I would venture to say she is at least as capable an actor as he was when he held the role. Mr. Boyega, whom I see as spiritually stepping into the role of Han Solo, does a decent job, although maybe with just a touch less charisma than Ford in the originals, in my opinion.Adam Driver does an excellent job filling the role of villain, portraying a juvenile arrogance mixed with a juvenile insecurity and impulsiveness wrapped around a despicable earnestness in his adoration of evil.And finally, as in the original films, the droids play a strong role. BB-8 is amazing as the cool robot that you wish you could own with the adorable personality of a puppy. They provide comic relief during tense moments and express the audience's emotions during the tragic ones.Just for the sake of brevity I will say that the rest of the cast was excellent as well. With the exception of Oscar Isaac portraying the fighter pilot Poe Dameron and Harrison Ford reprising his original role, their roles were much more limited, but what screen time they did get was well done.So to sum it all up, this is the perfect film for fans of the original trilogy. With tons of references and call-backs to the originals, it will have everything you are looking for, done well and with a lot of heart. If you loved the original Star Wars, you will love this one as well. And if you are too young to have started with the original trilogy, this film is a great place to start a new love affair.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding!!!,"I'm not going to say much about this outstanding sequel film, but this Episode 7 alone rips the last three apart with the force! LOL!The last three were pretty good, but this one Jedi crushed em all! I can't wait for episode 8!A mash up on the classic film and the new ones, which in turn is absolutely amazing!!The cast were phenomenal!Story and action are perfect!Im not a big fan but i think i am now!Definitely getting this on blu-ray!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force is strong with this one,"Welcome from Michael Lai's Magical Movie Reviews: ""Ahhhhhh!"" That's the sound you'll hear from the majority of Star Wars fans around the world breathing a huge sigh of relief. This is what Star Wars was meant to be, qualities not exhibited in Episodes I and II...characters you cared for, exciting action pieces not dominated by CGI, engaging plot twists and revelations plus a story that doesn't become bogged down with too much technical exposition. It's a combination of the old and the new with characters we remember and love from the original trilogy as well as new characters that have their chance to breathe a life of their own. We have the chance to reminisce with our beloved characters yet be intrigued by what will happen with the new characters. These characterizations ultimately drive the story with the action scenes helping deliver a spectacular and rewarding two hours plus of fun-filled entertainment.Set three decades after the death of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished and the Resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), is trying desperately to locate him before the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) captures him, thus eliminating the main threat to their galactic dominance. Second in command is a Darth Vader figure in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who also has Force-like powers like his idol. The droid, BB8, has been entrusted with the map of the location of Luke. BB8's companion is Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), the best fighter pilot in the Resistance. Poe is captured by the First Order but his escape is assisted by a Stormtrooper in Finn (John Boyega). Meanwhile, BB8 is separated from his companion and winds up in the company of Rey (Daisy Ridley), a young woman living on a desert planet, who is hunting for spare parts to trade for food, just so she can survive. Finn and Rey eventually team up with each other along with old favorites like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).This is the ultimate homage to the original Star Wars trilogy, which some people might complain about as playing it too safe. J.J. Abrams, the director and co-writer of the film, employs traits such as the slide swipe and 'eye' closing between some scenes, but it is this familiarity which will endear him to Star Wars fans. There are several scenes and plot points which you know you have seen before but you can forgive Abrams for doing this as it doesn't alienate the Star Wars fans. As a stand alone film and not comparing it to the original trilogy, it attracts the audience. For that, Abrams deserves credit for bringing in a new legion of fans. He also maintains an up-tempo rate, ensuring that there is never a dull moment.We are emotionally invested in the characters. Daisy Ridley is a newcomer worth keeping an eye on because she portrays the heroine with conviction. Her scenes with Boyega are engaging and they make us care for the fate of their characters, something that wasn't always evident in the rapport between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in the CGI trilogy. Harrison Ford appears in quite a fair bit of the film and shows here how much his acting has improved since the 1977 original. The major villain in Kylo Ren is brilliantly portrayed by Adam Driver and he capably exhibits the rage and angst his character is experiencing.The abundance of CGI which detracted from the first three episodes is thankfully not in evidence here. It's a return to what made the visual effects so special in Episodes IV, V and VI. There are CGI characters (more like motion capture) like Snoke and Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) but they're never as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was. Kudos also to the sound effects team for bringing all those space vehicles to life. You'll feel like you're involved in the action.Other technical aspects to flourish include the superior set decoration, costume design, cinematography and editing, all contributing to the overall pleasures of this movie. Who could forget to mention the score by John Williams? Star Wars and John Williams go hand in hand and again, he has fashioned a score that is exciting and atmospheric. He is a living treasure and we must appreciate every score he composes, now that he is close to the end.As a side note, this is the first Star Wars film not released by 20th Century Fox and it's sad to not hear the 20th Century Fox fanfare that introduces a Star Wars movie. It's a good thing though that Disney, the studio that has acquired the rights from George Lucas, didn't include its usual ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" tune and the image of the fireworks above the castle to introduce the film. Those iconic words to begin a Star Wars film...""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" will give you goosebumps.Disney plans to release a new Star Wars film in 2017. If the adventures of these characters, both and old and new are anything to go by, the next sequel promises to be an exciting chapter in the Star Wars franchise. The hype won't be as big for that installment but the hype for Episode VII has certainly been justified. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"SPOILER-FREE Honest Review of ""The Force Awakens""","First and foremost, even IF someone has spoiled this movie for you or you read some of these butthurt 1-star reviews...go into this movie with no expectations, and you will be given a truly spectacular treat.From the get-go, the film puts you right in the middle of the action. Our heroes, ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and desert-dwelling scavenger Rey (the beautiful Daisy Ridley) are introduced, and their mission, to resist the evil First Order, begins. This is only the START of what's to come next.The villains are sinister, action is non- stop, the lightsaber duels are breathtaking, and the Force is in full swing again. It's a joy to see Princess Leia, Han, Luke, Chewie and the droids again. Both myself and my inner child were fully pleased, and I can't wait til Episode 8 comes out.My only minor complaint would be there was a few misplaced (very) self-aware humor moments scattered around the movie. Could've done without these, but at least they didn't go the ""Age of Ultron"" route...Yes, there are a lot of questions left to be answered and characters to be developed, but I think these nay-sayers are forgetting this is part of a TRILOGY, meaning we have two more movies to get answers and expand the characters.Overall I would rate this a B+ (in the grand scheme of Star Wars films). I will always remember the night I went to see ""The Force Awakens"" and am getting chills just thinking of what may come next!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pathetically average,"There is a lot to expect from a franchise that has produced 6 memorable movies so far and created some internationally beloved characters. Some have been better, some (I and II) have been worse. But if you decide to make a sequel to the original story, you have to do better than that. The fact that Disney bought Lucas films could be seen all throughout the movie, from start to finish- with a somewhat feminine looking villain-Kylo Ren, a few sad attempts at bringing in new characters and a lot of unnecessarily mellowed down scenes, just so the movie could be rated suitable for everyone to see- exactly what Disney were going for. All-in-all, The Force Awakens was a sad attempt to follow up on a legendary series, and the only thing that awoke while watching this movie was my desire to see a real movie, which is not watered down by the urge to shatter box office records and please children. If there was one positive from the whole experience, it was that it made me re-watch all of the previous 6 movies beforehand, which, unlike watching the 7th, was a real joy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force has Awoken in me.,"It's an awesome time to be alive when your life co-exists at a time when 'Star Wars' ruled the cinema screens. This is the film I was looking for. Being reunited with some old friends brought a nostalgic smile to my face as I returned to a time long ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It was simply coming home for this 'Star Wars' fanatic. Before I even thought about reviewing this latest installment, 'The Force Awakens', I had to see a viewing not once but twice. The first was out of pure excitement and after allowing my brain to process what I had just seen, I took a quick trip to the local cinema and relive the magic all over again.J.J. Abrams has to be commended for taking on this massive task. The self confessed fan knows exactly what 'Star Wars' means to the countless souls throughout the world but in saying this, the man is a professional and does get paid the big bucks. What Abrams has done well is instantly transporting the audience back to galactic worlds where the forces of good and evil are played out in an eternal struggle for supremacy. Against the backdrop of wonderful galactic arenas and timeless characters it doesn't take long for the audience to know that they are watching something uniquely 'Star Wars'. J.J has introduced new characters to drive the fresh direction of the space saga but is still respectful of the past by casting familiar faces that have made the 'Star Wars' epic so special. Abrams experience with the rebooted 'Star Trek' series has given him the knowledge and wisdom to recreate an epic universe and recognise the importance of George Lucas's story.'The Force Awakens' begins thirty years after the events of 'Return of the Jedi'. A map containing the whereabouts of the legendary Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), is placed into a BB8 droid by a resistance fighter named Poe Dameron (Oscar Issacs) before he is captured by the New Order led by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who possesses the power of the force. And so the episode begins and it isn't long before we are introduced to Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) who cross paths with each other on the junkyard planet of Jakku. They are forced to escape the planet with the BB8 droid after being tracked by the enemy and it is here that they fortuitously run into Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Together, they all set about returning the droid back to the Resistance before the New Order can intercept them. The Millennium Falcon races across the galaxy where General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) awaits the precious cargo. Absolutely brilliant stuff!The new cast of Ridley, Boyega, Issacs and Driver drive this new trilogy for a new generation. Each have created their own piece of history in the 'Star Wars' saga and need to continue to grow in the roles that they have created just as the original cast did before them. Daisy Ridley looks very comfortable in her starring role and doesn't seem overwhelmed by the magnitude of the narrative. Ridley works well with John Boyega with each increasingly familiar in the others presence. Harrison Ford is prominent throughout the film as his timeless character, Han Solo, effortlessly engaging with the younger cast members. Han's relationship with his lifelong mate, Chewbacca, oozes charm and is worth the price of admission alone. They truly are two of the greatest characters ever to grace the cinematic screen.J.J. Abrams has delivered an engrossing space fantasy that will satisfy the fans who have waited for the magic to one day return. He has been respectful to George Lucas's story but has had enough vision to open up avenues that the rest of the trilogy must explore. With the baton being past to a new Director for the next installment, the final trilogy has the potential for greatness. It is calling to us all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"What you heard is true, all of it.","In short, this could have been good, perhaps great in its own right as it has been over 30 years since ROTJ. It fell short on all fronts: character introduction, depth, development, empathy and purpose. Some veteran actors did well with what they could with what they had (remaining). Yet interactions of known characters were so short and shallow when passion was needed most. Every scene was quick and snappy with zero time for the viewer to soak in the world or situation, just pushed around to the next scene. Even panned shots and close- ups of vehicles were rushed and the fights predictable. I won't comment on the plot at all or the lack of story depth. This was only a sci-fi motion picture going through the motions. What you heard is true...all of it. A shame.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Amazing Movie that will inspire the next generation,The Force Awakens is better than all of the prequel trilogy movies. It has a lot of scenes that are similar to A New Hope. That doesn't effect the movie in a negative manner but boosts the audiences interest in it. The characters are amazing and the reveals are brilliant. They make X wing pilots cool and bring a whole new take on the story that does a great job at continuing the story from the original trilogy. I felt a lot of emotion watching this and am glad that a new generation will be introduced to Star Wars in such an amazing way.I grew up watching the prequel trilogy and it did its job at hooking the next generation on the Star Wars saga. This sequel trilogy will continue to add a new generation to this saga.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I enjoyed this entry into the Star Wars universe more than the prequels,"My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed.The story is a bit of a retread of the first Star Wars film, but I was expecting it to be more so than it was. I felt it had enough new to offer to keep me entertained. Well, like in the first film, a droid is tasked with the final piece of the puzzle as Luke Skywalker has been missing and a new order has arisen to fill the void of the evil Galactic Empire left behind. A young girl and a storm trooper who has had enough will try to get the droid back to the resistance fighters lead by General Leia who is desperately trying to find Luke. They shall get help from Han Solo who has gone back to smuggling and Chewbacca ever loyal Wookie. The new order though has a new weapon that takes the power of the sun to cause devastation and a new evil has appeared in the form of Kylo Ren, a man who wishes to be better than Vadar!It was cool seeing Harrison Ford as Han again and some of the old favorites. Han is about the only one from the original films to make more than basically a cameo appearance though. The new characters are pretty good as Fin the former storm trooper was a bit interesting as was Rey, a mysterious girl who seems to harbor some force powers of her own. My favorite new addition though was Poe as he was very enthusiastic and I am hoping he has a more extended role in the next film. I liked Kylo Ren at first, but he deteriorated kind of badly as the film went along and I am kind of hoping they introduce another Sith lord in the next film, because Ren just did not seem quite competent enough to poise much of a threat without some backup. As I said, the film felt a bit weak during its final act and this character was one of the reasons I felt it weak. As for the new Deathstar, I thought it looked cool and I loved it when that one commanding officer ordered it fired and it took out three planets, but at the same time, one would think they'd stop making them with such obvious weak points!So overall, I thought it was a good film. I am not sure it really warrants all this undue hatred I have seen from various people, nor do I really seeing it being the most awesome film ever. It was a pretty good Star Wars film and to me it felt like a Star Wars film, had they put a bit more effort into the conclusion I would have probably given it a nine, but an eight to me is a good film. A lot of movies this year have gotten eights, as very few movies released lately have really pushed my buttons enough for a higher score with the exception of the latest Mad Max film which is my favorite film I saw in theaters in 2015. This one though capped the year off nicely as I did not see anything that I did not enjoy at the theater this year. If this film had disappointed me like the prequels this would have been the last Star Wars film I was going to see, but I will be seeing the next installment which would be the eighth. Still unsure if I want to watch the Rogue Squadron one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nice plot, great effects, Loved it","First of all, I don't know why there are people really bashing this movie. It is actually very good. I am already a fan since 1977, when the first...or better said, the fourth episode was released. And now, 32 years after episode VI, there is finally the continuation...sort of. No more Empire. Now there is the New Order. The interesting thing is that the 32 years that passed since episode VI, is also the time that passed in the story. Leia and Han have a son who appears in the story. I won't tell who or what he is... You should see this for yourself. Unlike episode I where an idiot figure like Jar Jar Binks appeared, speaking a ridiculous English, there is a nice new robot, named BB- 8. In short, I loved the movie, the action, the effects, and let's not forget the awesome 3D. Definitely worth watching...more than once. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
J. J. Abrams reboots another franchise and literally knocks this one out of the galaxy,"With all due respect to George Lucas, J. J. Abrams has taken this incredible franchise to the next level and added a little more dimension to the once rusty characters that the original master created. The movie itself has absolutely stunning graphics and a new story line, which was very well constructed. In a hyphenated word it is awe-inspiring and well worth the price of admission.So, pack up the kids and go see it today and be part of this movies' already historic record-breaking opening weekend (over half a billion dollars made worldwide).

Old and young Star Wars fans will enjoy this epic second revive of Star Wars!,"I just got back from the cinema. My gut tells me 10/10, of course! That was kind of obvious when feeling the hype that's been raining all over the internet these last few weeks. But where to begin, when I try to describe my emotions after watching it?Maybe I can start off with this: Star Wars fans, old and new, you will most assuredly feel a chill spreading through your body and warming your heart when you see Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill on the big white screen again, resulting in goosebumps arising on your skin while your heart pumps just a little faster from the joy. It was truly amazing to see all of these three actors back in action again. It's just so delightful to see that age isn't necessarily an obstacle for being the star of a legendary world class movie (which can gross $238.000.000 in one day.) Moving on, of course we can not forget the phenomenal new additional characters to the Star Wars franchise: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver just to mention the most important ones. I am so happy that these are the people who were casted to revive the Star Wars universe once again after a second long break (luckily, I am from the 90s, so I only had to endure one of them.) But maybe it was all for the best though; to give the franchise time to manifest itself in us for generations (talking about both my father, grandfather and me for instance.) Anyway, this new cast must also get a very big applause for their excellent work and for not being too intimidated by the franchise due to what it has become today.I would say the movie perfectly unites the original Star Wars trilogy (4-6) with the latter Star Wars movies (1-3) by recasting the SAME brilliant actors (who are still acting brilliant, despite their age) and introducing fresh, new and young actors who so eloquently live up to the high standards of their predecessors.Of course, you will also get to see the epic, mandatory light saber duel, which in this movie at least keeps up with the recent Star Wars movies. Whether or not it is as good as the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan duel on Mustafar is up to you to decide, but personally I think this one added a nice extra element to it. At last, I feel obligated to mention that Star Wars fans all over the world will be thrilled to notice certain familiar elements from the past movies (like a certain light saber perhaps; that is in no way a spoiler by the way) and much other stuff, which I will gladly send you in to watch by fully recommending it to you.So grab your family or friends and head to the movies as long as it's still on in the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lazy mess spray-painted gold and covered in sparkles.,No Spoilers.This film is a weak rehash of everything you have previously seen. If you have seen the previous trilogy you have already seen this film done far better. Poor writing all around. Underdeveloped characters and loads of deus ex machina. Lots of convenient and contrived plot points. Lots of recycling from previous films. This film relies entirely on the nostalgia of its viewers and fails to bring anything new or interesting.Poor pacing. The film has a lot of action but not much breathing room or build up. You will find yourself wondering why you are supposed to care pretty often. Even when big moments happen they feel rushed and undercut by the need for the filmmakers to keep the train rolling to the next shot. About the only things this film pulls off well are the special effects and music. other than that it is not worth anyone's time.,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion of This Movie.,"The Franchise we all know and love is back, and guess what? It's BETTER THAN THE PREQUELS! While it doesn't quite top the originals, it comes so close. The movie is so close to perfection!While many will complain the lack of screen time each character gets, everything else works out perfect! The new comers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are near perfection. There were times when they had a few corny and unfunny lines to deliver, which did not work, but the newcomers do the best job. The casting choice in this one is way better than the prequels.J.J. Abrams does his best to make it like Star Wars and not Star Trek and i think that is what brings this movie to life in so many ways. Everything you knew of the original Star Wars has been brought back to life, and it's as if you are a child again! Sometimes you could never tell what was CGI and what was a costume. The main villain is not only different, but extremely terrifying. I will not spoil anything, but let's just say it was not what you were expecting.All in all, there are some terrific and emotional, breathtaking moments in this film that will go down in the history of the Star Wars franchise.All your favourite characters are back, and it's a breath of fresh air! I am giving this 5/5 stars. May the force be with you. -JayFor my review of The Force Awakens, I will indeed not to give away spoilers to ruin the fun and solid return to roots for the franchise but I will say what I loved about TFA.Firstly, forget the prequels that had surfaced a couple of years back and embrace the continuing saga of the Star Wars universe, taking place at least 30 years after the exciting conclusion of The Return of the Jedi. The story introduces new characters for both from the good side (New Republic) and it's foes (Galactic Empire) and brings back the iconic characters from the original trilogy, sharing some awesome scenes of emotion, full scale action set-pieces, development and even setting the tone for the future episodes VIII and IX.The acting from John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and such are all tops, they each give a solid treatment to their roles that enable them to develop further with the plot and set their future roles into the coming episodes.The direction is a solid job well done by J.J. Abrams, who manages to keep not only the original elements of the trilogy but gives a polished refreshing look and tone to the new trilogy that is bound to keep fans and audiences revamp their love for the franchise.Overall, this is the film that will indeed win you over again and again while being labelled as the best instalment of the series to date. Go see it not only once, but multiple times as it's worth the hype and word of mouth.5/5 - Nick",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything we thought it was and more....,"I'll keep it brief. J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt took one of the most iconic movies and used it as a road map, knowing that we all fell in love with it when we were 8 and knowing that we will all get that same warm and fuzzy feeling seeing it again 30 years later. Knowing that we've yearned for a return to form...and also understanding that it worked on the 8 year old's of yesteryear, it was destined do the same for today's youth. There was just enough laugh out loud humor, just enough nostalgia and self recognition of it, and there was also a sense that the new protagonists were fans of Star Wars themselves...I truly think (and hope) the writers should use this as a warm memory to Episode IX only to reel us in and shatter our expectations, changing directions and introducing both young and old to uncharted, yet familiar systems.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"'The Force Awakens' sticks to its roots, introduces great new characters","The Force has indeed awakened, ""Star Wars"" fans. Thanks to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm we have been gifted a new movie and all the excitement and anxiousness that comes with it. And while it has only been 10 years since the last new ""Star Wars,"" it has been more than 30 years of wondering what happens to the beloved characters of the original trilogy after ""Return of the Jedi."" And so, it is at times a teary-eyed delight to see these old friends return to the big screen.Therefore, before a single trailer surfaced, ""The Force Awakens"" was rife with nostalgia, and few directors understand the sensitivities of nostalgia the way J.J. Abrams does. His film ""Super 8"" was an exercise in '80s nostalgia and his reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise also demonstrated respect for decades-old and beloved sci fi/fantasy with massive, dedicated followings. It made him the clear choice – and the safest choice – for ""Star Wars: Episode VII.""In collaboration with writer Lawrence Kasdan (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Return of the Jedi"") and based on some work from Oscar- winner Michael Arndt, Abrams crafts a new ""Star Wars"" chapter that is in turn very safe, but safe in the way of warm old blanket that has been patched back up with some new fabric. Abrams and Kasdan identify and distill classic ""Star Wars"" tropes and re-forge them into a new movie, sometimes down to even the plot details. The result is a constant feeling of familiarity coursing throughout the film and branding it as unequivocally ""Star Wars."" Even many of George Lucas' directing hallmarks are adapted in a show of humble reverence.This was, in many ways, a strategic first move back into ""Star Wars"" by Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy because it makes ""The Force Awakens"" somewhat impervious to criticism. By sticking so closely to the formula of old ""Star Wars"" films, the choice for the creative direction can be attributed to homage. That's how you appease fans – they can't complain if what you give them is a near replica of what they fell in love with in the first place.""The Force Awakens"" is truly a film for the fans in this way, with new characters and ideas introduced with a measure of subtlety. The inclusion of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill along with Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 serve not only the purpose of appeasing fans, but also as a way to transition the story to the new characters, a passing of the torch, of sorts. These folks – ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn (John Boyega), skilled scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) and the adorable ball droid BB-8 – are the real gems of ""The Force Awakens"" in their performances and characters (not unlike the fresh faces of ""A New Hope"" at one time were) and will take future episodes to great new corners of the galaxy.What feels new – or what Abrams adds to the ""Star Wars"" universe – is a greater sense of danger and an appropriate degree of complexity. I wouldn't call ""The Force Awakens"" violent, but there's an added realism and grit to the violence to the action sequences of this film that Lucas seemed to avoid in all six previous episodes – and it makes a difference. There's so much more tension and suspense. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren also brings an element of unpredictability and complexity to the pantheon of ""Star Wars"" villains, who have usually been very stoic, enigmatic and dignified. Ren is none of these, though arguably he aspires to be.But complexity doesn't necessarily translate to depth. ""The Force Awakens"" comes off as purposefully vague at times (about character history and anything that's happened in the last 30 years) and doesn't linger on one idea or in one place for very long. The story moves at hyper-speed, as if by avoiding any stationary activity it can stave off the many questions the audience will surely have about, well, everything. It wants to be fun and exciting, not bog you down with details about how the First Order came to power, what went on between Leia and Han since we last saw them, why the Rebellion is now the Resistance, etc.The most common negatively inclined thought one will probably have throughout the film or after is: ""I expected there to be something more to that."" And that's probably what Abrams preferred. Better you should be upset with something you wanted to see because it means you were intrigued, than because something was in the movie that you despised. Whatever questions you had, whatever characters you wanted to know more about or see more of, can be addressed in the next two films. It's a smart move.But most importantly, Abrams puts the emphasis back on the characters and that's why ""The Force Awakens"" works and will win audiences over. The actors and the story give us enough of the characters to care about their journey, in the same way we did in ""A New Hope."" That's the essence of ""Star Wars"" and that's why fans will be clamoring for ""Episode VIII.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Uninspired, paint-by-numbers film-making","The whole film was just dull and adopted too many elements of modern Hollywood. Far too many key events and plot complications were disappointingly familiar. Important characters have little motivation to carry out key plot progress and I kept asking myself ""why does this person even care?""Storm troopers were more incompetent than ever and felt even more disposable than zombies. The off-screen characters were disposable on the same scale as what's typical of a superhero or apocalypse film. As is typical of those genres, viewers of The Force Awakens are led to believe that for some reason, the protagonists are the only ones who can save the day, even though there could in fact be other groups that could get involved if they so desired.There was more humour than in previous films, but much of it was low-brow and equivalent to slapstick, with the punchline being based on various people being stupid. Curiously, I found myself sometimes laughing a sentence before the rest of the theatre patrons, all Americans.I found the new black male protagonist to be about as likable as the brat from Spirited Away. I didn't especially like the new white female protagonist either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredible stuff, even though it's in familiar territory.","After a really long decade Star Wars is back! J.J. Abrams has done us proud. The Force Awakens, or episode VII (the first in a new trilogy of films to come every other year) as it's been named, is a superb science-fiction film. For the die-hard fans its only gripe is it's a little too familiar in territory, but that's genuinely it. For the newer, younger audiences, TFA leads a path to what's to come. When the blue letters 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' followed by the trademark yellow words swiping up the starry backdrop, I felt like I was 11 again. There's a strong scent of nostalgia mixed in to the story, but for every old memory there's 10 new ones. So many emotions washed through me within a short space of time, as I know my expectations (and everyone else's) are, and were, going to be met. It only takes a few seconds to know we're in the capable hands of someone who's a major fan himself.Now briefly on to what he's given us. The light side hangs in the balance. The forces of darkness, now known as the First Order, are stronger, bigger, more formidable than ever before. Characters on either side are equal throughout. TFA opens up the SW universe. Jakku's desert looks splendid, derelict AT-AT walkers and Star Destroyers are left abandoned and new arrivals provide different personalities that I want to know so much more about. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren switches from intimidating foe to deeply torn adolescent. All five main newbies (Isaac's fighter pilot Poe, Ridley's feisty girl Ray, Boyega's runaway Fin, Gleeson's evil man Snoke and Driver's Sith) get there chance to shine, just as the older ones so dear to me do as well.I'm eager to see The Force Awakens again, and even more for the next chapter. Episode VII will keep me feeling happy and young for a long time after its release. Next up, a spin-off called Rogue One!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Awakens played it safe.,"Now we have to be honest, if you bought a franchise for 4 billion dollars: would you be bold and risk the longevity of the story for one good motion picture, or would you stick to what works and lay the foundation of an everlasting franchise?This is what the movie feels like: predetermined, characters must live as they lay the foundation of episode VIII and IX. There can not be any profound story twists that make it harder for future sequels. Everything is also very familiar, revisiting old plot lines. New characters are likable, but they feel like watered down versions of the original characters with the same story arcs. With less screen time and character development.There is also a strong presence of nostalgia, introducing the same artwork and design from the original trilogy. Also the introduction of SW veterans Luke, Leia and Han. Yet here their presence is poor and basically have no memorable scenes. I would go to the certain extent and say the screenwriters even took the liberty of being bold in such a bad manner with these characters. In many ways I feel they were just in it to secure the passing of the torch to the new generation.I am from the generation that actually watched prequel trilogy before watching the original one and by any means is not a SW fan. I did not experience the same SW hysteria when original was made. But I see a great divide here on IMDb, most people either hate it or love it. I think it has a great production value and had it been any other stand-alone science fiction, I would have given it an 8. I have a principle of trying to not judge a film by comparing it to others but rather on the basis of its genre. The movie is actually great fun and a well-crafted adventure. But it is built on an existing legacy. Star Wars exist and I can not ignore the fact that a lot of this movie is a blue print on the original trilogy. Good storytellers say they have drawn inspiration from other movies and created something original (ex. The Dark Knight is modeled after Heat, weird huh?). This movie pretends to do so, although here in SW Universe there is a direct link between the movies.Now, to my initial question: If I bought something for 4 billion dollars, heck I would not even dare touch it with a kilometer long stick. This is the mentality of this production and the current trajectory of mainstream movie-making. Hollywood rely on major franchises and peddle mostly on nostalgia, true originality is hard to come by these days. TFA is no exception.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Old fashioned good vs. evil,"I wrote a review for the prequels saying that maybe George Lucas made a mistake using current world affairs as a means to tell how Star Wars came to be; trade negotiations, the war on terrorism, and the rise of imperialism in the government. But they were his mistakes to make in his legacy. But I accepted the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars. In fact, my family still has the home video recordings from when the originals aired on HBO in the 80's and I'm standing by those instead of the 2000 upgrades. As for TFA, I'm standing by it because I believe J.J. Abrams has gone back to the roots of Star Wars: good vs. evil. Before I went to see it, I asked my brother one question, 'Is there a preview scene after the credits?' I didn't want any spoilers or hints and he didn't have anything bad to say about it either.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Everything is Bigger, Bigger, Bigger and Feminist Awakens is Made for SJW's","Disney has taken Star Wars and PC-ed it to no shame.From the trailer, when it was first shown, the first comments feminists stated was how wonderful to see a black, a female and a Latino together and no white males. How wonderful it is for the world.Sci-Fi used to be made for men and it was great. Now what we have is the female awakening and Disney pandering to the fake audience and snot nosed kids who think Taylor Swift is an exceptional singer.This is made for the Disney Generation, the kids who were in diapers when the PREQUELS got made. The current SJW's, BLM's and feminists will adore this film as all creativity is gone, replaced with plot stolen from the first trilogy. At least the prequels tried to be original. Episode 7 is just stealing.This was a wet dream for many and the female lead is a unicorn. Untrained in the force, she is more powerful than Luke, Vader, Palpatine and Old Ben combined. They even ripped off Yoda with a female who was supposed to be older than Yoda but with more vitality? They made sure you knew it was not your daddy's Star Wars many times. While male Yoda was old and fragile, the older female Yoda was spry and hits on Chewy.It is devoid of real substance and plot. Instead it is BIGGER Deathstar? We have Stormtroopers but not Stormtropper, they are FIrst Order Troopers? Palpatine but not Palpatine as we have Snoke aka Gollum? There were a couple of scenes that made sure to let you know who they were pandering to. During the Rebels attacking the First order; the camera cuts to a Black pilot, then Asian female pilot, Alien, Alien, Latino. I chalked this up to everyone else accusing men of being chauvinistic, but another scene they did it again making sure you know this was NOT your daddy's Star Wars.This movie had cheesy one liners meant for kids to laugh to cover up plot holes. There was ZERO memorable scenes or musical scores. They even tried to re-hash the shock of ""I am your father,"" but obviously it fell flat.This reminds me of Terminator Genysis. They sacrificed the real fans who loved T1 and T2, for the bratty snot nosed PC crowd who loves everything they are told to love. Hipsters at their best who rely on others to make decisions for them.Luke was a side character and a rehash of Obi. Same out fit to boot. He is looking for, I kid you not, the FIRST Jedi Temple. This was a very videogamey plot to explain how the Empir.....I mean First Order rises.This movie lacked drama and seemed to be scenes just strung together. The characters were emotionless robots. Han and Leia had no chemistry. My gosh they had a kid and were together for a long time. In fact Han, Chewy, C3PO and R2D2 were just thrown in as an afterthought and to make money off the REAL fans.The plot actually has the Empire being annihilated by the First Order. This was the writers letting you know that this ""Star Wars is for the new generation and too bad real fans, Disney needs more money and the Disney/Gamer/SJW generation will give it.""Star Wars TFA was a letdown. it is not a continuation but a remake, a re-imagining, a poorer re-telling of the originals except BIGGER DeathStar;BIGGER Dark Lords; BIGGER explosions; BIGGER, BIGGER, BIGGER!!!!If you are a Hipster easy 8, If you are a purist, it is a 5. This is truly an SJW's wet dream.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great Film if you understand context and managed expectations,"I loved this movie, immensely. It was fantastic. Too many people let hype culture kill their experience or something else.. I didn't. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I've spent so much time with Star Wars throughout my life and this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and fun. I am very excited for the upcoming releases, don't let the negative nancies ruin the movie for you. A movie can have flaws and still be fantastic, I don't understand why some people can't grasp that!Their was nostalgia, joy, laughter, sadness, tension, and even remorse. It was a plethora of emotion, with tons of nostalgia to show ""hey we know the prequels were a letdown and we want to do this right."" the setup for the next films had me thinking so deeply about this film, and that's a good thing!When Empire was out the movie ended on a huge cliffhanger, people had questions, were disappointed, and they let the fact of that ruin their experience. This movie does not tell you everything, or spell it out for you, and that's let some people have their experiences ruined.

The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!
The visuals were amazing, the plot got me intrigued. Got no complaints about the acting, it all seemed to fit the individual characters imo.
Out of all of them, Rey definitely got to me the most. Her longing for a place to call home and for people to call her family and belong with is something I can understand, so I felt for her. I thought she was cool on screen, but you should hear my little ones - they were practically gushing about her (still are), and well - that sealed the deal.

Enjoyed the performances of the old Star Wars stalwarts. An action packed thriller for fans and new fans alike!

And the one-liners in the Movie... oh.... my... god... From the first minute until the last 20 maybe, just LOADED With stupid one-liners and the black guy just playing a typical black guy action role.Remove the light-sabres and the Movie would kick ass as a star trek Movie or something. But belonging to the epic star WARs opera it does not give what it could have.The 7 is just for the Movie on it's own.

"Better than 1 & 2, Worse than 3, 4 & 5","""This will begin to make things right."" The film starting with that line infuriates me. Though the prequels are not held in high esteem, the thought that this movie would course correct the franchise is asinine. Starting on a self-righteous note definitely leaves a sour note.That being said, this movie is a solid entry in the Star Wars universe. The ground work is set and it's a good re-introduction to the galaxy far, far away. The plot is formulaic and follows the structure of ""A New Hope"" very closely. That's not a bad thing, but it does lack some originality. The new trio of Rey, Finn and Poe is interesting. The legacy of the original trio, while in the background, is a joy to watch.There are some chill inducing moments, most coming in the third act involving one of the heroes and Kylo Ren. The humor wasn't too much for me and I found myself enjoying the banter between the characters. The lightsaber choreography is weaker than the prequels, but the action as a whole is decent.In the end, I like ""The Force Awakens"". It's definitely better than episodes 1 and 2, but worse than 3, 4, and 5. I find myself putting this movie in the same tier as ""Return of the Jedi"".Best Character: Finn

"The Force Awakens delivers, and is true to form.","Star Wars episode 7 certainly seemed to continue the ring composition that we find throughout the Star Wars series. ... (SPOILER WARNING)... Rey's humble beginning on a dessert planet seemed very reminiscent to Anikan and Luke Skywalkers humble beginning on a dessert planet. All three characters leave their dessert home world to become a Jedi. All three of their characters go through similar experiences in each movie. This is interesting because all three movies are the first movie in their respective trilogies. All three of them have certain similarities with one another. Episode 7 has a cantina scene like episode 4 does. Another thing I would like to point out is that Rey's mentor/father figure in this movie meets the same fate Quigon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi met in the Phantom Menace and a New Hope. The mentor/father figure dies in each film. Which leaves our protagonists with new mentors. Obi- Wan in the prequel trilogy, Yoda in the sequel trilogy, and Luke in the new trilogy. It's interesting that Rey finds Luke hiding in exile, which is similar to Luke finding Yoda on Dagobah. It is also interesting that the mentor character in the Force Awakens falls down a large shaft when he dies which is similar to the way Darth Maul and Darth Sidious die. I noticed that the Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens have some striking similarities. Specifically the climaxes of all three films. All three films have a multi-layered climax. All three films have a space battle, a ground battle, and a light saber fight. The battles are very similar by the way. In Return of the Jedi and the Force awakens we see that they need to destroy the shield generator from the ground in order to destroy the Death Star/ Star Killer Base. Phantom Menace does the same thing except in reverse. In Phantom Menace they have to destroy the space station from space in-order to deactivate the droid army on the ground. We are seeing many of the same ideas played with different chords. It's sort of like Star Wars is just a giant chiasm. The light saber fight in the Force Awakens sort of mirrors the one we see in Return of Jedi because in both movies the villain is trying to convert the hero to the dark side. We also get to see a sort of trench run take place at Star Killer base like it did in a New Hope. I noticed ring composition in the new film. Kylo Ren's character also sort of mirrors Anikan Skywalkers character. The chiasm continues.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Could new characters be introduced that engaged our hearts with emotion and excitement as Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Darth and the Droids did? I am writing this to tell you THE FIRE HAS BEEN RE-IGNITED! The Force Awakens has managed to re- kindle the fire of Star Wars. The new characters draw the viewer in and make you care about what happens to them (something Ep. 1-3 failed to do). The connection to the familiar old characters didn't feel forced and made it fun. I can't wait to see Episode VIII! I need to see it! I did not think I would feel that way about Star Wars again.

Strong the force with the new cast is,"Daisy earns 10/10 for her intense play. The scenes on her home planet are the best and on par with the ones in 'Hope' as well as Williams' absolutely beautiful 'Scavenger' theme. Finn is a great character and Boyega the perfect actor for it. I like also Drivers subtle performance, he's great as (already very dangerous but still unsure) Vader wannabe. Poe is also a great character and the actor plays the pilot the way I know this optimistic tough guys in reality. the bad guy general as usual in SW has not enough room in the movie to be exposed in depth but is also great play. Snoke was somewhat disappointing but OK.I was a 15 years old when watching the original movie in '78. It changed my live and influenced my choice of profession. But at this time the movie was a revolution. TFA is solid and very entertaining. I can't simply understand why some people are that frustrated. I felt great most of the time even I've missed the simple, dreamy story development of 'Hope'. But this times will never come back. Today everything is fast paced. And considering the way movies are made today, under pressure of a big company, this is perhaps the best we can get.I'm looking forward to see great scenes and moments when Rey will be teached by Luke in EP VIII. This two exceptional actors together will be able to create a remarkable moment in movie history. I hope the director and the script are able too.And Disney: go for risks!

Han Solo went to the bar in the original movie, same here. Princess Lea put the message in R2D2. Now, Poa put it in BB8.

Nostalgic and New Fun,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what can justifiably be termed a cultural event, director J.J. Abrams brings us Episode VII in a film franchise that date backs almost 40 years. While I was one of the lucky ones who waited patiently in line to see the first Star Wars on opening day in 1977, I can only be described as a series fan rather than a Star Wars geek. My bond is with Hans Solo and Chewbaca, so this is not the place to debate the minutiae of costumes, timelines and weaponry.What I can happily report is that Mr. Abrams (he's also directed Star Trek and Mission Impossible films) has found just the right blend of nostalgia, science-fiction, and geeky gadgetry to appeal to the widest of all audiences. The film is an honorable tribute to the previous six in the series, yet it's more than entertaining enough to stand alone for new comers.As we expect and hope for, the screen is filled with fantastical visuals that somehow push our imagination, while at the same time, feel realistic to the story and action. The aerial dogfights are adrenaline-pumping and spectacular in their vividness, and the more grounded action scenes feature Stormtroopers who have clearly had lots of target practice since the previous films.You need only watch the trailer or read the credits to know that some of the old familiar faces are back: Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, Peter Mayhew as Chewbaca, and of course, our old pals C-3P0 and R2D2. Also back is the remarkable composer John Williams – likely to receive his fiftieth (yes, 50!) Oscar nomination for his work here. In addition to the familiar, new faces abound: John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kyle (don't call me Ben) Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Hux. There is also the magic of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, and an all-too-brief sequence featuring Max von Sydow. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o voices Maz Kanata, and there is an impressive list of other cameos available online if you are interested (Daniel Craig being the most eye-raising).Abrams along with action cinematographer extraordinaire Daniel Mindel take full advantage of all available technical aspects in creating stunning visuals and spine-tingling sound. It's a film made to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound system, so ask around if you aren't sure. If you are a long-time fan of Han and Chewy, you'll enjoy catching up with old friends. If you are unfamiliar with the Star Wars galaxy, this latest will hook you into the force.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Time Has Come!,"It is surprising that only 10 to 12 hours of films created the giant franchise we know as Star Wars. People have been waiting for a good Star Wars story ever since Episode 6 came out 32 years ago. Fellow Star Wars fans, I am pleased to tell you, it has come.Everyone knows Star Wars is a sci-fi, action franchise, but this film is very unique for the fact that it goes much deeper. With Evil getting more and more powerful, there is drama and fighting between the characters, but that doesn't stop romance from sneaking in with a little bit of comedy. Granted, I was worried it would turn into a kid's comedy, but quite a few times I found my self thinking that not only are the jokes perfect, they are also not over used!Alright, let's get to the part everyone wants to read, the plot of the most hyped, but hidden film of the decade. The events start out 20 years after what took place in Episode 6, (spoiler alert for people who didn't see episode 6). The Empire has fallen, yes, but a new Evil has risen, known as The First Order. The rebellion needs new Jedi now more than ever, but Luke (Mark Hamill) is missing and they need to find (wait for it) a new hope!Is the film worth the wait? Ever since almost a year ago, people have been talking about new Star Wars episode, and it is SO worth it. Famous directors have taken on some great challenges before, including Spielberg finishing Kubrick's AI. But J.J. Abrams took on something completely out of the ball field trying to continue Star Wars. The cinematography is spectacular, the ending shot (no spoiler) is one of the greatest endings I have ever seen in a film, and the whole story itself is unexpected and very enjoyable. Although there are many aspects that are not in the original Star Wars films, I think it is actually very nice to see Star Wars not get ruined, but go through its own evolving evolution.As for the acting, of course, the original A-Team - Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and more – are phenomenal and I think it was the perfect idea to bring these characters back for the pure enjoyment of long standing fans. However, it is really Daisy Ridley who steals the show. Her character, Rey, is so fresh and unique, full of emotion, and this character (still no spoilers, sorry) goes through so much drama in the film. It must have been a very hard role to play. Daisy gives it 110%. I predict she will be win an Oscar nomination for this role.The special effects obviously got better since the last Star Wars film in the early 2000s, and I still want to mention how breathtaking they are. Even for 2015, with all the CGI aliens, ships and spectacular space scenes, it is quite literally ""eye candy."" My only criticism of the film is that it is a bit too long. However, not one single scene is out of place or feels unneeded.One of my favorite scenes is when we are reunited with Hollywood's favorite space ship. Rey and Finn (John Boyega) are trying to escape The First Order. They have two options for space flight, a ""piece of junk"" or another space ship. Well, the space ship gets blown up and it turns out the ""piece of junk"" is the millennium falcon! Of course, everyone cheers, claps and whistles in the audience once the camera shows the breathtaking ship. It is not only enjoyable, and a bit funny, but the camera technique is perfect. If you want to know the rest of the story, go get your tickets and watch the film!This film is actually pretty mature. It isn't as kind as episodes 1, 2 and 3. It has its violence, so I recommend it for ages ten to eighteen. And, adults who saw previous Star Wars films and appreciate them will enjoy this film as well. I give it five out of five stars, because, even if it is a little bit boring in the middle, (it is 2 hours and 10 minutes long) J.J. Abrams, the cast and crew achieved the impossible and created a new masterpiece that can be proudly added to the Star Wars franchise. I am also glad to say that, for the first time in over 20 years, Star Wars returns! You can see Star Wars: The Force Awakens in theaters starting December 18th!Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

Good - but lacks a little soul,"While this film is an improvement on some of the prequil movies such as Attack of the Clones, which were a disappointment, it lacks the soul and character the original 3 had.The plot was very vague and oversimplified and the character development was also lacking.However there were some great performances from Ridley and Boyega and of course Ford always delivers a good performance.It felt a little too much like a ""Disney"" film, although it was nice to see Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford again. The movie feels too much like a Star Trek film and this is where Abram's influence shows. It was a mistake not to allow Lucas to direct. The movie did have its positive aspects and had great action and special effects. I think most fans are relieved that the movie didn't suck.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Best Star Wars since ""Empire""","""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..."" When those famous words appeared on the silver screen once again, followed by the galactic logo and title crawl, the crowd cheered and I felt like a little, excited kid all over again. Seeing the Star Wars logo in the theater again solely almost brought tears to my eyes. What followed was a film that was everything I dreamed it would be. Dazzling, exhilarating, funny, and heart-breaking. This film brought me back to the world of Star Wars.While a little weak on a formulaic plot, The Force Awakens has no shortage of great characters. With many of the original characters returning, it give you the chills to see some of them together again. Han Solo returns in a role many people were expecting to be more of a mentor role in this film, but he really does stay true to the Han Solo character and does not inspire to be some new Obi-Wan Kenobi or Qui-Gon Jinn. Harrison Ford once again delivers a great performance as the scruffy-looking Nerf herder. Carrie Fisher also returns as now *General* Leia Organa in a somewhat substantial role as does Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, but that's all I'll say about that.While seeing these original characters, along with others like Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO and even the man, the myth, the legend himself, Admiral Ackbar, is fantastic, it is the new characters that really pull you into the film. Daisy Ridley shines a the ass-kicking Rey, who I think will one day be among the greatest of film female heroines. The other heroes of the story include the young men Finn and Poe Dameron, portrayed by John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, respectively. Both men are extremely funny, courageous and are people audiences can really relate and connect to. In addition to our new heroes, we have the new villain: Kylo Ren. There is much more to Kylo Ren than meets the eye, and while he is not as formidable as Darth Vader, he has a lot of depth that audiences can explore and maybe even sympathize with.It's really the characters and their dialog that makes this movie great, but no Star Wars would be complete without a killer soundtrack from John Williams, who once again delivers. In addition, J.J. Abrams' direction is fantastic as he draws the film from script to space and brings Star Wars back to its roots by relying much more on practical effects instead of making another CGI abomination, like so many films we see nowadays.As I stated earlier, The Force Awakens is not without its weaknesses. The plot mainly relies on fate, or rather the Force, and some of the characters get sidelined. General Hux has his moments but he barely gets any characterization. And while they tried of give Gwendoline Christie a bad ass female villain role, Captain Phasma has to have been given one of the lamest roles in a Star Wars movie of all time.Despite that, I haven't had more fun at the movies all year, nor have I been so nervous or even sad; it is an emotional roller coaster that really makes you feel for everyone. If you like Star Wars at all, you will truly love this movie and be begging for more when its over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nostalgia personified,"Mixed feelings on this one. Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another piece of garbage,"I find it absolutely sickening that I paid $15 for this crap. I went there with my g/f and halfway through it we had to leave because it was getting too painful to continue to watch. The theater was nearly full and there was a lot of nervous tension going around and when the opening script started to appear there was a huge round of cheers and my g/f lost by telling folks to quiet down because it was rude. The cheers lasted awhile and most of couldn't here the initial dialogue. The sad part was most folks were clueless on who the actual characters were and didn't understand when older characters appeared. I had to tell the d'bags next to me to shut-up because I didn't want to hear them anymore or the stupidity coming from their mouth. I doubt after this epic failure there will be another episode, with this crap Star Wars is pretty much dead and buried.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good movie,"Well first of all I am great fan of the SW franchise and also a big fan of JJ Abrams. He is indeed a terrific director. I saw this movie along with my wife for the first time as a couple. We really enjoyed the movie in 3D. As far as the story goes it is a typical JJ's way of story telling and it was so cool. As somebody reviewed earlier that JJ is not a fan of SW. Yes I agree but he is a great fan of the Star Trek series and I believe that he has made this movie like a ST movie somewhere on the line. Though a few characters were missing in the movie but still the movie was awesome. Daisy Ridley really stole the show in this movie as well as John Boyega. Oh! And BB8 was so very cute and really caught the heart of the audience. I was actually expecting Mark Hamill to be at least be joining from the middle of the movie but in the end he appeared and looks like his presence in the end will surely be a turning point in the next sequel. The visuals were overall great but it could have been greater but still it was good. I don't know how others judge this movie. Yes... for some people it maybe a disappointment because they would have expected a ""larger than life"" type of this movie but for me it was really great movie and two thumbs up to JJ and his team for the great effort. Keep up the good work JJ...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A part of the summer superhero franchise,"I rarely write reviews since I guess I am just too lazy at times. But Star Wars is perhaps my favorite franchise and this one kind of killed it for me. There is a trend going for Superhero movies and Marvel releases a bunch of them and have even been going for the minor characters now (Ant Man for example). I believe Disney said they were going to do something similar for Star Wars. So we have here a mash-up of some of the original series (4,5 and 6) with basically nothing new. Now if they had marketed this as a remade New Hope I would have nothing to complain but I was expecting a whole new movie. The common thing with most superhero movies is they get pretty high fan and critic ratings (aberrations being Green Lantern perhaps) and they always succeed in the box office. But the issue is Star Wars was much grander and more innovative. However,now it is all part of the same mold--- you feel good after watching it but it does never leave an impression. Thinking of the prequels, while Episode 1 was a bit bad but there were some redeeming moments---the journey through the underwater world, the pod race and the Maul vs Qui Gon fight. Attack of the clones made things complicated and I actually had to re-watch the whole 1st 3 parts to understand exactly what was happening. Political intrigue and Order 66. And it was great to see how different things were before the Dark Side took over. In this one, nothing seems different---what a disappointment. And it still gets a 8.9....Bleh On a separate note, this is also a very politically correct Star Wars, perhaps the first one which is so. Makes me think if we had any of Lucas' originals releasing now, how would critics and audiences have treated them?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force is Strong With this One,"This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy.It literally is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It brings back just about every feeling you could want in a sequel of this nature. The original cast members that return are quite simply Star Wars royalty and all do their jobs excellently. Ford steals the movie as Solo in a performance that will be legendary.The new cast's in Ridley, Boyega, Gleeson, Driver and Isaac are all home runs and they did a great job of laying the ground work for future episodes.The force is strong again... and Star Wars is back in every way possible.

i feel like i should give it an 8 but i don't want to,"not flawless, but still very, very good.what many negative reviews say is that its a ""remake"" rather than a sequel. it certainly seems that way, but it was definitely done that way for a reason: to appease star wars fanboys. you can see so much of a new hope in this movie that its crazy. but that isn't a bad thing. its just something that will cleanly divide viewers of this movie. some people love it, some people criticize it for being this way. personally, i think they went just a little overboard with the nostalgia, but they did what they originally planned to do: revitalize the series, try to remedy the damages done by the prequels, and start off what looks to be a great trilogy. this movie does a lot of setting up, with plot, characters, and even themes. rage is something i had never seen in a sith but it was always said throughout all of the star wars movies that it was a path to the dark side, and this movie really showed that. it also answered a lot of questions that people had coming into this movie.one thing i especially liked are the new characters. finn is very charismatic and rey is a strong independent woman, and they can be correlated with han and leia, but finn its as if they took some of hans qualities out of finn and plugged in some of Luke's original qualities in a new hope, and then did the same with some of the leia qualities in rey. overall, I'm really excited for these characters, and new ones to come (benicio del toro). also, I'm now a fan of Oscar isaac, and while his acting was questionable at times, he did a great job as a character who wasn't really based off of anybody.while we are on the topic of acting, i want to mention that abrams did a great job of taking these D-list actors and turning them into stars.the main reason i couldn't hate all of the correlations with a new hope is because, well, its star wars, and they copied great concepts from a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The torch is passed,"The Force awakens is by far the best Star wars movie to come out. While many fans may have a preference and I got mine as well. We could all argue to ourselves that there could is no denial that the force awakens gives us more depth of every character in one movie than in a whole trilogy for some. Each character carries a rare maturity that has not been seen in a star wars movie yet. If one looks past in imperfections...(or better said) or comparisons of similarities or differences in the other films we could see that: if this movie was to stand alone and be the only star wars movie to come out and we didn't hang on to nostalgia or comparison, we could easily see the force awakens is absolutely brilliant and most people will say their second viewing is much superior to their first viewing due to the facts expectations are gone.And the best part...it's that we still have some more films to look forward to.The force awakens is the PERFECT movie to pass the torch to the next generation. Give into the good side of the force, understand reason and not into your own understanding and see the beauty and truth of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointingly derivative,"I went with my 8 year-old son, who was super excited beforehand, and wasn't disappointed.But I was.I imagine the writing team sat around a table and said ""what are the iconic scenes from the previous films?"", and then rehashed those into the script for The Force Awakens. That said, it was much better than episodes I through III, but that's not really saying a lot.It was a very entertaining film, but it felt like a lazy / nostalgic reboot rather than a continuation of a classic series.I hope the screenwriters can be a bit more original in the next film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It will make billions! Not much more.,"Initially I wasn't going to write a review of Episode VII, but I've just seen a Duracell ad featuring light sabres and it was too much.The Force Awakens is not a bad movie, but it's a pandering to nostalgia, without any courage to explore new ground, motives or motifs. In the attempt to not alienate fans or heaven forbid hurt sales of toys or tie-in products, JJ Abrams rehashed all the key points from the original trilogy. If it were not for BB-8 or Kylo Ren's light sword and the hilt, it would have been devoid of anything original.From the production and directing point of view, there's nothing to reproach to this movie. It's easy to watch, not boring or annoying, but it's utterly unoriginal and a major disappointment in this area. The new characters are bland except maybe for Daisy Ridley's. Adam Driver is completely unconvincing as the villain, John Boyega's Finn could be deleted from the movie without anyone noticing, and as for Han Solo, Harrison Ford delivers, the only bright point in the movie.That's about it. Fans will like it or love it, people new to SW (I know those do exist) can pick up without needing to know the previous films, and it will generate billions in worldwide sales. Mission accomplished. Hopefully JJ will not repeat his inexcusable demolition of the Star Trek franchise. Then again, Star Trek is intelligent and thus can be dumbed down. Star Wars, not so much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"it's true, all of it... i've fallen in love all over again","30 years ago the incredible Star Wars trilogy came to an end, many didn't expect the return of the characters we grew to love and cherish, but now they have returned and JJ Abrams has given us back a world which shaped so many childhoods and i could not be happier. This review will be completely spoiler-free, which will be hard with so much to cover, but i will not be revealing anything here which you didn't already know from trailers.A very basic story outline is that we follow Rey and Finn, two characters who are quite similar in many ways, but who are so interesting to get to know. I won't be revealing anything else because if i do i will literally be treading into spoiler territory. First things first though, Harrison Ford as Han Solo. My god. Han Solo is my favourite character in the entire Star Wars saga. Harrison Ford does such a good job at bringing this character back that he alone shows us why we missed this universe so much. He wasn't shoehorned in either. He played a vital part in the plot and did the best job possible. I loved seeing him and Chewbacca, who was hilarious in this film, step onto the Millennium Falcon for the first time. When the opening title crawl came onto the screen with the iconic John Williams theme playing through the IMAX speaker system my heart swelled with nostalgia and my eyes filled with tears. This was a moment i never expected to see and it could not have been done in a better way. The same goes for Han and Chewie stepping onto the falcon. It was just that good.That being said, the main cast of newcomers were incredible. John Boyega's Finn is such a relatable character who has done wrong and just wants to right that and Oscar Issac as Poe was just the most likable guy ever. But my favourite character in the entire film was Rey. I love Daisy Ridley, she is such a likable person and I had every faith that she would make this role her own and completely shine in this film.. which she did. Getting to know Rey as a character turned out to be the most interesting part of this film for me, which is saying a lot because A LOT happens. As well as this we have our new 'Empire' who are known as the First Order. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was also such a joy to watch. He didn't just play this bad character who was bad for the sake of it. He had real human emotion. He played the character as someone who was fearful and had a sort of emotional vibe which set him apart from other villains in the saga. I was however disappointed by the lack of anything Captain Phasma does in this film.. she is literally the new Boba Fett. Im not saying that is a bad thing, i was just expecting her to do more.I saw this film in IMAX. The locations and set design are stunning. There is a scene where Rey is introduced on Jakku and we see the area, it is so well shot that i felt there and was literally amazed by what i was seeing. I also like the high use of Practical effects. Almost every character we see is practical, whereas others who are CGI such as Maz Kanata (motion capture) look so real that they don't feel out of place. But a lot of praise for going back to the original route of using mostly practical effects. A lot of people say this is too similar to the original Star Wars film, whilst the last act is pretty similar, this film did feel like its own film at the same time. Some characters such as C3PO and R2D2 feel kind of like if they weren't there it wouldn't make a difference, but like i said new characters really feel at home here. BB8 had a lot of great moments which were real highlights of the film, he also played a huge part in the plot of this film which surprised me.But all-in-all what can i say except, thank you JJ Abrams. This film makes us realise why we missed this universe so damn much. From seeing the Falcon take flight for the first time, to seeing Han and Leia reunite for the first time, it warmed my heart as a huge Star Wars fan and i smiled almost the whole time in this film. There are a few real emotionally heart wrenching scenes too though. I laughed, i cried and having the franchise in the hands of newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as well as Oscar Isaac, well i am just okay with that. They have bright careers ahead of them and they have really proved themselves. This is the best in the saga since The Empire Strikes Back and i cant wait to see where this story is heading, as well as seeing this film again.

Star Wars is back!,The Star Wars that we know and love is back and better than ever.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best SciFi Movie of 2015,"The saga that enthralled two generations is back to captivate the imagination of a third. A new Star Wars trilogy begins with the much discussed STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Since the classic trilogy, Star Wars has become synonymous with relatable characters in an old fashioned good vs evil story all set to mind blowing special effects, convention defying designs, and a rousing fanfare that kicks off each story set in that galaxy far far away.Under the masterful hand of director JJ Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan , THE FORCE AWAKENS pays tribute to the original classic trilogy, recreating iconic scenes, memorable lines and bringing back as many of the classic actors to reprise their roles. Some may say that it is a whole sale copy of A New Hope but there are enough differences and twists to keep things fresh. It is new enough for first time viewers yet Familiar enough without feeling like it is pandering to the existing fanbase. The balance struck is extraordinary!Actors new and old give a stellar performance. Veterans like Harrison Ford slip right back into their classic roles, completely becoming those same characters the old fans knew and loved. The new ones aren't too shabby either with John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey and Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron turning in magnificently nuanced performances. These, coupled with strong writing and snappy scripting, brings back the naturalistic dialogue of A NEW HOPE, giving us characters that are easy to relate to and well fleshed out. Humour is used sparingly but effectively such that the level of tension and danger is maintained, unlike certain comic book movies where we get a laugh every 5 minutes (I'm looking at you marvel) even though the world is going to end.JJ Abrams was born to direct science fiction. Having honed his craft in two STAR TREK movies, His Free flowing filming style and Long tracking shots make every spaceship scene an exciting roller coaster ride. The audiences weave in and out of battle as gracefully as the starfighters that are blasting away at each other, they run alongside Rey and Finn as enemy TIE fighters fire on them, they are right there in the thick of the lightsaber duels. All this without resorting to the scourge of shaky-cam that so many directors tend to fall back on to ""enhance"" action. Action is large and sweeping in scale with more personal character moments filmed intimately. A balance.For every good balance dictates that there should be a bad. For every hero, a villain. The new villain of Kylo Ren is easily the weakest in the history of black clad STAR WARS antagonists, lacking the menacing presence of Darth Vader, the regal air of Count Dooku, or even manipulative cunning of Palpatine. Kylo is just one angsty angry boy who throws at least two hissy fit tantrums throughout the movie. Maybe it is my age but I find it hard to relate to him as either a tragic antagonist or the next Big bad villain. Adam Diver does his best in the role of Kylo, but he is written Less like a villain and more like an furious fanboy worshiping a famous Long dead individual.Some may not appreciate the seemingly ""safe"" route that the movie takes when it clings to the story beats and mirrors the narrative of the original trilogy. Perhaps they wanted to play it safe after the questionable critical reception of the prequels. After all, familiarity sells and so does nostalgia. The marketing team definitely did their research. I for one did not appreciate a return to the simplistic ""hero's journey"" where good is good and evil is evil. I missed the more complex themes of the prequels and the real world analogies within the narrative of the clone wars and the rise of the empire. But again, this could just be the producers playing it safe.The best part of the movie for me was not the breathtaking special effects or the acting. It was the music by veteran Composer John Williams. From the first notes of that legendary fanfare to the more quieter character centric themes, William's score retains the feel of old school space opera and never caves in to modern movie scoring conventions. He eschews the heavy drums and electronic sounds of recent blockbusters for the traditional brass, strings and woodwinds. The general tone, distinct melodies and some old favourites bring us back to an era where a movie's soundtrack is its own performance that can be enjoyed with or without the movie itself.With all the homages to the older STAR WARS movies, one can really feel that the creative team were fans themselves. That is not to say that this movie would only appeal to fans. On the contrary, it has something for everyone to love, even relative newcomers to the franchise. This is one movie that would definitely have everyone talking about it after the closing credits; reminiscing, recollecting, speculating, and waiting eagerly for the next instalment in the STAR WARS saga.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Microwaved Goods,"The time has finally come, a new star wars film has arrived. A sequel to the original trilogy and hopefully an apology for the 3 prequels. Also now in the hands of Disney who have had the rights to star wars at the parks for years. Seemed like a good move and honestly I think it was a wise choice. I shuddered when I heard JJ Abrams was the chosen director. I find him over- rated and personally dummbed down star trek and ruined it completely for a new generation. However I was still excited and would give him the benefit of the doubt. So how does the new movie fair?.......well it basically has the exact same plot as A New Hope with old and new characters thrown into the mix.All in all the movie was not terrible but it felt like they wanted to play it too safe and rely on nostalgia to convince movie goers that star wars is back. Watching it I couldn't help but fall back in love because of this nostalgia however that being said upon analization of the film afterwards proved to remove the beer goggles.As stated before this is a re-has of a new hope. There is another death star, a new disappointing villain, however he may grow into a badass but for now is weak and pathetic. The pacing was also terrible and everything happened to fast and relies on previous knowledge. For fans coming into this film without seeing previous movies may ask themselves, this is what the hype was all about?That being said it was hard to hate on this film, because they did try but were not wanting to take a gamble and branch out into a complete new storyline with risks. I'm curious to see what direction this goes however I'm scared as the next director hired is the gentleman who bastardised jurrasic world. In my personal oppion I'd give this a 7 however rating this as a film not as a fan it would get a soft 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"May knock some back down to Earth, but will lift up others to that special place they haven't been in a while","Few franchises are as cherished and as glorious as Star Wars. Since its release in 1977, it has been passed down by hardcore fans to their children in the form of repeated viewings on VHS or DVD like a precious family heirloom, or has simply found itself etched in a young child's mind with no help from their parents. My generation endured the often tarnished prequels, but even if you're somebody who despises the franchise's prequels and embraces ""the original trilogy,"" think about that; you dislike one-half of the series, but you still have the nerve to call yourself a Star Wars fan. That's because the Star Wars characters, universe, and experience transcends a few subpar films; it's something that reminds us why we go see films in the first place and how they can completely transport us out of our element for an experience that we'll always hold dear to our hearts and cherish until we pass.There will undoubtedly be people quick to praise Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens as the best film in the series, or even second to The Empire Strikes Back, and there will be the hardcore fans that will simply not allow themselves to enjoy it for whatever reasons exist under the sun. For me, as a casual fan of the franchise, I wanted a compelling cast of new characters, the same kind of enriching and unique environments I had been graced with in prior installments, a desire on the screenwriters' behalf to propel things forward and not dwell on nostalgia and past events, and offer up some new thrills in a modern, but classic package.If you go into Star Wars: The Force Awakens expecting that, I'm convinced you will get it and emerge satisfied. The film may not have the kind of warmth and tingly feelings you got when you first witnessed the original Star Wars film in the theaters, on VHS, or in one of its theatrical re-releases. Through a lens that packs confidence and lacks flare, J.J. Abrams continues the franchise in a respectful and commendable way.To keep the plot's description as vague as possible, the film takes place roughly thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, where Luke Skywalker has disappeared and the galaxy is left dominated by the First Order, the successor to the Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, both trying to find Luke's whereabouts. We focus on a Stormtrooper nicknamed Finn (John Boyega), who escapes the First Order with a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with BB-8, a small, round droid. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the First Order, which is commanded by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who uses the dark side of the force to command and conquer. Later in the film, Finn teams up with a scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley), in addition to both Han Solo (Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role) and Chewbacca in efforts to defeat Ren and take back the Galactic Empire.To begin with, in an effort most likely geared to try to disassociate this project from the often tarnished prequels, Abrams takes the safe route in structuring The Force Awakens's narrative in a manner very similar to A New Hope. The chronological events of attacks, character development and introductions, and cause-and-effect relationships all mirror the film that started it all, and this isn't a bad thing, frankly. To try and hatch a new experimental structure to a film that's already going to be approached very cautiously by fans who are fearful of the Disney brand now stamped on all future Star Wars projects and products is a very risky move, and Abrams does a great job at playing safe, yet still delivering.This isn't to say that Abrams and his cowriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt cling to a railing for support and safety the entire time; in fact, making the leading male in the film black and the other lead a woman is a high-point for the film, especially given how engaging these characters are. Boyega gives one of the most naturally charismatic and engaging performances I've yet to see in a Star Wars film, full of energy and not one-liners or quips that distract from the story at hand. Ridley, too, finds herself being a very believable presence, especially when tasked with carrying much of the emotional weight in the last act. Finally, let's not sleep on Oscar Isaac, who, this year alone, has had performances range from business tycoons, laidback but sinister scientists, and now a key role in one of the most renowned franchises in history. As with nearly every project he has been in, don't sleep on him here, either.Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in addition to being the best-acted installment of the original franchise, also happens to be one of the most exhilarating action spectacles of the year. With the effects being delightful blends of CGI and practical effects, the feel the film carries throughout mixes the old and the new with great results. The film doesn't bear the laborious and often artificial looks of recent blockbusters like Godzilla or Jurassic World, but it doesn't look poorly or inexpensively assembled either. This is an incomparably detailed film, especially during the first hour, when it's essentially the best sound and lights show you could ask for.I came for an experience and I was wholly satisfied having witnessed what I did before I walked out. This is a film that will likely inspire and captivate a good majority of its audience, and remind them why they love films in the first place. It's a lovely blend of old and new that doesn't rely on nostalgia to carry its story, and offers viewers a new breed of likable souls to carry this franchise to galaxies even farther and farther away, perhaps next time to uncharted territory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not great. Spoiler-free review from a Star Wars fan.","Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Star Wars. Not the type of going to conventions and wearing costumes (although the idea already crossed my mind more than once), but the type that has seen the original trilogy (IV, V and VI) more times than I'm willing to admit. Regarding the second trilogy (I, II and III) I found them acceptable movies, with some mediocre moments but also some enjoyable ones, and quite a satisfying story arc.Star Wars: The Force Awakens (aka Star Wars VII) is a good movie, but it's not a great one (7 out of 10). It provides a solid experience but shows some noticeable weaknesses, especially in the final act.The first two thirds of the film are excellent, perhaps the best start of all Star Wars movies, and if the third and final act showed a similar level of quality this could easily be the best Star Wars experience of all time. But, unfortunately, the final act is very predictable, unoriginal, feels rushed and is overall unsatisfying.The cast does an excellent job and I especially liked Rey's performance, the main protagonist. The technical aspects, sound and special effects of the film are also excellent. There's humour, some of it light, but some quite good. I laugh hard for two or three times and it felt good.The problem is that third and final act. Lots of fan service all around, which is not such a bad thing to have per se, but the way its done makes this movie feel more like a nostalgia ride than a new movie. There's some naivety shown by characters that should know better, a somewhat lightness to it all and an overall careless behavior which breaks the sense of tension and the serious tone the first trilogy had.If you're a big Star Wars fan, like me, you'll leave the theater with mixed feelings, but with an overall sense that you had a good time, if not because of the spectacle by itself at least for the nostalgia ride. But don't expect too much intellectually or story-wise. There's nothing really new, special or epic about this movie. Perhaps that was kept for Star Wars: VIII, which I hope will be great.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Return To The Star Wars Universe That We Origionally Fell In Love With,"I went into this film not expecting much. But boy was I surprisedAfter the disappointment of the prequels, I am so glad the Star Wars is Back. The characters were fleshed out perfectly, the music was as nostalgic as ever and the comedy actually worked.some have complained that this is an exact copy of A New Hope, and I say to those people: ""Have you even seen A New Hope""? Yes there are similarities, but is that a bad thing? A New Hope is one of the greatest films in cinema! Even if this was a scene for scene copy, it would still be amazing.J J Abrams had a huge task, this was to not only provide for the viewers who grew up with Star Wars, but to also introduce a new generation of moviegoers tho the Star Wars Universe. Also JJ had to wrap up 30 years of history between Force Awakens and Return of the Jedi. He accomplished both of these feats and made an excellent filmThe Force Awakens brings us back to the Star Wars we know and love and gets us excited for more to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly disappointing,"I had high expectations from The Force Awakens. Initially I thought that the decision to hand over the SW franchise to a new generation was great. The new faces, the feminist twist and even creating The Force Awakens as a remake of Episode IV were not necessarily bad ideas. They were poorly executed though. I question Disney's choice of movie makers because JJ Abrams did a terrible job with the story, cast, score and pretty much everything. And he has no excuses as I am sure that he had a lofty budget.I also wonder if Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay himself or outsourced it to a 4th grader from an underdeveloped country. It looks like a nauseatingly cheap comic strip with so many gaps in the plot that it almost makes me want my money back from AMC theaters.The new actors are trying hard but are unconvincing, unattractive, and unable to portray chemistry between the characters. The score is painful.I feel sorry for the kids who are supposed to be indoctrinated with this garbage. We grew up with better Stars Wars and probably better dreams. I gave it 3 stars because they brought back Han Solo and Chewbacca although even Harrison Ford cannot save this bad movie. The CGIs were decent too.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The New... New hope.,"Now I went in the theater with incredibly high hopes. There was no possibility that this could fail. I refused to believe that. And I was right.The movie is incredibly fast-paced. J.J:s camera movement keeps the action flowing, forcing your eyes to be glued into the screen. He gets you right from the opening shot and doesn't let the audience off of the grip. The emotions are underlined by great cinematography which supports what really happens in the scene (beyond what's said). I know some of us were worrying the use of lens flares by J.J. No worries. He doesn't use them in this movie ""because they're cool"" (that's direct citation from Abrams by the way). J.J uses them sparingly so they do what they are supposed to do. To empower what we see.It's so hard to make a plot to a star wars movie. And although the plot is really similar to the new hope it does what it's supposed to. And because we are reviewing this film as it's own, we don't really care about how much of it was copied. We review it with the eyes of someone who hasn't seen any of the star wars films.What carries the story is strong characters. The clash of the old and new cast is rather hilarious to watch. Everyone can understand most of the comedy but some of it only OT fans will get. It's the opposite of jar jar.The dialogue is here and there pretty clumsy, somethings could've been conveyed better through action with no dialogue at all and some of the dialogue was too obvious. But the fact is that this is a movie also for kids, so some kids maybe wouldn't had understood what they meant with a more subtle dialogue.Rock solid work, that hasn't been made entirely with dollar signs in the eyes. It's a movie from an old Star Wars fan and you can tell it. Overall it would be a solid 8/10, but for every Star Wars fan it's a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Abrams Awakens,"In 2005 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""Revenge of the Sith"", convinced it would be the final ""Star Wars"" movie. The mood was electric, the audience was buzzing with excitement and there were massive cheers and applause every time a new character appeared on screen. It was an incredible moment and one I was sure I'd never experience again.In 2015 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""The Force Awakens"". There was a smattering of applause at the beginning and end of the film and when the Falcon, Han Solo and Chewbacca first appear. There were also a few laughs for a couple of scenes. Other than that, silence. Walking out of the theater, surrounded by hundreds of moviegoers, no one uttered a word. Everyone just shuffled out in a deathly quiet.Now don't get me wrong, ""The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic movie and the best thing JJ Abrams has ever done. However it also underwhelmed me in a way Episodes I to III never did. There is enough good, even great in it, and I have enough good will towards the series to name it my favorite film of the year, but I also have major problems with it, which range from the outer packaging all the way to the creamy center.Everything you feared since hearing JJ Abrams was directing has come to pass (lens flares aside). His obsession with the first three films as well as ""real sets, practical effects"" is taken much too far. You can see everything coming from a mile away, none of the mysteries and twists work and there is zero emotional weight to the film. The endeavor also suffers from a major case of telling rather than showing and as such we are pleadingly being asked to love our new heroes rather than liking them of our own volition.Of the new characters, Snoke and Hux are great, Kylo Ren is the weakest villain the series has ever had, Captain Phasma is useless, Rey and Finn are fine, Poe Dameron makes no impression whatsoever and BB-8 is pretty cool but very redundant.Again it's a great film, and I'll see it again in theaters. Just be careful to keep your hype in check.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Saving ""Star Wars"" from George Lucas","J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a ""Star Wars"" film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking feminism. The similarities to ""A New Hope"" seemed specifically intended to identify the film with the original trilogy; the differences were great enough that the film remained deeply satisfying to watch. I'm eager to see how the ""Star Wars"" universe develops now that it's finally in capable hands: Abrams and his associates understand Lucas's creation better than Lucas ever did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Starcrash,Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't Deserve Criticism,"So many people are talking about how this movie is a terrible reboot, but it carries a really impressive story on its shoulders and it's hard to make a movie that pleases everybody having the legacy that is the entire Star Wars galaxy.

A breath of fresh air .. Star Wars has returned from a Galaxy Far Far Away...,"I have waited ever since the initial teaser was released, and from then the hype has been building. It i s safe to say J.J Abraham's lived up to and exceeded expectations to bring us THE best Star Wars Film ever.The movie falls nothing short of excitement, action, humor and amazing CGI effects. The light saber battles were a mix of the prequel and the Oreg but very well choreographed.The Space Battles are truly entertaining it takes you back the original prequel days but way better.The plot is well very well deceitful but clever and throws you a curve ball it is really unexpected ..The returning cast members give the new generation a taste of what it was like in 1977. Han Solo , Leiab, chewbaca All have impact-full and a well deserved lasting performance for one particular actor...Overall the movie lives up to the hype and delivers a powerful and emotional plot twist with exhilarating action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice to watch but many missed chances....,"Some nice jokes, an old story, and a missed chance to create a real new story with new characters that have their own personality traits.And why can now suddenly everybody fight with a light-saber without ANY training or experience. The scenes then Yoda was teaching Luke were awesome! You could get an idea of the whole thing: Now, the youngsters just take the sword and fight the well trained dark side... Very sad because the ""training makes perfect"" credo, is one of the very crucial in the Star Wars philosophy.And why no new technological gadgets or inventions within these 30 years? A missed chance....And many scenes feel so forced, so scripted. No surprise, no unforeseen turn in the plot! :-(",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There has been an awakening...,"It is crucial that I don't spoil anything so I will stick to the general facts and the technical parts. The story you will have to find out on your own.I belong to a new generation that was introduced to SW when Episode I was coming out so I have a connection with the new trilogy as well as the old one. Still, the old one is way better and any and all debate about the quality of the movies ends here. The original trilogy is a masterpiece and revolutionized SF movies, the new one is visually stunning and fun. So, where does TFA fit in? I have to say that it has taken 32 years to make a real and powerful sequel. It has the magic of the original trilogy, but also visually stunning segments as the new trilogy.The story. The movie has a very slow and light way of revealing elements of the storyline. The script was well written and keeps one interested throughout the entire movie. Then, at one point it kicks you in the teeth with a stunning revelation that one just doesn't expect. That revelation is so strong and done so suddenly you just needs time for it to sink in, but just as that happens the story picks up the paste and leaves one with just one option - acceptance. Only a (jedi) master director could have done that in such a way. Also, this movie has one of the most unexpected and emotionally painful segments I have ever seen SW movies. All I can say is that it took some real courage to put it on the big screen. Furthermore, I feel obliged to defend this movie from all of the rambling that it is a remake/reboot. The movie has a very interesting way of playing with sequences seen in episode IV, and if you spotted them that only means you are a real SW fan. This movie is nowhere near a remake or a reboot nor does it want to be. It is a continuation of the original trilogy, and nothing more.The acting. Ridley and Boyega were phenomenal! She is extremely talented and all the scenes she was in just blew me away. Her possibility to switch from amazement to sorrow and loneliness were astonishing. Boyega on the other side was entertaining and a good comic relief. Still I had a feeling she had a harder character to portray so my compliments go to her. But, the best of them was Isaac who, I felt, had the time of his life playing Poe. But, I feel a bit more screen time could have been given to him because he could have given more. So lets wait for Episode VIII, maybe he gets more time there. As for Driver, his acting is so phenomenal that I am looking forward to his death scene more than anything else at this point. He understood exactly who he had to play and how. A great presentation. As for the old cast, well, it is very nice to see the original cast back in the movie that made them famous. Hamill's final appearance is an equivalent to the one done by Alec Guinness in a New Hope. Pure good and light just dripping from every segment of him. Fisher, despite her age, still pulls of Leia in a manner more serious and wiser that in the original trilogy. But, all of the compliments and standing ovations go to Harrison Ford, who gave the best performance of Han Solo ever. He is funny, he is filled with sorrow, he is kind, good, he is the ultimate childhood hero anyone could imagine.The CGI. It is crucial to say that there is very little CGI in this movie. Most of it looks real and the whole movie feels like it was done 30 years ago. The most important thing is that when CGI was used, it was used in small dosages and it was used wisely. There are spectacular fighting scenes, magnificent visual effects, done with very little CGI. The movie feels real and that is one of it's greatest advantages.The music. John Williams did a nice job here but, in my opinion, held back a bit for reasons unknown to me. Not a lot of the original music is present and when it is, it ends quite fast. Besides that, no new tunes can be heard.So, why 9/10? Well, the movie drags a bit at the middle and the music could have been more innovative or more tunes from previous movies should have been used.All in all, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't like this movie, then there is nothing else SW can do for you. It is the best possible sequel you could have hoped for, it is fun, it is dramatic, it has a great message. The original trilogy will never be made again and stop comparing them. View this movie as a sequel that really delivers to all the SW fans out there and all of the new ones that are yet to come. A new generation of SW fans are coming and they deserve a new generation of SW movies. Ones that will thrill and be corespondent with the time they are viewed in but still as powerful and great as the old ones. This movie is exactly that.May the force be with you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Start to a New Generation,"The movie was everything that I wanted it to be. It was funny, full of action, it went back to the feel of the original trilogy and above all it reaffirmed what people loved about the series. The costumes and the CG worked together seamlessly without looking fake or cartoony, like in the prequel trilogy. The light saber graphics were phenomenal and they add a lot to the cinematography.John Boyega Oscar Isaac and Daisy Ridley have an excellent performance. I believe that the future star wars movies will rest easy on their shoulders. I only wish that we could see a little more of Oscar Isaac; although, I'm sure we will in future movies!It sets the tone for future movies and reminds us why we love star wars!

Average,"Firstly, it is worth saying that I enjoyed the film, there were a handful of moments that were 'wow this is a great Star Wars film', however they were few and far between.The content was recycled from previous films and was predictable from the moment the synopsis scrolled across the screen. If you go back and watch a new hope, re-skin it, replace a couple (only a couple!) actors and you'll have The Force Awakens. There was nothing to inspire, or push your imagination.It was good to see a 'proper' Star Wars movie again, and it was an improvement on Episodes 1 - 3. That said, I really wanted it to be much, much more than it was. It felt as if this film was closing some older story arcs and setting the scene for the next two films.Finally, I await the next two films with great anticipation - this was a good stepping stone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good way to relaunch the saga,"JJ Abrams is smart about how he plays with the toys he was given. If I had one criticism about this movie; it's to be too classic in its structure - no spoiler but the movie will feel very familiar. On the other hand, what is the right balance to strike between old & new?There is new in this movie - lots of it. The new characters are strong and different from their elders. The settings are cool, the Star Wars technology and designs amazing (there will be so many new toys from this movie!)But Abrams manages to weave the old in ways that please and bring a smile to the hardcore fans. That was very well done.And the end scene is amazing and poignant.I need to probably re-watch it but day 1, first screening I left happy to have spent two new hours in the much beloved Star Wars Universe - I guess this is what matters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disney and Abrams bring Star Wars back to full glory.,"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?The film takes place 30 years after the events of Return of Jedi. Darth Vader is defeated, and the galaxy is at peace. Until a new threat named Kylo Ren tries to take over the galaxy. He's after a map that could tell us where Luke Skywalker is. Luke has disappeared over the last 30 years and both the First Order and the Resistance and searching for him. The plot is very basic, but definitely does scream Star Wars. Abrams and his other writers did a good job with the plot for the 7th installment in the Star Wars saga, as it continues where we left off, and leaves us wanting more in the end. The plot introduces us to new heroes such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley).Now Abrams brought back some of the old characters we loved in the original Star Wars trilogy. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, and even Chewbacca returns. Now they're introduced later on in the film, but Han and Chewie gets the most screen time. Now the new characters really carry this film. Poe is a Resistance pilot, Finn is a former Stormtrooper trying to change his ways, and Rey is a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who trades pieces of ships for reward. Of course, there's the little orange and white droid known as the BB-8 who plays as the trusty droid. The film focuses more on Rey and Finn the most as they team up with Han and Chewie in the second act of the film. They all serve the plot well, and the young good actors do a good job at portraying the heroes. Replacing Darth Vader is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who joined the Dark Side in a similar fashion as Darth Vader did. Adam Driver does a good job as playing the villainous Kylo Ren as he opposes as a threat to our new heroes in future movies.It's good to see Star Wars back on top. JJ Abrams brings the Star Wars saga back to life. We had to sit through George Lucas' prequel trilogy, but now we have a new trilogy we can enjoy and sit through. The hype was worth the wait, the old characters we all love are back, and the new characters are going to be loved by fans of this franchise. The story is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. It has everything we love about Star Wars, from the opening crawl to the classic John Williams score. I did have some nitpicks here and there. I did felt the second act did drove on for awhile, but that's mild criticism at best. Like Disney did with Marvel, Lucasfilms is in good hands as well, and I'll be looking forward to future Star Wars movies made by Disney. If you haven't check it out already, go check it out immediately. This is one expert if you don't want to miss on the big screen.This gets a 10/10 from me, and remember, may the force be with you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An incredible return to the Skywalker saga,"J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not That Great,"I agree with a bunch of reviews on here that the movie just doesn't compare with the movies by George Lucas.First off the magic of the original movies is just how good the casting is.All of the characters have incredible chemistry.The cast is perfect.In this movie we start off with Finn who is a terrible actor and who is basically a total wimp.I don't have any problem with him being African American but how can a storm trooper not be white,when they are all cloned from boba fett.The movie gets much better with lead character Rey,who really gets the movie going until she hooks up with Finn.When she interacts with him,the movie goes downhill again.Once again he can't act and they have zero chemistry together on the screen.The movie one again gets great when Hans Solo arrives but it just can't get anything going without any other solid characters.Then there is the evil Darth Vadar character Kylo,who is also a total wimp and who we are supposed to believe is Hans son,even though he looks nothing like Han or the princess.One again it is terrible casting.The story is also trying to hard to copy other Star Wars stories,instead of being original.Is this really the best that Abrams can do.What a surprise it was to basically have Harrison Ford get rid of the force field,so they can blow up the Death Star again.Abrams did a great job with Star Trek but he blew it on Star Wars.The only reason I gave the movie a 6 out of 10 was because of Harrison Ford.Without him,this movie wouldn't have much going for it,other than the actress that played the character Rey.She was very good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some of the best with some of the worst of Stars Wars,"I came out of the film with mixed feelings, sadly more on the side of the negative than the positive. I was really looking forward to this new release since I saw the first teaser around a year ago. I thought that we could finally restore balance to the force... sorry!, to the saga! after the disaster oft he second trilogy. I really think that it has been a lost opportunity to do so, in spite of JJ efforts. If for true villain of the second saga was no other than Lucas himself, I think that the new Emperor of the dark side is now Disney. To start with the good stuff I can say that visually speaking this one is undoubtedly the best of the whole saga, JJ has done a remarkable job here, probably the best space fighters fights ever known in sci-fi movies, I don't think that a better job could be done here really. There is nothing too wrong with the plot neither, only, if this was the first stars wars movie, which is not. For a 7th episode they really didn't need to constantly go back to the classic material, which makes it all so predictable as well as forced. It really seems to me that most of this plot comes from Disney marketing dept focussing to much on the young audience and the merchandising. Regarding the new faces on this saga, Ridely and Isaac give good overall performances (very much Star wars) while Boyega and Driver are pretty disappointing and, in the case of the first one, truly annoying most of the time. A final comment, I went to the avant premiere (16th of Dec), so, all die hard Star Wars fans at the screening, well, not a single clap at the end of the film...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
False Ratings,"It's now a proved fact that IMDb's rating system is rigged. I have looked through many reviews on this movie, and everyone seemingly agrees that this movie is not StarWars worthy. Given horrible rating by 9 out of 10 people, but yet still seems to have an 8.4 rating. It seems if the makers of this movie put more money into the script rather then to critics and bogus ratings, we may have had another great StarWars movie. I am not surprised at all that this series has been ruined. What good movie has ever come from Disney? I have seen Disney make great child, occultic, subliminal, cartoons, but never a single good adult film. JJ Abrahams should get first place and the biggest statue in the movie hall of shame.

Abrams has found his niche ... now stay away from Star Trek ! 5/10,"OK, first, the reason for the 5/10 is that I could not watch it again. There is not a lot of plot tension or complexity, and the movie is a little long and schmaltzy ... but, this is so much better than I thought it would be, I am glad I went to see it, it was fun.""The Force Awakens"" like all the Star Wars movies doesn't make much sense, but it had the feeling of the Star Wars series that even the Stars Wars official movies had kind of lost. That make a big impression on me. I really did not expect much, and I sadly went assuming I might just be fed up and have to leave after a few minutes, like I wanted to in the Star Trek reboots, which I hated with a passion.But the movie is beautiful, it is true to all the style and shots and quirks of Star Wars, but that means it is also thin, vapid, silly and basically low IQ Science Fantasy for kids. So, it is that kind of movie. Which is acceptable, that is all is had to be. It is just a movie to watch and eat popcorn and then talk about how this scene reminded you of another movie or situation.Star Wars was one of a kind, in its own time, and it really cannot be recreated, but this movie is hugely successful financially, or course, and so it met expectations - that is an amazing accomplishment, for Star Wars, For JJ Abrams and for the customers.Again, the movie is beautiful, the images and sets awesome, the views spectacular, and the style true to form ... a great job for a sentimental mediocre movie that will give lots of people two hours of great fun ... once!It would have been nice if Abrams had been able to accomplish the same with Star Trek, but i don't think he really understood Star Trek as he understands Star Wars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Awakening,"Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Follows the legend,"At the beginning you fear that the movie is shot just as every modern movie: no attention is put into the real filming and only to the actual action. After 6 minutes this fear disappears completely. You feel like you are watching an old Star Wars just in a higher quality. The battles are of those where you finish all of your popcorn's, actually after the first action packed scene you are empty handed and only your ice-tea still isn't opened. The actors and especially the close-ups transmit like no other movie the feelings, sadly this is up until the last 15 minutes. The end is, in my honest opinion, poorly made. That is on a acting and plot point of view. The final action looks like they forgot what they had to do and ends up in a strange awkward pause. What excels in this one is the filming: it is great from the moment you sit down till the screen goes white. In three words, do you need to go this movie?

Especially if you're a star wars fan! I went to a Loews theater and it was packed, everyone left with a smile on their face. The experience was incredible. The effects and soundtrack were great, the acting was great. It was a more modern depiction of the Star Wars we all know and love. If you didn't like it, you're an idiot. It's a movie, it isn't perfect, but it met my standards and a majority of everyone else's. Was it a bit repetitive? Yes, but it was so well done that I didn't even care.

Disney Star Wars.  Good Enough.,"Just got back from a pretty early showing in Manila. The real winner here was the production design and art direction which beautifully created an up to date version of the star wars universe whilst lovingly staying faithful to everything from the earliest movies. Together with the awesome special effects and locations the movie looked stunning.Unfortunately the story and the concepts in the movie just really felt like a remake of episode iv (the original 77 movie). Many of the key elements were simply redone. As for twists and turns just think of any long running soap and you'll have an idea.The music also had some nice new pieces mingled in with the main themes. Basically this is Disney star wars nostalgia and we'll never get tired of whatever is dished up. In the same way as the 007 franchise, we will whine a little and then continue to watch the next one. Just the music themes and the sound of droids bleeping, phasers blasting, and dark lords breathing heavy will give us a rush no matter what.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't go in with too high expectations,"I was so excited to see this, perhaps too excited. I had watched all of the theory videos and trailer analysis videos and thought I had things figured out. So when I saw it the first time, I went in with preconceived notions and a critical eye, so I ended up disappointed.After reading some other comments saying it was much better the second time, I decided to try again. This time I went in open-minded and tried to view it as pure entertainment, not 'real life.' It was MUCH better that second time. I really enjoyed it. So yeah, OK, I missed on a few of my predictions but so what.So the two main parts that bugged me even after the second time: there were a lot of themes/scenarios that seem repeated from the original trilogy; and there were a handful of deus ex machina type events that gave me some WTF moments.It does end in a cliffhanger, but as the first movie in a trilogy, I can handle that.See it in 3d in a theater with reclining seats.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Terrific!,"I've just returned from the cinema, and normally I don't do such things as sharing my personal opinion on the particular films online, but this time I'm going to make an exception.I felt like moving back in time to the days when I was a kid who is going to watch the first trilogy for the first time. Yes, the atmosphere, the climate so to speak of this blockbuster was preserved and maintained on the highest level. It has tribute and bow towards elder fans and something fresh and funny to those younger who have just begun their adventure with the Saga.I loved the characters. Han Solo and Chewie just rock. I have never seen them before to have such a great chemistry between them. The new ones, well, they were more than OKAY, especially Rey and Finn, and Poe of course. I also enjoyed the humour, maybe it was a little bit in excess, but I suppose this is something very required in today's cinematography. Special effects? No question about it - TOP NOTCH! Some people might say, 'I've already seen this in the previous episodes', I say 'so what?' In my humble opinion, it's a fresh view and a very interesting approach towards creating something epic that I'm going to long for the next few years. Kudos for Mr J.J. Abrams.

A fan well-served here,"It's clear that J. J. Abrams shows his utmost respect to the franchise and keeps everything familiar intact. As a fan, I'm totally happy watching this movie, with well-timed re-introduction of characters we know and admire, and a structure that faithfully follows a classic Star Wars movie.In a way, Abrams played safe and developed this movie like a tribute to the original trilogy, which is not a bad thing. But consequently, we don't get to be wowed by anything truly novel. The movie is brief on the few new things it introduces, and that calls for elaborations in the next installments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic!,"One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Feels like classic Star Wars with new faces.,"Good....Goooooood.That's basically what I was doing upon leaving the theater an hour ago. I feel there will be a wide variety of opinions for The Force Awakens but for this life long Star Wars fan, I believe the Force was Strong with this addition.I think most of the negative posts will come from older fans who want to see the edgy adult flick a lot of our childhood classics have been turned into like the Marvel and DC comic flicks, and while for me personally that would be awesome, I think the team creating this new set of films hit a much better winning combination by keeping the flick true to the classic hero adventure and family appropriate style that made the original trilogy such a classic.I'll start by pointing out the only negative points and get them out of the way, yes, there was quite a bit of the cheesy humor and some fairly over dramatic acting, especially in the beginning. And yes, there was an over abundance of throw backs to the original trilogy that did come off as pandering. But with those exceptions, I think the film did a great job setting up a big new trilogy, especially after the abysmal Episodes I-III.You could tell this was directed by JJ Abrams, it felts like the Star Trek remakes, especially the action scenes. At first his style didn't appeal to me but just as he did with Star Trek, he really builds his characters over time as well as his plot lines.The action was freaking intense, definitely the highlight of the movie. The ground fights were believable and gritty, no mass of Jedi's tossing robots all around and storm troopers falling by the thousand, no overuse of CGI, it felt like real combat (with blaster rifles and light sabers). The ship to ship combat scenes were beautiful, though gravity was very subjective in some cases. Tie fighters flying in with a rising sun in an Apocalypse Now style assault...shut up and take my money!The movie is PG-13 and Disney is now the overseer, you aren't going to get something like the Batman reboot, and honesty I don't think it should go that route. This really brought me back to how I felt when watching the original Trilogy on VHS, it's a film the entire family can enjoy while not going full Jar Jar Binks. I'm already looking forward to the next installment and hoping JJ Abrams follows form and brings out some serious Dark Side in the future.Plot- 8/10 Action- 10/10 Acting- 8/10 Effects- 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beginning of a new era with the foundation still intact,"Finally, the most anticipated movie of the 2015 is here! After gathering all the hype and hoopla around it over a year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't throw in any unpleasant surprises. Taking over from George Lucas, JJ Abrams makes sure he does not disappoint any Star Wars fans or cinema lovers in general. It is quite hard to make a sequel to the movie which had ended almost 30 years ago and especially when it comes to this era where most of the sequels are made just to mint money without a proper story, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has quite a strong plot to build on. In fact with this movie, it looks like there are more to come.The story is once again about the conflict between 'The First Order' (like the Empire) and 'The Resistance' with the aim of finding lost Luke Skywalker. So for the fans asking where was Luke Skywalker in the trailer, the answer is 'that's what they are trying to find in the movie as well':-). The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) fit in the mix perfectly while the classic characters Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3P0 still reminds us of what we watched Star Wars for. Since there is a huge time gap between the last Star Wars movie and this, there are changes with respect to the time when it comes to visual effects and slapstick humour (read Boyega). However the some of the original elements of the Star Wars are still kept intact like, the weird creatures, retro editing, lightsabers, music and of course taking hostages :). The movie is largely entertaining and yet true to the franchise.It is a tough job to star in a movie franchise which is older than you. But Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, not so well known British actors show what they are capable of. John Boyega's timing is excellent. Harrison Ford could sleepwalk the role of Han Solo and we all know that. Oscar Isaac does not have a lot of screenspace but it may change in the upcoming movies. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is okay and Domhall Gleeson tries too hard to fit into the General Hux's character. However as always, Chewbacca and C-3P0 seem evergreen.Star Wars: The Force Awakens lives up to most of the expectations surrounding it. But remember, it is yet another beginning...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Beautiful elements, incoherent plot, lack of originality","I am a fan of original Star Wars (4-6) and I grew up with it. I knew it is difficult to repeat the success of something as original as Star Wars, unfortunately this happened to be true for The Force Awakens. The movie tried to satisfy fans by pick and mix elements of the original SW, then reshuffle and arrange them loosely and carelessly. The result is some impressive and spectacular battle scenes and pursuits, yet the story plot lacks cohesion and believability. It has many structural issues, and bad person Kylo Ren has far less charisma than Darth Vader. The movie fails to deliver anything substantial of originality, and I felt disappointed at the end. I hope they learn their lessons and get their acts together for the following sequels: there's still time! As a fan, I can only go up as 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Seems bit rushed,"I won't make this long. Well after seeing the movie, I, like most of the others, felt that it was rushed and unnatural, meant mostly for the new generation to attract the audience and to appeal to them. And it still feels like it.But for all of those who are saying that this is a remake, well double- check your arguments. Thing is, that the Force Awakens is based on the novel of Star Wars. It has everything that happened since the episode VI till the Force Awakens and plus the whole plot of the movie is based on it, whilst skipping some minor, some bigger parts of the novel.As for myself, all in all, I think the movie was okay, was expecting a bit more. Let's wait for 2017 for now.Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I found it long and boring,"I am not a hard core fan, but the original trilogy was a nice childhood movie.The Force Awakens is not like the original trilogy. It doesn't capture the charm of the original characters - Luke, Leia, Han and Vader.This is when I realized that the whole attachment to the original series was entirely because of the main characters of the film. So it will never happen again, it is just like a sweet memories.The biggest and basically intolerable flaw of the Force Awakens is that it's built around the main character of Rey (Daisy Ridley). Soon in the movie, her presence becomes annoying and later on it becomes intolerable. The actress just doesn't have the personality for such a movie and her character is present in 80% of the scenes.Another minus is the overwhelming sound track.Too little special effects (spaceship fights).The movie never takes off, it is just a long flat plot from the beginning to the end. I am sure for kids and teens it can be nice to watch and they will perhaps love it the same way us, adults, did love the first series. There is no strong violence or language, thank you Disney.For adults, at no moment we feel this is like the original three movies. Yet, it would be a movie to watch at home while relaxing without hoping to make us feel like the original Star Wars series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not a sequel, but a reboot","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Used to Abrams' horrid bastardizing style, I expected something fit for children and devoid of soul. But since I am not a Star Wars fan and Abrams probably is, I found it acceptable and he probably made more of an effort than when he mauled Star Trek, where the situation is clearly reversed.But what is important to understand right away is that this is not really a sequel. They spend as little time as possible tying the other six films with the story, instead focusing on specific nostalgia bringing moments and catchphrases. Other than that they just rehash Episode IV, the original first movie. It starts on a desert planet, the main character is strong with the force and is good with mechanics, the villain wears a mask and is the apprentice of an evil and ugly looking a-hole, it has a Death Star kind of thing, it is destroyed in the last moment, there are a lot of familial ties that are either pushed down your throat for no good reason of hidden away for a big reveal later on. The only thing missing is an Obi-Wan Kenobi type of guy, dispensing with the training or any kind of explanation of what is going on and replacing it with battle and explosions.Therefore, this is a clear reboot. After all Abrams does the same thing, only better because he probably care about Star Wars a little (sorry, still bitter): he takes a franchise, lists all the good and/or nostalgic points that fans love and shoves them all in his new movie, tying it all with duct tape and special effects.I thought the actors were good, including the new Vader, which some thought was too whiny. Excuse me, have you seen Anakin? Anyway, Adam Driver does a very good job of displaying flaring uncontrolled emotion while behaving in a clear psychotic way. He is not just a misguided soul torn by pain and seduced by dark power, he is clearly deranged and he portrays that very well. The new Luke is quite hot and credible, as much as the plot lets her.A disappointment is the character of Finn, who seems to jump from one personality to another with glee, his only role seemingly to bring the plot in the direction wanted, with no consideration to character consistency. I have nothing with the acting, but the character was almost JarJarish in its randomness. Also Luke...Special effects were top notch, including the battles. Gone are the incompetent stormtroopers who can't hit a target sitting in front of them. They are not competent either, but still. The 3D is also done well and didn't just jump on my face for no reason. Also Luke... (you'll get it when you see the ending of the movie)Bottom line: Abrams reboots Star Wars, trying to take credit for the good stuff others invented before him and brush under the rug the bad things that people hated. He does a reasonable enough job, but while trying to bring realism and technology to the table, he loses part of the magic that the fans were so addicted too. For Star Wars' sake, I hope the sequel will be as good as Empire Strikes back was for Star Wars, otherwise people will just be left with a childish special effect filled clone of the movie that awed their parents.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The good, the bad and the ugly (incl. German edition's review)","I went to the cinema last night and here's my personal review:In general: None of the characters is getting developed during the plot. All of them are fully explained and equipped with all their attitude and feature sets within the first five minutes of appearance.Kylo Ren, the villain: isn't threatening at all. I feel sad for a youngster who's apparently been hanging around with the wrong guys and is gotten weird in his puberty. But I'm not impressed. He's just a nervous kid who has never learned to control his temper, angrily destroying things in his room when he gets upset. To me he's more like Biff Tannen in the ""Back to the Future"" franchise.Rey, the girl: is just as stubborn, insolent and ludicrously high gifted as all movie heroins are. She's so scrawny she can hardly hold a gun, yet she's winning every fight easily. Oh my god.... Well, at least she PILOTS like a woman ;)Flinn, the guy: is stupid and clumsy. I wonder how he survived his time as a soldier. And I wonder why I should be continuously watching him failing over and over again. I feel sad for him.The girl and the guy: I guess Disney wanted to turn the role model wheel 180°, making the skinny young girl a fighter and the fighter a foolish young girl. For me such absurdity is utterly hard to watch without holding and shaking my disenchanted head.Lor San Tekka, Max von Sydow: Why is he, the perfect Obi-Wan Kenobi character successor, in the movie only for about five minutes?--Why is every film aimed at 12 year old children nowadays? Why didn't the creatures in the carrier hurt someone?Most of the excitement, suspense and sobriety in a movie comes from characters not talking. But all of the characters in the movie - just - didn't - stop - talking!No ambiance or mute suspense scenes are depicted whatsoever. No fade or wipe as been applied, too. So there's no chance whatsoever to get John William's excellent score to interact with the audience.Everyone was acting so fast and nervously. Gee, I felt like being in a nursery from all the unnecessary stupidity and cheer that's been said.What's so great with Chewbacca's crossbow which Han Solo didn't see earlier in all these years?Everyone in the movie is talking and behaving too nervously and fast. The only ones with a great timing were Han Solo - and Snoke in particular.The Chewbacca character is giving a plain stupid idiot. Just like the Finn character does.BB-8 is behaving like a little dog. No cleverness whatsoever. He's unnecessary from the beginning. It would have been more reasonable to put the USB stick into a box and hide it in the sands than to introduce the BB-8 character for this.I would have preferred if a Muppet would have been used for playing Maz Kanata. These CGI characters just don't have soul. I bet no child would like to have a Maz Kanata puppet in their bed.Why is the chess board (Dejarik) on board the Millennium Falcon playing all of a sudden - WITHOUT players?--And here's my review to the horrible German translation of the flick:""I'm a Stormtrooper"" has been translated into ""ich bin ein Sturmtruppler"" - Huh? ""Sturmtruppler""??? Really? So the German translators didn't know how to translate a German word into German?? In English this would be like calling him a ""Stormtroopling""! Gee!! ... Who came up with that idea?? Why didn't they let him say something reasonable like: ""ich gehöre zu den Sturmtruppen"" which may be translated as ""I'm belonging to the shock troops""?!?Same for ""The First Order"": They translated it into ""Die erste Ordnung"" which sounds just like ""The First Orderliness"" in German. Gee!! What did they think this is? Isn't the house cleaning company nearby called like this? I hardly believe the director of the German version really knew what he/she was doing... A more appropriate translation into German would have been something like ""Das neue Regime"".It must have been nitwits who did the translation. Didn't they know that the Empire is a allegory to the Third Reich? Come one, guys, this isn't Lord of the Rings!Moreover, I don't know about Kylo Ren's English voice, but the German voice has been badly set. Too much intonation, he is talking too quickly. His voice is just too vivid and nervous to be evil. Given that voice, wouldn't he be better off singing when he tortures others? (After all, it's a Disney flick, isn't it?)Same for the silvery ""Stormtroopling"". He's a ""she"" - and she's talking with a high pitched girl's voice! Urgh!! I couldn't hold myself laughing when she'd be giving orders.Not to mention the voice of Maz Kanata. She's got the voice of a young woman! But does she look like one?? To me she rather seemed and felt like a female Yoda. And that's what I would have expected from her voice: The voice from someone having a voice like one of the Golden Girls actresses. Or Roseanne's as it is now.--One positive thing: There *really* is a great deal of true hardware and makeup done in the movie. And it was great to see the Millennium Falcon interior with all the traditional switches and levers - and WITHOUT a touch screen!However, the amount of CGI in the movie is still 99 % compared to real hardware/makeup.--I'm very much looking forward to get a hand on the DVD. As soon as I get it I will cut all the hooey and girlish stuff out, add length by slowing down some scenes and create my own grown-up version of the flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Poorly written but somewhat entertaining,"The seventh installment of Star Wars is very fast-paced and entertaining to an extent. The events move quickly, the battles are generally over shortly and the characters are fun. That is the most positive I can be about this film.One of the largest glaring issues is the messy writing. There are lots of unexplained events, predictable parts and terribly handled plot points. It tries to cover it up by adding slapstick comedy and gorgeous scenery but that still doesn't excuse it.And then there's the main villain. Unlike Darth Vader, he didn't foreshadow his face. Lame! But seriously, he was very confusing and his motives were unclear. He even had a weak personality and felt more flat and evil than interesting. Even the main characters were rather lame, sometimes reduced to cheap plot devices. Whenever a character was focused briefly it was interrupted with the need to further the plot.The comedy is decent but I personally didn't like how excessive it was. The characters were fun and their interactions are entertaining but that is all I can say. This is more of a personal bias than a flaw.Aesthetically, there is nothing to complain about. It looks and sounds good.I half-enjoyed it. If it were more serious and had less comedy then I would've enjoyed it more. All I can do is shrug and pass this off as another average film.

"A conservative, overly familiar, empty, sanitised pastiche which contains precisely zero surprises","J.J. Abrams often likes to work with a single point of reference. With Super 8 it was Spielberg, Cloverfield was Godzilla, Into Darkness was The Wrath of Khan, Fringe was The X-Files. The same applies to The Force Awakens. This time it's the original Star Wars trilogy. Almost everything here is an analogue of something from those films, more often than not, Episode IV.This tunnel vision is a total contrast to the open minded approach George Lucas taken when making Star Wars. Lucas drew inspiration from all over. Religion, WWII, westerns, spirituality, the Vietnam War, 1930s serials, Japanese cinema, motorsport and so on.Under Lucas's leadership the Star Wars films pioneered new filmmaking techniques, fresh styles and helped advance technologies. The original trilogy featured innovative sound designs, created the used future aesthetic and developed computer controlled camera movements. The prequels advanced motion capture techniques, CGI characters, pre-visualisation, digital shooting and projection. It's the same attitude both times. Trying new things, making progress and changing the industry in lasting ways.Abrams doesn't share this attitude. The Force Awakens is a backwards looking project. It's a retro, nostalgic throwback delivering little more than fan service and deja vu. This is evidenced by the return to 35mm and the rehiring of Alan Dean Foster for the novelisation. Not that they are bad things (Splinter of the Minds Eye is a fun read), but they are revealing of the filmmakers mindsets.The result is a conservative, overly familiar, empty, sanitised pastiche which contains precisely zero surprises. Disney clearly aimed to recapture the feel of the 1977 classic, but under Abrams approach and direction they have only done so in a superficial way.What we get then is more of the same. Rebels fighting the Empire, a desert orphan prodigy encountering a droid with sensitive data, a spherical super weapon destroying planets, said super weapon being easily destroyed due to a glaring design flaw, father/son confrontations on suspended platforms, a cocky but likeable pilot, trash compactors, lightsabers vibrating in snow, cantinas populated by colourful characters and alien jazz music, 'I've got a bad feeling about this', a new Yoda, a new Emperor, a new R2D2, a new Darth Vadar, 'We've got company', AT-AT walkers, Tie fighters, X-Wings, rebel being tortured by a bizarre contraption, an alien spy ratting on the good guys etc.There's a good reason why Lucas stopped after six episodes. The story was finished. Episodes I-VI chronicle a young man's corruption, descent into tyranny and eventual redemption through the love and conviction of his estranged son.There's nothing left anymore. And Disney will keep drip feeding us further instalments of nothing on a yearly basis for the foreseeable future. Or until the Earth gets blown up by a spherical super weapon. I've got a bad feeling about this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Personal thoughts, no spoiler.","I just came back for the movie theater. I never wrote anything about movies before here, but now i feel like i have to, because this is the first time i got so overflowed with thoughts and feelings, i don't know what to do with them. After I turned two, my father got the original trilogy on VHS for Christmas. Sure, i don't remember that, but I remember the next few years, when i spent countless hours watching them and by the time i stepped into elementary school, i know every line by heart. I was a lonely child, due to both by nature and circumstances, and these films were my castle, a place I've always felt safe, even in the most fearsome times. (this isn't exaggeration) I'm sure that the movie is not without mistakes, that not everybody agrees with the casting choices or with the plot, but they're gonna write about it, so thank god, I don't have to. I just want to thank you, all of you, who made it happen, that I can relive some of my most precious memories. This film felt like coming home, and being welcomed, and i haven't felt like this in a very long time.

The Force Is Strong With Jar Jar Abrams,"Star Wars is back, that is the highest of compliments. JJ Abrams has masterfully directed us 40 years back in time to a dirty world in a galaxy far, far away. The nods back to the original trilogy are many, but never feel forced or makes you go ""enough already"". And the moments we've all been dreaming of were there including an amazing last scene. The new main characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and bad guy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are introduced in a fantastic way and I was blown away by the talent of Adam Driver who plays a very complex character that not at all feels like a new version of Darth Vader but very much his own character. The chemistry between Finn and Han, and between Finn and Rey I found to be great enough to ensure an intriguing new trilogy in the Star Wars universe. The movie does leave a lot still open which bodes well for Episode 8 and probably even Episode 9. Perhaps the only problem I had with the movie is that it does imitate A New Hope one too many times, but while being blown away by the fantastic shots of The Force Awakens it is not something that really takes anything away from the movie. The Force has awakened in a big way, and I would like to personally thank JJ Abrams for taking me back to my childhood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A great movie , nothing more to say","This is the best movie i seen in a long time, while the story is kind of predictable i account this to my many years of watching movies, there is rarely ANY movie that has an unexpected twist for me.The action is very good in this movie, the acting is waaaay better then the wooden puppet acting from I-VITo all the people giving this movie a rating of 1 star.... really, wow, just wow, spiteful people indeed just trying to get the movies score down.Don't worry people, just go watch the movie, its greatIts a shame i can only give 10 stars, because the rating of this movie should be at least 9,5 if u ask me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not the best Star Wars, but worth a watch","Star Wars 7 was a movie I've been wanting to watch for a long time. I initially wasn't expecting anything great. I decided to just give it a go. The dialogue is far better than Lucas's previous work(prequels)9/10 Story seems decent, but could've been more engaging. 7/10 The acting is very great from these new actors, I'm looking forward to their other 2 movies. 9/10 Soundtrack is basically the same as every Star Wars Fans. 8/10All in all, the movie seemed to only try to follow the original star wars films that they seem to make a new copy. Abrams does a great job of trying to make beautiful backgrounds without the major use of cgi. Big props for that, but the movie was bit over-hyped. This movie is best for rental or if you can, at the $5 theaters. This is a pretty cool movie with a few flaws such as better action and more engaging story, but hopefully, you'll get a chance to watch an addition to the Star Wars saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good start to the new trilogy.,Another well directed film by JJ Abrams. Not a reboot like Star Trek. Well filmed with a lot of action. Great mix of new characters and old ones. Not without a few issues but overall a good Star Wars movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The old gang's back together for one last time, good fun. 8/10","As a stand alone film The Force Awakens is good fun with enough action, story and old acquaintances to keep you entertained.....where as the The Last Jedi, in stark contrast, is just too slow and boring with new characters that have the charisma of brown cardboard boxes and gaping irreparable plot holes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nothing new in 30 years.Dramatic for a sci-fi film,"Nothing new in 30 years! Original film was a great success, because of creativity and innovation showed at that time. This new edition it is no more than just a remake of past success with absolutely nothing new: same older stars offer just a shy interpretation, with exception of Harrison Ford, with an active role. It am quite disappointed that action place 30 years after and you see exactly same aircrafts, same weapons,... nothing, nothing new. No evolution in 30 years. When first Star Wars film was first released there were no mobile phones, no Wifi, no PCs,... but now action in this film happens 30 later with no technologic progress within the history, no new ideas, almost same history. In the other hand Daisy Ridley, Rey, offers a great interpretation. I am sure she will become a great film star, while others with be forgotten, as it happened with Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher. Star Wars always push some actors (Harrison Ford, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor...) and others became forgettable. An entertainment film but very mediocre! Good for nostalgic people and young people, but very far (light years) from what it was first film and some sequels. Mission Impossible, James Bond,... have evolved . But it is incredible that a Sci-Fi film did not! Walt Disney's creativity seems frozen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,"The Force Awakens is an Amazing film . It does nearly everything right , the characters are likable , the action is great and the story and music are just great like usual . 9.5/10 A+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not better than 1977,"I got a thrill from the Star Wars opening theme. But as the movie continued it seemed like more than the opening was similar to the 1977 original. You would think trained storm troopers would not be so scatter-shot, however one of the main characters actually got hit!! Alas, it was a mere flesh wound. Don't you think you or I could hit something - anything - with a blaster? Oh well, a space opera needs it's heroes. The villain of the movie would have been more menacing had he kept the mask on until the death scene. Young love is expected in movies like this - old love is pathetic. Good thing they don't dwell on that too much. Nice to see all the originals again. I was sorry to see the ex trooper healing in bed - he was awkward in his role. Not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, but had a Wesley Crusher feel. Given his prior job on a death star that big he would have no chance at all to have the knowledge he imparted. Better to give him a hero's death. Senator, he's no Hans Solo. The new women lead was very very good. Better than a young Luke.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice.,"The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film by Disney. It's has a great story and great action scenes.

J.J. Abrams produced a sequel that is faithful to the Magic of Episodes IV and V (before Special Editions),"This movie brings back the fun-filled Magic and excitement of the first two movies and (THANKFULLY) avoids the excessive CGI & stupid characters (ala Jar Jar Binks) that made later movies painful to watch. I'm doing my best to avoid any spoilers; so I'll only discuss in general terms. The closest I'll get to plot specifics is to provide rebuttal to reviewers who have criticized this movie as being a mere ""remake"" of Ep. IV & V. As an actual ""Sequel"" to the first series; it would be absurd to produce a movie that didn't include many of the same ship designs and other technology from the earlier films. It's not as if all of those ships would conceivably disappear and be replaced over a supposed 30 year time frame.Moving on, I admit that this movie does not have the deepest plot possible. As the first film in a new trilogy; it serves as the vehicle to introduce all of the new characters, reintroduce some old beloved characters and acclimate the audience to the ""Galaxy far far away"" in this time period. This is performed masterfully. With a blend of non-stop action, well-timed humor and tasteful nods to the earliest films; no Star Wars fan should be disappointed.Prior to its release, I read that J.J. Abrams decided to be faithful to the original films so much that he eschewed the use of digital recording in favor of 35mm film and whenever possible, used live action and stunts in favor of CGI. Thie results are a film that is beautiful in its rendition and captivating with its visual presentation. Starting with Return of the Jedi and to a much greater extent with all of the prequels; I found myself distracted from the movies with thoughts of ""That's pure CGI"" , ""wow, look,how that CGI character was inserted into the film"" and ancillary items. This time around, the effects were far more subtle. Rather than being in-your-face and screaming ""Look at this cool computer graphic"" the SFX are there to support the plot, not be it.I saw The Force Awakens in a D-box equipped theater. (Motion enhanced seats that tilt, vibrate and shake in a closely choreographed relation to what is going on on-screen). I've demo'ed D-box technology at electronics trade shows for years; but this was the first time I actually watched a full movie in one of these seats. While I can see the D-box experience enhancing a movie such as Fast & Furious XXX; I found that I was pulled into the non-stop action & plot developments of this film that I never really noticed any of the ""enhancements"" offered by this advanced technology. If I were to go see the movie again; I think I'd opt for seeing it in IMAX.In summary, If you are a fan of the original SW movies, you will love this one. The elements that made the prequels a massive disappointment are gone. This movie is pure fun for all ages. I can't wait for Episode VIII in 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bravo!,"When you're taking on this amount of history, or baggage depending on your point of view, you have to start modest and start small and let the story slowly tell itself and fill in the gaps. That's what happens here, as we begin (not unlike SW IV) with a small droid with an important package running into some random (or are they random?) characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that along the way Hans Solo and Chewy join the ride and things really start to heat up. As they do the movie pays homage to previous episodes without just redoing what they did before (with one exception). Maybe it's easier just to say what it is - 1) good plot, 2) good characters, best of them Solo, 3) good dialogue, 4) an active story that moves along well, and 5) beautiful scope to the scenery and special effects. What is one of the things that made the original Star Wars so damn good? Scenes like Luke looking wistfully over the desert grandeur of Tatooine. Just reveling for a moment in the spectacle of a foreign world. We got some of that here. What it's not is 1) too over-the-top, 2) too long, or 3) too complicated. Is Abrams to blame for why this is the best SW since Empire? I suspect he is. Real real nice job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth the wait!!!,"For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken.There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you have (as I have) been CRAZY in wait for this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not.You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - very solid. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the special film I had waited for,"Well, I don't really know what to say other than I was left a little unfulfilled. I don't even think it's as good as Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace.I felt like the story was a little flat and the film didn't know what the plot was. The graphics were OK, but nothing special and I just didn't feel awe inspired like after I watched some of the other installments of the Star Wars saga.In places, the acting was weak and at times on par with Hayden Christensen poor performance in Revenge of the Sith.A disappointing remake that's opening up to another episode.I hope Disney don't kill it, the next one can only get better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, not great","Boy, was I excited for this one.Nope, nevermind.It's a remake from EP IV (the first one). It's like Abrams had a checklist of things to put in the movie to make it a safe bet.Daisy does an awesome job of being Rey and I think that's what saves the movie from being just average. If Rey had been portrayed by a subpar actress, this would've been a flop. Not to mention Rey is basically a walking deus ex machina (which seems a deliberate choice to fill some agenda by Disney and the director).There's many good moments, but there's something missing.A good movie. Definitely worth watching, but it isn't the SW we've been waiting for. All it does is set up groundwork for the sequels.If you remember watching A New Hope, you know that movie stands on its own. Maybe we shouldn't compare it to the Original trilogy, but that's impossible given the similarities.Anyway, give it a try. Just don't expect it to be the next big thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect! Hands down...Best One Yet! Haters are out in full Force,"Let me start by saying I didn't know what to expect before going to see this movie. Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS YET!Let me tell you why...1. All the actors can act - Everyone from Daisy Ridley to Adam Driver gave stunning performances. It's the first Star Wars movie I have ever seen where the acting was worthy all around.Great Directing - The only movie that can rival this one as far as directing goes was Empire. They are both on the same level. Needless to say this movie is leaps and bounds beyond the prequels. Great job JJ!It's Funny - Remember watching Jar Jar Binks and wanting to punch a hole in something? There is none of that nonsense in this movie. There are lot's of laughs and it has the same comedic value of the originals.Great Action! Action, and more Action!There are a few twists and a few tears to be shed. I honestly felt emotion while watching this movie. And that hasn't happened since the Empire Strikes Back. Everyone leaving the theater also loved the movie... You can usually tell an audience reaction to a movie by their interaction... and they were loud!So I ask a question... WHATS WITH ALL THE HATERS ON SOME OF THESE REVIEWS? Well let me shed some light on that as well.Public reviews for movies are like having open mic night at the town forum. Every drunk, lazy, pathetic idiot has an opinion. If you look at a few of the profiles they are pretty negative people in general. Some of them have only reviewed this movie.... hmmm... that's odd. I see some people complain that JJ ruined this like he ruined Star Trek... ummmmmm... no. You sound like an idiot. Or I see a few people say that it's the exact same story as New Hope.... ummm no. Most of the robots in the Star wars universe carry important data with them. It's nothing new. So do everyone a favor. Since you will never love another Star Wars movie that is NOT one of the Holy Trilogy, please never go see a new one again so we don't have to listen to you complain like a spoiled brat rich girl who's having a temper tantrum because she got a black car instead of a red car for her 16th birthday. There is NO place for you in the Star Wars universe and I am tired of hearing you complain.I am really looking forward to seeing where this new trilogy goes.

Huge Disappointment,"I've watched it now several times. I tried to like it. It's Star Wars. It's Han Solo, Leia, Luke (a bit of him). I grew up watching episodes IV-VI. I can't describe how much I wanted to see and like this movie. But I don't like it. The story as a reboot stinks. How do you reboot something that is a part of this rebooted saga??? There are many non- canonical things happening around as well, and I don't want to go into debate with it. These things (without going into details) just don't fit my Star Wars universe. And this ruins the entire movie. I'm utterly disappointed. :((((( Damn You Walt Disney for ruining the most important sci-fi universe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"great for the fans, good for the others.","I just seen it in Brussels, right after work.Is this a good star wars movie? yes! Is this a good movie? yes Is this a great star wars movie? definitely yes!Is this a great movie? no, for me not!the good: i enjoyed myself quite a lot with this movie. Its clearly made by fans, for the fans. It feels and breaths star wars.The transition from 'the old' to the 21st century is definitely spot on.The acting is classes above all previous movies combined, yes including the original.I grew up with star wars, loving the movies, but unlike many(not all) fans i can be perfectly critical to the flaws of the original as well.Beyond great and by a landslide the best part of the movie was for sure, the action! the still camera's are replaced by exiting moving camera angles from all sides without ever loosing oversight. things simply looked delicious and total awesome.But since I'm not a 10 year old anymore :) I also manage to approach this in a more critical way then only the fan perspective!There were a few things disappointing to me as this is absolutely not a flawless movie. First of all, without spoilers, this movie is 60-70% just exactly like ' a new hope' strip down all nostalgia and re-introduction of the older characters and whats left of 'new story' material is really really thin, cant help it but i was disappointed about that.I understand the strong importance to connect the new to the old, but this was sometimes trying to be too much 'beying' the old to my personal sentiments. so nostalgic people will of course go nuts,crazy and in full admiration but i have honestly my doubts all adult people specially when not a star wars fan will be equally thrilled.inconsistencies: there are a few , now i know this is the first chapter of a new trilogy, and lots will still need to be explained. But despite that, there are simply a few things that doesn't make any sense at all or where a bit overly charmingly 'star wars' simplified for todays story telling standardsand then final for me the biggest disappointment was the villain!!! By seeing the trailers i had very high hopes, and having a legacy of total bad ass villains ,how could it go wrong? well asides form a few nice tricks this kylo is a total wimp, specially compared to all the previous baddies, he's without spoiling, a confused insecure teenager, struggling with himself, and not this ominous evil unstoppable powerhouse dark force. as what should be the proper decorum for being the baddie of star wars!anyway, non the less, overall, i had great fun, and i can not image star wars fans wont have. it definitely makes many of the high expectations true, and is by a landslide better then all the prequels combined.

Incredible,"I will make this a very concise review. The Force Awakens is an incredible movie that is a fitting addition to the Star Wars canon. The combination of the new characters mixed with the legends was very well done, and we truly have a new trilogy to which we can look forward. To be fair, no villain will ever live up to the legend of Darth Vader, but Kylo Ren is well cast, and a deeply flawed character. Finn and Rey were perfectly cast. I have read of of the negative reviews of this film, and while it is within people's rights to say what they want, I just cannot imagine what somebody would have done better.

"People can't be pleased anymore. It wasn't flawless, but it was damn good.","People who found this disappointing just because it wasn't flawless and completely original are very narrow minded. It had its flaws, a lot of which it did seem like too much was taken from A New Hope and put it into the movie... but that really is the only flaw. Saw it two days in a row and would watch it again. Easily surpassed the prequels. Fantastic movie.

Entertaining Movie but that's It,"Although Epidode VII is a very good standalone Star Wars movie, once again they do a terrible job of trying to make it fit with the previous movies. Return of the Jedi left me very happy with the way things ended, the Sith and the empire were vanquished, Leia and Han lived happily ever after, Luke was a consummate Jedi and he turned Vader back to the light side of the force before dying.This new chapter pretty much destroys all of that in trying to continue the story. Episode VII begins with chapter IV all over again, copying many aspects of the original story. It's the rebels against a new empire again now called The First Order (with a silly emperor called Supreme Leader Snoke), a new pet droid where they once again hide the maps of something valuable to the rebellion, another masked villain with an intimidating voice, another death star, X Wings again flying inside a ditch requiring precise shots to destroy it, etc, nothing new.The production again fail to see what made the original trilogy so great was that it touched the hearts of all of us who grew up watching the movies, it had great characters and a beautiful story that teached many wonderful human values. Maybe Lucas believes that what makes the movies great are the special effects, monsters, cool lightsabres, ships, robots, etc.So overall, It was an entertaining movie that made a terrible job of continuing with the Star Wars legacy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Almost a reboot of Episode IV: A new Hope,"A book could be written comparing the plot similarities between Episodes IV & VII. It is definitely not the story continuation those of us who grew up watching the original trilogy in theaters were hoping for; the lack of George Lucas' input is very evident. Social Justice Warriors will definitely find no fault with this movie, but I am old school and not politically correct... Han Solo shot Greedo first!Having said that, it still is an enjoyable film because it's Star Wars. I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it, but for purists it may be a bittersweet experience. For me, it's the joy of a new Star Wars mixed with the sadness of what could have been.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
