Great film,Really good enjoyed it. Tells an origin story in a interesting way,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good time pass flick..,"The movie is okaish! The main reason marvel produced this film is to tell us about Captain Marvel (The Strongest Avenger) and to link her with The Avengers: Infinity war and End game.
Brie Larson's acting is really appreciable as well as Samuel L. Jackson is flawless as always. Marvel fan's should definitely watch this film but at the same time shouldn't raise there hopes/ have high expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More than I expected,"When i heard about this movie for the first time, i thought that it will be a flop, with that not so assuring trailer. But, when i get to watch it, it was actually more than i exlected. Captain Marvel was fun and a little bit nostalgic. The way the movie started is a little different from the other marvek movies, but that's what make it special. People should really try to watch it first before they get to judge. It maybe not the best marvel movie, but it still bring a such joy for a movie fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better the second time round,"This movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. It's a good film, and a good one to come out before her appearance in Endgame. The acting was decent, I can't say it was bad, because it wasn't. Samuel L. Jackson is amazing as always, as is Ben Mendelsohn, 2 of my favourite actors. This film is good.

First superhero movie without a lovestory. Thank you!,"It was so refreshing to see this movie. It's fresh, not preachy and the story is solid and logical all the way through.
Besides being played by a very well chosen actor, Captain Marvel is the first woman main character in a movie without any romantic involvement presented. She is only focused on saving the world. No cheesy romance to motivate her and no preachy or sentimental self-realisation through emotional blah. They stripped away all the usual gratuitous and boring tear-jerkers and only left the essence of what a superhero movie should be.
Loved the story behind Fury's missing eye.
Gave it 9 stars because there could have been more fight scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie is good. nothing less or more.,"I don't want to adress the hate, but let's try to forget it for a second and just appreciate the film for what it is: a film. thank you.First of all, the intro of the mcu logo was great. youll see what i mean when you see the film and I appreciate the creators for doing it as they did.Now... first the good stuff:
1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much ""agent coulson prior avengers"" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very goodthe bad:1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; ""but you didnt deserve that yet..."" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.so that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Captain Marvel: Underwhelming,"PlotCarol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races.CastBrie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson (Because duh), Jude ""Just consistently dreadful"" Law, Annette Bening, Djimon Hounsou, Clark Gregg and blink and you'll miss him Lee Pace who returns as Ronan but looks so different I didn't even think it was him.VerdictI watched this back when it was initially released, I watched it a second time a few days ago as the missus is wanting us to binge watch the entire MCU as she's very behind. My opinion has changed on the 2nd viewing and not in a good way, my rating has shifted from a 6/10 to 5/10.You see straight out of the gate the first thing you notice about Carol Danvers is she's not really a character you can get behind. She's not funny, she's not entertaining, she comes across as a surly teenage girl who is just upset at the slightest thing and just doesn't want to be there. This is not a character you can build a movie around, like trying to make a teenage Groot movie! It wouldn't work, but he's okay as a side character.Supporting cast are also hit and miss, Jackson and Gregg are great,
but Lynch and Law just stink up every scene they're in.I'm a Marvel fan but I recognize where it's weak, this is a distinctly average film that serves as a standalone origin story and doesn't contribute much to the universe as a whole.RantsI remember when the movie came out all the controversy with Brie Larson, I just had to Google what the controversy even was as I don't remember due to not focusing on such things. Now I can't really get a definitive answer. From what I see it's a combination of people not liking her attitude and her comments on feminism. So I Googled further to see what she said, she came across arrogant in them and a smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate I've seen aimed at her. Then I remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up, I remembered that it's visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she's been targeted. News flash, the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up a very small percentage. Feminism is good, if you disagree I hope you simply don't know the meaning of the word.The GoodJackson and Gregg

"Not THAT bad, not that good either.","This movie feels out of place in the MCU, it feels Fury is not the same character we meet (only) 10 years later. The movie tries to force us to like Brie Larson, not Carol Danvers or Captain Marvel. The character feels like a mix between Tony Stark, Thor and Feminist Captain America. To make things worse, at the end she is way to OP. However, the movie had some good jokes, it was not over preachy. Sure there where some Cringe moments, but all in all it could be worse. The best part of this movie is the 90's nostalgia, Ben Medelsohn, Fury&Goose and The Kree. BUT the Kree do not get that much screen time, they feel like The Warriors 3 with even less to do. The intro does gave me shivers, what a tribute to Stan Lee. I would say Captain Marvel is Solo: A Star Wars Story mixed with The Incredible Hulk, a fun popcorn movie but nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Has cool moments, but poor main character writing.","I've liked Brie Larson in other films, but she showed ZERO range in this. When your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable, you already have a problem. In addition, Captain Marvel has no weaknesses, which kills the tension immediately. There is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing, or any danger at all for that matter.It's an OK origin story, but it makes no sense as to WHY she's supposedly so powerful.The cat was good.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Forget all this hate!,"I went into Captain Marvel with skepticism, because of what people were saying online, and I'm glad to say they were wrong. This movie is great. First off, Brie Larson is perfect in this role. Carol Danvers is a former air force pilot with incredible abilities, she's supposed to be a little snarky or arrogant, while not getting overdramatic in difficult situations. Larson emanates this with her ""lack of facial expression"" aka keeping her cool while being a badass. Trust me, she displays plenty of emotion in this film.
Now, does the movie have corny moments, or does it sometimes feel a little forced? Sure, but we're talking about possibly the most powerful being in the MCU. It was going to be hard to introduce her no matter what the filmmakers did. Not to mention it's the movie leading into one of the biggest, most anticipated blockbusters of all time. But personally, I think they did a hell of a job. Captain Marvel is a great recapture of where the MCU has been while providing insight as to where its going. A cookie cutter marvel movie? No, this is this era's Iron Man. We have a character fighting a war she was told to fight, only to realize later that she can use her talents for a better cause. I don't think the parallels between this installment and past films are the filmmakers saying ""hey let's just do what we did before because screw it."" They are deliberate parallels to show that we can have similar heroes, similar stories, on a much larger scale. People are upset because they think Captain Marvel is too powerful when Feige explicitly said this is what would happen. For anyone who has been following the MCU for the past 11 years, do you really think they would have a character come along and just defeat Thanos easily? The fact of the matter is, the MCU is getting bigger, its villains getting stronger. The heroes have to change with it. Something will happen in Endgame to even the odds. For now, this is a great origin story with very emotional scenes, kickass action, genuinely funny moments, and a well written (albeit clunky at times) story that encapsulates what I've loved about Marvel films in the past while showing us that things are about to go much higher, further, and faster. Captain Marvel will lead the Studio's foray into the cosmic realm of Marvel, and I am 100% behind her.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Really wanted to like it more, it's just ok","So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.The acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.On the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.EDIT: 2 years later and I watched it a second time as part of my MCU chronological order marathon, and it is actually better than I originally felt. A lot of the above points still stand but I was a bit harsh because it didn't meet my expectations at the time. I now change my original 6/10 to a 7/10 as it's a fairly entertaining movie and is truly an essential part of the MCU saga leading to Endgame.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This movie is an Origin Story, so I think it makes sense if it feels a bit simpler than the ensemble movies.

Marvel Leaps and Bounds,"I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great movie!!!! too much hate on it...,The movie wasn't as detailed towards her background as other marvel origin stories like captain America for example which is super detailed. I feel that this movie didn't need that because Brie has a 7-9 movie contract and it's mainly a movie to make ppl know a bit about her and to introduce her before ENDGAME. In the future MCU movies we will find out more about captain marvel so I don't think it should be criticized negatively about not going over her origin that's well.

Good Fun and Good Message,"Like all Marvel movies, ""Captain Marvel"" does not short-hand on the fun nature that is natural to superhero films. All of the action scenes and special affects are done very well, and the mix with practical affects keeps them grounded.The story of the main protagonist is entertaining, though confusing at times and could have used a bit of polishing. Brie Larson's performance is perfectly fine given the character's history within the established universe. The performances from the supporting cast of Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Menedelsohn, Lashana Lynch, Jude Law, and the rest are all great and believable. The de-aging done on Jackson and Clark Gregg is pretty much seamless.The core messages of the films were well done. The first being about the use of war, and reflecting on how we often dehumanize those we view as threats during it. The secondary message, and more obvious, is the one of getting back up no matter how many times you fall in life, no matter your background. The messages were sentimental, but tastefully done and not at all out of step for a Marvel film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What is there to marvel at?,"I was left with the general feeling, that ""Captain Marvel"" is a major disappointment.First of all, there is a good story here somewhere, but it's just not well told, and there's too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes. The movie is fast-paced, but never really works, because the pacing is flat and timing is off. Aesthetically, ""Captain Marvel"" has been processed through the same ""Marvel filter"" as the rest of them. Dull. The filmmakers (indie directors of the great ""Half Nelson"") have given absolutely no attention to the music: the score is completely forgettable as are the 90's songs.As for the themes, the MGTOW people are going to have a field day with ""Captain Marvel's"" less than subtle ""feminist agenda"". I'm putting that in quotations, because it's more accurately described as simply female agenda. Which is absolutely fine and commendable; the problem is the infantile in-your-face way the filmmakers address the theme. The movie is set in the year 1995, and it really feels made for that year's audience. ""Captain Marvel"" lacks a fresh perspective. And, by the way, any fans of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from a truly powerful scene in the series finale. In any case, Carol Danvers of the comics was always a decidedly feminist character, so this shouldn't cause any waves. What's lacking, is Carol's wide array of problems: her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the Marvel universe (which is saying something.). Movie's much simpler.The biggest disappointment, however, is the resourceful Brie Larson. She's just off. I don't know what happened, but the brilliant actress from ""Room"" is nowhere to be seen. She was just the wrong choice, I guess. Still, I'm surprised by her lackluster-ness. The cast isn't great, anyways, but at least Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn seem to be having fun.Unlike me, for the most part.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Overly familiar but still really fun,"Captain Marvel is probably the most generic MCU movie without ever straying into actually awful territory. Essentially an overly familiar origin story saved by a breezy pace, strong supporting cast and some genuinely smart decisions when it comes to handling the Skrulls that completely avoids any potential uncomfortable subtext.The decision to make Carol Danvers a blank slate for the majority means Brie Larson is given next to nothing to work with, having to rely instead on the trademark quips and charm that she obviously excels at. It's also a lot of fun whenever she shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson, who gets to show a more fun loving side to a younger Fury.Ben Mendelsohn is easily the film's saving grace. Talos both plays into and cleverly subverts the kind of character he's usually given in these kinds of films. An initially one note villain with so much more going on beneath the surface who delivers the majority of the film's best jokes.To say Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden directed the film feels inaccurate. This is the most bland, voiceless, clearly made by a studio construction any of these have had. Nothing is terrible yet very little is memorable which is so frustrating for a film that starts with one of the best opening shots of any MCU film.Pinor Toprak's score is actually amazing. It's the only aspect that's full of life, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve and favouring creating something new over callbacks. The film also has plenty of time on the soundtrack to include so many iconic 90s songs without overloading itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A missed opportunity,"There's been a lot of excitement surrounding the release of this movie with one side wanting it to do well to support their camp, and the other side wanting it to fail to support theirs.I don't care about that either way. I just want to be entertained by a good superhero movie which continues the story that Marvel has been telling for the last 10 years. Unfortunately, this isn't one of the better ones. I found it to be very mediocre and forgettable. And that's really as charitable as I can be with this movie.Brie Larson certainly looks the part, but based upon her performance it seems like she was miscast in the role. Her time on screen is spent vacillating between looking indifferent and an unidentifiable expression, which many have attributed to smugness, for most of the movie. Personally I found it to be a bit off-putting and not only was the Carol Danvers character unlikable as a result, it also kept pushing me out of the movie by making it hard to suspend my disbelief.Unfortunately, it goes downhill from here.The underlying subtext of the movie is female empowerment, which is fine. Comic books are allegories, and always have been, at least when it comes to Marvel Comics. It's one of the (many) things I love about comics, but there's a fine line when creating these kinds of stories. They still have to be relatable and engaging, and ultimately entertaining, which is something that the comic book industry does quite well (for the most part). If you lean a little too far towards the underlying subtext then it looks a little ham-fisted and people perceive it as propaganda. And that's what happens here; it's so busy trying to be a feminist film that it forgets to be a superhero movie.It's clear that Marvel (and ultimately Disney) is trying to capitalise on the current zeitgeist, which is a bit of a departure for them. Past efforts have been focused more on telling entertaining stories which remained reasonably faithful to the source material. This movie doesn't do that and as such has a different look and feel than its predecessors. So much so that it doesn't really feel like a Marvel movie at all.An unfortunate side effect of this are the changes made to existing characters, both from the source material and the MCU itself. In this movie Nick Fury doesn't resemble the character we've seen over the course of his appearances in 11 of the MCU movies. His character is not bad within the context of the narrative they're trying to support, but his actions are not congruent with what we've seen and know about that character. On the back of that, having him lose his eye to a cat is a disservice to the character and shows that the filmmakers don't really have any respect for the source material or, I would argue, the fans.It's the casual fan base which underwrites the financial viability of these movies, not the fringe elements. When you dogmatically service these elements specifically, on one side or the other, you risk marginalizing the culture we love by forcing out this casual fan base.Personally, I enjoyed Alita: Battle Angel much more as a female empowerment movie. These two films essentially have the same plot, but the execution of the story, of the allegory, is done more competently in Alita with characters that are more fully formed, coupled with superior performances from the actors. It's a superior movie in every way and I recommend seeing this one instead and giving Captain Marvel a miss.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I'm one of those who've read the ""old"" Captain Marvel comics (yes, the one where she's a crazy psychopath who kills a bunch of skrulls), and I can without a doubt say; I LOVED THIS!A lot of reviews are calling out on the movie being ""women empowering"" (which I don't see as a bad thing), but if that's an big of a issue for you to watch a movie, maybe you should start living in the 2010 Century and not in the '90s. But the point is; yes the movie is trying to empower women, but what's wrong with that? We need more movies that try to show us that neither our gender, sexual orientation or heritage matters, and that we can strive to be better. It's a message that maybe doesn't fit the Marvel movie series as we are entering End Game, but I don't see it as an big issue, especially since there are more to the movie than just one message.The humour is really on point! We have the classical confusion humouring, as in, fury not being aware of Aliens, and the mocking of other people, as Captain Marvel herself is mocking the enemy in many ways.CGI is pretty much the same as across the entire Marvel movies, it looks like it's the same team working on this as the previous movies (people saying anything else is either delusional or haven't watched the movie).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This Movie is One of The Greatest MCU Movie!,"Tbh, I'm not too excited about this movie in the first place. My only reason is for understanding things before Avengers EndGame(in case anything important comes from this movie). I watch at the cinema in the first day, cause I dont want to get a spoiler. After I watch the movie, OMG THIS IS SO DAMN COOL. I can't describe in words. It's the only MCU movie that blow my mind with that plot twist, Good job Anna&Ryan. The three main aspect of a great movie is :
-Story : Incredible
-Visual : Fantastic
-Character Development : Amazing
Now I am out of superlative word for it. But Seriously, It's so pretty damn cool movie. The only flaws of this movie is the climax, it's not quite make my adrenaline goes crazy. Maybe because carol is too overpower that she can easily beat every enemy.
Pretty much worth to watch ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie!,"I read a lot of bad reviews, and they had me feeling a little disappointed and even contemplating not going to see it in the theatre.

Bire Larson. Ugh.,"I've been a big fan of the Marvel films long before Iron Man, but this is the worst movie Marvel Studios has put out.Besides being just plain out bland, I lay most blame on Brie Larson's utter lack of personality. At no point was I remotely emotionally invested in her character. She's easily right up there with Kristen Stewart and Hayden Christiansen for utterly lacking in any ability to emote.If this is the character they're going to base he MCU around going forward, good luck to them.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Honestly, I was hoping for better.","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.To start with things I liked, there's some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.Honestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what's going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn't have to say is that I don't think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don't necessarily think she's to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn't enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don't think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she's giving towards this character.The narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what's going on now, and a set up film for what's to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it's trying to do too many things at once.This honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That's not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren't good, it's just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work about their films. They've passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.They also don't do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what's currently going on in the MCU. We're told she's the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.The Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren't really given any character.There was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it's a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch's character. And there's no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it's always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.There are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.The film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It's a very generic film that we've seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.Please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don't listen to what others say, don't give in to online agendas no matter what side they're on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that's how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn't work about their films.But at the end of the day the fact that this film didn't live up to its potential doesn't matter, and I'm still very excited because...

Quality Marvel Film!,"I don't understand the hate this movie got. I got exactly what I wanted out of this marvel movie. ENTERTAINMENT! I've seen a lot of hate about captain marvel not being likable. Which is bogus! I loved her! This is also coming from the people who loved captain America in the first avenger, which is a nightmare of a movie. This movie had flaws yes, but all in all it was a very fun watch! Also as a side note, I get worried when I see a movie that has an opportunity to make a social empact. In the past movies like this shove it views down your throat. However this wasn't forced at all, when I fully expected it to. For sure a win for marvel!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Make your own opinion,"It was a pretty cool movie, I like Brie Larson's performance, she won the Oscar for a reason.

Just watch it, and make your own opinion. 🙄",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Seen it twice already. On the upper half of the MCU. IMO!,"Let me begin by declaring that I hate feminism and identity politics. I am also very disappointed that they (Marvel) have pushed that agenda when marketing the film.The film itself, on the other hand, was a positive surprise and no one can claim with any credibility that it is the worst film Marvel has produced. Anyone who says that knows nothing about film and are clearly pushing an agenda themselves.Brie Larson does a good job given the role she actually plays as a manipulated soldier without memories of her past. I am absolutely convinced that we will see her character develop in a direction where she shows many more sides of herself.Captain Marvel is clearly better than the first Captain America, Iron man 2 and 3, Thor, The Dark World, Ant-Man and Hulk. No one can claim anything else, even if you hate feminism and identity politics as much as I do. It is, on the other hand, inferior to Ragnarok, Infinity War, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and the first GOTG. Among the Marvel films that I have not mentioned, I find it difficult to place it.According to Feige, they have also thought a lot about what weaknesses she should have just so that it is possible to create some kind of tension in the films. Will be exciting to see what they will be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Copy + Paste Marvel Movie,"I live in Indonesia, and I've just seen it since it aired today. The action scenes are good, the de-aging of early SHIELD Agents are great. I can't really notice in seeing Fury. That's it. Those are the good things about this movie. Brie Larson comes off as snobbish when she quips like Tony Stark, but became boring and unlikeable the more she does it. There are moments in the action scenes when it's all CGI that looks like it came from a PS3 game. Comedy is sub-par.

A standout in the MCU,"One of the better standalone films by the studio. Being a prequel of sorts, it isn't constrained by the previous two dozen or so movies before it. It feels fresh, and a big part of it is because we've already seen many a crossovers and sequels with the same old characters. This seems like a return to form, Captain Marvel being one of the few well-crafted, self-contained stories. It can exist independently of the cinematic universe.There is an interesting plot, with a tasteful twist. Even though a significant amount of the runtime is spent in space and in alien environments, the movie stays simple, and focused on its characters, their goals, and relationships to each other.It also has a nice message, and for some reason that is a negative thing for a surprising amount of people. Nevertheless, Captain Marvel ranks high on the list of MCU movies in my opinion, in part because of the same heart and humor that made the audiences love Iron Man and Thor: Ragnarök.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

People gripe about her banter, but Tony Stark does the same thing and is well-liked. I thought it added to the character in a positive way and definitely had a few laughs.

Uninspiring,"My honest advice is to wait until it comes out on streaming video. Uninspiring. That's the best way to describe it. Plot, script, character interplay, everything. Plodding and forced. Larson is stiff, 1 dimensional, and brings a complete lack of warmth or humor to the character. How much of her terrible lack of emotion is bad acting, and how much is poor direction and writing is open to discussion I suppose. My niece, a Marvel fan as well, was unimpressed and noted several times that parts were simply stupid.It's sad, fans have invested 12 years and many dollars in the story arc. It would be a shame to see Disney/Marvel blow it on a character nobody wanted or is likely to care about. Marvel says this is to be the new face of the MCU, if that's the case, count me out. Trying to create strong female characters is laudable, but this Mary Sue dumpster fire isn't the way to do it. Take your cues from DC's Wonder Woman, that was just plain fantastic.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Best Movies from Marvel Cinematic Universe,I enjoyed this movie very much. It is mainly because Marvel didn't go with their usual ways in this movie. It has a deep story. It didn't pack a punch like Iron Man or Thor but everything fits with the story and the narrative.Especially the Mid-Credits scene was awesome and it makes me more eager to see the Avengers:End Game movie.It was also exciting to see the younger Nick Fury and Phil Colson. The Big reveal of how Nick Fury got blinded on one eye was really cool.Overall a good movie. It didn't have many action sequence like other Marvel Movie but if you're a DC fan you might like it more.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just average,"Nothing new is brought to the table here. For a superhero/origin story, a fish-out-of-water, espionage, 90's nostalgia-hit, a spectacularly disinteresting film. None of the actors seem keen on being there, in particular the star. Anyone who's seen 'Room' is more than aware of Brie Larson's acting chops, and here they are on full disguise. Her displayed emotions throughout the film range from smugness to total emotional emptiness. Boring story, predictable and unsatisfying twist, low-quality humour (if any) and someone please send Ben Mendelsohn to a speech pathologist to fix the lisp, and then to a linguistics specialist to remind him and the writers that just because the MCU has given the universe English for a common language, doesn't mean they'll use the same phrases as us.

"I loved this movie, despite the internet deciding to hate on it","Despite everything that people say online, if you haven't watched this movie, just go and watch it, It's worth it.When the movie came out, there was a lot of hate going around it, all because of an interview of the main actress, Brie Larson, which btw was taken way out of context.You can't judge a whole movie based on what one character has said in real life.So, now for the movie. Before you dive in, forget everything bad that you read online or all of those videos that you watched demonizing this movie, I will not spoil the story for you here, instead I urge you to watch this one and then you can make up your own mind.Personally, I loved the story and the way the movie is written is in fact marvelous (pun intended). Awesome portrayal by all the actors and actresses, Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson did an amazing job, the CGI is fantastic, the story starts up slow and then builds up perfectly in conclusion with the recent Avengers: Endgame. We see how Captain Marvel character evolves and regains her humanity but, she also gains something bigger on the way too.Overall, I loved it and can't wait to see the story expand and see more of the other characters in future films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie to see. Glad Stan Lee had the normal cameo,Saw the movie a couple of hours ago. It was was a little bit hard to follow the story early on.

Great Origin Story and Addition to the MCU!,"Captain Marvel Review:Captain Marvel is the 21st film in the MCU and it follows Carol Danvers who becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. As most of you know I'm a huge Marvel fan so there was no question that I wanted to see this. Unlike most audience members, I really liked this film (you can read about the audience stuff in my rant post). I thought it was an interesting and intriguing origin story. Anna Biden and Ryan Fleck did a good job directing this. This was their first major film so good for them. Marvel likes to do that. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers was a perfect fit. I thought she developed the character well and made it her own. She's clever, ambitious, and sometimes humorous which made the film very enjoyable with her scenes. Not only that but her relationship with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was literally the best part of the film. The chemistry was spot on and it made the friendship believable and feel real. He did great as Nick Fury again. This is probably one of my favorite performances that he did with Nick Fury. Annette Bening was in it briefly but I loved her. She's such an amazing actress. There's a twist with her character that was cool and might upset some who are true to the comics but I don't care. I should also add the cat, Goose, is an amazing character and I loved him! All the characters made for an enjoyable film and a good plot. Something I really loved about the plot was it made for questioning and thinking throughout so it was like a drama. Yes, there's action, and may I add very good action scenes, but the drama aspect was my favorite. The visual effects were pretty good in this. Lots of cool stuff, especially in the first shot you see of the Kree planet (I forgot the name of it). There were a few spots that were noticeable with it but not many. The makeup and hairstyling was very good. I thought it was cool what they did. I liked the super suits and costumes. The cinematography was pretty good for a marvel film. There were a few shots, one in particular that takes place outside in a backyard a little past sunset that I really liked. It reminded me kind of Annihilation with the shot of Natalie Portman walking towards The Shimmer. It was also colorful like Thor: Ragnarok. The score I would consider colorful too. It was interesting and pretty good. It had a tech vibe to it, also like Thor: Ragnarok. Since the movie takes place in the 90s, there's some pretty good songs added. One sequence in the final battle had a perfect song playing. Some thought it was dumb and copying Guardians of the Galaxy but I thought it was fun. Also Guardians of the Galaxy is apart of the MCU and people loved those sequences so what's the big problem?! I didn't have too many problems with this movie. The only thing I'd say is there's a part at the beginning with a trippy sequence that made it hard to follow. I understand it was supposed to do that, but it made an awkward shift. It was predictable what was going to happen to with the conflict. Also there's a reoccurring thing that comes to play in major role that was in the other MCU films that left me having to research it because something seemed out of the timeline then. Once I figured it out it made sense but there's one part I still question. Other than that I thought this was a great addition to the MCU and Captain Marvel will be a great addition in Avengers: Endgame. If you haven't seen the other films you could probably still watch this. There may be a few things you won't understand but it's a great time watching this film!My Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
See for yourself! classic superhero vibe + fun and strong female lead!,"This movie was fantastic -> I enjoyed Larson's character and acting, she was confident and feisty with a good heart and a rogue streak. And she was FUN, she played around. She had some of that young soldier wants to prove themselves mentality impulsivness, yet which you see develop and I expect to see a lot more depth and maturity of character in her next appearance (yet with the same light hearted fun to her personality!) Also LOL to reviews saying she didnt show enough emotion when she is repeatedly told to curb her emotion during her training and she is supposed to he a serious soldier like character (yet that also has a lot of fun). The movie rang as a true superhero origin story, not the most original in the world and they all have cliches but was made up for in details, dialogue, and actor chemistry.
Gotta say look at critic and user rating disparity, I dont always agree with critics but it is rare to see that high of a disparity and the low ratings might have to do with being threatened by a new era of female led superheroes movies-> you wont see that admited in the reviews but the details of the lower end ratings just dont make sense, did we watch the same movie? Please put down your expectations, see it for yourself, and make up your own mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Formulaic, certainly, but Marvel knows how to entertain","It says a lot about the mammoth universe built by Kevin Feige and the folks at Marvel over the past 11 years that merely the glimpse of a modified pager displaying the colours of their costume is enough to generate a huge amount of buzz around the arrival of a new superhero. Captain Marvel's introduction was teased during the traditional post-credits stinger of last year's Avengers: Infinity War, and now, just under a year later, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers finally makes her bow. Black Panther became a cultural phenomenon, and Infinity War delivered and then some on its promise to bring this breathtaking (first) saga closer to an end, so the small-scale and light-hearted Ant-Man and the Wasp was a welcome, if underwhelming palette cleanser. Captain Marvel is the studio's first female-led superhero film, so there's a weight of expectation behind Marvel once again.There has been a wave of ugliness online in protest against the idea of female empowerment and Brie Larson's pro-feminist comments before the film even premiered, but an opening weekend of north of $500 million has silenced the haters and, with any hope, brought us closer to a future when a hero's gender or sexuality is irrelevant to a film's success. Captain Marvel is far from perfect. In fact, it relies heavily on Marvel's tried-and-tested origin story formula we saw a lot of when this universe was still in its first phase, although directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck toy around with the structure enough to keep things slightly less familiar. Anyone who was keen to write Captain Marvel off as an example of forced diversity should take the time to actually watch it. Don't get me wrong, the film takes a strong pro-feminist stance and tackles issues plaguing our modern world, but it does so with subtlety. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel is strong, confident, even arrogant at times, but just like Tony Stark or Dr. Strange, she is also flawed, troubled and - despite the mystery surrounding her ancestry - recognisably human.The warrior known as Vers (Larson) is a member of Starforce, an elite band of soldiers operating within the Kree Empire tasked with infiltrating the Skrulls, a race of shape-shifting aliens they have been at war with since before they can remember. Vers is troubled by dreams that feel like memories she does not remember, but her commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to put aside her emotion to focus on the enemy. During a mission to rescue one Starforce's own, Vera is captured by Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), who proceeds to dissect her memories before they all crash down on a strange, primitive planet. That planet is Earth, and the year is 1995. It isn't long before an eager, two-eyed agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. called Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is drawn to this mysterious stranger and is caught up in her desire to uncover the secrets of her past, along with learning of an intergalactic war that may one day threaten his home. With the help of old friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and a cat named Goose, Vers discovers that she was born Carol Danvers, and that everything she has been taught about who she is and what she's fighting for may actually be a lie.Although Marvel have done period before with Captain America: The First Avenger back in 2011, Boden and Fleck were clearly having fun revelling in some 90's nostalgia. Although some of the music choices are a little on-the-nose, the appearance of a Blockbuster store and the sound of a dial-up internet connection will delight those, like me, who grew up in the decade. The big joke is that while Carol embarks on galaxy-hopping adventures with the Kree, down here on Earth everything takes an age to load. Captain Marvel switches seamlessly between these two extremes with good humour, and for a character that is destined to become the franchise's next cosmic powerhouse, the low-key approach to her origin actually works in the film's favour. It also allows time for Larson to develop the character, whether it be bouncing off Jackson's one-liners or discovering her old self with her best friend. Larson is great: strong but not over-powered, cocky but endearing. Despite Mendelsohn's scene-stealing, Larson ensures that it'll be Captain Marvel's appearance you'll be eagerly awaiting in the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. Formulaic? Certainly, but Marvel knows how to entertain, and they can't exactly re-define the genre with every film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Marvel is better than this garbage they sold us,"Do you enjoy watching a movie in which the main character has the same facial expression throughout the entire movie? If yes, then this movie is made for you otherwise stay away from this horrific movie. The excuse is ""they rushed this for Endgame"", but still couldn't have a worse job.
There isn't a single enemy or moment in the movie where you feel that the hero is in any danger. The origins of her powers still make absolutely no sense and this movie answers no questions and just tells you that this happened and accept it without any background.

Quite solid filmmaking,"The two-hour long Captain Marvel has a standard four-act structure, where each act has thirty minutes. The first and second act present some old-school hard-hitting action sequences, and the sound editing is impressive. The third act and fourth act offer some stunning set pieces, particularly the plane crash scene and the missile intercepting scene. There is also a major plot twist in the third act.

"An enjoyable, but flawed film that introduces a new character to the MCU","One major thing that people have said is that this film is great for ""Phase One"" of the MCU and that is absolutely true. The more recent films in this universe either raises the stakes for these heroes, adds more depth to them or does something unique to make it very worth watching. Although, I did enjoy it and want to see more of this character, this film didn't do anything to actually WOW me in any sort of way.There weren't any cool shots or standout scenes, even though I did enjoy all of the superhero stuff. The moment Captain Marvel uses her powers and starts using her abilities, we understand that she is a big deal and can be a huge asset for the heroes of Earth. Sadly, the characters didn't have enough personality for them to be memorable. For the most part, the plot is interesting by handling Carol Denvers adventure in rediscovering who she is and finding her place in this world, but I thought the execution could have been handled more carefully as the film did have some potential to go deeper with the characters. There was never that spark or flare that I've loved to see in an origin film and felt a little bit bland compared to the others. The characters that we have seen before, such as Nick Fury, is always nice to see as he and Denvers had good chemistry and provided a lot of the humor together. Excluding a few of the new characters, the rest were uninteresting and kind of had nothing to do.People do complain about Brie Larson and I thought she did fine here. She was able to bring a sense of personality to the character and although she isn't as interesting as the other characters in the MCU, Larson did the best with what she was given. Samuel L. Jackson is always great as Nick Fury and I'm glad we've got more screen time with him as this film provides as a prequel and we get to know who he is as a character. He brings in the humor and liked every single moment with him. One major plus is the special effects team by making him look so much younger, there was never a time where I noticed that it was fake. Ben Mendelsohn is actually pretty good here and I liked all they did with his character. One actor I'm actually disappointed in and not because of he was bad, but because he had nothing to do was Jude Law. I wanted to see more Jude Law here and if they film was able to put him more to build a bond and relationship between his character and Larson's, then it would have made his character even more interesting.The stuff that happens on Earth is easily the best part of the film as it was able to bring the comedy and entertainment. However, I wished that the film focuses more on the Star Force team which would have helped add more tension and conflict throughout the film. Some of them do appear in other films and it had potential for us to get to know them. Instead, we only get a glimpse of these soldiers and do not have any sort of understanding of who they are and not being able to connect with them. After the first act, they disappear and appear again for the climax in which wasn't executed well as I don't remember their names or their abilities.One thing that I did like was that the movie had a few twists that surprised me. I expected things to happen a certain way based on discussions I had about the characters and based on the trailer only to have the film to do something unexpectedly. The pacing and the overall story is still fun to watch, but because of the caliber of the previous films, it just feels weaker than usual. Also, one final remark, all of this talk and ""controversy"" I never had a single moment of Marvel bringing in politics to cinema. I have talked to some people who did not like parts of the film due to the fact that they believed the agenda that Marvel was trying to push. You see what you want to see and I saw a decent, but flawed superhero flick that is enjoyable to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Does a good job making other movies worse.,"To me, the primary issue with this movie is really how much it just makes anything having to do with Nicholas Fury, Colson and SHIELD worse.... These storylines were terrible and needed to never have happened. SLJ was fine in it, he was silly and goofy which is totally in line with the Nick Fury character (wait, not it isn't). And the animation was... distrcating (they made Colson and Fury look 30 years younger which was aweful). Shield's place and involvement made little to no sense other than they wanted to get a way to have CM tied to the rest of MCU and give her an in to Endgame which really creates problems in the first 3 Avengers movies.Jokes in this movie were... not funny, I think I laughed maybe once though I can't recall the joke. They produced more eye rolls than anything else. But they tried REALLY REALLY hard to be funny which was kind of painful. I think Jackson did all right delivering jokes, even if they weren't good.... Larson doesn't seem to have a funny bone in her body.Speaking of Larson, she was fairly.... annoyed. Best I got. I mean take the dealing with the kid in Iron Man that Tony Stark had where yeah he was annoyed with the kid but it was kind of funny... Larson was dealing with a kid whom she wasn't supposed to be annoyed with but boy did she seem annoyed. I mean I realize that she wasn't supposed to be.... personable? But they kept on giving her snarky lines and she wasn't snarky... at... all....Now look, I get that Marvel had a female problem and they needed to solve it, and when they made this movie, the Fox buyout wasn't in sight so they didn't have a ton of options... And Maybe in future movies Captain Marvel will be fine, after all, the Captain America movies.... wait he wasn't funny but those movies were surprisingly good. Nevermind bad point. CM is not a great character, about the best part about her is her cat.... Chewie... wait what happened to Chewie? Could Marvel not attain rights to the name from Disney? Oh well, maybe Disney will fix the character by introducing Rogue in order to take Danvers out.This movie was uninspired, poorly acted, not well thought out and just... bad... on the bright side, it isn't the worst MCU movie out there as some others have suggested....",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

We're obviously not watching the same film folks,"Take the time out of your busy schedule and think critically before you judge this movie. The floods of trolls and 1 star reviews had their mind made up about this flick before it was even released. It just goes to show some adults grow up but never actually mature.
So I put on my big kid pants and actually gave this movie a shot. And guess what folks? The film wasn't terrible. Dare I say, it was actually very good. Nothing particularly spectacular or groundbreaking, but good nonetheless. I thought the makeup, effects, and fight choreography was stellar. The movie ran at a decent pace, I was actually engaged in the story and wasn't quite sure what was going to happened next. Marvel managed to another villain with a good twist that is actually entertaining and even sympathetic with their plight. Brie Larson does a fine job portraying the marvelous captain. I don't understand how people say that Brie's performance is wooden and compare her to ScarJo's Black Widow when there hasn't been a single memorable or interesting scene of MCU Black Widow other than her introduction scene in Iron Man 2 (also let's be real ScarJo has the emotional range of a baby wipe).
The dynamic between Fury and Danvers is great, I was surprised how well these two played off each other. The friendship between Carol and Maria was also well done and felt genuine. I loved the message of how Carol's humanity is what truly makes her strong, thwt how even though we may fall; getting back up is what matters. The refusal to give up against all odds is where true strength lies. A solid superhero flick. I gave it chance, and so should you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"For Goose, Fury and ... Carol Danvers !!","First of all, Brie Larson is one of my favorite young actresses, with Room and Short Term 12 for instance. So, I could not miss a Marvel with Brie Larson. In addition, the special effects are rather well done, and the film is funny (especially the danger detector that would not work according to Nick Fury). But it lacks a I-do-not-know-too-what in order to make it an excellent movie. In particular, the film is insufficiently pedagogic about the capabilities of the main character: in exactly 7 minutes (timed and verified at second viewing), we elliptically switch from a woman who does karate, manually warms a kettle and is able to send energy flows from her fists, without really knowing why or how, to a woman whose power seems limitless, on a scale we have never seen before in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a few weeks, within Avengers 4, she will be one character among too many others super heroes, while we barely know her. I wanted more about her. I still want more!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

'An absolute blast which comfortably triumphed my expectations.',"Captain Marvel stars Academy Award winner Brie Larson as the titular comic-book superheroine in the latest entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Carol Danvers is first introduced to us as Vers, an intergalactic Kree warrior trained to serve in the ongoing Kree-Skrull war. Her journey leads her to Earth circa 1995, where she slowly begins to unravel her mysterious past there as an air force pilot. Through her buddy cop team-up with S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury, Carol discovers her true self and becomes the hero Captain Marvel.First things first, I had very little expectations going into this movie, largely due to an underwhelming marketing campaign. Nevertheless, part of me also had a sneaking suspicion that Marvel were keeping their cards close to their chest as to try and not give away too many of the film's secrets. Thankfully for me the latter proved to be true. Captain Marvel is an absolute blast which comfortably triumphed my expectations. This is a true fantasy, sci-fi, superhero, action adventure epic which is exhilarating to watch and is sure to be a real crowd pleaser.It would be a disservice for me to discuss the films merits without me commenting on the performance of lead actress Brie Larson. I was sceptical going into this film, certain that she had been miss-cast and would deliver a wooden, un-interested performance. I couldn't have been more wrong; Larson is fantastic and brings to life a character full of heart, humour, attitude and strength. The supporting cast are equally brilliant with Ben Mendelsohn a clear stand-out as Skrull General Talos. Like many, I feel Mendelsohn has often been type-cast in villain roles but thankfully here he is so much more than your run-of-the-mill comic-book supervillain. Talos is delightfully menacing but at times also wildly entertaining, with many of the film's best lines delivered by him. Samuel L. Jackson of course returns as Nick Fury, this time around much younger and more optimistic. Fury, along with fellow MCU alumni Agent Coulson, are welcome additions to the cast and provide much of the films heart and humour.What I found most intriguing was how the movie served to fill in many of the blanks that existed within the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Of course, that's not to say you have to watch all 20 entries to appreciate the movie, but there remains a large number of Easter eggs for die-hard Marvel fans to feast upon. The film also has a number of surprises, which at times left me stunned. Without a doubt these moments greatly contributed to my overall enjoyment of the movie. Captain Marvel is far from a perfect film, however, and there are certainly a few elements that I could have done without.As seen in the trailers, Captain Marvel is set in 1995 and the filmmakers go to every effort to remind the audience of that fact. Many of the film's more comedic moments are derived from 90s pop-culture references and feel extremely forced at times. Many of the films song inclusions are also odd choices that took me out of the movie, albeit briefly.Going into the film I had several concerns and fears for the movie that were luckily proved to be unfounded, I therefore strongly recommend to re-evaluate your own personal expectations before checking this one out. I went into this movie with an open-mind and I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. That's not to say that Captain Marvel ranks as one of the all-time great comic-book films, it just isn't. I personally rank this one alongside other solid MCU origin stories such as Doctor Strange or Captain America: The First Avenger. On the whole this movie is one hell of a good time that is sure to appeal to audiences young or old, female or male.

I really enjoyed this origin story for a character I knew nothing about. I've never read the comics so can't say if it paid justice to the comic character. But i didn't care. The movie was entertaining, funny and followed Marvel's winning formula.

All in all if you've enjoyed watching all the Marvel movies so far you won't be disappointed with this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Good, not bad either","First half is a bit slow, second half flows better. I like where the skrull story went. There are a few too cheesy moments that seem a bit biased, mostly in scenes with Maria on Earth. I also didn't like Law's and Larson's chemistry. It seems as Larson is trying too much to not have expressions in many cases in their joint scenes, when Law makes it seem more natural and less stiff. Captain Marvel's big moment with her full power is a bit blunt.
All in all it's an OK movie. I expected a better result, but it's not for the trash as many suggest. It's a 6/10 for me.PS: It was promoted as the last step before Endgame and having heard so many times how powerful Captain Marvel is during 2018, I can safely say even if you skip it and go straight to Endgame, you want miss anything. You already know how powerful she is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
There is nothing wrong with the movie,I still don't understand why so many people are giving such bad rating to it. May be they were expecting some terrific story line and high end action sequences like other Avengers movie. But we need to understand that Avengers story is a combined effort of a team of Avengers and they all have proved themselves with time. On the other side Captain Marvel movie is a much needed introduction to Captain Marvel herself as an Avenger. This part was important to connect the dots between Captain Marvel and upcoming Avengers Endgame. Everybody has a life story and so does Captain Marvel. There is nothing wrong with it. I agree that Brie Larson could be better at some places but still it's a must watch if you are a MCU and Avengers fan.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why all the hate??,"Captain Marvel is a superhero film and is also the twenty first film in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) franchise. Captain Marvel stars Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn. Captain Marvel revolves around a Kree warrior named Carol Danvers who has recurring memories of her past while at the same time getting caught in the middle of a war between the Kree and the Skrulls. Now I think I'm going to start this review by addressing the elephant in the room and that is Brie Larson. Brie Larson came under fire for making a racist remark about how this movie was made to target female audiences and not white male audiences. I may be paraphrasing that, but you could look up articles and watch videos about that because I don't want to get into all the details. And after that remark all the Internet trolls were mad and some of them have this fantasy that Brie Larson took the role of Captain Marvel because she's a strong female superhero who is the only superhero that could destroy Thanos. They also said that Brie Larson was miscast because she only had one emotion and that we were supposed to look up to her as a symbol. And my response to all this statement is is that its no the best, but it could've been a lot worse. I know nothing about Captain Marvel, nor do I intend to go out and immediately buy a Captain Marvel comic book. Not once during the whole movie did I feel that Brie Larson ruined Captain Marvel for me or that she seemed uninterested in taking the role. She portrayed the character really well and maybe it was do to the fact that there were so many backlash against her being Captain Marvel, that she was able to tap into that character. The movie offers great special effects, characters, and an emotional ride where I almost actually cried. And also die-hard Marvel fans are still going to see this film because they don't care about all that information I just mentioned. And its still going to make trillions of dollars whether it sucks or not. So overall, while Captain Marvel may not be the best superhero movie out there, its definitely not the worse we've seen that's it's worth the price of a ticket whether you're a comic book fan or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent Origin Story,It's not a great superhero movie but it's also not a bad movie either. This Origin movie will remind you of MCU's 1st Phase Origin movies like Iron Man & Thor.

Good solid film,"Visually this was an awesome movie. While pacing was really weird in this movie and at certain times Brie Larson was bland that's about all I have negative to say. In a way I consider this a needed filler movie. They needed her origin story and this was sandwiched into the last bite of the sandwich between infinity war and end game so calling it a filler would be appropriate and for that, probably one of the best superhero filler movies ever.

"The film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result!","About to end its phase 3 with an ""Ultimatum"", one of the most awaited films of the last decades, Marvel still finds time to introduce new and important characters in its shared universe. In the comics, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, debuted in the Silver Age of American comics. The character was featured in a solo series in the late 1970s, before associating with the superhero teams, The Avengers and X-Men, the character was created by screenwriter Roy Thomas and designer Gene Colan. Danvers first appeared as an officer in the United States Air Force and a colleague of superhero kree Mar-Vell in Marvel Super-Heroes # 13 (March 1968). In recent times, Danvers has been labeled ""Marvel's greatest heroine"" and ""possibly"" most powerful Marvel Avengers member. ""
In theaters, ""Captain Marvel"", in addition to being the first Marvel film starring a heroine, is the bridge between ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and the long-awaited ""Avengers: Ultimatum"". Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, it stars Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashanna Lynch, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Mckenna Grace, Clark Gregg and Jude Law. takes us takes us to before all the other MCU features (except for Captain America: The First Avenger). In 1995, the story follows Danvers when she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien worlds, borrowing elements from screenplay writer Roy Kree-Skrull (1971). Thomas.
For starters, the publisher's homage to his legendary comic artist Stan Lee stands out, putting him in the place of the characters he created in the opening animation of Marvel Studios. Lee passed away in late 2018 and, before that, he even recorded his famous participation in the film, appearing in the scene where the heroine hunts a Skrull in the subway.
Exploring flashes of the past very well, the heroine tries to discover more about her own past, as well as understand and master her powers. Finally, the heroine manages to show a more human facet to the public through the partnership with Nick Fury that generates several situations of comedy that gives lightness to the war by showing it through Fury's still innocent eyes, and also with Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch), which is the heroine's great connection to her past. It is in Maria's memories the memory of facing prejudices as pilots and in the support for the creation of little Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). But there are other characters who are doing very well and steal all the scenes they participate in: Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and the cat Goose. Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Dr. Wendy Lawson / Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) are good assistants.
Because it is a film that takes place decades ago, it is curious to see several of the characters that we get used to accompany, in another moment of life. Ronan the Accuser, who first appeared as the great villain of Guardians of the Galaxy and a lackey for Thanos, appears as the leader of an elite Kree force, the Accusers; Korath is just a Kree soldier; Agent Coulson appears as a young and promising agent and the main highlight is Nick Fury. At the time, he was an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who, after years as a spy, worked outside the field looking for ways to protect the Earth. He is still inexperienced and had no knowledge of intergalactic issues, let alone superpowered beings. Jackson and Gregg - who, among others, reprise their roles in previous MCU films - were digitally rejuvenated in post-production to reflect the setting of the film in the 90s. And the result couldn't be better: they are of an absurd quality, bordering on the perfection.
One of the main aspects of the feature is the infinity of references not only in relation to the stories of the publisher's comics, but also in the pop culture of the 80s and 90s, where the story predominantly takes place. After escaping the Skrulls, Carol Danvers falls to Earth inside a Blockbuster video store. As the feature takes place in the 1990s, it is possible to see references to classics such as Hook: The Return of the Captain Hook (1991), Babe, the Rough Piggy (1995), True Lies (1994), in addition to The Elected: Where the Future Begins (1983). The musical references are also present, with several references of bands from the 80's and early 90's. She appears with a Guns N 'Roses T-shirt - and finds a ticket to the group's concert, a Bush poster appears when she is on the pay phone, Nine Inch Nails, Heart t-shirts appear, a Smashing Pumpkins poster and even a reference to grunge in the heroine's civilian outfits.
Another reference is Captain Marvel's cat, which in the comics is called Chewie in a reference to Star Wars. In cinema, however, Marvel chose to call him Goose, a direct reference to Anthony Edwards' character in Top Gun: Untamed Aces. It is not, however, a conventional feline. Goose arrived on Earth with Mar-Vell and is an alien of the Flerken race, with internal tentacles and the ability to swallow objects as powerful as the Tesseract. In comics, the breed also has the ability to harbor dimensions within itself, being able to teleport from place to place, in addition to laying numerous eggs. In the film, aware of the threat of Flerken, the Kree gag the creature, in a moment inspired directly by the comics. The film also reveals how Nick Fury lost his eye - a scratch from Goose, and how theories emerged about how he came to use his famous eye patch, with Fury insisting on feeding the aura of mystery around the wound. There is also the fact that Fury was inspired by Danvers to propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. recruiting exceptional individuals to defend the Earth together from unconventional threats, and when he discovers that Danvers was codenamed ""Avenger"" in the Air Force, he names this protocol ""Avengers Initiative"".
Although the film highlights the friend Maria Rambeau, we must pay attention to her daughter. Monica Rambeau in the comics is one of the most powerful heroines in the Marvel Universe, having even been the first woman to use the name Captain Marvel. In 1982, at Amazing Spider-Man Annual # 16, Marvel introduced Monica Rambeau at the hands of Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. as a New Orleans police officer who has the power to transform into any form of energy. As Captain Marvel, she was a member of the Avengers and even led the team. Then he adopted the name Photon (which in the film appears as Maria's nickname in the air force, as shown in the photo above), Pulsar and currently serves as Spectrum. As the film takes place in the 90s, Mônica is around 30 years old in the present line of the MCU.
However, the film is not just a nostalgic trip and it has different points. Perhaps due to their lack of experience in running large blockbusters, the duo of directors are unable to shoot action scenes that look spectacular. The prevalence of more closed plans and not so imposing scenarios, fail to give the scenes greater proportions as they should. The feeling is that in the hands of another director, the scenes could be reimagined in the way that worked best on the big screen. In addition to not being grandiose, the scenes are scarce, being almost all restricted to the final act of the story, and were also not helped in many moments by the visual effects team. In several scenes, it is possible to notice the use of CGI in the composition of scenarios, giving an air of artificiality, especially in the final stretch when the heroine fights aerial fights with her powers developed.
The rhythm of the film is a problem with the plot starting relatively at a slower pace, taking time to explain the central conflict - deeper than it appears - and, of course, the protagonist's role in this story. So, gradually, Captain Marvel gains a more intense cadence and it is in her arrival on Earth that the film actually begins to take a more defined form. There is also the issue of the Skrull-Kree war, which is summed up in a very simplistic and incoherent way. We have a little war. In the film, everything is very predictable. From the beginning, one feels that nothing is as it seems, and the real villains can be identified with a mere guessing exercise. However, it is the lack of personality of the antagonists, generic in their plans and worldview, that damage the plot more deeply. Seeing this weak antagonism after figures like Killmonger and especially Thanos is, to say the least, something that lowers the experience to a B or C series within this recent crop.
Long before she was Captain Marvel, Carol was a fearless girl finding her place in a world of men. As a human, she has flaws, but whenever she fell, she got up, tried herself and got everything she wanted. A child, a teenager, a young adult. The transformation into Kree would be the starting point for the character, if her entire past no longer assumed a hero's journey. The feminist subtext, although well implemented, does not reach the depth that racial and cultural themes gained in the film of the hero of Wakanda. And you don't even have to reach it. Issues can be raised for discussion without becoming flags blindly defended by a particular group. Overall, the film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result and a character that will certainly be one of the leaders of The Avengers in the next films!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best about the movie is Samuel L. Jackson... and the cat,"I enjoyed this movie. It's an OK movie. The kind of movie that would've gone under the radar if it wasn't because it ties to The Avengers and the polemic around Brie Larsson's persona.If anything Captain Marvel piggy bagged on The Avengers fandom because otherwise mist people wouldn't be interested in this version of a female Superman.Samuel L Jackson, the cat and the aliens save the movie and make it worth the ticket.

Watchable shake and bake superhero stick.....,"Captain Marvel is yet another in a long production line of what I call ""shake and bake"" super hero flicks.Its not bad as such. You just have to accept going in that what you are getting is much the same formula that you will find with most other superhero franchise films.This is good guy vs bad guy stick with lots of special effects and things going ""boom"".The typical, drawn out, chocolate box, US folk-sey thing was mercifully kept to a minimum and something of a twist was thrown in. Taken together, this helped the pacing of the film and removed a little of the bland predictability normally associated with this kind of fare.There has been criticism of the acting from some quarters. I'm inclined to disagree. Action sci fi films like this one are more about exposition which tends to limit the potential for actors to really offer up stand out performances. Samuel L Jackson as always provides some welcome comic relief as did the ""cat"" (watch the film and see if you don't agree with me).In short Captain Marvel is what you expect it to be and what you get is, to be fair, quite watchable. 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Do Yourself Favor; Review the Negative Reviewers,Almost without exception the reviewers who rated this below a 4 have very few reviews on IMDb. And the ones that had a decent sample size of 4 or more had horrible movies like The Lone Ranger rated at a 10. If you rated typical superhero movie fair like Aquamam a 10 and Captain Marvel below a 5 I can't take your reviews seriously. Because both of these movies are fun and have holes. The Captain Marvel story however is more surprising and compelling. And Brie Larson in a very medicore performance for her is still better than Jason Momoa. Although Jason is more attractive than Brie. This is very good movie. Probably a solid 6-7 for anyone that likes typical superhero movies that doesn't go into it with a lot of bias,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However her supporting cast largely made up for this and as with all Marvel movies it looked beautiful and moved along at a fair pace.I think a lot of people gave this one star because they are easily swayed and brainwashed by other people's political ideologies.

Not quiet Marvellous,"I have said it before and I will say it again. The Marvel Cinematic Universe are on a higher plane compared to other superhero franchises. They can knock it out of the park, shot after shot.I went to this movie knowing almost nothing about Captain Marvel apart from there was originally another DC character with the same name who became Shazam.The film takes a little while to get going as it wants to set up the character of Vers/Carol Danvers (Brie Larson.) Vers is a warrior recruited by the Kree. They are fighting the evil Skrulls who take over planets by infiltrating them. They are shapeshifters led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn.)After trying to get away from the Skrulls, Vers ends up in LA of 1995 where she meets a young two eyed Shield operative Nick Fury accompanied with Agent Coulson who is new to Shield.Vers though has some memories of being on earth but her memories are filled with fuzzy. Vers thinks she might had been an ace test pilot on Earth. The key is Dr Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who might provide more information.However it is a race against time as Skrulls are also looking for Dr Lawson and something she created.Once a de-aged Nick Fury turns up, the film hits gear. It also has a few twists in the story and the humour emerges. Marvel films always do well when they add some fun.It does stick too close to the Marvel formula, the directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck never put their own stamp in Captain Marvel. The hand of producer Kevin Feige is all over it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I'll just need to remember that Marvel CAN get it right but need to stop this pandering to a fringe of lunatics.The movie is cringe from beginning to end.

"Not marvelous, but an ok movie nonetheless.","While it's protagonist could have been a lot more interesting and fun, she is still a good protagonist when compared to other female superheroes in female led superhero movies that aren't ""Wonder Woman"". The movie itself is a serviceable enough origin story and ends up having a rather big impact on the story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Better After Years Of Other Marvel Blunders,"I enjoyed watching this many years later after seeing it in theaters years ago. I'm not sure if it was better than my original impression of it the second time around or if many of Marvels post End game blunders make this appear better relative to them. I've also seen Brie Larson more since then and I've grown more accustom to her style.For the majority of the movie the story is decent and I don't mind the character interactions between Fury and Vers/ Carol. Talos also is pretty good for the role he plays.The ending, however, is poorly planned and completely ridiculous. There was some character development within Captain Marvel, but she out of nowhere just becomes totally overpowered and can destroy anything she wants. With her power at the end of this movie she could have easily taken on Thanos on her own.

One of the better origin stories in the movie-verse!,"Captain Marvel delivers as an origin story. Origin stories tend to follow a formula because of their very nature.

Captain Marvel takes what it can from this trite structure, and makes it fun and enjoyable.Brie Larson acts the lovable superhero to perfection but perhaps the best part of the movie is Fury. The movie in some ways encapsulates a smaller origin story for Nick Fury and the Avengers. We get to see a lighter side to Fury as he banters with Carol Danvers across the film. The cat, however, drew the most laughs from my fellow audience-goers. I loved the whole 90's Top Gun vibe in the movie as well. Also, damn, Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel does not pull any punches.

Enjoyed it a lot,"I really enjoyed watching this movie and I've seen quite a lot of superhero action movies over the past ten years and more.
Right at the beginning, there is a nice hommage to Stan Lee and there is also a cameo later.
The protagonist is a strong and sympathetic character and she is played really well by Brie Larson. Like most other superheroes her main choice of problem solving is by violent means but in between her actions also hints at the powerful message to never give up and stand up again (and again) no matter what odds are against you.
She is accompanied by some other strong characters too, i.e. she gets joined by Nick Fury. The setting is in 1995, so here we see a younger Nick Fury and also Agent Coulson, both already working for S.H.I.E.L.D yet in different positions than later. We also get a soundtrack full of hits of the Nineties, like Nirvana, Garbage, TLC and others. The original soundtrack was not overwhelming yet okay. If you see the movie, wait until the end to see two short extra scenes, one of them hinting at ""Marvel's The Avengers: Endgame""I won't tell anything about the plot in order to avoid spoilers. The weaknesses I see in the movie are these two:
1. One might argue that Captain Marvel is so powerful that she seems a bit like a Mary Sue. However she has at least one flaw, because she often looses her temper quite quickly and has problem controlling her powers and her impulses, at least at the beginning. Maybe another or a different character flaw would have been a good idea yet I don't how the character is presented in the comics. Maybe she is just meant to be so powerful and with little flaws - and I can completely live with that.
2. Due to a lot of flashbacks the structure of a story seems a bit like a puzzle. The story keeps going back and forth in time which makes it a bit difficult to watch at some points especially because you keep wondering what is going on - like the protagonist does as well. However, finally everything falls into place when the plot twist is revealed and the action is heading to the showdown.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as bad as we first thought,"Samuel L Jackson is the best part of this film, the de-aging of him and Coulson is cool to see. Jude Law gives a good performance too. While Brie Larson gets a bad reputation, she's decent in this film and she works well with Jackson.The film has some good moments and is funny at times. The ""girl power"" scenes are pretty cringey and the story is abit weak. It's definitely not going to be in the top 15 of Marvel movies but it's definitely not the worst.It was critiqued harshly back in 2019 but compared to the phase 4 Marvel films that have come out since, it holds up well enough and is worth watching during a MCU binge.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Was not expecting this at all,I'll be honest i had high hopes from this movie and it was not worth the hype. See many people are complaining about brie larson and kind of agree with them.

Very fun and quirky,"I absolutely loved Captain Marvel and Brie really shines in her role. The movie was funny and very entertaining. One of the best things about it is Carol's personality, I like how she's different from Wonder Woman (people compare these 2 too much). Whereas Wonder Woman is innocent/naive and very sweet in her movie, Carol seems like the strong silent type with a sprinkle of humour that has a kind/soft heart that gets uncovered in certain key moments. Nothing wrong with Wonder Woman though, I love her also, but it's refreshing to see other kinds of personalities on female superheroes.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fantastic Movie! It just,Grows&Grows&Grows. Excellent stuff","I have got say i loved this movie. I thought it was awesome. So much so i will go and watch it again soon, especially to pick up on the cool 90's references again dropped in through out the movie also to pick up the bits that help answer alot of the questions over the MCU.
I will be honest and say it does take a short while to get going but with any new character it was never gonna come out of the traps guns blazin as you need to grow a new character or they will seem too one dimensional and captain marvel is anything but one dimensional. Brie Larson is fantastic in this, as is Samuel l jackson. And so is ben mendelsohn. The humor is fantastic too.
This movie just grows and grows and grows leaving you wanting more and more and more. Job done there then really as i cant wait to see more of captain marvel's character in the future.

A disconnected movie about a disconnected character,"While there are definitely some entertaining moments in Captain Marvel, the film overall feels flat and rehearsed with a cobbled-together storyline. The filmmakers really try to make you care about what's going on by shoehorning in a connection to the MCU, but it was difficult to emotionally connect to the plot and characters. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't bring anything really new to the table.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely worth the watch,"Is Captain Marvel the best Marvel movie?
No.

Without a doubt. The chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson is very well developed and believable seeing Colson again is also a win.

Fun Action film with Weak characters.,"Captain Marvel has a lot of really cool action scenes, and a pretty compelling story. The one thing it seemed to be missing just so happened to be the one thing it was shooting for, A compelling Character. The audience never got to see Carol's motivations which resulted in us not caring for her as a character. We were shown numerous clips from her past of her falling down, but without the context, we don't know how to feel for her. I guess Marvel just hoped we would feel sympathetic without much work.

Disapponting Marvel Movie,"Felt like the movie was more targeted as a feminist anti-culture than a good marvel movie. It portrayed that women are weak and must overcome difficulty (The movie only portray difficulties from men) in order to become strong. It also shows that in order to become truly strong one must give in to emotions (Again portraying men as logical beings and women as emotional). They even went so far as to use music with male lead singers for the villain only, while the protagonist only had music from female lead singers. I only enjoyed the movie for its back story to Fury. The only continuity to Marvels previous movies for existing fans is the CGI action scenes.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I guess it's a good one.,"The beginning did not catch my attention enough and I always treasure good beginnings. However, the story progresses very well and is told in a careful manner. Some humour is definitely there as well, but I can't tell if there's too much of it or too little.The plot twist is quite an important feature and you will never see it coming -that's what got me the most excited in the middle of the movie.Brie Larson plays the part quite well, juggling between the robotic soldier she was made to be and another part of her that existed a long time ago. Maybe some scenes are just a little too robotic, compared to her other Kree companions.Overall it's definitely a good movie to watch and there is a lot of different opinions about it.

Generic. Just another episode of MCU. Nothing more.,Marvel movies can never be taken seriously as a standalone movie. I dont remember when it was but I just started to feel that I should watch MCU movies because I dont want to miss the episode.As usual this is just another episodic movie that fits right in the never-ending MCU.Still Marvel does fine job on delievering fun story with right jokes to hit at the right time.Ben Mendelsohn as Talos is a great villain. Same goes with other supporting characters including Jude Law and Gemma Chan. Scene stealer of the movie is obviously Sam L Jackson. Jackson portrays younger Fury more energetic and rookier than his current character. Every scenes with Jackson were a blast!Sadly... I strongly beleieve Brie Larson is a miscast. She is extremely dull and boring. Marvel should have hired more energetic and fun actress to portray Carol Denvers.Hope she does better in future films but in this movie Brie Larson is not quite right.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another solid Marvel entry,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe reached it's crowning apex with Avengers: Infinity War. The film left comic book fans and causal viewers devastated by the snap of Thanos. Just when all hope had seem abandoned in the MCU, the post-credits sequence teased the appearance of Captain Marvel. Oscar-winner Brie Larson signed on to play the hero in the first female-centered superhero movie. Anticipation was high and filled with great controversy before the actual release of the film. After being the nerd I am and going to the first possible showing, I am here to tell you that I was somewhat pleased with the results.Captain Marvel is a somewhat mixed bag of genres. It uses some aspects of a neo-noir, such as lost memories, a lack of trust in all characters, and a bad-ass femme fatale. Using a poor man's Memento-like plot, the film pieces together who really is the character we see on the screen. It also uses aspects of buddy cop films with the relationship with Captain Marvel and a younger Nick Fury. The story is the weakest part of the film, being incredibly threadbare at times. Even thought he film uses basic plot lines, the use of visceral imagery and storytelling is truly captivating. As a viewer, you can't help but be engulfed by the pure emotionality of the film, whether it is the humor, poignancy, or vigor Captain Marvel brings to the table.It was very interesting to see different performances from many actors who are typically typecast in roles. Brie Larson is usually utilized as a likable and charming character in most of her films. The transition to a more hardened yet charismatic hero is refreshing. Samuel Jackson going from the hardened rebel to an amiable side character reminds the viewer what a range he truly has. Ben Mendelsohn is finally not pigeon-holed into a one-dimensional villain and is finally given some heart and humor in a script. Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden know how to direct great acting performances as witness by 2000s indie darlings Half Nelson and It's Kind of a Funny Story. Using that filmography background made the drama within Captain Marvel to be that much more believable. Visually, the film's use of de-aging technology is the best that Industrial Light and Magic has created so far. On the contrary, the visual effects did at times look somewhat cartoonish. Being the forward thinker that I am, I could see these aspects of the movie not aging well for future generations.The choice of the 1990s as a period for the film was a unique choice by the filmmakers. At times, the film felt engulfed in the 90s culture many of us know well. On other instances, the film felt jam-packed with references at times became bothersome and left me as a viewer wanting to say, ""Okay! I get it!"" However, the film wouldn't nearly pull off its pure wit without some of the references, so overall, it was a well-utilized plot tool.Captain Marvel has been described as a 2-hour trailer for Avengers: Endgame. While some of that is true, it still is able to operate as a separate entity with satisfying tie ins to the rest of the MCU. The casual comic book viewer could still enjoy themselves and the die hard viewers are rewarded with wonderful connections to comic lore. The film is truly feminist in nature, proving that women are a force to be reckoned with, literally. Though it is not the strongest Marvel entity ever, Captain Marvel is another success for the comic book titan and is still better than any film D.C. has made.Grade: (7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good but not great,"This film failed massively in letting us get to know who the major characters are, or even the two alien races who despise each other. Even now I can't remember if we're even told why the two races were at war with each other in the first place. For a large part of the first act Danvers can't remember who she is; and we are only assisted in finding out via occasional flashbacks or voiceovers. Frankly I felt as confused as the character. We only find out about the main character's background with tidbits of info. I didn't really understand what was happening or why; and despite some flashy action sequences I found myself bored. The point when I started to become interested in the film was following a chase sequence in which we finally get to meet Fury. Jackson was de-aged for the entire film; and it looked flawless. The biggest compliment I can pay is that after the first time we see him I quickly forgot about the special effects and just saw him as young Fury. In the second act we begin to discover more about Danvers, as she begins to learn about herself. We see the origin of her powers; and it's at that point that the film finally begins to be interesting. I don't know why they couldn't have just started with that and told a linear origin story; instead of doing all the stupid, confusing flashbacks. Danvers and Fury end up turning this film into a sort of buddy cop style of film. The two of them are working together, cracking jokes while trying to discover the mystery of her identity. This part was actually fun. There's also a segment where Danvers meets with an old friend Maria and her daughter Monica. I have to admit that at no point did I feel like these girls were at one time close friends, I just didn't buy it. That said the relationship Danvers had with her friend's daughter was cute. Other fun aspects include the 90's soundtrack and hits of nostalgia. We also meet Goose the cat. The cat was certainly one of the most interesting characters. The last act is ok, although it was let down by the fact that it became a standard CGI fight. What's worse though is that it wasn't even a well shot fight. The colour pallet was mostly grim; the choreography was nothing to write home about; and the outcome was downright predictable. Overall, There were some aspects which I enjoyed, as well some parts where I was bored.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There were moments where I was engrossed in the movie and others when I was brutally pulled out of the immersion by some terribly lazy line or moment. Also the entire movie basically led up to the point where the character basically realized she's Supergirl and can do whatever she wants regardless of what's against her.

"That Cat is the main ""star"" of the film.","Marvel films are an entertainment show. They never claimed any deep and elegant art of cinema.

This was its value as a fun movie that can give you some ""cinematic pleasure"" ...However, in this film, everything went wrong. I will not talk about the fact that it was many... no, a lot of ""cinema missteps"". I will talk about thing that gave main value to Marvel movies and here are dead: In this film we don't know at all what this war is for and why it is being fought, shameless and rude behavior of the main heroine, which the entire film served under the sauce of smiles and chuckles. Super intelligence of world where it's soldiers have to be act without emotion behaves like average emotional person from Earth. Nick the whole movie exposes like some idiot and clown.

Could have been great,"Set in the nineties (the best decade since the 80s) featuring aliens and space ships a young Nick Fury and fan favorite Phil Couleson, this movie was set up to be awesome. Sadly the main character is probably the most unlikable in all marvel movies.Captain Marvel starts out arrogant and ruthless but unlike Iron Man she never gets humbled and shows no character development at all. And as she is able to soundly defeat her foes with her hands cuffed in the first quarter of the movie there isn't really any tension involved afterwards. Of course she succeeds at anything once she is wielding practically unlimited power.Luckily this movie gets carried over the finish line by its great support cast - Samuel L.

Jackson becoz i wanted to know how he handled the situation and how he lost his god damn eye. But i when i watched this movie i enjoyed this movie a lot.Captain Marvel manages to take the best ideas of early MCU origin stories like Iron Man and Thor and use them to form something that feels both familiar and fresh.There r many heroic moments of Nick furry and captain marvel but honestly speaking i don't care about captain marvel beocz her acting was pathetic and she has no expression on tge face at all . It is only becoz of Samuel Jackson which binds u to the movie till the end .And also she seemed overpowered and when she is doing capatin marvel stuff u don't feel that great as u feel like in a thor or Captain America films.It can be a bit on-the-nose at times, and occasionally has to fast-track its exposition in ways that can feel slightly clunky, but what it lacks in grace it makes up for in charm.My rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Captain Marvel Is A Blast,"Captain Marvel is one of the more controversial films in the MCU and, what with Endgame having just been released, I thought now would be the perfect time to write this review. I don't mind this movie, honestly. I feel like it has great acting from Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson. I don't like Brie Larson that much as a person, but I can't deny that she's a good actress. (She won an oscar after all) The stand out performance in this movie, however, was Ben Mendelson. Ben Mendelson's character is the best one on the movie. This movie's depiction of the skrulls bring a clever twist on established comic book lore. I also enjoyed Captain Marvel's story in this movie, while some she she doesn't have much of an arc, I disagree, but to explain why I'd have to spoil the movie, which I do not wish to do. What I didn't enjoy about this film was it's depiction of Nick Fury, he's a completely different character than in other Marvel films and doesn't even change into the character we knew in Phase 1. I also found Jude Law's character to be rather bland, which is a shame because he's very important to the movie. Finally, I didn't like that cat. That cat is single pawedly responsible for the stupidest scene in the MCU to date. So for all those reasons, I believe this film deserves a 7/10.

I also enjoyed the Coulson scenes as an avid Agents of Shield watcher and all the 90's throw backs.This isn't as much of a feminist film as it is a film regarding identity and strength.

"Better than feared, worse than hoped --- Or: Why is everyone giving this movie either 10/10 or 1/10?","I just watched the movie's midnight premiere here in Germany. So here are my first impressions:(+) The ""woke"" advertising campaign has little to do with the final film. I found Brie Larson offending, but I don't find Captain Marvel offending.(-) Generic plot. There are much better alien invasion flicks out there.(+) VFX + SFX are splendid. But that's a basic requirement for a Marvel movie.(-) The concept of a female Superman is as absurd as the concept of a male Superman. Did you dislike the scene in DC's ""Justice League"" where Superman flew around carrying a row house? If so, you will find Captain Marvel to be a camp culture screwball comedy that will make every Superman movie every produced look sane+sober. (I see that superheros per se are an absurd concept, but there has to be a limit!)(+) Good pacing. I never had the feelings of ""oh, I'm sick of that scene because it is so slow and adds nothing to the plot"" or ""oh, this was to fast for me to follow the plot"". (Edit: After having read many other reviews I'm surprised so many people seem to disagree on this point. Have they really seen the movie? Pacing was really good!)(-) As a 90s kid I can just say: What I saw, heard and felt was not like the 1990s, but more like the work of a screenwriter who did a serendipity trip through Wikipedia's 90s portal.(+) Solid camera work. It's good to see there are still people left in mainstream Hollywood who can do their job without inducing nausea in their audience.(-) Too many CGI sets. And yes, you can spot them quite easily. (This does not contradict the fact that this movie's VFX is splendid.)(+) I really like the props and costumes. Can't wait to see my gf in the Captain Marvel cosplay she's working on for the upcoming Leipzig Book Fair. ;-)(-) The MCU in general is increasingly suffering from franchise wear. In hindsight many fans might actually want to consider this movie as the genre's ""jumping the shark"" moment, but I personally think ""Thor: Ragnarok"" already did that job back in 2017.Conclusion: 5/10 + one extra star for the cat = 6/10. But that's the absolute maximum rating you can give this movie without having an agenda. 7/10 or more is fanboy palavering, 3/10 or less is hater rage.Because seriously, think of it: If you rate this movie 10/10, then what verdict would you give to the Avengers films? Or the Dark Knight Trilogy? Or the Godfather movies? 25/10? And if you rate this movie 1/10, what's your verdict on movies like ""Sharknado""? -25/10?Btw: I'm really looking forward to see Captain Marvel's review section in a few months. Because by then the ""honeymoon period"", in which everything is great and the weaknesses are widely ignored by joyful fans, will have worn off; and the haters will have shifted their attention to Hollywood's next SJW project. And yes, of course Captain Marvel is an SJW product. But it's still an ok movie that's far from being unwatchable like the all-female ""Ghostbusters"" from 2016 was. And it doesn't break the MCU's canon like the hyper-diverse ""Star Trek: Discovery"" broke Star Trek's 50-year-old canon. So, if you are a Marvel fan, there is no reason not to have fun with Captain Marvel. However, if Marvel stuff isn't your cup of tea, you might want to consider watching ""Alita: Battle Angel"" instead, as Cameron's movie is better made and features a female superhero, too. And if you don't like superhero movies at all, you might want to stay at home.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Middling Marvel....,"It has been ~ 10-12 hours since I came back from the premiere if this movie and I am struggling to find moments that stands out in my mind. Perhaps that is the biggest shortcoming of Captain Marvel the character and the movie is it is an unmemorable experience and a somewhat disappointing entry in the MCU (the second since the decidedly worse Ant Man and the Wasp).Without going into spoilers, one of the strongest criticism I have of the movie is the characterization of Captain Marvel herself. Her character does not have a strong arc and from the beginning to the end of the movie, the character does not go through any sort of meaningful change or development. She already calls herself a noble warrior hero early on in the movie, and by the end of the movie (drum roll) she saves some people.The hardest thing about a very powerful superhero is to make them seem vulnerable and relatable. The characterization of Superman is incomplete without the existence of kryptonite. In later movies/literature, that was slowly interchanged with Louis Lane/his parents/the inability to save everyone etc. But the central idea is a Superhero is only as interesting as the obstacles (weakness/adversaries) they face. Captain Marvel at best faces what amounts to minor inconveniences before everything is said and done. Even Thor went through a better arc in his debut movie, which is not considered even in the top 10 of the best marvel movies.As it stands, Captain Marvel is better than Ant Man 2 (in my humble opinion, the worst MCU movie) but only by a margin and an aggressively forgettable movie going experience. Hopefully, just like the other Captain in the MCU, her character and movies will get better with each sequel too.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Ignore the trolls, Captain Marvel is a fun time.","I saw this film at an advanced screening the other night with a bunch of friends and it was a fantastic evening out. A phenomenal cast all deliver, with Brie Larson giving a fine performance in the lead as a woman discovering exactly who she is. Her brand of snark was right up my alley and I'm excited to see her in a wider team dynamic.The plot seems fairly straight forward to begin with but various twists and turns keep you guessing throughout. The film also ties together various elements of the wider mythos of the MCU and my questions going in about how she'd fit into the universe were met with surprising yet satisfying answers. Unfortunately origin stories for Marvel tend to be their weaker efforts, with a lot of exposition and not packing quite the same emotional punch as when the character is fully established.So overall this is a middling Marvel effort... which means it is still a solid film with a lot of humour and heart. Make sure you stay for both credit scenes!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

origin story with 90's retro,"Greetings again from the darkness. Girl Power! Not only does this serve as an origin story for Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, but Anna Boden becomes the first female director of a Marvel movie (she co-directed with Ryan Fleck, and they previously collaborated on IT""S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY, SUGAR, and HALF NELSON). It's Marvel's first solo female superhero movie, and even though it's actually a prequel to what we've previously seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it clearly sets the table for AVENGERS: ENDGAME and the showdown with Thanos later this year.Oscar winner Brie Larson (ROOM) stars as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and the film opens with her as Vers, a human-Kree hybrid and a soldier of Starforce being trained by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) for a role in the Kree-Skrulls war. Part of the training includes regular reminders to keep her emotions under control ... see, not only is Vers a woman but she also shoots sonic blasts from her fists. The filmmakers have not presented her story in chronological order, but have instead utilized flashbacks and memories to let us (and Carol) in on how she obtained her immense powers.In Marvel tradition, the film uses much humor as it progresses. Proving that the action takes place in the 1990's, the roof literally comes down on a Blockbuster video store (foreshadowing future financial events), as Vers crashes to earth. Soon she has met young agents Fury and Coulson, played by digitally de-aged Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg, respectively. This is of course pre-eye patch Fury, though we do get that origin story a bit later in the film. As Vers peruses the Blockbuster shelves, we get a tip of the cap to THE RIGHT STUFF and TRUE LIES, and soon thereafter, a nod to Radio Shack, pay phones, pinball machines, pagers, and 90's era internet speed. The retro bits may be a bit overdone, but the millennial target audience will surely enjoy.The always interesting Ben Mendelsohn plays Talos, the leader of the shape-shifting Krulls - who also sport the best make-up as they transform from pointy-eared green aliens into exact replicas of humans. Lee Pace returns as Ronan the Accuser, while Djimon Hounsou is Korath and Gemma Chan is Minn-Erva, both part of Starforce. Annette Bening plays the AI Supreme Intelligence, while Mckenna Grace appears as young Carol in flashbacks.The glimpses of Carol Danvers as a US Air Force fighter pilot lead to the best dramatic scenes of the film - her reuniting with fellow pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Maria's daughter Monica (Akira Akbar). At first I was taken aback that Marvel dared cast a black actress in the role of stereotypical supportive sidekick, but then Ms. Lynch got her own impressive action chase sequence (similar to STAR WARS) and kicked some serious alien tail. Those familiar with the comics know that Maria Rambeau is the mother of Photon, a character likely to appear deeper in the universe.The co-directors also co-wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve contributed to the story. The strong female presence is impressive both on camera and off, as Pinar Toprak's score complemented the heavy 1990's rock music soundtrack. Again, nostalgia seems ever-present, as does the humor (Goose the cat/flerken) and good fun that existed in THOR: RAGNAROK and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Carol Danvers and her backstory also seem a bit more relatable than that of WONDER WOMAN.Marvel offered up a nice tribute to the late Stan Lee by providing a new opening featuring his many cameos over the years. And yes, he was able to film his cameo for this one prior to his death in November 2018. So we have an origin story not just of Captain Marvel, but also of the Fury eye patch, the Avengers Initiative, and a prequel to all Marvel movies we've seen in the past few years. Two post-film stingers are included: one expected and necessary, while the other is good for a laugh. It's an inspiring story of a young girl who repeatedly fell down and got up and brushed herself off every time - even before her fists and eye balls could shoot energy streams. It's fitting and about time that young girls now have their own superhero to emulate.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Higher Further Faster!,"Brie Larson enters in the role of Captain Marvel with style. Her palette of emotions is more than rich, so the hater can cry in the corner.

The movie is great and engaging, great action, fun moments, and lots of references that will only be appreciated by the true fans. There're suprises (some of them will blown you away).The combination between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson is something we could only have wish to this point. The chemistry between them is great. Jude Law is on point, Goose (the cat) just killing it, but man...Ben Mendelsohn steals every scene, just unique character!The visual effects do not disappoint! Everything looks even better than the trailers.One of the reasons why the film is interesting, is the time period in which it's set and all the small references to events from the Marvel Universe. It's not the ""typical"" Marvel movie for sure. Brie Larson and Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) kicks immediately and no, this is not movie about feminism, it's a great comicbook story about female lead character, get over it!It's not in my top 5 MCU movies, but I definitely can't wait to see Captain Marvel and The Avengers side by side! For sure her first appearance will be a blast! She's the necessary shock to the system, not the hero who will defeat Thanos, but with the combined efforts of the Avengers she will can do so much.

"A solid entertaining film, ignore the hating trolls","Ah, the one star reviews. As expected for a movie like this, right wing nut jobs that loose all hell when a female lead hero is cast. I'll admit myself this movie has flaws, but that doesn't mean it's not GOOD. First off, it does start slow, but once carol comes to earth the movie is endless fun with its flaws here and there. The chemistry between nick fury and carol is one of the highlights of the movie, we get a look at how fury was before the start of the avengers and tony stark, the action is great, the humor is well balanced, and the soundtrack is one of the BEST since guardians. The real stealers of the show is goose, and Talos, played by Ben Mendelssohn was phenomenal. He was also a Villian in rogue one, which was another great performance, but this was easily his best. This movie also ties in to endgame really well and it's awesome to see this side of the mcu in the 90s. Of course this movie will have it's flaws, but the one star trolls who hate this movie because it's different is ridiculous. They all did the same to black panther. Carol is portrayed exactly like the one from the comics, so it's obvious these trolls probably don't even know who captain marvel is.

Not a perfect movie but not an awful one either.,"CAPTAIN MARVEL NON-SPOILER REVIEW1) THE GOODThere were many great moments in this movie. Moments where long time MCU fans will really enjoy. Most of the MCU questions and plot holes will be cleared in this movie. The supporting cast (all of them) were very good. The best character in the movie by far is Ben Mendelsohn's Talos, i mean come on, its Ben Mendelsohn! My second favourite was Nick Fury, man did Samuel L. Jackson shined as hell in this movie. Brie Larson will be my third favourite though. Aside from the second act, she was so powerful, menacing and fun to watch. The mid credit scene was so awesome and the end credits was not great but fun to watch. I also loved what this movie has added to the overall MCU history. Oh yeah, Goose the cat was awesome too!2) THE BADBrie Larson as Captain Marvel was up and down for me though sadly. She was very good in the first and last act but in the middle act (especially on Earth) her character (for some reason) was acting kind of dull but there is still lots of movies where she can improve just like how Chris Hemsworth's Thor took 4-5 movies later to grow on me (in Thor: Ragnarok was where i started loving him). I also wished the Kree soldiers/Starforce members had more screentime and character development. Most of the Starforce's members role were very small. Also the colour grading for this movie was very awful. Some of the scenes were very difficult to see. The scenes were very dark, rusty and brownish. The pacing in this movie at some parts were very slow as well. But i get it as it needs to explain a lot to the audience. The action scenes were just ok as well. I was hoping for them to be unique and entertaining but they were just ok and above average. If you are a CGI nerd like me and you want every CGI scenes to look great and believable. Well, some CGI in the third act (the ones on Captain Marvel when she flies) are a bit game-like. But they arent awful or very obvious. I also wished they developed the relationship between Maria and Carol even more but what i got was fine and not that bad. My last criticism would be that there was a song that was played in the third act, the scene where the song drops felt very rushed and out of place for me.MCU movie ranking: 14th place (out of 21)

"Marvel's first female-led outing isn't without its flaws, but Brie Larson is good as the titular heroine and makes up for some of the shortfalls in the script","On the planet Hala, capitol of the Kree Empire ruled over by AI the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Benning), amnesiac Vers (Brie Larson) possesses the power of concentrated photon energy blasts which she uses as a member of Kree's military unit Starforce to fight against the Kree's sworn enemy the Skrulls, shapeshifting aliens lead by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). During a mission lead by Vers' commander and mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Vers is captured by Talos and the other Skrulls who read her mind and find several memories regarding a Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) on planet C-53 (Earth) locked within her mind. Vers escapes the Skrulls eliminating many in the process and crash lands on Earth circa 1995 with Talos and a few other Skrulls having survived. It isn't long before Vers' arrival is noticed by SHIELD agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and after saving his life from a Skrull attack the two team-up to stop the Skrulls and understand what Vers' connection to Earth and Dr. Lawson is.Captain Marvel marks both the 21st entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as the first female-fronted solo MCU film following the long unsatiated demand that had followed the MCU (with Black Widow often a subject of discussion on that point). In 2014 it was announced that Captain Marvel would be the first female-led superhero film adapting the Carol Danvers incarnation of the character with the project going through a lengthy development process including changes to the origin story due to perceived similarities between Danvers and the DC Comics character Green Lantern. Brie Larson became the front runner early on with Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck later slated to direct the project. Upon release the film became a decent sized success garnering $1.1 billion worldwide against its $175 million budget, with many critics praising Larson's portrayal the titular character but also feeling the plot was convoluted and relied on a number of tropes. The movie was also noted for a large amount of online backlash and review bombing that didn't have much basis on any solid reasoning. While Captain Marvel isn't my favorite MCU film (I'd probably put it on the same level of OK as the first Thor movie) it's nowhere near the worst especially with competition like Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron considerably less entertaining.Admittedly the movie doesn't make the best impression in the opening act where when we're introduced to Vers and the Kree Empire there's some issues in establishing characters and their identities and it feels like it's written as the audience should be already familiar with the Kree Empire and society when in their one brief appearance in the Guardians of the Galaxy they were only really mentioned in a throwaway exchange to set up the rogue Kree, Ronan the Accuser (who also makes an appearance here). This also leads to a not particularly good action sequence on a planet that's not only at night, but there's also a lot of swirling dust so you can't get that clear of a look at what's going on. Once Vers is captured by the Kree, the movie does find a bit more solid footing and when the movie takes us to Earth circa 1995 where she's teamed up with Nick Fury (who is de-aged, but it's not distracting from what I saw) the movie feels like it's got a much clearer idea of what it wants to do in that it's a quasi-buddy action piece with Larson well complemented against Jackson. The scenes where Larson is trying to put the pieces together and figure out what's going on is well done and there's a strong foundation that keeps you interested along the way. I think however the movie does feel like a phase 1 or phase 2 MCU movie in terms of the villains as despite being played by strong actors, they're simply not that interesting and feel like a step backwards from the relatively strong villains we've had in phase 3 of the MCU.Captain Marvel is not deserving of all that flak it's gotten, and I maintain there are worse entries in the MCU by a wide margin. I think Larson is good as the titular character, but the movie's in need of a villain and story that's up to the level of its heroine. Overall: entertaining, but like Thor I'm not likely to revisit it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's not THAT bad!,"I was debating whether to give this a 5 or a 6, and I kind of want to go with 5, but I'll go with 6 to slightly counter some of the absurd scores here, though I know it's futile. The movie is a little boring for a Marvel movie, and certainly no masterpiece, but what I really don't understand are all the people going on about this being a (too?) feminist movie or whatever. :-/ I'm a guy, and I hate third wave feminism, but unless simply having a female main character with superpowers alone is enough to automatically make a movie a feminist movie (which imo is super dumb, obviously. Some movies have male main characters Some have female ones. Some have both. Like, so what?), then I'm not seeing what makes this movie so feminist. There's maybe like one scene I can think of that has that undertone, and that's it. People are tripping, seriously.Other than that, the story was okay to me, the directing a bit meh, and the acting so-so (Samuel L. Jackson is great as always though). More importantly though, the action felt lackluster, which was my biggest disappointment. The comedy was good though. Far from as good as in some of the other movies, but still.All in all, the movie is kind of meh as far as Marvel superhero movies go, but it's certainly no atrocity as some people seem to want us to think...I'd suggest watching it just to understand how Carol Denvers fits in when Avengers: Endgame comes out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Likeable, dynamic superhero story with feminist panache","Brie Larson fully embodies the protagonist as a Kree warrior in this energetic addition to the MCU film legacy. She and Samuel L. Jackson (as a younger Nick Fury) face the challenging task of warding off an invasion of Earth by the Skrulls, a species adept at blending in with whatever population it seeks to infiltrate and subsume.The film takes place in California in 1995 and therefore has plenty of joyful mementos from that era. Larson brings her trademark onscreen charisma, and Jackson gives one of his most enjoyable performances in years. Ben Mendelsohn shines as the Skrull warrior who has found his way to Earth. Jude Law is quite authoritative as Larson's longtime Kree mentor. The film is at its best when it covers themes of divided loyalties and coming to terms with one's own discoveries, surprisingly well laid out in a popcorn blockbuster movie. The theme of female empowerment is omnipresent but it lingers on less so than other things this film did right.Perhaps because I came in with such low expectations, this turned out to be quite the pleasant surprise. It won't likely go down as an iconic trailblazer or a future classic. But for those who like a big-time superhero blockbuster experience, this one delivers. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very typical Marvel movie.,"Yet it's another Marvel movie.This is just your average Hollywood production with good visuals and engaging stories. Most people would enjoy this movie as solid POPCORN entertainment.Brie Larson's acting in this movie is not the best. Certainly, Brie is a wonderful actress and has done many great performances in many other films. But her portrayal of Captain Marvel is rigid and awkward in this movie. Clearly, they have NOT figured out the exact tone, manner, and persona they want Captain Marvel to have. The character design of Captain Marvel is a failure in this movie. But I'm sure these will get better in future installments just as they did with Thor.Overall it's a solid Marvel production with some typical Marvel flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's not great but not horrible,"Well I always hated the concept but it wasn't as terrible as I'd believed. It's alright, the problem here is one we should've guessed, Brie unfortunately doesn't have the experience needed to completely pull off the character, put alongside Jude Law who is absolutely phenomenal and experienced causes a very obvious rift. He's just more skilled. I'd rather watch his backstory than hers. Sign me up for films based on his character instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as bad as they say,"I have to say that i don't read comic books or anything like that, but i think for me that's a good thing, so when i watch a movie like this i dont know what to expect.I really liked the movie, especially if you keep in mind it's the first movie about Captain Marvel.
I won't deny that there are flaws and i have to admit that i would have loved to know more about Captain Marvel's past, so there is room for improvement, but isn't there always?. But it is NOT a bad movie and it was just fun to wacth. Brie Larson does a good job and i liked her character. I also liked the rest of the cast.There are a lot of bad reviews and even if you dont like the movie, it doesn't make any sense to give it a 1.

Nice movie Hate for brie Larson seems to be the reason for bad reviews,"As it's a super shero movie obviously she will be very powerful I don't see poeple complaining about Spiderman or Batman to be very powerful. Acting was good story was good , Brie Larson did smile in the movie many times .... In last 30 min it did seem a little rush rush but overall good suspense and nice watch .
Given the movie is definitely not as bad as people have made it , it seems clear
1. People see what they want to see , all those who came with very negative image of movie and lead actor saw a very flawed movie
2. They over exaggerated the flaws and even made up flaws like Brie was not smiling or not friendly
3. They even hated the story which was not that bad ...
It has the same flaws as wonder woman but wonder woman is sexy and showing legs and tonned arms ...
In wonder woman she single handedly kinda ends the world war and then there was a weird evil Greek god ... ???? That story made far less sense than captain marvel yet people seemed to like it a lot coz of sexy and beautiful super sheroI am not against any of the movie ... I am glad we are having such super sheros movies .. but it's worth noting that despite we all bragging about how logical we are and feminist we are we end up making up our minds as per what media tells us(hating captain marvel) and loving a more skinly clad shero than a super powerful one",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Below Marvel Standards in terms of entertainment and story; too powerful Main character,"I would also argue that there were also too many changes to Miss marvel's story we all know. Guess I could live with that, as maybe most people could, and I am saying this mostly because Miss Marvel was never a core Marvel character. But still, it is good to see respect to the history of a established character thats been around for over 25 years. Same thing happened to the Skrulls, that now have been portrayed as sort of good guys when we have seen them as anthagonists to Human race ever since they were introduced in the Marvel Universe.But the fact is the movie feels overall below Marvel high bar in terms of fun and story. Also, the heroe is too powerful. It is on a league of its own. Unless they come up with some sort of a kriptonite to balance the odds, in the way she is portrayed she could face all the characters in the MCU together with an arm tied to her back.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Captain Marvel,"I really liked the retrospect and the effects were great. As a superhero, Captain Marvel was rather modest but also interesting, there was no MCU movie with a woman in the main role. However, Brie Larson did well in her role In the movie there were also funny elements where I could laughed well, but that was not so often. Jackson tried to show his funny side of Fury and I think he did it well, he was very different than in the films before.He and Gregg both have been able to give their ""younger selves"" a character which have a deep impact on the chronologically later films / series. The end of the film, I found rather unspectacular as far as Fury and an important animal are concerned, have more The rogue (s) were different than I had hoped and therefore disappointed me. Captain Marvel's costume is well done and the colors look good on her.The music was perfect, as there are both exciting film music and pop / rock music from the 90s, which again underlines the time back then, 1995, and makes you feel more into the time.Actually in the fight scenes fits this music super pure.
The film is perfect for anyone who loves sci-fi, action and Marvel films. Larson symbolizes a strong woman, which is why the film has a positive impact on many people in my opinion. Theoretically, you can watch the film without any prior knowledge on the previous ones Watching movies, apart from the post-credit scene.
I give the film 7 out of 10 points. He was good but not really special. But definitely worth seeing.

One of the worst Marvel movies,"Bad things:Mediocre performance of Brie Larson in this movie, she just cannot succeed on being credible as a superhero. Chris Hemsworth, for example, even if he is not a great actor managed to give personality to its character, he has charisma and fun. You don't feel attachment or real emotion for Carol Denvers. The character has no more depth than a cartoon one. And for people who talk nonsense saying that those who do not like Brie Larson or her character are envious or insecure about a strong female hero, I liked Wonder Woman, it was a much better and emotional performance.Inconsistencies in power/fights and some really ridiculous scene that shows how Fury lost its eye. Plot holes, no depth and emotion, not enough explaining and continuity, in conclusion, lazy writing and bad directing, cartoonish, good for kids of twelve.Explicit, annoying, in you face political correctness. Kind of the one you see in Black Panther.Much overrated by fake reviewers, just as Black Panther was.

Great movie,"I thought the film had a powerful story line, good humour and lots of 90's and Marvel nostalgia. I think a lot of people have become wrapped up in the politics around this movie and are determined to trash it. If you are a marvel fan then you should enjoy this film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A comic-accurate level of origin story.,"Brie Larson is underutilized in a Marvel film that revels in '90s nostalgia but successful to rise to the occasion of its own relevance.Superheroes regularly save the world, but their films are nearly as brave: For every inventive 'Black Panther' that deviates from the billion-dollar template, ten timid time-wasters are produced. 'Captain Marvel,' the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first female-led film, holds a lot of symbolic significance, particularly for young girls who identify with Gal Gadot's bold portrayal of Wonder Woman. But you can't help but wish the watershed moment was accompanied by a more vividly envisioned lead figure. Even within the MCU, there are fiercer, more complex women to be found (Elizabeth Olsen's tortured Scarlet Witch comes to mind), and while 'Room' and 'Short Term 12' star Brie Larson is certainly capable of expressing guilty uncertainty, she's a little stranded in the cosmic matters, playing a role that gives her scant opportunity to be human. It appears to be beneath her role.That's a big deal, because 'Captain Marvel,' co-written by 'Mississippi Grind' directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (plus an army of story writers), tries hard to dazzle you with its originality. That effort is sometimes too obvious, as in the film's absolutely superfluous first 20 minutes, which introduces planet Hala, the Kree, the Supreme Intelligence, the nefarious Skrull (maybe take notes), and, only slightly less mysteriously, Jude Law as a warrior instructor. Our hero (Larson), an alien supersoldier, eventually falls through the roof of a Blockbuster Video into a very James Cameron-like 1995 - they even get the mote-filled Los Angeles haze just right - where S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Nick Fury (a digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson, astounding in every shot) pulls up in his boxy car, reporting for quip duty.But if you don't have a Furlong or a sense of humour, don't play in Cameron's 'T2' fish-out-of-water scenario. Scenes between Fury and Larson's Carol Danvers, who is learning her human origins, are curiously passive, and the film's much-touted feminism, promised in months of build-up advertising and interviews, the movie calls out a important message. What does it imply that Ben Mendelsohn, who is always appealing as a villain-here as a bald, pointy-eared Skrull-ends up playing the most likeable character, providing action heroics, sarcastic quips, and even paternal devotion? Shouldn't Larson have been there? Yes, one of those gleaming power cubes is important to the plot; you already knew that.This movie also introduce the origin of 'Avengers' name by Nick Fury, on the jet by Carol. Simple but quite useful.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Captain Marvel a movie that surprised me.,"Captain Marvel was an incredible film, the expectation I had in it was outweighed by some aspects of the film, beginning with the actress Brie Larson, who played the heroine in a very good way, she managed to convey emotions in moments occurred in the movie both on paper of Captain Marvel as much as of Carol Danvers, the soundtrack used during the film managed to give an emotion to more scenes that matched perfectly with the film, the special effects on the other hand did not please me for a simple reason, in some moments they were used unnecessarily and also not very realistic. Despite my criticisms of the special effects, the movie was very interesting in my opinion since it has passed a rather captivating story and we can see if Captain Marvel can defeat the great villain Thanos.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Solid,"Captain Marvel is a solid entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that showcases the immense talent of Brie Larson. The film follows Carol Danvers, a former Air Force pilot who becomes caught up in the midst of an intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrulls. Throughout the film, Carol struggles to find her true identity as she uncovers secrets about her past and learns to harness her new superhuman abilities.Without a doubt, Brie Larson shines in her portrayal of Carol Danvers. She brings a fierce and confident energy to the role that is both captivating and empowering. The film also delivers some impressive action sequences and special effects that make it a visually pleasing ride.However, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing is uneven in some parts, and the plot can feel a bit convoluted at times.Despite its shortcomings, Captain Marvel is a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With strong performances from its lead cast, and some exciting action sequences, it's definitely worth a watch for Marvel fans.

"Awesome, classic MCU movie with great ties to the comics.","People don't seem to realize that this is a COMIC BOOK movie. Do the people posting bad reviews even read the actual source material these movies are based on?I read TONS of old comics and seeing Kree warriors in their battle armor just like in Fantastic Four Annual #18 was mind-bogglingly awesome. So was seeing live-action Skrulls done right. Brie Larson's acting was perfect; she's been living on an alien planet for 6 years, do you really expect her to act like a normal person? The character development was constant, with lots of little moments throughout showing character interaction. The humor was in classic MCU fashion: plenty of cheap laughs, some subtly funny stuff, but the tone flowed easily from joking back to serious when the plot demanded it. The action scenes are intense, yet predictable enough to feel comfortable. The plot twists that did happen were unexpected for me and my comic-book-loving friends, but we all loved the movie's adaptation of the source material.It goes without saying that the special effects are absolutely phenomenal. Even in a lower-budget MCU film like this, the CGI, compositing, visual effects, Foley, etc. are all there and are way better than the majority of movies coming out today. The de-aging blew my mind, there was only one small scene where it looked 'off,' but overall it was literally perfect.If someone is unironically bashing this film, they're either not a serious comic-book reader, or they've got some kind of weird bias against comic-book movies, Brie Larson, or strong women.

"""Captain Mediocre.""","As a Marvel film, Captain Marvel had potential to outdo its predecessors. As a regular superhero film, Captain Marvel had potential to outdo its premise. Unfortunately, despite carrying many elements of previous Marvel installments, it fails to embody their success due to its questionable ambition. Not only does it fail to carry enough baggage to persuade audiences to care about her ordeals, but also giving more time to tolerate her.The story of Captain Marvel follows protagonist Carol Danvers on her elongated adventure to recover memories while utilizing her vast superhuman strength within an ongoing war. Although she's joined by allies and foes, she's presented as an unstoppable and stoic heroine with behavior that could be considered reckless and unsympathetic.One of the biggest problems with Captain Marvel, unfortunately, is Captain Marvel. Aside from her blatant stoic attitude, which at times are followed by some mildly emotional and disjointed comical outcomes, she's incapable to avoid being merely humdrum. Her attitude in this film is dreadfully humdrum to the extent of not caring about her impending fate. Although she manages to somehow build chemistry with other characters, their personalities feel more alive than Captain Marvel.Carol, as a character, leaves an interesting impression towards audiences. She's seen as a genuine heroine but also a recklessly stoic individual. She's given the strength to overcome her worries, and overpower her foes, but not enough time to appear outmatched. Time is also another unfortunate problem in the story since audiences aren't given enough with characters and subplots. The storytelling featuring certain crucial ideas are merged in sections that either feel rushed, unfinished, not enough, or outright questionable.The universe that Captain Marvel introduces to audiences has ideas that could've been given more depth but was purposely condensed to fit the main narrative. It's all about Captain Marvel's quick flashbacks and toughness but never about vulnerability and giving more context to her origins. This also follows other characters in certain instances but theirs are underutilized and unsatisfying.Captain Marvel is mildly enjoyable with lowered expectations and ignoring any potential setbacks that greatly trembles any storytelling or characterizations. In comparison to other Marvel installments, this gave audiences the least dynamic introduction to a character that feels too abrupt than properly timed. It''s an ambitious installment that fails to entirely exceed its intent.Carol Danvers isn't Captain Marvel yet. For now, she's Captain Mediocre.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as terrible as I remember!,"When I first watched this movie I thought it was terrible. As a massive marvel fan I thought this movie would be amazing, introducing the skrulls, giving more back story to nick fury and having some of the best marvel characters in it to play with. I was massively disappointed. Since then I've rewatched it a few times and now I realise that it really isn't a bad movie. I love the Star Wars style this movie has with its cosmic feel and massive space battles. The first hour of this movie really is one of the best starts to a marvel film, it just goes down hill from there. The end battle isn't really exciting as the villains just aren't as powerful as Captain marvel and it's so obvious who is going to win. The movie is mostly beautiful with the amazing cgi and glorious wide shots, some parts look a little silly and abit off every now and then but most of the time it's a very good looking movie. I love that the villains don't end up being the skrulls as every single marvel fan expected! Even though they will 100% become villains in the future, it was a surprise to see them depicted as the good guys in this movie and was a pretty good twist in the movie. Now onto the main problem I have with this movie, Brie Larson! Her performance is just wooden and boring in this, the support cast just carries this movie so much and her performance just stands out as the worst by far.

What I love about this movie is the fact that there was no love interest, but Carol was still her own hero. The soundtrack was also amazing. The fight scenes were awesome and the songs played during them added an effect that completed the intensity feel of that scene. I did feel, however, that the plot was a bit rushed, but was, overall, a good plot and story. The costume design was also phenomenal and stuck to the style of the 90's. The suits of the alien races were intricate and just beautiful to look at. Carol's character is witty and humorous which provides amusement to the audience. This movie had just the right amount of comedy whereas Thor: Ragnarok was pushing the limits (even though it was a great movie). The story ties into the Marvel Universe nicely and provides history to the MCU. All in all, Captain Marvel was a groundbreaking, revolutionary movie that broke boundaries with a powerful, original female lead hero who takes a stand as an idol for women (and everyone in general) around the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

0/10,"I really hated this movie. I was very sceptic about it when I first heard about Captain Marvel and when I saw the actress....I was like...oh god....Movie sucked.0 out of 10. Too bad they put her in Endgame because she has no value at all.

Solid hit!,"I went in with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised.I don't know if all the negative reviews are from DC Fanboys or Russian bots, but they're wrong.

"Wasn't bad, wasn't great. Just good.","I'll start with the bad and then good.Bad: I just feel like this movie could've been much better. Story was fine and dandy but it just lacked a stand-out moment of Carol Danvers being Captain Marvel. It needed a spark but it never really gave much. It felt like it served more than a promotion to Avengers: Endgame than it being a Captain Marvel stand-alone movie. It's just above or maybe just an average film. Also, I'm kinda agreeing that Brie tended to lack emotion throughout the film.Good: Acting was great. CGI was great as well. The Marvel ""formula"" still pulled off pretty well. It's empowering especially when a portion of the film dedicated to Carol's struggle in being a woman and being in the army. That moment where people tell you that you're not what you're supposed to be but you just ignore the naysayers and continue on what you really want to become makes it empowering.Still a good movie tho. It just lacked a spark. I'd still recommend it especially to those who have been patronizing MCU for a while now.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Would not recommend,"This movie was by no means ""life-changing"" as people have said. It was honestly a lackluster film. The only saving grace were the special effects.

Exactly as same as the trailer-- Boring!,"Well this movie actually didn't prove out to be a surprise as it lived up to its trailers. Bland and emotionless movie.
The screenplay wasn't intact, script could have been better plus Brie Larson completely failed to put life into Captain Marvel.
Just as you avoided Black Panther before infinity war , you can even avoid Captain Marvel and still can comfortably watch endgame. Big time that MCU stops making such underwhelming movies!😑",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't listen to all the hating fanboys out there...,"Okay, well granted I don't have much of an active interest in superhero movies, but I still do watch them whenever I am given the chance. And recently I had the chance to sit down and watch the 2019 ""Captain Marvel"" movie. Needless to say that I had heard all the moaning and groaning online about this movie, which was the same with ""The Last Jedi"", lots of fanboys experience pains in a certain backside location.I enjoyed ""Captain Marvel"". I honestly did, and I can't find any hold in all the grief that this movie has been getting online. I guess it takes very little for a tsunami of hatred to get out of control, all thanks to elitist fanboys. Come on, this is a movie meant to entertain, it is not innovative movement within brain surgery or curing cancer. This is a movie. Plain and simple.The movie had a very simple and straight forward story, making it very easy to follow. So, as with most superhero movies, you just lean back and enjoy the action-packed ride. And yes, this is an action-packed ride.Needless to say that with this being a Marvel movie, the special effects and CGI are top notch, as it has generally been in most previous Marvel superhero movies thus far. The CGI really helps bring the movie to life on the screen with realistic-looking special effects that also look spectacular on the screen.Personally I don't get all the grief that has fallen upon Brie Larson. I enjoyed her performance in ""Captain Marvel"". Again, take into consideration that this is a superhero movie, not a heavy drama with intricate dialogue like ""Good Will Hunting"" or the like. The characters in ""Captain Marvel"" served their purpose and the dialogue was befitting of the characters and their progression throughout the course of the movie.While on the cast, then I must say that it was quite nice to see Jude Law in a movie such as this, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time. And, of course, Samuel L. Jackson, well, he is Samuel L. Jackson, enough said, right? You know what you get with him in a movie. Then there was Goose, the cat. That was just a hilarious and wonderful character, and that character added a wonderful comedy element to the movie, and it fitted into the movie quite well.Personally, I must say that ""Captain Marvel"" was enjoyable to watch, and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire course of the movie. So, don't assume beforehand judgmental assimilations for this movie without having seen it. Who knows, you might just find it to be quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film was good!,"I went in with high expectations, as I always do. This film didn't disappoint, either. The casting is awesome, the special effects - impressive, the story - cool, the fight sequences - could have been better. But that's the only drawback that I could find. This movie is great; no movies of the MCU could be scored below a 6 other than Iron-Man 2 and 3, and the Thor films. Was this film Black Panther level epic? Nowhere near, but the MCU pulled yet another good movie out of their always impressive bag.
Brie Larson is a decent actor, and her big brown eyes and moody look make her so attractive. I think she's gorgeous.
The best thing about this film is Danvers chemistry with a younger Nick Fury, they bounce off eachother so effortlessly. Ben Mendelson was quality, as always. He played the charming, charismatic skrull leader. Loved it.
I don't get what all of the -4 reviews are about; the MCU haven't made sub-par movies since Iron-Man 2 and 3, and Thor 1 and 2. They have perfected their formula since then. I was amped when I left the cinema, this film just felt good. It's a massive feel-good film. It didn't even feel like a showy feminist empowerment movie, it just had a badass, powerful hero who just so happened to be a cute, moody looking girl. And what's the big issue with that anyway. There was no ""agenda"" involved, it was just a feel-good superhero movie about a girl. It's a 6 - 6.5 movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great lessons for humanity's future,"I put big Hollywood movies into two categories: A: Deep State propaganda film with an agenda of social engineering, fear mongering, creating division or rewriting history. B: Alliance military sponsored film promoting constructive lessons on our reality and encouraging humanity to get off its knees and embrace a positive future. Captain Marvel was clearly a type B movie for me.
The movie hit all the right nights for a great story telling experience: likeable characters, good chemistry, believable motivations, nostalgia for the 90's, exciting action and an uplifting sense of purpose. My only complaint was that the movie wasn't longer; more fleshed out flashback scenes would add more depth... I want to see C.M. doing karaoke at the bar and getting hit on by some cocky pilots!
The biggest takeaways for me after I walked out the theater:
1. Loved the message that humans never give up.
2. Black / White / friendly aliens... who cares if we look funny...there's going to be big culture differences, but we can all be friends.
3. Disclosure is coming (if you are paying attention you know that there has been a big coverup of alien life, secret space programs, true Earth history). This film is preparing the public for life in a Cosmic community.
4. There are good and bad ET's. Some are just opportunistic. We do need a strong military presence in space to maintain fair and safe relations with the technological advanced ET community.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Better than some of the reviews had me to believe.,"Two powerful alien raced fight a bloody war, stuck in the middle of it is Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel.I'm still relatively new to Marvel, I'm slowly working my way through, this has been the first of them that I've found a little underwhelming. It's not bad necessarily, but maybe the storyline is just lacking somewhat, it feels messy, a little disoriented.Brie Larson was decent, I quite liked her, the only thing I wish, is that she had a little more humour, I get that she's a super hero, she's just a little lacking in charisma. The same can perhaps be said for Jude Law, don't get me wrong, the pair are both very good, and talk about eye candy, the real quality came from Samuel L Jackson, but when doesn't it.Some of the special effects look good, some don't. I did like the music, it didn't overtake, it worked well.As for the storyline, the friends being enemies, enemies being friends aspect was pretty good, but I said that from the start, it seemed a little too obvious.Loved the cat.It was pretty good, 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Surprisingly good,"I liked it a lot. I generally tend to make my own opinions on movies myself. So all the bashing didn't bother me. Plus I've been reading comics since I was (1990), so I've been a carol danvers fan for a while. Is it the best marvel movie. No. The storyline idea was good. Even the change of a influential comic character I thought was a good fit. But even though the idea was good, it seemed not too well. The actors were all great. Which I think really made the movie. Brie Larson was the perfect choice for this role. Sam Jackson was great also. I think the scrolls and the young girl stole the show though. Its not a feminist or a SJW movie. it would've be ok with me whether it was or wasn't. I think some may be upset that it's not.

Also, Stan Lee's appearance was very emotional, everyone in the theater stood up and start clapping.Enjoy!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fun ride that did not sparkle.,"Honestly, I went into this movie hoping it was going to try to top Black Panther, but what I saw on the screen was a great episode of Agents of SHIELD.It's a good movie, it's not the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's a good movie.The movie starts out so fantastic with their homage to the Man himself, Stan Lee in one awesome opening, but that High note levels out quickly.Brie Larson, as Captain Marvel was not what I was really expecting. I was not expecting her to smile, cause that's not who she is in the comic book. I think I was expecting Captain America cause they both have Captain in their names and because both characters are dedicated shoulders. Either way, this idea really effects what I think of the action which was not clicking well.I did love the chemistry between Captain Marvel and Nick Fury, played once again by Sam Jackson who like Larson played a Fury I'm not fully use to, which make sense because he's playing a young Fury before he even though of the concept of the Avengers. Man, did Sam look good in this movie. I don't think it was all CGI that was taking the age off his body, as I think Jackson has started a vegan lifestyle that took off the pounds. He was lean and mean, but I'm surprise they did not make him look like Jules Winnfield sense the movie takes place in 1994.Captain Marvel's attempts to put us in the 90s were real hit and miss. The jokes about how technically has changed since the 90s were hilarious, but the attempts to be like Guardians of the Galaxy with selective Girl power hits of the period being used as part of the soundtrack did not really do it for me.I did love seeing Coulson in the flicks for the small moments he had.The Skrulls were amazing! I really like the change that they made in who they are that turned out to be very cleaver and very intelligently updated (despite the movie being place in the past), it's a perfect Marvel story arch.Also love Annette Bening in her role. The only thing that fully worked for the pace of the film.Honestly, If women go into this movie and come out wanting to be Captain Marvel than perfect, The film's goal was completed, but I did not come out of this film wanting to be Captain Marvel, a hero whose comic book version I would totally want to be (and unlike Wonder Women two years prior in which I did leave wanting to be The God-like Amazon princess, In fact Captain Marvel makes Wonder Woman look like an even better picture)Nothing particular wrong with the movie and nothing bad about it. It's a solid hit. However it's not epic, not epic at all. Compared to recent entries in the Marvel blockbusters this one just does not take me there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The first female superhero film in the Marvel film series is entertaining, but the heroine herself has few emotions","Captain Marvel is a new superhero film in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and partly written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who have also directed Sugar and It's Kind of a Funny Story.The film is set in the 1990s where a galactic war between two alien races the Kree and the Skrulls is under way. Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is on the side of the Kree. Here she has been trained to the soldier she is now, but knows nothing about her past.
When Carol crashes into battle on Earth, she comes into contact with the young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Carol must convince Fury of what is going on in the universe outside the problems on earth. Then they have to search together for answers to information that could end the galactic war. The shape-changing Skrulls have also landed on the earth. Because of this, Carol and Fury do not know who to trust during their search for answers.This is the 21st film in the Marvel film series, but only the first film where the leading role is played by a female superhero. Because of the lesser script, the first female superhero movie from Marvel is less well presented.
The character himself knows little about her background and as a viewer you miss this information too. You only get some background information in fast flashbacks, but these are not really clear in the movie.
Captain Marvel is also one of the most powerful heroes in the Marvel film series. As a result, there is never a real threat to Captain Marvel and thus not really tension for the viewers. Captain Marvel is also largely emotionless in the film, so as a viewer you do not really get a connection with the character.Because the film is set for most other Marvel films, they also make mistakes, so that the chronological order is no longer completely correct and they actually mess up the timeline of the Marvel films. You also get unnecessary information the meaning of certain things, so these things actually get a weaker meaning in the other Marvel films.The effects in the film look good. The space battles are realistic, but unfortunately many action scenes are filmed somewhat unclearly, so you do not always get along well who is fighting. The best effects in the film are the digital rejuvenating effects that they have used with characters such as those of Samuel L Jackson. Once you are used to his appearance in the film, it seems like you are watching one of his older films. The Make-up effects are also nicely done and help with the realistic transfer of the aliens in the film.Brie Larson trained for nine months for the role and learned about the lives of air force pilots to come across as better as Captain Marvel. It is unfortunate that she comes across as emotionless in the film. The comedy also does not really work with her, because she is not really a comic actress. For example, she compared other actors and actress from other Marvel films somewhat more seriously and sometimes also somewhat stiffly.
Thankfully Samuel L. Jackson knows how to take care of many comical moments in the film. He often knows how to do this together with the cat in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So sad and disappointing,"This movie is by far the worst MCU movie. It almost seem like they they didn't really care about this movie when they were making it. Nothing was interesting about this movie not her past or how she got her powers, not nick fury's accident (if you know what I mean) not ronin, not even where it left off. The movie never had my attention to the point where I thought hey that's pretty cool. Ant man was a way better movie and so was wonder women just in case people think I'm hating cuz she's a women. The expectation was very high for this movie and unfortunately it did not deliver considering it's right before avengers. Maybe timing was a big factor also if they would have done this film as one of the first ones I don't think it would have been that bad. Nonetheless it is definitely not worth watching in the theater it almost seemed like they targeted young girls who are working on their dreams (as an audience) and maybe inspire them not to give up, who knows?

Exceeds Your Expectations,"Filled with complex characters and some good comedy, Captain Marvel comes off as a surprisingly good film amidst all the hate the movie has received by audiences and has certainly exceeded many expectations.
Brie Larson has done a good job as the main lead but the highlight of the movie was the adorable chemistry between the cat Goose and Nick Fury. The Kree-Skrull was good enough to invest your time in it and the plot-twist about the Skrulls is something you won't surely expect.
The writers dragged the movie's first act which was not at all a serious problem. Jude Law's character is quite complex but the problem is that he wasn't given enough screen time which was a huge mistake for you won't even remember the name of a character who had the potential to be as complex as Loki himself.
The Supreme Intelligence of The Krees' offered some character defining moments for Carol Danvers but that's all about the Krees, they weren't explored enough which could be done in the sequel.
Clarke Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson may not have much screen time but a couple of scenes were enough to build the trust Nick Fury has in him in the First Avengers' film or in the Agents Of The Shield T.V. Show.
Overall, the movie was far better than the mediocre Ant-Man movies which mean it is worth a watch.

Captain Meh!,"Hmmmmmmm. Left the theatre not quite sure how to feel. I really thought that the 'ok' trailers were something of a slight of hand, and though I wasn't prepared to be blown away, I've come to have relatively high expectations of Marvel movies. I mean, the last few alone, Thor Ragnorok, Black Panther, Infinity Wars & even Ant Man and the Wasp have been solid cinema experiences. This though left me feeling very ""meh"". Was looking forward to a cool Thursday opening night screening of Captian Marvel but left very underwhelmed.Ok, enough of my experience. In a nutshell:
1) Storyline & script - very clunky trying to do too many things such as an origin story told in flashbacks, set up for a new Kreme & Skrull cinematic direction I believe the MCU will be exploring, ALOT of exposition (Jeez) - more showing, less telling please! A sort of buddy comedy/action set up btw Larson and Jackson's characters which doesn't quite nail the chemistry (although Jackson can now do these parts eyes closed)
2) Acting - Larson is a far better actor than she showed here. I'm not sure if it's down to the direction she was given or the script but she just doesn't sell anything more than a one dimensional character with the occasional nice moments. Maybe she needs to grow into it. Compared to Gadot's Wonder Woman I have to say GG was miles ahead in delivery of performance, even though I rate Larson the far superior thespian. Marvel, sort this out please! Jackson is ever reliable and I dare say he's actually the connecting glue in the MCU, more than Downey Junior's Tony Stark. He's got the Fury character nailed and I can't see anyone else playing him (yes, I'm talking to you Hasselhoff!).
Mendelsohn - dude was so effortlessly charismatic and easily has the best moments in the movie. I'd say he was the stand out with Lashana Lynch (shame this thread didn't get pulled a little more).Oh well, on to Endgame & Shazam!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting,"I thought the most interesting thing about Captain Marvel was their decision to go back in time and create a bit of an origin story for Nick Fury and his inspiration for the Avenger Initiative. The Furken was pretty amusing, too.As always, the Marvel films make the DC films just embarrassing. They're better written, better acted, and have better special effects. Captain Marvel had (ahem) marvelous special effects, and the closing credits are gorgeous.The film brought in some big-time talent with Samuel L.

Below Average,"This movie wasn't terrible, but definitely below average.I'm not blaming Brie completely for this but the scenes with her were almost always awkward and felt forced.

"Lacking character arc, Carol felt too plain","I was looking forward to the movie however, it was extremely disappointing. Yes, it's fun and it can be enjoyable if you can ignore everything else and solely watch JUST the action. But Carol has a lot lacking in her character and it was very hard to relate to her and feel for her. She showed very little emotions, we don't see her cry, and nobody knocks her down - she knocks herself down, and for character development, I feel like this is very bad. She has little to no reactions to when she is remembering her past, or even when she unlocked her true power. I feel like she didn't feel human, and she's not a very good role model for women as a female character, she's not empowering for women and could quite frankly be replaced with a male actor and it would still be the same. Which is okay, I won't say that, that is particularly a horrible thing but I feel like a strong female character should be inspiring for the women in the audience. She feels too dull. There was no character arc. Nothing that happens to her, even the shocking moments of the film, nothing changes her or shapes who she is. It's all too bland. The CGI and special effects are amazing, however, it's hard to ignore the flaws when the flaw IS the main character. I would personally not recommend the movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solidly entertaining.,"Admittedly, it is one of the more forgettable MCU pictures, but it still offers the high quality entertainment value of even the more middle-tier flicks in the franchise, never failing to keep you invested in the story and caring for the characters. The best character work here is the relationship between Carol Danvers and Nick Fury, who's interactions provide some of the film's best moments. Speaking about Nick Fury, the de-aging CGI technology used here on Samuel. L Jackson is phenomenal, to the point where it becomes completely unnoticeable. Marvel have always had success with this in the past, but this is clearly the best example of this technology seen in any film to date. Some of the other CGI, especially in the climactic action sequence, isn't nearly as good, but thankfully it doesn't prove to be too much of an issue as you are invested with the characters while watching. The 'live-action' action sequences aren't as involving as they could have been, mainly due to the poor editing, however they're still entertaining enough in the moment. Although it is an origin story, the overall structure and narrative in general allow it to feel somewhat distinct from stories of that type, which is definitely a positive thing and retracts from the predictability of it all. Overall 'Captain Marvel' is a lot of fun and less predictable than expected, but its sometimes badly edited action and the fact that it is fairly unmemorable mean that it never quite reaches the heights of the best MCU movies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Possibly the most ""ok"" movie I've ever seen","Brie Larson is not an amazing actress throughout this movie and I came away thinking that Carol Danvers was sort of bland as a character.
Sam Jackson was great with what they gave him, but Nick Fury has never been full comic support. That threw me off a little.
The special effects were generally great, but some scenes were very obviously CGI. Most notably, her flying at the end.
The storyline is literally nothing like the old comics and I'd argue that this story is much less enjoyable, but it's still fine.
Some acting was wooden and bad, which was extremely noticeable once the end credits scene rolled and all of the OG avengers stars were onscreen. All of their acting in that 2 minute scene was better than Larson's in any scene in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Solid Addition to the MCU,"""Captain Marvel"" is another solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe series of movies. While I don't think it's a top tier film like ""The Avengers,"" ""Black Panther,"" or ""Captain America: Civil War"" or even a second tier set of films like ""Doctor Strange,"" the Thor series, or ""Ant-Man,"" it is really entertaining and fun with a lot of world building.The film tells a really good story of empowerment, self discovery, and not taking things on face value because there is always more than meets the eyes. The script is filled with great character moments, especially developing Nick Fury and making Captain Marvel a total bad-A. There's a lot of funny lines and snarky remarks that are true to the Marvel formula. My main issue is with how the film handles its plots, they pack a lot in to making the film fit within the MCU that it tends to rush through a lot of interesting storylines that the film sets up. And we get some hollow victories. The stakes also don't feel completely all there because we know the outcome of most of the characters. On the flip side, we do get a lot of great character moments.Speaking of the characters, this movie has a tone of great ones. Sam Jackson as Nick Fury is great as ever and we get more softer moments with him. He's always been a harden soldier and it's great seeing him early in his career, when he was a bit more naive. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is a true standout and a great addition to the plethora of great Marvel Characters. She has some of the best parts of every characters that make up the MCU. She has Iron Man's snark, Cap's leadership, Thor's confidence, Hulk's Strength, and Widow's resourcefulness. So she is a great culmination of the heroes we love, while being her own. Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law are both great as powerful threats and allies.Again, ""Captain Marvel"" isn't a groundbreaking film in the MCU, but it is a film with a lot of entertainment, fun, and world building. It has characters that are great additions to the MCU and the film does a great job of building up towards ""Avengers: Endgame."" It is worth the watch, I give it 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

#Movie Review,"Captain Marvel (2019) is Marvel's first attempt to create a female hero and to also tie some loose ends from past movies. The main quality this movie has is the story and the plot twist.Marvel created a handful of amazing movies, unfortunately Captain Marvel (2019) is NOT one of them.The movie suffers of multiple issues. I don't know if it's the actor or the direction but Brie Larson as Captain Marvel did NOT click with me. I think that she did a fine job but she did NOT leave an impression on me compared to Robert Downey, Jr. Or as Iron Man or Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The moment I saw those guys on screen I just KNEW there is no other human being capable of replacing them.The fighting scenes are average thus they were a bit of a let down... I was expecting more of Marvel since they raised the bar so high with spectacular movies such as Captain America The Winter Soldier.Marvel made the same mistake as in Black Panther. The hero is WAY TOO STRONG. The only real satisfying and memorable wins are the ones you have to fight and struggle for!Conclusion: Captain Marvel (2019) is a decent movie but compared to the rest of the Marvel Movies it lacks the charm, a clear strong message, and also tension making it a lower tier movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Full of action, much less so on story","As an avid Marvel fan waiting several months for the newest MCU movie right before the 'big boss' End Game releases, I was pleased to see Captain Marvel in theaters.Captain Marvel reintroduces us to a couple of familiar faces, being set in the past. But that makes it not being able to build on things already set in stone. Hence the weakest point of the movie being its story. It's a good introduction to our newest heroine, but it was a bit more serious than usual. Meaning that the amount of jokes is quite toned down compared to what we are used (this might please people, for me it was nothing too bad). There are funny moments, but it was all grins and smiles.Now to the action, it's a thrilling ride. From start to the end, we have a lot of explosions and fighting happening that I had a feeling it wasn't gonna stop soon. This movie has a lot of action, nobody will disagree. It gave me some GoTG feelings as well, so if you liked the action in that, you will no doubt like the action in Captain Marvel.My feelings after the movie was perhaps more the feeling that I'm glad Marvel is releasing movies again, which might have affected my score. All the ""feminist"" things are really okay in my opinion. I mean, what else can you expect from a movie that introduces a really strong heroine, there are no jabs or anything which is great. This movie did give me some plotholes to ponder about, and I am a bit dissapointed that there wasn't a lot of follow-up given for End Game.This movie is a solid 7/10!PS: there are 2 end credits, one after cinematic credits and one after the rolldown credits!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ever been to C-53?,"The origin story of Carol Danvers, otherwise known as Captain Marvel.I found this movie quite enjoyable for the humour, spectacle, and character moments.The plot involves the title character's origin which is reasonably good but quite exposition heavy at times. This is told within the context of Kree v Skrull conflict and the origins of the Avengers initiative. It all works fairly well but feels slightly overlong, with certain aspects seemingly a bit rushed to make room for everything. It all adds up to a lot of screen time for what is essentially a popcorn flick.There are plenty of good points. All the character focus on Danvers, Nick Fury, and the Rambeau family works pretty well.Brie Larson looks and acts the part of a great superhero. She makes Danvers a likeable main protagonist and has solid chemistry with the likes of Akira Akbar, Lashana Lynch and Samuel L Jackson.Jackson has one of his biggest roles in an MCU movie and is as entertaining as ever. If you take Marvel too seriously you might be disappointed by the level of humour in this portrayal of Nick Fury, but I enjoyed it.The Kree and Skrull characters are reasonably good and their inclusion builds more worlds within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ben Mendleson and Jude Law are both good in their respective roles.The 1990s cultural and technological references are great fun and for a forty-something like me, this is probably the best aspect of the film. Some of the musical choices are a bit obvious, but if you like a bit of nostalgia it does it fantastically well.As you would imagine, female characters are portrayed strongly and there is an obvious theme of empowerment running through the movie. This feels like it's pitched at the younger female audience members, particularly in the fight sequences, childhood flashbacks, and the scenes that make use of popular music to make them 'cooler'. In this sense I think there is a bit more style than substance, however it had the desired effect on my 6 year old daughter who was suitably blown away by Danvers powers and then said she is her favourite superhero.Visually it is as colourful and impressive as you would expect from Marvel, with creature effects, space battles, alien worlds, and superhero spectacle. The fight scenes in particular are very well done, some using the shapeshifting characters to comical effect.It is quite an important movie to see before Avengers: Endgame and the WandaVision television show due to the characters that are introduced. So I would recommend watching for MCU continuity.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It was just OK..,"For a Marvel movie, Captain Marvel was just average at best. I didn't love it, but didn't hate it either.The writing of this could have been so much better, this seems rushed making the script and directing very poor imo - almost like Marvel didn't have a lot to choose from for script writing or directing.The introduction of such a famous character like Captain Marvel to the big screen should have been something amazing. This didn't happen here and the result is just an average movie at best.I am a fan of Brie Larson but I thought her on screen presence was very bland in the movie. This could be more a result of bad writing then bad acting, as none of the roles where that great as far as acting and delivery. You know you have a problem when the cat Goose is more entertaining then the entire movie cast.Still, seeing as Captain Mar-vell was the first superhero I got introduced to as a kid, it still makes me feel glad it was chosen for the big screen, although a part of me really wishes they had gone the route of the first Mar-vell instead of Carol Danvers. The original Kree warrior Captain Marvel had such a rich history as a rival to Thanos then the female version. I believe seeing as the younger generation is more likely to know Danvers today then us old school fans of the original, this is why Marvel studios didn't go old school on this adaptation.I am hoping Captain Marvel/Brie Larson have a better performance in Avengers: End Game to make up for this movie",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Hardly a game changer, but a promising start.","Before the highly anticipated Thanos and the Infinity Stones storyline comes to its long awaited conclusion in next months Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios transports us back to the 90's for a cosmic origin story centred around Larson's Carol Danvers/Vers, A.K.A Captain Marvel. Amidst an intergalactic feud between the Kree (noble warrior heroes, as described by Vers) and the Skrulls (green-skinned shape-shifting aliens), Vers is sent hurtling towards Earth after barely escaping with her life following a botched stealth mission. Stranded on Earth, she meets Nick Fury (Jackson), who is at first reluctant to believe her intergalactic stories. When the Skrulls arrive on Earth shortly after, morphing into humans to disguise themselves, Fury and Vers team up to stop the imminent alien threat. Following their team up, Vers learns that she may once have had a life on Earth as air force fighter pilot Carol Danvers.Captain Marvel garnered quite a lot of hype leading up to its release, with fans eager to learn how the titular character will eventually integrate with the surviving Avengers in Endgame. Unfortunately, Captain Marvel is hardly the game changer it was hyped to be. Instead, it settles as being a perfectly fine comic book film, and that's all there really is to it. Brie Larson is serviceable enough in the title role, but her performance isn't exactly the most memorable, which is a surprise given her terrific work in the past (just check out 2015's Room, a career best). From a narrative standpoint, the film is a little disjointed and doesn't always engage as well as it should. It takes a while for the film to pick up the pace, and even when it does, it never reaches the wonderous heights of previous MCU films. Directors such as Taika Waititi and James Gunn brought their own unique styles to their MCU instalments, but Boden and Fleck don't establish a style here, resulting in a film with very few memorable moments. As for the action sequences, they're fine, but that's it. There is nothing in Captain Marvel that comes close to the brutal fight between Captain America and Iron Man in Captain America: Civil War (2016) or the bombastically mad clash between Thor and the Hulk in Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Sadly, the final battle is anticlimactic and not at all exciting, and I never once felt as though I was completely engaged with what was going on.Having said that, there are some noteworthy elements to the film. The chemistry between Danvers and Fury is strong and their buddy-cop dynamic that runs through the film is great. The friendship between Danvers and Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) is well written, and the heartfelt Stan Lee tribute at the very beginning of the film is perfection. The digital de-ageing of Samuel L. Jackson is accomplished brilliantly, and the Skrulls also looked great, but were written differently to their comic book counterparts. In saying that, in the context of the film, I felt as though the change worked, even if it sacrifices a major comic book storyline from being adapted in future MCU instalments.Captain Marvel isn't one of the strongest MCU films, but overall, it's a perfectly fine watch. It's definitely flawed, with some storytelling issues that could have been reworked, but the dynamic between Danvers and Fury saves the film from falling completely flat on its face, and there are some chuckle worthy moments in there too. It's a very standard origin story, but there is promise for much greater things to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fairly bland even if it has its moments here and there,"Probably doesn't matter that I watched this film after Endgame, as I doubt knowing that Danvers is not the solution hinted at in the post-credit sequence of Infinity War. Supposedly the most powerful of the characters, and the first major solo character to be a woman, it is surprising that the film doesn't do more or take more risks. That the character continues to disappoint in Endgame is no great surprise now, given how so-so this film is. It has all the budget, stars, effects, and production standards of the wider franchise, but it somehow doesn't come together as a whole - and I'm not entirely sure why.Larson is maybe part of it, as mostly she fails to have any genuine character. The narrative structure I think made it hard for her to do it, as she is never allowed to be human apart from very brief flashbacks. Outside of this she is powerful and in-charge, which just means she is pretty dull due to lacking humour, risk, danger, or edge. Same could be said of the film as a whole, as it feels incredibly 'safe' in what it does. Jackson and a cat are the high points, otherwise it is not a particularly good standalone film, and certainly does little in the context of the series. I was sort of glad I had not seen it between Infinity War and Endgame, as the moment of those was good, and this might have taken the wind out of it a little.It is too expensive and slick to be a bad or weak film, but certainly it is not a good one. Even within the MCU it feels like a hollow affair, offering spectacle and noise, but almost nothing in the way of heart, and little in way of humour and thrills.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Expected Laughs, Ended Up Caught in the Feels","It seems as the Marvel Universe widens, audiences are either given a more grounded story focused narrative (Winter Soldier, Black Panther) or a goofy comedy (Ragnarok, Ant-Man). Is one style better than the other in this series, no. Will people bring down one side only because they prefer the other, of course. Captain Marvel happens to fall on the comedy side of the spectrum as we ready for the anticipated sequel in April. It is by no means a perfect movie but I left surprised by the events and was happy that I decided to watch it in the theaters.The overall story arc saved this movie as the decision to make Captain Marvel a comedy didn't work as well as I hoped. Larson plays the character with a certain toughness that when she had to deliver comedic lines they don't hit and feel bland. Being teamed up with Fury didn't help much either. The two stars did the best they could and they did have a good buddy cop feel but they certainly were not funny...or was the funny part how unfunny they were, I don't know. I do expect Captain Marvel to be better received in the Avengers movie as that tone should fit the character more.I also enjoyed what Marvel did with Carol's arc as a whole. Most importantly with the fact there is no love interest in this movie. I will say Wonder Woman is a better film but they focused too much on her relationship. I preferred this movie in terms of developing the main character. They did a great job at humanizing the character giving her flaws and helping her overcome and lead.The stand outs would have to be Talos and Monica Rambeau. Talos added much needed depth to the film while Rambeau is a great character and I expect to see her in future movies.Overall this is another solid addition to the lineup; it sends a positive message and at times is very sweet.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A typical Marvel movie,"As a source film, despite being a subject often explored in the movies, Captain Marvel does this differently, reporting the development and rise of Carol Danvers through flashbacks and small memory recoveries, making this the motif of the film's development , because by uncovering the truth behind its origin, we follow the story and how the protagonist develops. While the character portrayed by Brie Larson recalls the events that defined his life, the turnaround in the center of Skrull and Kree is used as background and element to develop the universe in which the film takes place, and the other characters present, in addition to the impact that this brings to the protagonist.In technical aspects, as already expected from a film produced by the partnership Marvel and Disney, the visual effects do not disappoint, with a great contrast between the colors and many explosions of the same, making the look very shocking. And just as this may favor some people who yearn for special effects, they do not please a more critical audience, who wants more development in history, than focusing on visual effects (I consider myself part of that audience).Action scenes for amateur-looking people may look very well executed and fun, but for some (and for me) most of them are masked with exaggerated cuts and performed with a certain superficiality. The end of the work does not differ so much from other Marvel films, being extremely predictable, and very cliché, with elements and techniques already used by the company, besides in a certain nucleus, some solutions to the allegories present in the film are not consistent with scenes presented in previous releases of the same.Overall, the movie is average, not weighing much on the negative side, but with some factors that make this movie to many, a disappointment. But I do not consider the worst film ever produced by Marvel, actually does not even come close.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Boring and dull actually want my money back!!,"I heard about the bad reviews before seeing Captain Marvel but figured from all the reviews saying it's people slayting on it cause she's a women (which didn't make sense as this isn't the first movie we've had a women in the lead role and as a superhero eg wonder women,Alita and ghost in a shell to name a few) I went in there with the mind set it may not be great but good enough...well me,my wife and sister all thought the same...this is rubbish!...the whole time I was waiting to get pulled into the story and get excited to see her use her powers and fly but you sort of see her powers straight away(minus the flying and when you do see it it's nothing like a wow! Moment) you find out how she gets her powers near the middle-end) so most of the film Your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like ""oh right ok was that it"" I just felt like it had lots missing to it...I didnt really care much about her..I was never really woried or felt much toward her like I did for wonder women or any of the avengers...I think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not a very good actress...scarlet johanson played her part really well In the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of her!....I was just really disappointed that this is the hero who's supposed to save the day in Endgame...I thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didn't really do much(unless your a juxbox or door) tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you don't need to!...has nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on YouTube and tbh it wasn't all that(if you wondering how fury gets the pager.......*Little Spoiler*********** ******************she gives it to him after he hands it to her earlier in the film but this time she modified it to call her) overall I'd say it reminded me of a Netflix marvel show I'd say it was watchable but nothing more...annoyed at myself for sticking up for it before I saw it and now I actually want my money back!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very overrated character which should have had a better origin movie than this to survive.,"I did not like Captain Marvel from the start so I was already pessimistic when I started watching the movie. In the end, I was right because if this movie was not a movie released by the MCU, it would not have had an IMDB Rating of more than 7, but completely the opposite, it would be a laughing stock. The movie is lazy and forced, it is just not done right, everything feels rushed and empty, she acts way more arrogant and chill at the same time than she should be, the script writting is awful. the dialog is nothing special, the villains are also very forgettable, but in the end, we all knew it was a bad casting choice when we saw Brie Larson and the movie was doomed to be bad, but not to fail, cause it is an MCU movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An entertaining enough film but not Marvels best,"Captain Marvel sits well enough into Marvel's Canon. It is action packed, funny and charming. However it does feel like it's been awkwardly crammed into the Avengers backstory as an afterthought. Much has also been made of the first leading female Marvel character based film (although you could argue Ant Man and the Wasp did that last year) but comparisons to DC's Wonder Woman (an excellent film btw in case you haven't seen it) seem a little muted as that film beat Captain Marvel to the screen by nearly two years.However I digress. Brie Larson is hugely engaging as the title character and while much has been said of the de-aging of Nick Fury, I personally think it looks a bit odd and think the de-aging of agent Coulson is much less jarring. The story might be fairly ordinary by Marvel standards and the cgi scenes vary from very convincing to poor (such as some of the scenes with Goose, the cat) but there is much to enjoy here even though I don't think it quite has the emotional gravitas of The Winter Soldier, Infinity War or Black Panther. Having said that the film has also been given the difficult task of introducing a game changing character late on in the Marvel cycle that will no doubt be key to the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. In this respect it is job done.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Worst MCU movie ever,"Obviously, neither the director nor writers if the script ever read a single comic. This was by far the worst movie and worst cast character in the MCU.

"A witless, artless, joyless, self-aggrandizing piece of schlock.","As an old-school Marvel fan, I am very, very disappointed in CM. And, due to the recent controversy surrounding the picture, my expectations weren't exactly stratospheric. The film looks, sounds and feels offensively bland, with Brie Larson serving as the soul-sucking coup de grace of the entire joyless affair. I'm sure the screenwriters figured a constant retro-pop touch to accompany its nineties setting would be enough to endear the viewer to the film AND Larson's CM, but it actually gets rather grating after a while, particularly due to its slaphazard integration. Being ""Just a Girl"" certainly isn't doing her any favors in this, I can tell you that. Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America 1 and Agent Carter did 'proto-retroism' in Marvel movies/shows very right, with their fine selection of music and moody sci/fi-40's production designs respectively, but it's disappointing how they failed to follow through for our trip to a more recognizable, grounded and less distant past. Died-in-the-wool Art lovers who advocate for the total annihilation of pop cinema now have considerably more legs to stand on. Thanks, Captain.But worse than the overall sterility, however, are the freshman college-level political allegories in the film, with the ""inhibitor"" being the most egregious example of cheap empowerment pandering I have seen in recent years. It's also hilarious how almost every man she comes into contact with is somehow looking to ""keep her down"" or otherwise denigrate her with sexist or misogynist remarks. It all seems so hollow and artificial, as if the writers made a desperate attempt to string together a series of narcissistic wish fulfillment fantasies, but failed to come up with the appropriate connective tissue. At no point does this charade turn into a legitimate story for the audience to get invested in and that is a crying shame. Tiresome, stakes-free action beats and predictably spotty CGI work don't exactly do anything to remedy that.But surely the film has a good sense of humor about itself to offset the balance a bit? Well, no. There are a couple (literal couple, two) mildly entertaining lines here and there, but for the most part it's just the screenwriters pontificating their ideas of fun, without actually, you know, having or being fun. It's a rather tragic sight to behold, watching activist screenwriters trying their hand at something blood-pressure-lowering and failing SUPER hard, due to their life-long wokaine addiction. Everything is in service ofSo yes, the film feels extraordinarily, nipple-rubbingly good about itself and there is a definite core of haughty overbearingness underneath the superficially energetic shell that is being presented to us. Perhaps, in part, because Brie Larson is such a flat-liner of an actress who doesn't appear to know how to imbue her character with the necessary life and humanity of a fictional superhero, so she appears to settle for being a real world hero among her sycophantic fans. Too bad. However, I probably shouldn't blame the film's failure entirely on Larson's buffoonish try-hardery, because the rest of the cast isn't particularly inspiring either. Jackson is somewhat serviceable as fan favorite Nick Fury, but the material he's given is as underwhelming as the rest of the film. That means ZERO chemistry with any other (human) cast member. You don't do that to Sam Jackson. You just don't put him in a situation like that. Ben Mendelsohn, on the other hand, makes an adorable (but utterly fruitless) attempt at covering his own ass by means of scenery chewing, A.K.A ""Old Reliable for forty-something actors"". Yeah, nice one, Ben. I probably would've done the same.Of course, my real question is: why oh why did I even bother with this turgid misfire? When the biggest problems of a prestigious blockbuster film pertain to the star of the show, one can only hope said star's involvement in future endeavors remains limited. I fear that she will be allowed to soil Endgame, although the fact that that movie is being written and directed by far more capable people COULD make a difference.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I am rather confused about the negativity (or maybe not),"Look, I didn't like the first act a lot. The amnesia angle rarely makes for great entertainment in my eyes and this movie is no exception.
I don't think every joke landed, although after reading some quotes, I have the impression that some stuff was lost in translation (I watched it in German). Not every action scene was as good as most others in marvel movies.So, why still eight points. Eight points for me is a rating for a movie that is either plain good without being extraordinary or a good movie, which lesser things are compensated by the good.The latter is th case for me here. I liked Brie after the first few scenes. Her acting is good and the flat acting some complain about is actually motivated by the story and shows her growth or rather rediscovering who she is.
I like the message and the way she overcomes the obstacles.For all those complaining how she is too powerful and was never in danger: did you actually watch the movie? Yes, I the end she is pretty overpowered, which is one reason this character could not join the MCU earlier, but until that point in the story? She gets her ass kicked a few times and is never shown as actually much more powerful than any other character. Only after she uses her full potential could I agree, but that is the climax, so not really different from many movies, especially in this genre, and fitting for this character.All in all this is not a great movie for me, but a good one, an entertaining one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Freaking 10/10! When the hate kills the truth! The movie is just awesome no matter what the haters say.,"This is my first review. I might sound a bit amateurish. Never reviewed any movie before how much ever I liked it. But this time its different. I felt forced to put up a review to support a good movie receiving so much hate just because the lead actress expressed her racist views. You can even call this is less of a review and more of venting my frustration towards the false negative publicity going around today. When has crowd become so overcome with ego and immaturity? Ruining a movie just because of one cast member? What about everyone else who has put their heart and soul in to this project? The director, musicians, VFX team, make-up artists, all those prop makers, light boys and light girls? Would we really want to trash all their hard work just because your insignificant immature ego-self got hurt by one person's views?I have honestly gone in to the theater expecting the worst of the worst.
