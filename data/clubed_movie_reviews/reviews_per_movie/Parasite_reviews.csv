One of the best films of this decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An original dark comedy about class struggles,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new.

"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it","A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I'm baffled by the over the top praise.,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
simple opinion without any spoilers,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the greatest movies ever made!,"Parasite (2019) is a South Korean dark comedy movie written and directed by Bong Joon Ho. This was the first movie I watched from this filmmaker's filmography as it was being praised by every movie reviewer in YouTube and I loved it. After rewatching the movie for this review, I can still say that this movie is still a bonafide cinematic masterpiece.Positives for Parasite (2019):
First off, the movie's premise is very simple and is elevated by the phenomenal writing and directing from Bong Joon Ho. The movie is about a poor family infiltrating the life of a wealthy family and all the shenanigans you would expect to happen in a movie like this does happen in the most hilarious amd absurd ways possible. The acting from the cast is brilliant and everyone is give it their all in the movie. The movie's comedy is some of the best I've seen in any movie in a long time. The movie is extremely well paced with its over 2-hour runtime. There is some dark stuff that happens here in the most ridiculous and absurd ways imaginable. And finally, I loved the ending to this movie as it felt very natural for the story and it was very smart in the way with how it was being executed.Overall, Parasite (2019) is an instant classic of modern cinema, it is my favorite South Korean movie and it is one of my favorite movies in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brilliant,"A brilliant and razor-sharp social critique masterfully disguised as a thriller, this film strikes a perfect balance between dark humor, tension, and drama. With meticulous storytelling and exceptional direction, it draws the audience in from the very first scene and refuses to let go.At its core, the film exposes the harsh realities of class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The narrative unfolds with an almost surgical precision, peeling back the layers of economic disparity, privilege, and survival with an unflinching gaze. Yet, it never loses its entertainment value-thrilling set pieces and unexpected twists keep the tension high, while moments of dark humor offer fleeting relief before plunging you back into unease.What makes the film truly exceptional is its ability to shift tones seamlessly, keeping you on edge and making its social commentary hit even harder. Just when you think you know where it's headed, it veers into unexpected territory, forcing you to rethink everything. The cinematography, performances, and score all work in perfect harmony to create an experience that is as emotionally gripping as it is intellectually stimulating.In a few words, this is a cinematic masterpiece-one that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, challenging you to confront its themes and question the world around you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Totally Unique,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No wonder this gem got almost 10 mins standing ovation at Cannes.,"Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Bong Joon-Ho's most uninspired film to date.,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fine, but Overrated.","This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion.

A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots.,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout.

Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The nuance of classism captured on film,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite (2019),"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"My God People, Really?? Get Your heads out of the sand","After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you in,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Absolute Brilliance,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Incredible.,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Painting Social Criticism With a New Color,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lacks any realistic human dimension,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Funny, messed up, depressing, scary. All of these things describe Parasite.","I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Parasite!!!,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason.

The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue.

A Masterpiece/Work of art.,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.

"Daring, original, but doesn't quite hang together","I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit.

Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank.

Masterpiece,"Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards.

"Ineffably great, hard to classify film focused on class warfare","It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite.

It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.Pity.

Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser.

Extremely absurd without basic logic,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket.",,Anonymous,Comedy

I don't get it,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A difficult film to digest, but a worth reflecting.","Reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me. As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere.However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling.The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out.When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised.Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense.This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it.Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material.From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through. The 2nd half is particularly striking and goes super deep into total madness. That's why you want to go to the theater to watch.I gave Oldboy a very solid 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend you watch it. Parasite is a bit behind, and I think it deserves a solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Half of a great movie,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get.

Parasite teaches an important lesson,"Parasite (2019)10/10 💸""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year.

Parasite (Spoiler Free),"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.
The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I hate to say it but...,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie.

Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.P.

"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.","A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho
SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan
CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin
In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become.

A masterpiece,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite is a very rare film ...,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites?

All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text.

Palme d'or? It's a gem!,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed.

"In any successful black comedy, GREED is GOOD.","My rating: A-plus.
(Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought.",,Anonymous,Comedy

A movie made by a 'far away' country doesn't make it a masterpiece,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family.

Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exceeds every expectation,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Best Korean Film of All Time - Parasite,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.","""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.The movie was good. Lol.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

And that broke the fourth wall for me.The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was wrong ...,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;Best picture:

This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling.

An incredible film which doesn't reduce itself to one genre,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror.

mediocre and forgettable,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simple yet realistic,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.
While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite sucks itself dry.,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite (Spoiler Free),"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.Grade- A+Brody's TAKE 5",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for this tour de force masterpiece!!!!","PARASITE
Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner.
Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo.
The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller.
Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Entertaining and shocking twists,"Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization. Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary.From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience.The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story.Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry.The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty.Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life.In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received, marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Family Affairs,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A sharp social commentary wrapped in thrilling drama,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and thrilling drama. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences.The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy.The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles.Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic.However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone.

First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.,"First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A little fantastical journey that reflects the harsh and unfortunate reality.,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Poverty,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This One is a Game-Changer,"In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Prince and the Pauper ........ I've seen this scenario play out a few times before,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Gisaengchung, the genre-LESS film, a masterpiece","Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists.
Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away.
Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals.
But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.

'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Maddeningly bad film,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion.

It's fine. I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.I had no issue with understanding it.It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.Except he does.As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.The cinematography is simply beautiful.It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like ""City of God"" was for Brazil.","Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people!

Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best of the Decade,"My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time
One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just ok,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Parasite Review,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Suspenseful, but...","Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The cast was brilliant, the story was amazing, and the writer-director at the top of his craft.(The trailer shows a scene where one of the actors speaks in English. Perhaps that was done for a fickle American audience, of which I admit to be a member. But except for 3 or 4 lines in English, the rest is in Korean.

Best Film of the year 👏,"It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core.
Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre
Was I the parasite?

Unconventional and terrific,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fantastic !,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Through a stroke of luck, the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), secures a tutoring job for the wealthy Park family. As the Kims infiltrate the lives of the Parks, their symbiotic relationship takes unexpected turns, leading to a series of gripping and suspenseful events.Bong Joon-ho's direction in ""Parasite"" is masterful, seamlessly blending elements of dark comedy, drama, and thriller to create a unique and immersive cinematic experience. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong's ability to balance humor and suspense while delving into profound social themes is a testament to his storytelling prowess.The performances in ""Parasite"" are exceptional across the board.

This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace.

One Parasite you shouldn't avoid,"SYNOPSIS:
A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.REVIEW:
This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film.
POSITIVES:
As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance.
NEGATIVES:
Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10.
CONCLUSION:
This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood.

Not Oscar worthy. Not even close,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10,5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Both comedy and tragedy, a fierce social satire","This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.

A Darkly Hilarious Dive into Class Struggles,"Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say ""social climbing"". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn.

Innovative but messy and over-the-top,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What's the real grift,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Interesting look into Korean society.,"Like everywhere else, there are the successful and the not-so. In this film, the bottom dwellers (the Kim family) live in a basement suite and do odd jobs. One day, they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family (the Park family).In typical Asian manner, the employers don't check job references or do a criminal background check. Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview. Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships.Naturally, the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs. Park. Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants.Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement. Preferring self-imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground.Eventually, there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them.

A devilishly delicious and twisted tale of class dynamics,"After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it.

"Wonderfully funny, warm, surprising, and beautiful...though not ever astonishing","Parasite (2019)With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking.
I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension.
The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting.
That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place!

The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019.

Deserves every single award of it...,"I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie!

The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well.

Brilliant Dark Satire,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I've never seen a movie more deserving of a 10/10,"Edit:
After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it.
Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry.
After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films.
I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder.
But there are many that I've yet to watch.
What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much.
I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line.
I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.So, regarding Parasite.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT!
Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer.
This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was!
My spoiler-free thoughts:
This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius!
All praise to director Bong!
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural.
When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"".
So, respect to the professionals.
This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Who is the Real Parasite?,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
And again - Overrated,"First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar!

Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Kim family vs Park family, and then...","At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other.
Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's so metaphorical.,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.It comes with a highly recommended from me.(For the graphical version of this review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Masterpiece,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar.
The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo.
Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film.
Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Best Bong Joon Ho Movie So Far?,"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so.

"""Parasite"" Crosses the Line","In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
the line between class,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful","Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is why the rating scale goes all the way to 10,"Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film.
It will certain open many others for others to follow him.A must watch.PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A MUST WATCH,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.
Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.
This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.

Perfection.,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Best Film I Have Ever Seen.,"I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext.

One of the best films of the year as well as Bong Joon Ho's career,"Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A film worth rewatching.,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically.

Masterclass film,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively.

If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong.

"Interesting in Parts, Mostly Boring.","This movie is bolstered in it's ratings by ""piling on"", but in this sense, it is a piling on of unearned praise. This is a mixed, it will examine the good qualities, some of the misnomers of other reviewers, and the bad qualities of this film. In case anyone wonders, this is not my first Bong Joon Ho movie, I watched ""Host"", which Parasite is so far ahead of ""Host"", which was a 5 at best when all things were considered. ""Host"" is also a movie that gets far better reviews than it deserves, it totally squanders its good ideas, and ""Parasite"" does the same.""Parasite"" is expertly made technically, outside of it's script(which is sophomoric at best), ""Parasite"" is not a classic, it isn't groundbreaking, and it is not that good; although it is a mildly interesting film by the end, it cannot make up for the fact that it is boring because it is completely predictable if you have watched even a few films. ""Parasite"" may refine what Ho did with ""Host"" and irons out the kinks, it isn't enough to rise about a 7 when all things are considered. I have watched enough Korean films to know they are quite different from their Western counterparts, and even other countries such as Japan or Hong Kong. Parasite is relatively dull and predictable for the most part, but it does have a cohesive vision and tone that, for your average movie goer, it will set it apart from almost anything they have seen, and for those unfamiliar with Korean cinema, this will seem a lot more unique then it is. I've seen movies similar to this from Korea, it really isn't too unique. If you want to see a truly unique Korean film, see ""Save the Green Planet"", which is about 14yrs.I too watched ""Parasite because of the hype, but I could not stop watching the clock up until the last 20 minutes, other than a minor twist or two, it was totally predictable, and it was highly irritating to see the movie dragged out to over 2hrs, it just wouldn't end Had it been 100 minutes at best, this might actually be a 7.5-8, even with it's unoriginal storyline. Despite it's overly long run-time and predictable script, the direction is Ho is vastly better here than ""Host"", the cinematography is well-done, beautiful music, good acting(those saying the acting is bad are wrong, this is an absurdist film, the acting is supposed to be, well absurd), the lighting and sound are great, so from a technical standpoint, it is great, but it is a very predictable script with too much padding, the script is also largely devoid of any real character development(there is only a little bit towards the end), and is filled with cliches, which some are probably confusing for clever. Better characters would have driven home some of its main points better, and this script is in desperate need of some trimming.In terms of the story, unlike others, I do not feel it is far-fetched what the family did, per say; people get conned every single day While others saw the poor family as being portrayed as dumb and lazy, I saw it differently. What struck me was the father wasn't lazy or stupid, he is the typical hapless and bumbling father that is so prevalent in Asian films. Mostly he appears to have lost the ability to care and was aimless, without purpose; and doesn't actually care about his family, which makes him hard to like. He has a small progression in this film, it just isn't enough. The son, on the other hand, was shown as cunning and selfish from the beginning(in the incident with the pizza company), and once the family saw that he had been able to complete this ruse as a tutor, and they got on board with his plan. The father and son of the poor family, are by the far the most fleshed out characters, but that isn't saying much. While I didn't like the stereotypes on either end either the rich or the poor families, and it does seem to make the rich people the bad guys, which is pretty absurd given they were swindled, and far worse by the end of it. The film, despite other's claims, had nothing meaningful to say about class struggles, it is simply the same rote nonsense that is in most films these days.Unlike some, based on the slow-burn of the events of the film, the violence here felt natural, and it didn't feel out of character for these people; it felt like a natural progression of the script and the feelings these characters have bottled inside. This sudden outburst of violence at the end after a long slow buildup, doesn't feel as shocking as maybe it was supposed to be.Do not come to this looking for traditional comedy, you don't find it here. It is more what would be called a black comedy, or even a dramedy it just isn't in the traditional sense This film is extraordinarily absurdist, however, it doesn't get absurd enough. The closest Western relative I can think of, which really does have extreme and cartoonish violence, is ""War of the Roses"", a movie that does extraordinarily well in making you feel how horrible divorce can be using absurdities. ""Parasite"" also contains elements of a typical thriller, yes, there are some bad things and some violent things in it, but that does not equal a horror movie. It maintains a consistent tone throughout,with the exception of a portion in the middle and the end where it tonally takes some left turns, and these elements actually feel a bit out of place, in a bad way. Fir the most part, it blends the genres together and maintains a consistent tone.On the whole, I don't like this film, even though it is such a leap from ""Host"", which was mostly awful, and wildly tonally all over the place with downright awful pacing. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, sets it's tone from the beginning and it really never changes much, the pace also stays the same, and that is quite a feat. As previously noted, the predictability of the events in the film, minus a few blips here and there, makes it an extremely dull ride unless you've watched very few movies. I cannot fault it's technical achievements, but it is painstakingly dull in others because of its predictability. I would rather go watch ""Save the Green Planet'' again instead of this film, it is a much better example of absurd Korean cinema. With only a few events to really keep you interested it is impossible for me to recommend this, even the twists feel more like cheap tricks than an organic part of the story. Granted, I am not against gimmicks, but this movie is not deserving of 4 or whatever Oscars that it got, nor an 8.6. I can only guess it won due to Tarantino's incessant lobbying, he loves this guy's films.Don't buy into the hype, watch it if you want to, but don't accept the hype, scrutinize it endlessly, it deserves it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Interesting but certainly not spectacular!,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The art of the uncomfortable..,"The art of the uncomfortable..
When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel..
'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy & empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this..
One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'?
One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing..
A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s)..
Between so much more was said in the unsaid and that is the beauty of this cleverly written, acted, directed Korean tragic, haunting, conflicting, comedy classic..

See the potential Oscar-winner before it's spoiled for you!,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Story of two Korean families,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite (2019),"Directed by Bong Joon-ho.

(R)Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.91/100",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Masterpiece in Filmmaking,"Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the decade's most clever and original,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Parasite film review (2019) by Screams and Whispers,"Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks?
Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently.
Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family.
Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband.
One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites?
One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success.
The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off?

Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?,"When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Pleasantly disturbing,"Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious.
It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop...
Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.
The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable-
When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.
You haven't seen a film like this before",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Crime & Class,"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder._________Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How'd this turkey win an Oscar?,"Long before Parasite ended (I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish) I had diagnosed Bong Joon-ho with ADHD. The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story: slapstick, hard-hitting social commentary, mystery, comedy of manners, tear-jerker or thriller.There's a lot of good acting, but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character's situation. It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago, where every production had to cover all the bases: romance, crime, thrilling chases, and lots of hilarious (well, meant meant to be hilarious) comic relief. This wasn't as much fun. At the end, I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale, but I was very happy. I only rented the film.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Every film lover needs to see this at least once or twice,"Director Bong Joon-ho, the wildly innovative foreign director behind ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"" has outdone himself with ""Parasite""- An original and profound look at class warfare that among many things is meticulously crafted, seamlessly blends drama and dark humor with several of the best performances I've seen all year.If you can get past that this isn't spoken in English, fellow film fans will be in for a real treat come awards season (or whenever it comes to streaming, because missing this would be a crime).This may just be favorite movie of the year, depending on after I see ""The Irishman"".

UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN,"Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Best Film in Years.,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A flawless masterpiece.,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Original Work of Art,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.

Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner.

CROSSING THE LINE,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.hipCRANK",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
