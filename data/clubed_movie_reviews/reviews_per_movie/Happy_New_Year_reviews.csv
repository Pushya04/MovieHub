A complete family entertainer,"Indians films are quite similar and familiar.Happy new year is fine for Indian audiences who don't take films completely logically. Somewhat the plot is similar to the Hollywood films Oceans Eleven and Italian Job. Anyhow when it comes to rating, 6 or 7 out of 10 is an average rating. Casting was good and so were the locations of shooting. But nothing was so special about this film. Since its and bank robbery film it is entertaining. As for me this film was fine and some of the overrated scenes were predictable, such as the winning of the dance competition finals. Those who are reading this review it is complete fine for them to watch the film if they are fans of Shah Rukh Khan or like Indian type of common films. Well all the Shah Rukh Khan fans wont be disappointed after the film. Some scenes are very overly acted. The fight scenes broke all the laws of physics but was in a comedy sequence. But as for the robbery part everything was practical enough for me. Anyhow this family entertainer will make a blast at the box office.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
100% entertainer-a Desi Diwali Bash from Farah Khan,"Watched HNY yesterday- And read some of the very sadistic reviews from the critics about the movie too. That is the reason I felt to take time to write down my opinion of the movie. I have noticed that 95% of common people get affected by reviews from influencers. One so and so director liked a review written by any x or y on FB, TADAthat creates an opinion in some 'poor' fellas. I can tell you my honest opinion as I am not biased to anyone not even SRK. India is different from any other country-We have colorful celebrations all throughout the year-so are the Bollywood movies. Most of the Hindi movies make no sense now days- HNY is a Desi Diwali Bash for the people of India -the movie also tries to induce patriotism . First important character in the movie HAPPY NEW YEAR is Atlantis the Palm Dubai Hotel & Resort. The majestic Atlantis is an eye candy which should be enjoyed only on the big screen. Kids would really love their favorite spots for example, Dolphin Bay in Atlantis and the New Year celebrations that happens here. After the interval, I felt, people enjoyed more as I noticed the entire audience in 'Reel Cinemas' (Dubai mall ) burst out laughing .No critic can influence the hearty laugh from unbiased people in the movie hall . SRK didn't show any talent other than his 12 pack body-which too is of course a treat to people of India. :-)The pun intended scenes in the first half, I found as a taunt referring to the inside movie scoops in Bollywood- especially SRK- Salman fights and the petty Bollywood movie scripts-Match fixing trend in India etc. Many non Hindi speakers won't digest the humor as these are region specific-Marathi girl's sentiments ,Desi accents etc- some lines are included just to satisfy SRK fans. As HNY has a sensible plot for robbery- is better than Hrithik Roshan's ""Bang Bang ""- which banged our brain with a pseudo Kohinoor Hira robbery story – I have found the script of most of Hrithik Roshan movies adapted from Antony Horowitz children's books-but Pathetically screen played without giving credits to the English author for the great concepts. These are my opinions not referred from any ""GREAT"" critics so I can only suggest to read the books first before you bang on me to defend .I feel sympathy for other movie directors who has supported the criticisms without watching Happy New Year movie-I am not saying that HNY is a CLASSIC but it is absolutely a 100% entertainer - Before you encourage some crap reviews, you must think of your responsibility towards the society –kindly watch the movie before you show your opinion. I give 6.5/10 for HNY and 5.5/10 for Bang Bang.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A decent watch!,"Firstly, before you watch the movie, expect the worst; that's exactly when you'll enjoy the best.The plot isn't very interesting, but I must say it's new and pleasant. Has some fresh comedy and some great spoofs, quite unusual for Bollywood. It also brings about a sense of patriotism unexpectedly.The First half might be a bit lame, but give it some time.It gives you quite a tour of Dubai, even the Shooting Sets representing Dubai were great; though the set up of India could have been much better and more realistic. Additionally having a great cast suitable for the characters makes it lively.In short - worth a watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
F***ing grow up already,"This movie depicts everything that is wrong with Indian cinema, in fact it overshadows some of the good work done elsewhere. When the likes of Farah Khan are given more spotlight than Hirwana or Mehra, you realize how far behind the general audience is.I wonder why SRK does such movies. Is he that cheap now that he does such pieces of crap for money? then you see Irani in this movie, a brilliant actor and you wonder if Farah Khan touched their feet and begged them to do this movie for her.Plus i think Mr. Bachan just died after watching the younger Bachan, Ashweriya must be thinking after watching this that she was better off marrying a clown. When you can do brilliant movies such as Guru why would you do such a pathetic movie.All in all i will say, anyone who liked this movie probably has a lower IQ than a chimpanzee.SO kindly don't watch this crap and please if you like this movie for heaven's sake get a life and grow up.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst Movie Ever Made,"This is one of the worst movies ever to come out of Bollywood. Just because it made lots of money does not mean that it is a good movie. Most of the money was made due to huge sums of money spent on marketing and shows prior to the release of the movie. Farah Khan and Sajid Khan have the copyrights to make the worst movies in the industry. The story line of this movie is flawed. Why do they always have to characters which are bumbling, drunk, part deaf, have seizures and don't even speak properly. Jackie Shroff (Charan Grover) needed to be robbed, as he was so foolish that he couldn't even recognize Nandu as his son's double. The songs were too many, movie could easily have been cut short by at least 45 minutes. Poor direction and acting. Boman Irani otherwise such a good actor, lost on count of poor script. Vivan Shah was miscast in the movie. I don't think there is negative stars given for any movie, but to this one I give -10 stars. I am so glad did not watch this movie in the theaters.",,Anonymous,Music
"Not Crappy, Will Make You Feel Happy!","Happy New Year is a 'fultoo masala entertainer' that does not pretend to be anything else. The story is essentially about Charlie, played by Shah Rukh Khan and his 'angels' who plan to pull off the worlds biggest heist. But here's a catch - by participating in the world's biggest Dance Competition.What makes the movie tick is Farah Khan and her constant references/ode to Bollywood films. Be it Shah Rukh repeating (albeit with a twist) dialogues of his blockbuster films, or Abhishek's vomit inducing yet rib tickling performance (a dauntless double role), she hits the nail on the head. Deepika Padukone as the Dance Instructor Mohini, whose heart beats for the English speaking Khan is splendid as is her dancing! Boman Irani as a middle aged Parsi chick magnet is funny, Sonu Sood as a slightly deaf bomb specialist lights up the screen with his style of muscular action, and Vivaan Shah as the Hacker shows promise. Jackie Shroff as the master villain and Anupam Kher in an emotional appearance bring in the seriousness that is required.There are a host of special appearances that light up the screen as does the spectacular cinematography. My favorites being Prabhu Deva, Sajid Khan, Anurag Kashyap-Vishal, and the hilarious Kiku Sharda doing a Saroj Khan and the lookalike of Narendra Modi. Malaika Arora Khan, Dino Morea, and Geeta Kapoor playing themselves add to the recall value.That the movie is thankfully not a copy paste and merely references other films, in the process charting its own unpredictable course, is sure to light up your face as it does the screen. This being a dance film, the choreography by Farah and Geeta is actually damn good! Especially the sequences that bring out the terrible dancing of the actors. The heist portions are in comparison slick and stylized, and thankfully explained in minute detail.What transpires is more due to luck than planning, and sometimes highly improbable. But the lack of logic and reason is mostly overshadowed by the antics of the stars who try to utilize the situation to the fullest, and turn it to their advantage! At almost three hours, the movie could have been shorter, the music more melodious (save for 'Manwa Lage' - a soothing ditty and the hilarious 'Nonsense Ki Night'), and the explanations not as repetitive at times. But then no one said this movie was perfect! However what it is indeed, is a perfect entertainer for those seeking to have a good time and their money's worth at the theaters.Recommended for the Manmohan Desai fans who like the zany Farah Khan brand of Bollywood that's more for the masses than the classes. It has stars oozing appeal (read SRK, Deepika, and Abhishek) and can truly turn a dull boring weekend into a fun theater experience.In short - a movie that could have been crappy, but instead manages to make the viewers happy! A must watch for those who like their movies dished Bollywood style and of course for fans of Shah Rukh who with an 8 pack really does reinvent himself physically at this age while doing everything else as only he can.P.S: Viewer discretion required. Be prepared to omit (some scenes) if you don't want to vomit (your popcorn).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't get the negative reviews,"Absolutely loved it. Everything you want in a Bollywood Masala Movie. Romance, comedy, action, fighting, singing, exotic locations, cheesiness, emotion, edge of the seat thrills ... and I am sure there's more I've missed out.The people leaving these 3 and 4 star reviews must be stone cold, unemotional wet fish.

totally coool,"I like this movie cause it's a good entertainer, moreover, it's the movie of SRK. Who doesn't like SRK movies!! His movies makes you think about the relationships in life, about love, a bond between friends, a bond between you and your country, a bond between you and your family. Though it is not completely a message oriented movie, I like it very much because of their acting. Deepika has given her best but her role is less, Abhishek acted well but in a different way which is entirely comedy. Sonu Sud is good, Boman Irani at his best again. At the end, SRK is truly awesome when it comes to senti scenes yaar!!!! Go for it guys!!!!!!!!!!! It is a good entertainer!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is about 6 losers who are trying to loot a bank in Dubai,"I had expected a lot from this movie due to the cast it had and the publicity they did, but I had wasted my money, time and mind when I watched the movie. This movie has awful story. Comedy in the movie is nice. The vfx of the movie were nice, but the story could be made awesome, just due to story I gave the movie just one rating. I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY. I actually had an headache after watching the movie. I don't know where is the old Sharukh who had made hits like Swades, Chak de India etc, where ever he is, I hope he comes back soon.

A Family Entertainer,"SRK and Farah Khan Jodi is back with a bang after so many years. Watched this movie yesterday and found this movie to be a complete family entertainer. The shooting locations and very good and very beautiful. The cast selection is very unique and they are different entirely from each other. Every character played there role to the expectations whereas Booman Irani, Abhishek Bacchan and Sonu Sood did very well in their comedy part. The Movie is all about to be understood and being watched with the purpose of entertainment where people are are posting pathetic reviews with pathetic reasons with no brain. The concept of the movie was very clear from the start. Deepika done really well. 8 packs turned the crowed crazy. Watch it with your family and you all will laugh thats a guarantee.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
AWFUL!! what did i just watch?? (cringe),"What kind of crap does bollywood make these days.. SRK being such a known actor, how does he do such movies..There is no flow to the movie. It's just random collections of scenes and dances put together. Story seems to be written by some baboon. More than the movie itself, I'm worried about Indian people who are actually running to the theatre for this crap. I don't know what they're thinking. Songs are okay as well. Acting is over the top. Entire movie is over the top. Heist is stupid. Comedy is slapstick. Edittors did a very bad job. 3 hours was pain.In short, there was not a single thing that was good in this movie. Please donate your money to some poor chap.One word to describe this movie: ""CRINGE""",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst movie i have ever seen,"Worst Movie.Boring dialogs.THIS Movie is not worth to its price ticket.Nothing new in movie.Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work. I am going with 0.5/10. It's a magnum opus which is pretty much hollow from within and remains an all frills, no thrills show.illogical script mixed with senseless Farah's love towards the incapable Shahrukh coupled with 3 hr duration makes the experience too painful to handle. The actors were terrible except for Abhishek who did surprisingly well.Pathetic Movie with some non-laughable 'forced' action-comedy sequences.I am Regret that I watch this awful film and waste my time you have chance don,t ever go near that film if you have little sense What happen to bollywood they making worse and worse. I think competition in bollywood that who make worse film that they just just forget. AWFUL 3 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Movie was boring,"Not even story, no punches, no acting and none dance except one (manwa laage) rest everything sucked in movie. SRK's eight pack is sure shot graphics and can't be done at all, it is either graphics or some implants. The Jodi of Farah khan and SRK is back but sadly nothing magical came out of it as to from their previous movies like Mai Hu Na. Unnecessary use of dialogues from older movies which were just not necessary. And did'nt understood how these bunch of non-dancers won the final, it was well understood that on humanitarian grounds they were let into finals then how did the emerged as winner at the end. SRK looks just older for the roles he is picking. But for now SEE THE MOVIE ON YOUR OWN RISK!!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Visually stunning HNY is a great Entertainer!!!,"Main Hoona Na and Om Shanti Om (both the films directed by Farah Khan) are considered one of the most entertaining bollywood films. And after Farah's Tees Maar Khan's debacle, she is back with her new outing HAPPY NEW YEAR which was supposed to be made in 2005 but was later shelved! Will it be SRK's another Ra.one or will it be into the lists of the most entertaining films?Charlie(ShahRukh Khan) is planning to rob some diamonds from Charan Grover(Jackie Shroff) for a specific reason(Watch the movie and you will get to know) with help of his 5 friends. But to rob him he has to take part in World Dance Championship! The plot looks so simple and you might be thinking such a simple plot but a very long film? Well apart from the plot the movie has many other things to offer!Farah Khan has directed a heist film without any blood and gore or love making scene, which is in itself an achievement, because family audiences were looking for such a film with GREAT production values for a very long time! I guess last one was...Ah! Very few! And I should say a film doesn't need a kissing scene to make it impressive for the youth because I am 18 and I watch movies with my family! I didn't need to look down for any scene in the film! I didn't hear a single word of disgust from my parent like 'Is that what you surf or watch on Internet'. I applaud Farah for that.Coming to the performances, ShahRukh Khan rocks in the film! His dialogue delivery, especially during the emotional moments is fantastic! Deepika Padukone as Mohini has done a good job as a bar dancer cum dancer teacher cum a WINNER! Yes, a WINNER! Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Abhishek Bachchan all of them are brilliant. Special mention to Vivaan Shah as Rohan, has done a cool job as a hacker but needs a bit grooming though a good talent found.Music by Vishal-Shekhar will grow inside you and grows to max after watching the movie. India-Waale and Manwa-laage already topping the charts, I think Satakli will grow slowly within the people. My pick of the lot is Satakli and Manwa-Laage.Despite usual clichés, HAPPY NEW YEAR excels as a film! With great production values, heart warming moments, good Music, good story, good direction, this is a film Audience(especially families) were looking for and Here it is. Happy New year is a fun watch! Recommended!P. S- I don't care how the story was or whatever. After watching the depressing Haider(A great movie), I really needed a mind refreshing film with wholesome entertainment! And yes I got it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Complete package of romance,comedy and drama!","Once again SRK-Farah duo proved that when they combine,a BLOCKBUSTER is produced. Rightly so! Though the movie may lack the script but the exotic locations and good acting make it a treat to watch. Despite the long duration, you never want to leave the film in between. Abishek Bachchan's comedy is hilarious. SRK's 8-pack abs make the audience go crazy. Deepika is charming in her own way. Be ready for claps and whistles in the hall. Another plus point is the U-rating which suggests its a complete family movie and can be enjoyed by kids too. A complete joy ride this festive season. Happy New Year is set to break all the records at the Box Office.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great family entertainer,It is best family entertainer. And of course presence of Shah Rukh Khan makes it even better and watchable. After long time Farah Khan comes with SRK which is USP of movie.Happy new year may feel you good but in parts.Obviously it is great entertainer but it feels lengthy. Second half of movie is exceptional. It feels like Indian version of Ocean's 13. It also features adorable cameos of Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Dadlani.Happy new year is a movie which bound to make feel good.Exotic locations and music makes it more spectacular.Some casting problems with the film. Movie lacks Farah Khan witty streak.Overall excluding length and dialog it is good.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Stupid Fun Movie,"I was entertained throughout the film. Great acting by SRK, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani, Sonu Sood, and Vivaan Shah. I never really liked Abhishek Bachan that much but he was good as Nandu in this movie. I loved the comedy in this movie and I was laughing for most of it. Jackie Shroff was decent as the villain. The songs were also great. Farah Khan has made another good film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.Happy New Year is a stupid movie full of crude humor, but that doesn't mean it's bad. This is a very fun and enjoyable movie. If you are expecting a film as serious as Talaash, don't watch Happy New Year as you may find the humor terrible. There are scenes where the comedy doesn't work and nothing of interest is happening. And when the movie asks you to take it seriously, you just don't because the rest of the movie is full of jokes. But if you like funny family friendly movies, watch Happy New Year because it is solid entertainment.From A+ to F, Happy New Year gets a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Considering the track record of Farah Khan movies , it is better not to keep any .Sometimes you might get surprised if the movie turns out good.Well, this movie turns out to be damn squib. The plot hardly keeps you engaged. The antics of the cast just irritates you. Abhishek Bachchan is watchable though. Rest of them just bore you.

Horrible,"Happy New Year directed by Farah Khan is utter rubbish in the name of entertainment.Honestly,Humshakals was better than this.HNY doesn't offer anything new in terms of story,comedy or even direction.Farah Khan has taken the audience for granted.Story: Six losers take part in a dance competition.The plot is weak,the dialogs are lame,the performances are over the top and the direction is horrendous.The music is fine.Performances:Shahrukh Khan,Deepika Padukone,Sonu Sood,Boman Irani,the youngster and Jackie Shroff are bad.Abhishek Bachchan who also overacts does well in some portions though and was the saving grace.All in all,HNY is waste of time and effort.One out of ten is what it deserves only for the music and Abhishek Bachchan.Avoid HNY even if it comes on TV",,Anonymous,Music
A SRK-Farah entertainer for family audience,"After Om Shanti Om, Shah Rukh Khan is back with director Farah Khan to entertain audience. And this time also, they are giving the best entertainer film of the year. The story is not new. It's a revenge story from a son Charlie to his dad's enemy Charan Grover. But in between that, world dance championship has been put to add some songs, some action sequences and background plot of the film HNY. Director Farah Khan once again proved that the masala films are actually her part of business to attract masses. I think Main Hoon Na was the first Masala family entertainer. Than OSO has been released. After that she made Tees Mar Khan with Akki, which was a disaster. So, she made her 4th movie with SRK and again she made a complete entertainer. Although the film is 179 minutes long, but, SRK fans don't need to worry because not a single minute is here to bore you, even in the end titles, the casts and crews can make you smile till the end. Dipika looks stunning in Lovely song. Everyone is whistling in that song. She is as usual. Vivan looks cute. Sonu Sood has limited scope but than also he entertains. Boman is also fantastic and funny, too. Abhishek may get the best comedian role award for this year. I liked him so much. Jacki is also suitable to his role. Anupam Kher, Sajid Khan, Maliaka Arora Khan, Dino, Vishal, Anurag Kashyap, Prabhu Deva & Kiku Sharda as Faroj Khan did the cameo roles, which are the funny sides of the movie. I was laughing very loudly in the Prabhu-Kiku cameo scene, I loved that. SRK is a baap of expression. He can use his voice only to show or express the situation. He has given the best. His entry scene is very well captured. Whistlings and shouting may happen in every theater for sure. No doubt in the direction. But I feel, the editing could have been sharp. So the film gets appreciation from the haters of SRK also. But, the length is giving the chance to the haters to drag the film to a flop. But, this is a super-hit movie, a bollywood entertainer which is released after a long time. Music suits the motion of the film. Manwa Laage, Satkali, Indiawaale, Nonsense ki night - all the songs are well sung. Music is given by Vishal-Shekhar. Irshad Kamil proved once again that he is the best lyricist after Gulzar & Javed, who can write soulful songs as well as tapori and dancing songs with such a beautiful lyrics. Indiawale is the example. Dialogues by Mayur Puri are fine, but, the situations are more funnier than the dialogues. Farah and Geeta Kapoor are the choreographer and they did well. On the whole, if you want the Diwali gift, if you are a fan of OmShantiOm & MainHoonNa, if you like masala movies, if you love Dubai, if you like to watch film with whole family - Than go for it. Happy New Year is a complete paisa wasul movie. Fingers cross for 300cr.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

While rest of the character played their role quite well. The movie was full with instant comedy having glances and dialogues from Shahrukh hit movies which made it more beautiful. Movie was too long as comparison to other Hindi movies but time passed as fly. It didn't seem like that i saw it for 2hour 57 min continuously.

Strictly don't watch,"I recently watched Hollywood movies like Intersteller, Gravity and Dawn of the planet of the apes. The movies were awesome. Really, hats off to the special effects team. And I watched bollywood movies like Happy new year, Main tera hero, Humpty Sharma ki dulhania, Happy ending and to name a few. Those were totally bad. Nowadays, bollywood movies are losing their popularity because there is no story at all. There is no creativity, nothing. They are making movies just for time pass. If I have spent 100rs for a movie, then I expect a good story . Happy New Year is a muddled mess which has its own warm moments but as a package fails to work. Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work.

Just the right touch,"If I'm being perfectly honest - I initially agreed to watch this movie mainly for the sake of making my parents happy. Having watched the trailer beforehand, this movie seemed like another Dhoom 3, another make of pure ""entertainment"" value. Might as well go along for the family movie outing and put my brain to sleep. Or so I thought.Much to my surprise, I walked out of the cinema feeling absolutely delighted, as though I'd been taken on the journey with Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan) himself. There's no denying that this is a movie filled with the usual clichés, cheesy music, and somewhat anticipated triumph of good over evil. However, what distinguishes Happy New Year, in my mind, its heart warming execution. In the midst of the colourful songs and dramatic scenes, Farah Khan has created a movie that so innocuously captures the audience's emotions. Happy New Year is a film that subtly touches on the realities of Indian society - the perception we have of call girls who make a living by 'losing their respect' in society; the dismissive stance we take towards the low-class/nerdy/hopeless ""losers""; and the struggle of innocent individuals against the web of corruption and manipulation. All of this beautifully set against the backdrop of a dance competition. The fun-loving, relentlessly aspiring, truly Indian nature of the dance team just leaves you bursting with patriotism for Team India.Without a doubt, Happy New Year is a film that will resonate well with the audience. A well-portrayed story of 6 'losers' who battle fate, and a must-watch for this Diwali season.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A story of robbery.............,"A funny film.Commercial but completely meaningless film. Sort of ""Khichdi"" type film. More over the songs and SRK's fame saved the film. I just liked Boman's Acting. All the crew did their best. But I don't think making a script less film with big crew and cast with 1.5 crore can ever make change in Bollywood. But good come back of the crew. watching as an audience in theater would not be that bad. But the synchronization could be better. A masala khichdi. A spicy non-arranged film just for family fun. But is this 'Bikhra' film based on robbery is perfect as a family film?. The promo said that. However, I can't understand why the fire in SRK's shirt didn't burn him....He is not Johnny Storm right?????

The Biggest Heist Movie Ever: Its going to loot the Indian audience of Money & Intelligence,"What has happened to Bollywood? Directors such as Farah Khan bank on the star power of SRK/Deepika and other stars to earn rs300cr+ at the BO and what they deliver in return is a shitty/crappy/non sense/unfunny movie filled with slapstick humor, gay jokes, mediocre acting, ABS, and no logic whatsoever. I love to watch movie and I am myself a great fan of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Manmohan Desai, their movies may not be completely logical but were entertaining and had emotions. But the joke is current directors are making high budget crappy movies with bland humor mentioning that its an inspiration to iconic directors of the past and making loads of money at the BO.I am sure HNY will be the highest grossing movie ever and Farah Khan will be one of the best director in Bollywood history, but me as an audience is left completely disappointed and cheated.HNY is the best heist movie ever since it is going the rob the Indian audience of their hard earned money in the name of entertainment.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Pathetic,"Even though the trailer was awful, I still went ahead and saw it on the first day thinking ""hey, after all it's Shah Rukh Khan. How disappointing can it be?"" Turns out it was worse than I thought! An absolute rubbish movie with ridiculous accents and age old ""famous"" dialogues of Mr. SRK. In the first 15 minutes I wanted to get up and leave, but thought just like you can't judge a book by it's cover, why should I judge a whole movie based on the beginning of it? After all, I've seen many Hindi movies which start badly. But within a few minutes get interesting. Like I said before, it was horrible. A thoroughly disappointing flick. Abhishek Bachchan is the only one who came remotely close to being funny. Other than him there's no one I can praise, least of all the story writer. Made on a budget of 150 crores, the movie keeps on showing sponsors as the brands keep on displaying. A 3 hour movie, that too a bad one, seemed like I was watching it forever! I had a headache when I left the theatre (Not exaggerating).Bottom line:A total waste of time and money. Give it a miss. You can thank me later.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
6.5 out of 10,"This is a great family film, it really is funny and fun to watch however I felt that the film dragged on for quite long, this could have been avoided by cutting out some parts, I know Hindi films are known for being really long, but this film could have been less than 2.5hrs. Happy New Year is quite similar to the Hollywood film Oceans Eleven, it has a few themes and obviously the main objective of the characters being the same. All the cast in Happy New Year have acted really well, I particularly enjoyed Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Pudkone's acting, and I liked SRK putting in the one liners from his previous films. Jackie Shroff was alright I guess, nothing much to comment on his role. I didn't like the songs in the film, but thats my opinion. I don't think this film deserves more than a 7, there was just something missing. Overall,it's a good film and I would recommend watching it at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Spectacular Treat,"Heist thriller in Hindi cinema? What it would be and how it would be? These questions will be prompted in our minds, when we're about to watch happy new year. Generally, Hindi cinema is not popular for its heist thriller films, however, the trend had started to take off from don 2, another srk film which was released in 2011 (nearly Christmas). Even i was stunned by the choreography of that heist in don 2. After the release of don 2, people have waiting for another heist treat and luckily they got it from the film, happy new year. Even though don 2 excelled in its brilliant heist execution, it's now exceeded by happy new year for its splendid and jaw dropping presentation of heist. Usually in heist movies expecting funny moments, romantic scenes, friendship celebrations, marvelous songs are very rare, or to be more precise those elements are labeled as impossible at all. In happy new year, as an audience we can expect every element and thus can enjoy a good masala film altogether. Honestly, happy new year excels at everything, even in some small scenes. OK lets' have a brief look under this film. Happy new year explains the story of how Charlie and his team try to loot priceless diamond pieces from a highly secured vault, which is only to take revenge from the bad guy. Story sounds too different and too impressive, right? That's the initial notable point in this film. Then songs; wow what a songs and music; hats off to he musical team as well as dance choreography team. I don't want to spoil the film by revealing everything of the characters and their sublime performances, so go and have a real original cinematic experience by watching it in cinemas. People, now a days, tend to watch two or two and half hour films. Perhaps they might be thinking that would be perfect and wouldn't let them boring. But happy new year may not stand up for the expectations of these kind of people. though it takes approximately three hour time length, it has all the ingredients to spice up the seat edginess of audience for that time period, and i assure that no one will get bored throughout the entire film. Guys Happy new year is like a tasteful recipe, which has mixed up with all necessary element needed to fulfill the satisfaction of audience at any cost. Go for it and have a ball. In conclusion i would like to say that, don't miss this jaw dropping and stunning film for any reason.Have fun........My rating - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Unoriginal storyline but pretty damn funny.,"Blatant unacknowledged plagiarism. I don't wish to reveal any spoilers, so i will resist the temptation to provide specific examples.. but in general this movie was practically a compilation of references to other movies. Moreover, it was practically an exact copy of the movies Italian Job and Ocean's 11, with the exception of the dance team element. Had credit been given to these movies which preceded Happy New Year's release, and had it been marketed as so, there would be no issues. It was definitely a slapstick humor kind of movie, but was very entertaining. I'd recommend this movie for ""time pass"" , as long as you haven't seen Italian Job or Ocean's 11, or at least know that its the same story.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly  Fun,"(This is not a fan review,certainly not a typical bollywood fan) Farah Khan and Shahrukh Khan team up again after Om Shanti Om which means you can expect stupid one-liners,fancy dance numbers,and chessy dialogues,etc. BUT HNY is not what it may look.The film is surprising on its content and screenplay.The story is shallow but the characters keep you entertained.The locations are exotic,the songs are OK, acting is mediocre and overall the fun content is convincing. Talking about Srk he is good at what he does but its a shame his acting skills are wasted in movies like these.Most lovable character is Mohini(Padukone),her wittines,her ""ingleash"" and her actingAs a movie HNY is a little more than a typical Bollywood Masala movie and you can surely swipe your card for this one.I give it 7.4/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Healthy family neat-n-clean entertainer,"Good actors make an ordinary film work !After seeing this film you will know the value of established actors like Shahrukh, Abhishek, Boman Irani, Deepika, Jackey dada. If this film were having some unknown/ordinary actors it would have tanked badly.Movie reminds me of DHOOM-1 which was awful but for some sacred reasons worked. I thought about what worked for movies like these and concluded that these movies restrict themselves to the central theme of themovie and never deviate from that. HNY is one such movie.Movie is just like yet another Sholay like theme where a central person creates a team for a task. Numerous films have been made on this theme in India with several variations keeping Sholay's theme intact. In HNY too,our King Khan creates a team for a hiest to take revenge for his father.Locations, sets are big. Movie is colorful. Dubai is shown beautifully. Deepika steals the show in her unusual role. All are OK, but more weight and time is given to Shahrukh and Deepika.And now the negative traits :Characters were not polished at all. If a character is peculiar, then some decent build up must be there to bring more weight. Mere 2 minute verbal background story is not enough to bring out excitement.This one should learn from notable film makers like Manmohan Desai(Amar Akbar Anthony), Late Mukul Anand(Hum), David Dhawan(Aankhen, 1993). These are multi-starrer films and every single character wasintroduced and raised beautifully.To bring out a hair raising heist is not an easy task. Remember Anil-Kapoor in Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja, Jwell Thief ? Farah Khan does every thing right but fails to create an edge.Expecting more polished movie next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Worst , awful, nonsense are not enough to describe this movie.","This movie is so bad, so bad that those who will vote for it are either related to this movie or never went to any school,college,never learned anything or have never seen any good film in their life.Except for few funny scenes this movie is a torture. By torture I mean serious brain torture & I am not joking. Its literally a torture.It is a shame that Indian movies have stooped to such a low level. Even a gutter will be better than this _____(what should I call it I don't know.)This pathetic almost 3 hours of movie contains cheaply borrowed non hilarious item from other movies. Even the name charlie will remind you of The Italian job. I don't know if the self proclaimed director has seen anything better than that movie or thinks Indian audience is that much idiot.The story is no doubt a cliché but could have been presented well. However the makers of this film spend no time in thinking of something creative. The dialogues are very very cheap. The actors had nothing to do, The editing is bad,I will ignore the direction because in bollywood almost anybody can direct a film if they have money. Only the songs were okay.I would recommend to avoid this movie even if you get a chance to see it for free. Because wasting even an hour on this movie is like asking too much for it.This is not a film but an insult to Indian film industry.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"Decent movie but go with ""right"" expectations!","As another Farah Khan/Shah Rukh Khan blockbuster comes out, as usual it tends to polarizes the audiences. But my opinion is that each director has a speciality and after having watched this movie, nothing surprised me. It was exactly what I expected based on Farah Khan's track record and also 'enough' was out in the promos for me to be prepared for as to what exactly I was walking into. A heist story based around a music competition. Shah Rukh Khan leads a bunch of no-hopers into this and how they juggle between the dance competition and the diamond heist forms the crux of the story. As Farah Khan movies usually span out, it moves along the expected lines of funny moments, decent song sequences and over the top finale! The music is good. Obviously ""India Waale"" song is the chartbuster of the movie but my pick would be Deepika's introduction in ""Lovely Ho Gayi"". She has danced admirably and looked million bucks. Acting from everyone is fine. Overall, a decent family entertainer and just exactly the kind of movie Farah Khan makes. So, enjoy and get entertained. And stop whinging about why this movie doesn't stimulate your grey matter (look for other options for that but please don't walk into this movie looking for exactly that). It delivers what it promised! But I must add that perhaps it is time again for Shah Rukh Khan to take some ""risks"" for his future projects.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A BORING 70's kinda movie,"Happy New Year movie was very disappointing.A very lengthy movie which is barely entertaining. Just the introduction of characters happen for more than an hour. The team has misunderstood the phrase ""entertainment movie"" to be a sequence of outdated jokes bridged with dance sequences.Though packed with quality actors, pathetic screenplay has ruined the movie. HNY is a typical evidence of poor screenplay and direction complimented with uninteresting jokes . Even Sharukh's ""signature"" dialogs could not help in the movie's rescue. The movie at one point becomes boring due to its predictability and lack of any degree of creativity.I had taken my family with a hope of Sharukh in the lead role. We did witness few audiences exiting the screens in the middle of the movie. Please do pick the movie-to-watch based on directors and not actors. Or At least wait for the review before you book the tickets.With marketing and international reach of movies like this, I am worried if the international audience would look down on Indian cinemas and build a wrong perception. Hope quality movies like Swades, Lagaan, Lunch Box. with original story and screenplay too has a good reach.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Happy New Year,"The magical combination of a Farah Khan directed potboiler and the king of hearts Shahrukh Khan in a Diwali generates a lot of nostalgia.7years back, this combination gave us the humongous hit 'Om Shanti Om' which also introduced the talented Deepika Padukone on the silver screen. This time, it has got bigger and grander with Happy New Year. A heist plotted in the garb of participation in an international dancing championship, the film assembles the typical Bollywood clichés. With a plethora of self-deprecating humor and self-referencing, Farha employs all stereotypes which is sometimes funny and sometimes tiring.The introductory scene in which our protagonist, Charlie(Shahrukh) decimates a well-built musculature in an unsanctioned fight evokes Deja vu,resonating with the voice-over of the Royal Stag 'Make it Large' endorsement. Within no time, we get to systematically know the Ocean's 5,rather 'Loosers' who must transform themselves into Charlie's angelic dancers since the only route to steal the diamond from the treacherous Dubai-based diamond magnate , Charan Grover(Jackie Shroff) is through the World Dance Championship. Amidst a lot of visual dazzle, you get familiar with the Parsi bumbling safe-breaker, Tammy(Boman Irani), the ex-army man with a defective ear, Jags(Sonu Sood), the cyber-hacker Rohan(Vivaan Shah)and the best of the lot, tapori Nandu Bhide(Abhishek Bachchan)who must team up for the mission. Enter Magic Mohini(Deepika)the bar dancer besotted with English and English- speaking men, who teaches them some killer dance moves without knowing their 'undercover' intentions.The drama unfolds through a routine of countless dance sequences and sometimes the humor seems too feeble to sustain the momentum of the plot.The template is decidedly of a heist, but Farah,being such an ace choreographer,fails to cash-in on the opportunity to make us root for the dances.Things shape for the good post interval when the narrative switches to the scenic Dubai which is ravishingly captured with all its glorious and sprawling sky-crappers.It goes without saying that the writers must have kept the school-going kids in their mind when scripting the heist plan.It's too simplistic and over-explanatory.Equally un-cool are the racist digs at the Koreans who compete with our India-waale or the way this team hacks into the voting results and beats a children's' team.Farah degrades the quality of the jokes with too much of crassness.While Farah Khan focuses on delivering entertainment not compromising on the budget, the movie seems a long drag.But yes,there is a generous dose of laughter which gets more effervescent with the camaraderie projected by the six oddballs,romance which is fueled by the sparks between Charlie and Mohini, melodrama which is stirred by a backstory spawning the revenge and lastly, a climactic dash of patriotism evident in the form of the spirit of dance.Considering her earlier works like the regressive Tees Maar Khan,Happy New Year is a conscious improvement and relies on the enviable ensemble who pump a lot of energy into the proceedings. At the helm of affairs is SRK whose evergreen charm and eight-pack abs do the trick.Deepika looks gorgeous and oozes dollops of sensuality despite going overboard with her emotions and 'engliss'.My heart goes out to Abhisek Bachchan who is delightful in his comic avatar and tickles your funny bone with the goofy Boman Irani.While it appears that the lad Vivaan Shah has a long way to graduate as an actor, it is Sonu Sood who holds on to sanity despite showing off his well-chiseled torso. Cast in a negative role, Jackie Shroff is convincing and adds a suave streak to his persona. Farha also gathers her routine fav-boys for cameo including brother Sajid,Dino Morea, Vishal Dadlani and even Anurag Kashyap.At a long running time of 2 hours and 59 minutes, Happy New Year is meander of a journey - only meant for the SRK-crazy fans and the optimists who feel that Farah Khan sincerely carries the legacy of the Manmohan Desai brand of cinema !",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Even if you waste your money PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"Direction, Camera, Cinema work, ACTING, Script, Look everything was awful. Shah Rukh Khan looked like Deepika's Dad or Uncle and yet want to have on screen romance with her. Very cheap and poor quality humor. Usually Bollywood is a mother load of over acting but this one crosses all limits. With some huge name they are just trying to show people anything. Trust me and SAVE your TIME and MONEY as well. I started watching this but could not tolerate it more than 30 mins. Such a waste of time. Would like to see this investment goes to drain so in future directors/producers don't dare make such poor quality movie.Please Please Please don't waste your time of this movie.Usually I watch Bollywood movies because they are no brainier.

Flawless,"Farah Khan made a flawless movie. Every single bit of this entertainer is perfect. It's an entertainer. Not a deep movie. And it entertains extremely well.1st SRK - Farah directs him wonderfully. There are no cringe worthy moments in this film. She gives us the gratuitous shots of SRK early on and 1 ups herself from the Darr de Disco sequence in Om Shanti Om. And once again it was hysterically funny, provided for character development and was superb eye candy all at the same time. This was a wonderful role for SRK.Abhishek - Farah uses his talents perfectly. And I mean perfectly! Wow! Double role! The guy is a chameleon and completely inhabits every role he plays. Put him in a new costume and he is that new person. He is a superb actor and was wonderful and watching him play off SRK was delightful.Deepika - This is one of the best performances I've seen from her. She is a fabulous actress, but this role required a surprising emotional depth from her and Farah was able to get that and capture that wonderfully.Boman Irani - I love the role she wrote for him. He played it perfectly and, again Farah nailed it both in terms of direction, actor choice and - well everything.Sonu Sood - His job is action star eye candy. He gets type cast a lot. Still - he was wonderful in it. At some point I would like to see him given a meatier role as he is capable of so much more than just being eye candy. But again, hats off to Farah for exploiting the eye candy thing within the movie itself.Jackie Shroff - he's perfect in his role. I love watching him act. He's great.Vivaan Shah - youngest of our crew - I was not familiar with him before. He was good and delivered the performance he was supposed to (he's more of a supporting role and given the high octane actors who was playing with in ensemble, he got a bit lost - but I don't think that's Farah's fault. He had plenty of scenes where he was the scene and he played them extremely well.Choreography. I love Farah's choreography. I love that she got Prabhudeva to do a cameo & the entire gotta dance montage was beautiful! The final dance sequence was amazing and left me wishing I had been rich enough to fly to one of the cities to see these people perform it live on stage during the slam tour. Realized I am going to go to my grave regretting that I didn't.Action sequences - Sonu Sood's early battle is fabulous. I'm curious to know why steam was coming out of only one ear. But this scene took every Hindi battle sequence ever made where our hero is surrounded, and put it up a notch. It was funny, it was cool, it was sexy - I love Farah! How she got the shirt off Sonu was really really funny. I like that she is able to deliver everything we want in a movie with grace, humor and in a way that forwards character development - for the entire ensemble!I can't believe she did used Kung Fu Fighting at one point (the song) but I loved the way she borrowed from the ending of Don (with SRK) for this sequence - especially since she had Boman in an onlooker role for the sequence. It was funny and scary and beautifully shot and the Jackie Chan sequence with the table that the borrowed was again, beautifully done.They say the best artists know who to steal from. Farah does. And with movies, it's not what you steal, it's how you steal it and make it your own. Farah is a MASTER! She is even at the point where she can steal from herself (with the ballroom sequence from Om Shanti Om - which is nothing like that except that she steals the music and the rotation - and has Deepika and SRK in the center of everything).This was a flawless movie. Everything about it was perfect. It was hysterically funny, well made, a fabulous ensemble and I left the movie positively giddy. I haven't felt this way coming out of a movie since I saw Streets of Fire when I was a teen. Well done Farah! Thank you for making this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
MY REVIEW: Happy But Nothing New!!,"Happy New Year. After debacle called Tees Maar Khan, Farah Khan teams up with Shahrukh Khan again and result is similar to their last venture Om Shanti Om. Happy New Year makes you feel happy but there is nothing new or fresh about it.Fortunately movie has a plot to talk about where a team of losers led by Shahrukh himself plan a heist while faking themselves as a dancing group. Movie has its moments because Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone has got a knack for comic timing and their characters make you chuckle. Farah Khan in her usual spoof style film making creates few moments of laugh as well as irritation.Shahrukh Khan is here in his comfort zone but an actor like him should aim much better at this stage of his career. Sonu Sood seems pretty uncomfortable in comic avatar. Boman Irani is competent as usual. Movie is around half an hour extra long. The first hour could have been easily trimmed for more impact.I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Happy New Year. If you don't mind brainless entertainers in the name of cinema, Happy New Year might satisfy you.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Chennai Express and SRK gotta break the stereotype and grow mature,"I won't talk about the story, directions etc but will talk about the cast and their potential and why you should NOT watch the movie. Farah's work I have never appreciated except for Main Hoon Na. She is a good director but needs much more improvement. The movie is rather made to entertain the cheap audience, who don't need a very good joke to laugh at. And Shahrukh should seriously stop romancing actresses who are half his age. C'mon, man! He really needs to know the character inside him. He should start doing some grown ups or supporting mature roles. He is no more a superstar material. Deepika is like OKish in the film. She cannot match the potential of her contemporaries like Katrina or PeeCee, but nice try. Sonu, macho, hunky, did his best and really was good in the film. I didn't understand Vivaan's character so I am not gonna pass any judgement about him. Best performers of the film were Abhishek and Boman, really. They were so effortless and natural that, I guess, the movie worked out only because of these two. So let me put it like this, watch Happy New Year at your own risk. There's nothing new or exciting in the film. But while booking the tickets, just remember one thing that you're simply adding to SRK's bank balance and nothing else. You won't get entertained for sure.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
An Unrehearsed Nonsense. ♦ 29%,"It all depends on what you expect. If rambunctious actors playing horse, wearing 100 different, colorful costumes, enacting a brainless heist is your definition of film, then you will be happy that you watched the film. Otherwise, you are in for a huge disappointment.It was unwise of me to be in the latter category. The film starts with Charlie (Shahrukh Khan), a nobody with an athletic body who is planning for 8 years now, to avenge his father's wrong incarceration by a hot-shot ignoramus (Shroff). Now as stupid as it might seem, he gathers a group of idiots (aka losers) to execute his plan which consists of many parts. The losers can be seen in the posters, but I will care to itemize them:► Tammy (Boman Irani) is the most annoying character in the whole film. With a voice improvisation that will make you wanna punch him in the face till it disfigures, he is an elderly stud who overacts and spoils the already botched attempt at making a film. Irani's worst performance.► Nandu Bhide (Bachchan Jr.) could be termed the most comic character by the audience with whom I watched the film because with every joke (all mindless, naive, and substandard), laughs sputtered as if an original stand-up comedy was being enacted. We aren't expecting much from Bachchan Jr. since after his Guru days, but drooping so low to make his fans to dissolve into laughter? Well, no one can help him. His performance makes his Idea commercials Oscar-worthy.► Rohan (Vivaan Shah) is a child who was only last month discontinued from breastfeed by his mum. With no acting skills at all or at least the ability to maneuver and make do without it (like Bachchan Jr.), he is a misfit here. Hasn't he inherited anything from his father?► Jag (Sonu Sood) is an explosive specialist turned body-builder out of the 2003 American hit film ""The Italian Job."" In fact, the whole film is relative to that film, which I guess Farah Khan didn't know, was brutally remade by Abbas-Mustan as ""Players."" She should've asked our Johnny-boy Bachchan Jr.. Sood is fine.Anyways, talk about performances and there is a competition happening among all the actors to come up with the worst performance. Consider Mohini (Deepika Padukone) who is a bar dancer with life values etched on to her. She cannot speak English and her disability is rampant in the film, helped by Bachchan Jr., which is the main cause of humor. SRK is fine, as well, but expecting more from him was my only mistake. He's grown old, but looks young both physically and mentally.The plot is as unoriginal as it can get. Borrowed from famous heist films, the first half blows. Traction builds up in the second half i.e. in Dubai where the actual heist takes place. The tens of dance performances, one unnecessary fight scene involving SRK, and loads of melodrama makes it a perfect family film by Farah Khan. The final scenes flash a lot of cliché and marks predictability. I have nothing special to say about Jackie Shroff, because he seemed like he played the role with only money (for the portrayal) in his mind.There are lots of junk comedy scenes that you may want to relish, but not a single sequence that evinces an emotion or a style or a film factor. Editing is hopeless and so is the screenplay. One scene involves a dance, while in the subsequent scene SRK is changing his 71st sunglasses. Music (Scott Choplin's The Entertainer used in a wrong context, Carl Douglas's Kung Fu Fighting, again used in wrong context; the fighters hardly use kung fu) and songs are the only thing that made me rate the film a 3, along with the slight effort that was made for the faintly funny dialogs.There are massive plot holes that if I start explaining will be longer than the reel of the film at 3 hours. But who even cares about these holes, when you know that the ship has already sunk. Towards the end, it looked like the makers didn't want it to end, slipping in unwanted parts of the film which may have been edited out previously. And the shindig ends with the typical way how a Farah Khan ends her films: the jokers who helped in making the film show their faces to get further embarrassed.BOTTOM LINE: It all depended on the direction, the torch bearer to bring out the performances in her actors, but after watching this 3- hour nonsense, I believe she was rather sleeping throughout the shoots and let her brother handle the unit. So the stupidity! Watch at your own risk if you are a fan of any of the actors. Otherwise, skipping wouldn't be much harmful other than the fact that all your friends would've possibly seen it, thrice, already.can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Time-pass if you have least expectation from the movie and ofcouse if you don't have anything to do !!,"Happy New Year was a typical bran-less , nonsensical entertainer which could be a time-pass if you have least expectation from the movie and ofcouse if you don't have anything to do.After his father is being duped by a diamond merchant, Charlie avenges the false charges implied on his father by pulling off a diamond heist with help of inexperienced yet brave laggards.Farah Khan does a decent comeback with Happy New Year after giving us the disastrous Tees Maar Khan. HNY starts off with routine song and dance with little melodrama embedded into it. Once Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone enters the scene , movie becomes interesting and hilarious. However , the film loses the steam subsequently and leaves no impact at the later reel. In fact , it becomes unbearable that you wish you could press the forward button . Direction is lame with minute focus on screenplay at all. Sometimes you feel that you are watching some old 90's cinema with typical masala ingredients to make a blockbuster movie. Cinematography is efficient. Action scenes are hilarious and larger than life. Art direction is good.Editing should be done efficiently. Dialogues are just about OK. Performances by the entire starcast is commendable. Sharukh Khan does fine job as the team leader. Boman Irani and Sonu Sood are good. But it is Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone who are the soul of the film and they make it watchable. Music by Vishal Shekhar is good.Happy New year is a movie which has decent story , no direction and simply no screenplay. As I mentioned , it is just a watchable time pass thanks to wonderful performances by the star cast. Above average : 2.75/5",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Horrible movie.,Dreadful movie- I may need to clean my eyes with bleach now that I have seen the movie.I have experienced pain in several forms. I have seen amateur attempts at movie making . I have watched fine art films like Gunda. I appreciate tongue in cheek humor. But this movie is just a bad movie. Period. It is not a movie that one would describe as 'so bad that it is good'. No this is terrible. This is a terrible movie. I did not find it to be humorous - At ALL. I honestly do not know why this movie was made. Notable issues include- The attempt to poke humor at Saroj Khan during one of the dance sequences is terrible. Full of double entendre - vaguely meant to be funny.

"Sort of like ""Ocean's 11"" combined with an Indian dance flick!","If you decide to watch ""Happy New Year"", and I suggest you do, then understand that much of it, particularly in the last half hour, makes little sense. It's one of those films you have to suspend your sense of disbelief and simply accept it for what it is...a goofy musical dramedy.Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan) has an audacious plan to rob a crook of 300 crore (about $8,000,000 USD). It seems that years before, Charan Grover stole millions and set Charlie's father up to take the fall. Now, Charlie wants to ruin Grover....and he proposes to do it through dance!!! Yes, dance! It seems that in Dubai, there's an international dance competition (much like Eurovision) and it's sponsored by the evil Grover. Charlie's plan is to get his gang into the semi-finals so they can break in to Grover's safe to steal millions in diamonds...and leave Grover as the only reasonable suspect. But how can they possibly become India's entry in the competition when they are NOT dancers? Cheat!At times, this film is like a drama, such as ""Ocean's 11"" or ""Mission: Impossible"". But on occasion, the film deliberately breaks the fourth wall in order to make fun of itself...which I think made the film more enjoyable.So why if I enjoyed the movie did I score it a 7 and not higher? Well, the entire final portion of the film is ridiculous....but enjoyable. Folks instantly change into new costumes, diamonds instantly mount themselves to trophies and folks who are simply too far away to be at the dance competition are instantly there...and they haven't even broken a sweat. But none of this spoils the film too much since it is so enjoyable. So my advice is to just turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is...silly fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Leave your brains at home,and watch this Movie","Okay let's face the fact, that these day's the movie's from these so called top actor's really suck and it's not about the movie but how much they make.The fan's of these actors, will do anything to prove you wrong,insult you what not.Now coming to the movie,the story is quite okay... you basically find out the ""main plot - plan"" in the trailer itself.Seeing the trailer, I was like what the hell did I just see, but my friends pulled me to the movie .. and i must say 3 hours well spent. Yes,The movie does lack perfection,it's senseless, fake accents by Deepika.But at the end it does entertain you, I am not overselling the movie, but it's surely not as bad as the reviews here are making it look.Just leave your brains at home, and watch this movie you will enjoy it",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing..,"Happy new year was an excruciating watch, specially in the opening 45 minutes of the film.. Utter nonsense, backed up by pathetic editing..Below average music, manwa lage and satakli were the only two songs to stand out..Deepika was a sight for sore eyes in the second half of the 3-hour movie.. Needless to say, lightened up the movie as she had done countless times in the past..Acting, overall, so-so, there's nothing much to mention, I liked boman's performance very much..There were a few laughs throughout the film, and they were, at times, genuine laughs, which we enjoyed very much.. The plot was okay, extremely predictable, and nothing out of the ordinary..Overall, this is a pure nonsense film, not worth to empty your pocket, specially with the ridiculous ticket prices all over India..",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Awful,"That was worst Sharukh Khan movie ever. I never expected him to get so low with his acting. I am sure that they will make ton of money and break all kinds of records due to Diwali holiday opening and no other big movie to compete against but there is nothing at all special about movie, no originality in music, dance, dialog, action. I have never written movie reviews before but this made me write review. I am big Sharukh khan fan and it took me 24 hours to get out of trauma after watching this movie. I wish he can find movies with good story line and something that can project his true potential. Its been real disappointment for me and am sure lot of other fans feel same way.

"Simply putting in one world,  Enterthrilltaining.","There are two things to be considered: 1. Shah Rukh Khan with beard is the most good looking guy in Bollywood. 2. Happy New Year is one of the most entertaining masala (spicy) movie made in Bollywood. Its the perfect example to show those bad film makers, how a masala movie can actually be made into entertaining, good and quality picture. For god sake, its no brainer movie and filmmaker excepts you to enjoy it while inside the theatre. It has good music, stunning cinematography, decent laugh and beautiful choreography.

The movie is good with its whole graphics thing,it looks too good,too colorful.But the story line is mixed up of ""Ocean 11/12"" and it can't copy that exactly. I recommended that not watch this movie because its a total time waste of 3 hours but if u are a true fan of SRK then go watch it once for ShahRukh Khan.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Slap on the face of viewers,"Your eyes meet. She is on the other side of the room, and holds your gaze for that little bit longer..a few moments extra that heighten the sense of anticipation and hold out a promise of good things to come. You cross over and get closer, excited now to have made the effort, settle down and wait. She reaches out with her eyes full of mischief...and slaps you repeatedly. You laugh nervously, knowing that people are watching and expect you to laugh while becoming increasing unsure about your emotions.Does the display of 6/8 pack abs, irrelevant references to SRK lines from previous movies, crude attempts at comedy compensate for an infantile plot that is not even original?Are glossy production values, a high profile star cast and a big budget enough justification to cobble together a movie?Is it OK to stuff a hungry man with junk food when he needs nutritious food that is available?NO.Does Bollywood still believe it can continue to pull wool over the eyes of its loyal audience and laugh all the way to the bank?YES.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Shahrukh certainly deserves much better projects, directors & concepts matching his current status & simply doesn't need to do such poor, repetitive films.","Unfortunately HAPPY NEW YEAR fails to deliver even a fairly engaging time and remains amongst the weakest film of the actor as well as the director post their entertaining OM SHANTI OM. To give you a fair idea, Shahrukh's CHENNAI EXPRESS still had much more enjoyable moments than HNY featuring a confident charmer Deepika Padukone with her fresh south Indian accent. But sadly, even Deepika is unable to save this pretty long, completely predictable and uninteresting film with her tapori mannerisms.Clearing the speculations being made around its inspired status, HNY has nothing to do with the films with the same title i.e. HAPPY NEW YEAR (1987 - English), HAPPY NEW YEAR aka LA BONNE ANNE'E (1973 - French) or the Spanish heist film LADR'ON QUE ROBA A LADR'ON having few similar characters. In fact this is a poor mix and match of our own several Hindi films since the main revenge plot straight away reminds you of DHOOM 3 and many dialogues make you remember the previous films by the team quite clearly.Beginning with all grand looks of the Dubai hotel, the makers keep stressing on the BODY structure right from the first few minutes itself and then go on giving the introductions for a good long 45 minutes. Looking for something fresh, one desperately starts expecting Deepika to come in fast to offer the much needed relief but such is the (all clichéd) below average script progression of the film that even her decent performance is unable to become the saving grace. The comedy barely works in only a few scenes and the dance competition before the intermission exactly looks like watching any mediocre movie unexpectedly.The long and lazy sequences continue to test your patience in the second half and (once again) the heist is so easily done as if the owners were just waiting for the diamonds to be stolen in advance. Particularly the elements of 'not in use' AC duct & the excessive water involved in the act were just mind blowing throwing away the logic as always. Next the painfully stretched climax trying to pump in some fake patriotism simply falls flat and the film thankfully ends raising a big question in your mind that, ""Why did Shahrukh signed this and didn't they all read the script first before saying Yes?"" and moreover, ""Why everyone including Aamir, Akshay, Hrithik, Salman & now Shahrukh are all desperately doing the same heist films all of a sudden?""Keeping aside the writing which more or less gets revealed from the description above, I would like to mention the direction which questionably doesn't give you even one impressive or memorable scene in the film to be precise. Refusing to learn from the mistakes of the past, this time Farah makes fun of Saroj Khan in a spoof and with Shahrukh (once again) being present in the act, becomes the 'partner in the crime' unarguably. In honest words, I really cannot understand the need and fail to laugh at any such act disrespecting our veterans, whom we have grown up watching in all the past decades.Other than this highly objectionable addition Farha also brings in some surprising cameos featuring Sajid Khan, Prabhudeva, Anurag Kashyap, Vishal and more. But none of them is able to bring in that much desired laughter in the theater. Plus the overuse of a particular suggestive abusive word in the dialogues seems to be really strange as well as sick considering the King Khan's status.And I would humbly like to ask the Censors that ""Does the committee only understands English abusive words, strongly objecting their use in our films and really not familiar with the Hindi abuse suggestively used in HNY? OR ""Do we have different set of rules for small, medium and big budget films featuring the known names?""Musically, the songs are not able to make any kind of long lasting impact on the viewers and the only catchy number ""Main Lovely Ho Gayi Han"" is highly inspired from a Punjabi composition also reminding you of ""Main Yaar Manani Ni"" from DAAG (1973). Coming to the other technical departments, a heist movie is largely dependent upon its Background Score which keeps you glued to the screen when the task is being done without any major dialogues. But HNY doesn't have any pulsating Background score to make you feel the excitement and the camera-work keeps trying hard to fill in the missing element through its different angles along with some fine action. Also the editors are not able to deliver a fast paced, engaging product probably because they had to give each and every actor his due scenes keeping the main focus on Shahrukh.In the performance section, I really haven't got much to write as none of the names come up with anything exceptional other than a few scenes of Deepika, Boman and Abhishek. Despite being there in almost every frame Shahrukh doesn't deliver the Khan magic and I truly missed the actor seen in SWADES and CHAKK DE India. BothSonu Sood & Anupam Kher are wasted just for nothing, Vivaan is only there to fill up the space and Jackie Shroff is the same, as seen before playing a routine act.In all it seems that the film was made just for the sake of friendship since in comparative terms HNY is arguably one of the most disappointing films of the year which misses out the opportunity to encash a talented cast ensemble. Nevertheless its pretty obvious that the film will still make a big killing at the box office due to our own gross ignorance and so huge cinema loving population of the country.However signing off on a positive note, I would like to request Shahrukh to please adapt new concepts, new directors and better films in the coming years, since the actor himself and his fans certainly deserve much better films than HAPPY NEW YEAR.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Too many & too much spoil the New Year,"Big Star cast and big production value do not necessarily give you a GOOD movie; I guess Bollywood directors should realize this""Happy New Year"" is another such opportunity, but somehow falls short in the overall narrationWritten by Farah Khan, Mayur Puri and Althea Kaushal ""Happy New Year"" is your Bollywood take on ""Ocean's Eleven"" with the desi Bollywood tadka of Naach Gaana, Patriotism and over the top comic sequences. The story is of five losers headed by Charlie (Shahrukh Khan) who plan a heist to steal diamonds worth 300 crores , how they implement the plan and whether they are successful in the heist is what the movie is all about.The story concept wise is brilliant but it is the screenplay which is full of loop holes and unnecessary sequences which do not add up to the overall movie experience. The first half drags, as it is solely spent to introduce the characters. The main issue in the narration is the emphasis on the Dance Competition and less screen time is spent in the planning of the heist. Though each character is defined excluding Charlie's well, but later the main characteristics are sidelined like Jag (Sonu Sood) is supposed to be deaf by one ear but this is conveniently over looked in many sequences, such is the case with other characters as well. The chemistry between Charlie and Mohini (Deepika Padukone) is missing completely. The climax looks too convenient and a bit stretched. Another issue is the 179 mins of screen time which is way too long and it could have been 30 mins short.The dialogues are more of a spoof of previous Shahrukh Khan Movies, and there is nothing original.The dialect of both Mohini and Nandu are inconsistent. Excluding a few sequences the comic sequences falls flat and is hardly humorous.Shahrukh Khan performs earnestly even in silly sequences, but definitely it is not his best. Abhishek Bachchan as Nandu Bhide unfortunately is a badly written character which is more of a clown without much to do. Sonu Sood as Jag is good in showing his abs but unfortunately the same could not be said for his performance. Boman Irani repeats his quintessential Parsi act as Tammy, I feel he is being repetitive and should re-invent himself. Deepika Padukone as Mohini unfortunately has nothing much to do but she is good and lights up the screen. Vivaan Shah as the hacker Rohan shows promise but his character is too one dimensional for any histrionics. Jackie Shroff as the antagonist Charan Grover looks too haggard to be a suave businessman and his act does not impress too much. Rest of the cast is also average.Cinematography by Manush Nandan is full of glitter and gives a glamorous look. Farah Khan and Geeta Kapoor's choreography is pleasing especially ""Manwa Laage"" and ""Main Lovely"".Farah Khan had an excellent cast and a huge production house backing her and off course a superstar like Shahrukh Khan, but she completely wasted this opportunity with a mediocre script and a narration which is full of loopholes. I think Farah should have concentrated more on originality rather than on spoof of other Bollywood movies.The movie is neither very bad neither very good, and has nothing new to offer, in a nutshell a very average attempt.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Job HNY Team,"Happy New Year exists for one purpose — to entertain. And Farah Khan, inheritor of the Manmohan Desai mantle, has proved that she is more than capable of giving us a good time. But in Happy New Year, the desire to entertain overshadows everything else — script, characters, coherence, narrative logic. The result is a 179-minute film that simply beats you into submission. It is frantic, noisy, gaudy and, largely, joyless. Farah takes the framework of the traditional heist movie and bungs in revenge, melodrama, comedy, romance, countless dazzling dance sequences and, as a climactic flourish, a dose of patriotism.You should watch this movie at least once.

When SRK is there, how can there be no charm. Deepika as the sexy and seductive yet innocent Mohini, definitely makes men go gaga over her. She has that charm to make her desirable yet admirable at the same time. Being at an age close to fifty, SRK proves tat his magical charms have yet not faded, the results of which are shown in the box office collections of the movie. Weak script, no plot and a worst movie by Farah Khan, is saved due to the presence of the mega star SRK. He once again proves that any movie will work and earn huge, when he is present in it.

Premature Happy New Year wish,"The major drawback of this film is its length. 3 Hours is too much when you don't have any super brilliant script. This type of product comes when Director is over obsessed with product. There were lots of scopes to trim it but they didn't prefer. When, You have to glorify the star rather than the character such type of things happen. Comedy punches are OK types. Story is old. Screenplay is routine. Dialogues by Mayur Puri, are good at places. You frequently get derailed that what is the main plot of this movie. How they culminated the climax, that is too kiddies. If you want to make a brainless comedy then how can you choose a heist as a main plot? It should be sensible but this is the least thing in this movie. There were lots of questions which are unanswered, like If one buy a security system from someone else then why should he keep the same password, which is one of main struggle in climax. Is it too difficult to distinguish the difference between real brick wall and a replica, for a Police!!? How can you call the son of a business tycoon via landline or intercom? There is only one answer to all question that they has taken the audience for granted. Performance wise Shah Rukh Khan is fine. Deepika Padukone is exceptionally good and stands out among all actors. Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachchan are good. Music by Vishal Shekhar is OK type. ""Manwa Lage"" is melodious.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Come on, sexism out","Last year, Deepika Padukone made a fuss because an Indian newspaper had published an article that mentioned her clothing. She said that women shouldn't be judged by the clothes they're wearing, the newspaper said that they had photos of her wearing even less clothing, and to that Deepika replied that those were photos she had agreed to be taken, and that one thing was her characters and another her as a person. So why am I bringing this up right now? I love Deepika, I love her feminist attitude and the feminist roles she plays. But the, we have Mohini. What is the most disappointing to me about Happy New Year it's not the terrible script or the lack of acting, but Mohini's character. Deepika Padukone, one of the most famous Indian actresses right now has a change to be a role model, to let little girls admire her, and she chooses a character like Mohini, who is portrayed like an English-phile, who only wants someone to love her. Come on India, it's 2015, just grow up! It's great that Deepika denounced sexist acts such as what that newspaper did, but she should carry that to screen too, where she could make the most impact. Women like Mohini shouldn't be portrayed on film anymore because she's not a person, she's basically a live cardboard. Women are complex and wild, some are love crazed, some only want to study. It's time that we start seeing real women on screen, and I thought this was Deepika's goal too.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

In Bloopers every one was there ... Its really good thing.(Only for Abishek)- 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Sheer waste of time,"This movie is only waste of time. The senior guy Shahrukh should now act as a grand grand parent than the main hero. His age is clearly visible in his dance moves and close-ups. Compared to Tees Maar kha, this is Farah khan's new record of doing worst movies. Her capability is beyond the cast and crew. I believe to show shahrukh better, farah has purposely asked other crew to under perform. That has reduced the overall entertain value. Rather i will say there is no entertain value of this movie. The acting of boman irani is surprisingly low. And the acting of abhishek bacchan is better. As i said this must be the direction gimmick to show aged shahrukh better. for die hard fan of shahrukh khan this may be another way to waste money. i will suggest to give that money to some orphanage rather then promoting such movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
You need to expireance Happy New Year yourself..I bet you'll regret if u don't.. Honestly I can't put it into words.. SHAH RUKH KHAN just smashed it..,"‪#‎HappyNewYear‬ Review - Finally after continuous anxiety and wait of almost 3 months it has arrived! ‪#‎HNYDay‬ is here!! And it has arrived and how? It was always expected to be big but how big was the question. And team HNY has answered that question in their own style. To put it simply it is EASILY year's best film. Miles ahead of last year BB yes even CE. In fact I will go out the limb and say it is EASILY SRK's best since OSO!! Why? Well here is why:- 1. Unbelievable canvas! Film looks expensive in each n every frame. 2. Unbelievable chemistry b/w all star cast! 3. Amazing humor! Ah we so missed the good family comedy timings! 4. Action was of highest standard that you can see in an Bollywood Masala film. 5. Farah Khan is back in her elements. 6.Abhishek, Sonu Sood did commendable job. 7. Vivaan and Boman were both very efficient. 8. Deepika Padukone has again shown why is the most powerful lead actress going around! 9. And last but not the least Shah Rukh Khan! He is in unbelievable form! Looking like million bucks in each n every frame, impeccable comic timing, in ROCKING action avatar! He has carried the film on his shoulder and will take it to the BO glory as well!! PS:- Watch out for the super cutest AbRam Khan playing with his father for 30 secs and it will be worth your all ticket price Also any glimpse of Mrs Khan is worthy enough well here she has shown some of her never seen before moves as well!! And in the film they end up stealing Diamond worth 300m$ it looks well set to collect 300 crores in India alone Now as for stars do I really need to give it? See you in theaters fellas for I will be seeing it for at least 20 times more",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Only for time-pass and that too when you don't get any other film to watch,"I went to the cinema to watch this film with our family friend, hoping it to be a good film as Om Shanti Om (also directed by Farah Khan), but the film turned out be heavily flawed. The same story that is common in Bollywood is repeated, so don't expect any new thing in this film.All the songs are bad and forgettable except for 'Lovely'. The lyrics are senseless.But why I gave this film 5 out of 10 stars is mostly because of its entertainment value in the first half and its technical brilliance. The film manages to entertain you for the first half but with old sense of humor. So it can be kept as a third option if you don't have any other movie. The cinematography was splendid and colorful as most of the films nowadays have dull and dark approach. Moreover, the editing was also one of the finest I have seen. Many sequences were quite good and smooth rather than highly flawed shaky, blink and miss shots.What also saves the film from being a total disaster is its use of characters. Each and every main character has an equal and significant role throughout the film which makes them a bit memorable.So overall, it is an only average film and that too because of the bad story and script. The story is the main component of the film and if the story is senseless, then all other aspects of the film are wasted, and this very film is a good example of it.Farah Khan wasted her money on this project and she could have made a movie 100 times better than this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
happy new year,"Honestly after watching this movie, one thing that struck my mind was - Since when Bollywood audience have become so dumb/stupid/senseless that they really want to watch any kind of crap these stupid film makers throw at them.Illogical script mixed with senseless Farah's love towards the incapable Shahrukh coupled with 3 hr duration makes the experience too painful to handle. The actors were terrible except for Abhishek who did surprisingly well.All in all, not worth watching at all and I really feel bad for Bollywood audience who made this movie a success which only result in many more crappier movies like these. God Save Bollywood! I HAVE NOW STARTED FINDING BETTER MOVIES THROUGH WWW.FLICKSTREE.COM. IT NOT ONLY SUGGESTS GREAT MOVIES TO WATCH,IT ALSO TELLS WHERE TO WATCH IT ONLINE.

Average attempt,"Happy new year is not a new type of cinema,it is the usual masala bollywood flick which is loosely inspired by OCEAN'S ELEVEN.The story is very simple as Charlie want revenge from a diamond dealer who cheated his father and sent him to jail.In order to get the revenge,he steals 9 precious diamonds from the businessman.Acting of everyone is good except vivan.Songs are good and feels nice while hearing.The main problem of the movie is it paperthin and predictable plot.The film is also too long.It could have been trimmed by 20 minutes.Overall i am not very much happy with this film.I am a big fan of shahrukh khan and i expected more.His previous film CE was much better than this one.Overall a timepass flick...",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A terrible horrible very bad movie,When I saw the first part of the movie(because I couldn't compete it) I said: come on SRK why such a very bad movie at least make it like Chennai express .Please guys don't waste your time in a movie with soundtrack effects like boom! OUF! and vapor from one ear with two old actors show their ab dos .And Depica in hot clothes Even the songs are bad except ManwaliOne of the worst movies I'd ever seen And Srk please try good plots What the hell is this story plus Dilwale tooDo a favor Don't try to watch it Don't try to watch it Don't try to watch it,1.0,Anonymous,Music
Poor taste and guilty pleasure,"My first reaction to this film was ""too much"". Too long, too loud, too flickering, too many cheap jokes and too much India pride (I am not Indian). On the other hand I must honestly admit that, when watching in a company, I laughed wholeheartedly many times and had fun. This film is a complete brainless entertainer and nothing more, but with good performances of acknowledged actors losing some dignity in silly (sometimes disgusting) jokes. So generally a professionally executed comedy in poor taste. There are some references to other Bollywood films, which I am able only partly to catch.The story: group of losers plans to steal diamonds from a safe in a Dubai hotel. It is a revenge to punish a villain who earlier framed the group's leader innocent father, who was in a turn unjustly imprisoned. In order to cover their burglary they, complete amateurs, intend to take part in a world dance competition as Team India.Team India members Abhishek Bachchan (in double role also as the villain's son), Boman Irani and Sonu Sood play expertly whatever (little, stupid, funny) they were given to play. Shah Rukh Khan's performance is also good. He as Charlie, the brain of the operation, is the only male character in Team India who maintains dignity. The film provokes me, however, to ask if isn't it too easy to stand out when your co-stars play halfwits. Deepika Padukone as Mohini, a night-club dancer and the team's dance teacher, is really good. Unsophisticated but good-hearted, infatuated with Charlie and his English, her Mohini fights for respect and does not want to lose it.There are some moments to remember like initial dancing lessons, scenes in an hotel elevator, efforts to unscrew a wall cover (cheap but funny gag) or closing credits with worst dance competition among film production departments (usual Farah Khan's trademark). I also managed to learn how is nine in Hindi. And I like flying sparks every time Mohini touches Charlie.There are also irritating or nonsensical issues. Multiple repetition of the plan. A glass of water with ice through airport security?! - Really, is there nowadays anyone who doesn't know how it works? How so little dance can make a number in a world dance competition final?Surprisingly the music is the film's weakness. The only song that remained with me is ""Manwa Laage"". ""India Waale"" is a good film number but nothing to listen to on its own.So generally this film is a guilty pleasure, which I should despise in the first place, rather than partly enjoy it. Good for watching in a company to multiply its ridiculous effect. For me it is a weaker work from the director Farah Khan in comparison to ""Main Hoon Na"" or ""Om Shanti Om"". Vomiting jokes are unbearable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Disaster from SRK (and Team),"As expected from the Deadly combo of SRK and Farah Khan, nothing but a deadly (Read disastrous)movie. Some gully chap actors, start learning dancing and end up winning the - World Dancing Championship within months of time. Useless Crappy masala. Dancers- Boman Irani and Sonu Sood - Really, Are u kidding me. Why would SRK even do such a movie. Isn't he capable to drowning the producers money on his own . Same old Fathers death revenge story told in a new boring flavor, with a typical bollywood style dancing and singing. Please save your useful time and money by not watching this.

It's fantastic ...with superb acting and screenplay,"Well script could have been a bit tighter my only issue regarding the film . It's the chemistry between all the actors who just blend with their roles so nicely that u would remember the movie with those character,s name . Full credit to MR.ShahRukh KHAN without him the film would not have become that big . his energy in the movie was amazing and those abs were just cheery on the cake . coming to his acting in the movie it was just awesome , how beautifully ShahRukh KHAN as a CAPtain lead his team it was amazing . DeEpiKa n SRK u r currently the best jodi of Bollywood ...from om shanti om . cheenai express and now happy new year , love the way how nicely u compliment each other effortlessly .from rest of the cast i think ABhishik shine and Boman irani ..Watch it if u r a fun loving person and u would enjoy the screenplay .

not as good as Shahrukh movies,"after watching the song Lovely, we decided to have a look at this movie, everything was clear as crystal from first 5 minutes, as though we have seen this movie many times, slightly different versions from Hollywood movies, but the story grows slowly and with few twists gets more interesting, Padokone was brilliant as always, but shahrukh disappointed, over the years his talents of being an actor have turned into just another hero of Indian cinema, leading roles are not meant to be so supportive, rather supporting the team, this what i felt throughout this movie, Abhishek was good and Sonu sood did a great job, this movie would be a flop with Abhishek and Sonu ... if team India have lost the final round that would have been a better end, but i think writer didn't find any other tactic to hide the Diamonds ... and by the way Blue Diamonds are not so expensive ... anyway .. as far as comedy is concerned i will give this move 5 .. acting and editing needed more",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Utter Nonsense, cannot hold my seat until interval","The movie is full of sh*t. Gone are the days when Shahrukh khan used to work in movies like Chak DE India and Devdas.The plot is to predictable right from the start of the movie. Abhishek Bachchan character is unwanted and unnecessary. Deepika doesn't really have anything to do in the movie other than teaching dance which seemed so futile and unnecessary.All in all, one should be able to connect all the dots in the first 30-40 minutes of the movies and can then walk out of the cinema theater knowing the whole story.Disappointing as the words sound.

A 10 Only for Climax Medly and SRK AB and Deepika and vishal-shekar,with in 25-30 minutes everyone in the audience would be able to know the plot and climax which was a huge black mark in the entire story plot. from a neutral point of view this movie offers nothing new but at least a new story with excellent music and background score especially in the climax where any true nationalist and Indian would get goosebumps for the first time at least.including the dance part to film shows the director passion for dance but fails miserably to present it on screen with a sense of humor . the comedy part carried in the film is totally senseless for a heist movie named 'biggest robbery of the world' probably could have been named easiest and silly robberies. only the climax song will keep you in the seats the rest you can relax and even miss it except the songs portion which was the only plus point in the film. overall a ten only actors in the lead role who carried the film on their shoulders with out whom the film could have been a disaster . a ten for the music directors who made the film and the end product watchable least of all. probably the actors from next on should choose a script and an apt director other than making films that may look commercial from the producer point of view but look a non sense from a neutral point .,8.0,Anonymous,Music

Really feeling bad for Boman Irani. Such a talented actor unnecessarily shaking his bums and dancing for no reasons. I was devastated by viewing his role in the film. This film is just running because of huge promotions and advertising. It again portrays that Indians can easily fall pray to the promotions. Common guys raise your standards. Just crossing 100 crores and 200 crores should not be the goal of the movies. You have huge potential but you are under utilizing it by making such a pathetic movies.

Outstanding movie with an other-wordly charm; This is what makes bollywood unique and special!,"An outstanding movie that typifies what Bollywood is supposed to be about and reinforces the other-worldly, unique charm that is pervasive in Hindi movies of its standing and genre. I observe nothing but negative reviews aplenty for the movie and I have one thing to tell all the nay-sayers. With a unique and perceptive thinking blueprint as a viewing lens, this movie will blow your mind. Happy New Year is not about about the destination, it is about the journey. And I want to share this blueprint with you all. The movie is primarily about creating a journey for the viewer; At any juncture, the circumstances will transform you into a virtual world infused with memories, instigate vivid imagination and fill your heart with feelings of love, wonder, anger, disgust. So allow yourself to be flexible and offer your emotions to be dipped hither and thither; Arm your imagination with wondrous fluidity, for this is a hugely important aspect of this blueprint. If you disrupt this thought journey by demanding the justification of the logical flow of the movie or it's character development, you will reduce your experience to unpleasantness and regret of having spent three precious hours of your life. Engage and indulge yourself in a virtual higher level flow that is created by YOU, using all your senses and which the movie feeds through its beautiful cinematography, inspiring locations, pretty women, macho men, great songs and crisp background music. Use the laughter in the theater and grimaces in the audience along with the other elements in the movie, to make yourself chuckle, wriggle, laugh; And infuse the virtual flow with wondrous momentum and catapult your imagination. The movie is riddled with exaggerated and dramatic responses for simple situations, which almost seems like it is a caricature or a parody of human reactions; And it does so in such a manner that it seems unpretentious and deliberate. While indulging in this virtual world and measuring your responses towards the emotional creations in the movie, it almost seems like the movie mocks you for showing seriousness and delivers a disruptive message to all of us; Our short time in this complex adaptive world should be about light heartedness, wonder and passion rather than seriousness, sadness or painful longing. The movie starts with a moment of awe at the herculean display of fireworks and right then it is very clear what the journey is all about. The brilliantly shot celebratory ritual of smashing a high hanging pot that is typical of Janmashtami, is close to every Indian and is well utilized to introduce one of the protagonist. Emotions are hurled around while interspersed with elements of surprise and shock just like a new year firework display exploding in the sky after provoking wondrous anticipation. This is demonstrated in a tense moment where nervous excitement arising from a simultaneous dance display of two competitors is transformed into a very touching moment induced by a show of bravery and selflessness. The lavish, colorful and celebratory atmosphere at the eve of the dance finale that forms the fabric for the impromptu dances from different cultures, is an inspired creation. Artistically choreographed athletic duels in the lucid arena of dirty brown muddy water or on the altitudes of a high rise, recreates in a specific modern setting, the feel of the combat between Arjun and Duryodhan in the Mahabharatha. I urge the movie goer to drop all notions about the conventional structure that highlights movies nowadays and go see this movie with an open mind and an open heart!",2.0,Anonymous,Music

A Movie of typical BOLLYWOOD style.!,"As expected from Farah Khan's movies, the film made very little sense from beginning till the end. The story was fully filmy; the hero have a tragic background which led him to follow wrong path; the heroine is helpless and in hope for her dreams to come true; and a villain who (not so cleverly)trapped the innocent family members of the hero.Its the story for vengeance. Hero and his friends demands to serve get justice in there own way. They wanna devastate the enemy in the same way their lives were devastated. An impossible seeming plan is carried out to steal Diamonds from (supposedly)the safest vault ever made. Hi-tech equipments and dangerous stunts are performed. And as expected a happy ending occurs. Even though movie revolves around dancing, no such great moves were seen. Fighting scenes were forcefully attached to places where the story didn't demand it. Highlighting Deepika's glamor and showcasing Shahrukh's body seemed to be the main motto of the direction team. Even Sonu Sood was hardly seen wearing shirts throughout the movie. Only plus in the movie were the funny dialogues and comic acts maintained throughout the movie. The graphics and the locations were outstanding. Songs were catchy and entertaining.Overall: Go..

So to give you a clear picture whether to watch this movie or not here is the example If you liked Ra.One, Tees Maar Khan and Chennai Express, you sure gonna like it but if you didn't like them, your taste is same as mine and this movie as well is a waste of time.

Only good thing is Abhishek Bachchan,"Before the movie, I had read reviews and had very low expectations. But the first half of the movie was really funny. There are so many out of place and mismatch contents yet it kept the audience laughing. Not that the jokes are original or very well thought. Creators put in all they can and it is like watching a cartoon. How can you not laugh when you watch cartoon . So if it's the entertainment you seek, first half of the movie is for you. Abhsihesk Bachchan is shining and he gives the most entertainment. Also references to other movies are okay, funny.But then the life of the movie drops significantly in the second half. Other than one or two jokes here and there, there is nothing to keep you entertained. You want to get it over with but the movie drags on trying to justify the heist and why the characters are involved in it. There is unnecessary fight between Charlie (played by SRK) and a Korean where Charlie's team does not come to help despite the risk involved in the fight.The patriotic angle of the movie is forced on. SRK does what he does in all the movies. His signature all over the movie. Some dance is like actually you are watching a SRK Live in concert. In a song they make all other actors raise their arms like SRK always do. How a leading actor like Abhishek falls to that level is so sad. In fact most of the scenes involving SRK looks very familiar.In the theater I was watching, there was a technical error and movie was stuck before it's last 10 minutes. It took some 5 minutes to fix and resume play but meanwhile many people had started to walk off as they were waiting for it to be over and took the tech error as an excuse to do so. Film being too long actually overshadows some rare key points in the movie.Finally, expect SRK does some meaningful movie. After all, he is an actor who has given some memorable movies. Riding that success to do movies like CE, HNY is so sad.I give 4 stars. 3 stars to the comic flow in the first half and 1 star to Abhishek Bachchan.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

The Best Bollywood Masala Movie till date... I mean it..,"Happy New Year, according to me, is not just the most entertaining but also the most well detailed heist and dance competition movie of the Bollywood...Of course, there are loopholes but not a lot. At least, there is an answer to everything. Whether its getting votes in dance competition, making it to the final round of dance competition... getting finger prints of villain's son... to making their way out with the diamonds.. even why the plan is called happy new year (after an unsuccessful merry Christmas attempt) the acting by everyone is great.. the best thing is the team work that shows in the movie and among the actors.. they look and work like a team... and there were aunty's sitting next to me.. who were saying.. ""comon, only 2 minutes are left for the safe lock to activate"".. (how can people say they had headache?)Direction is top notch.. ""OSO"" was a drag after intermission, but this one is so MAGNUM and ENORMOUS that you can't feel bored at all.. so much money and effort has been put to make every screen shine like gold.. and there is a soul in every emotion... you feel for team India.. even when namo says ache din aa gaye after their selection in the finals :P people were drooling in the hall on it.. also the scene, where ""Nandu"" strips for the sake of the plan :) also the fight scene between srk and the korean guy... Hollywood standard... (and people were saying the duplicate was evident in that scene.... he did it himself guys :)) people were rooting for ""Indiawaale"" and the team diamonds (as they were after diamonds)... and this is i think the biggest achievement of the movie..cinematography, choreography and background score... all of them fabulous.. we all talk about the actors... but background score, cinematography and choreography are never talked about.. they were phenomenal.. miles ahead of any other bollywood movie... of course, many people were not note the detailing put in the movie... but they all will at least notice one thing - the sheer beauty of the movie and effort of the people who have made it...and the songs.. bad? watch them grow on you while you watch the movie... all of themThis is one movie that you need to watch in a movie hall... it is MEGA, it is ENORMOUS.. the best of ""bollywood masala""..",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wish there was something New,"Advice to the Happy New Year Team: What not to do when making a movie: 1. SRK you need to realise that past glory is a PAST. You cant have ""Picture tau abhi baki hain, choti choti baatien, baade bade ba ba black sheep in all your movies"" 2. Exotic locations doesn't have the entertainment value. 3. 6 pack abs is a passé. Almost all of you ""actors"" have it. 4. Deepika you no longer need ITEM songs. You are a great actor. Probably the only one who acted in the movie. 5. The fight scenes should look realistic. A punch in a reel should resemble a punch in real life. 6. SRK you don't need to potray in the movies that people love you, people adore you. They do it in real life. 7. Don't make the thrill too obvious. 8. Expletives don't pull the crowd. Expletives doesn't denote that you can act. 9. The brand placement should be subtle. They should not get more time frame than 3 seconds. Minimal to be used. If you think you can make money by giving brands a space in your movie, you are not sure of the work that you do. You do not have the confidence that the audience will appreciate your movie which would be sufficient to cover up the benefits of the in brand placements.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"A star studded, clichéd, forgettable, yet watchable flick.","Happy New Year, one of the most anticipated flicks of the year comes smashing the records over and over again, but is this heist movie really worth the overpriced tickets? 'A Farah Khan film', the tag that thrilled everyone about 7 years ago, came as a downer 4 years ago when her disaster Tees Maar Khan. With the reunion of SRK-Farah-Deepika, it was touted to be Om Shanti Om part ii, however, post the lackluster trailer and songs, for me, the movie was an absolute downer, a Tees Maar Khan part ii, maybe. However, the opinions changed after watching the film last night.Adding the emotional touch of framed dad, and his son taking revenge with his 'Angels' and a probable love interest, the story is simple a one-liner. But you can't expect more from a masala entertainment. What is actually good about the movie is its grandeur, something I have loved Farah for. This is perhaps bigger than even Om Shanti Om in terms of grandeur. There are some genuine comic scenes which will leave you in splits, but most of them are over done. The heist scenes are copied from random Hollywood movies. Action scenes are engaging. Farah appears to be in a full fangirl mode. The dance tutor scene specially looks like a parody of ""Shake It Off"" video.All in all, it is much like Dhoom 3, having an upper hand in action and comedy, while lower hand in conveying emotions.What really holds the movie is its star cast. However, even there it is flawed. Shahrukh was overburdened with responsibilities of the script- less movie which he had to carry on his shoulders and his abs. Abhishek comes out as a surprise in this movies, having had string of annoying performances after Guru. Boman is fantastic as ever, though his accent was annoying in the beginning. Vivaan makes a good debut. Deepika, was most the cheerful part of the film, but her role is limited as a sidekick, not one that people would remember her for.Hence, to clarify, this movie is far from horrible, but isn't good too (as expected!). Still, this Diwali this one-time-watch maybe given a go.I go for a 5.5/10 for this Diwali cracker.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Low in content, good in Comedy Quotient.","I guess v shouldn't expect a high quality sensible movie from Farah Khan, just enjoy the music, star appearance, comic scenes and come back smiling without thinking much. Starting 15-20 mins looked boring with repetitive dialogs from previous movies but later the funny scenes were really hilarious making us laugh a lot... Shahrukh was no doubt looked great in his 10 packs Deepika was as usual gorgeous, Abhishek needs more movies and at east keep appearing so that we don't forget him, Boman's talent wasn't used much, Sonu again looks good but nothing to do much and I am a fan of his voice n looks , Vivan average as per his 1st movie... that's it!

Best reply to those Deepika fans who criticized Katrina and Kareena for their small roles in Dhoom 3 and Singham Returns. Overacting and illogicality @ its peak All emotional scenes sucked big time.

SRK : Thats true..so what do you have in your mind..I need to secure Abrams future with this one! FK : Lets make a revenge drama cum dance drama cum musical cum romance cum heist story & punch it all in within 3hrs of complete garbage & feed that to the Stupid Sand Ni**ers during the festive season (Indians spend most or whatever little they have during this few days!)& see how much money we all Khans can make!

"Worth The Time! Will Thrill, Entertain and Make You Laugh At The Same Time","I don't write reviews normally. But seeing the IMDM user reviews filled with low stars, I took the courage to write a review.The first of all, if you don't WANT TO LIKE the movie, and you don't have enough time to complete, in a hurry, you won't like it. All 3 hours will seem to you total nonsense. However, really it isn't. You need to refresh your mind, and just see the movie. You're definitely gonna like it.What's the main things that it has to offer other than countless movies? It's a pure entertainer with logic. It has a strong storyline, correct drama and a brilliantly done heist (the theft of diamonds). People who have confusion that it'll be a rip off of Now You See Me and Ocean's 11, really it isn't. No, not even the concept.It has comedy, it has action, it has the dance, it has romance, it has drama, it has a sense of nationalism. It's a great complete package and even some early scenes were too bit extravaganza, but once you skip this, it's a complete solid package. Do watch it. It'll put a smile and give you goosebumps in the end.To compare three Farah Khan films, I'll rate Main Hoon Na>Happy New Year>Om Shanti Om.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Visually Stunning But...,"Well one of the biggies from Bollywood has reached cinemas to ignite the spark already we have in the country with all the celebrations connected with the festival of lights and crackers in full swing. As expected, the film has lavish sets and foreign visuals, rich & colorful feel with vibrant costumes and above all the towering presence of the Badshah from Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan. But other than these and other than what the trailers showed, Happy New Year directed by Farah Khan has nothing much to offer content wise.The story mixed with humor and revenge has a heist backdrop and that is quite common in Bollywood these days with every superstar becoming part of such plots now. Charlie /ChandraMohan Manohar Sharma (Shah Rukh), Nandu (Abhishek Bachchan), Mohini (Deepika), Jagmohan (Sonu Sood), Tammy (Boman Irani) and Rohan (Vivaan Shah) are the six people or rather losers who are the participants of World Dance Competition in Dubai with a hidden agenda. How these losers become the ultimate winners is what the movie is all about.For a festive season, people looking for a mass film of this magnitude,HNY might be more than enough to satisfy their entertainment quotient but as a cinema other than technical finesse and rich visuals this is not a great film and perhaps if you leave your logical side of the brain at home before taking off to theaters, there are chances that you might be able to enjoy this stuff that has nothing much in terms of any unexpected twists and turns.The biggest highlight and life of the film even with the negative aspects is of course SRK. He brings that much needed color to the film when the proceedings becomes tiring. So it is more of a Shah Rukh Khan show all packed in a predictable and clichéd Bollywood film with all the mass elements. Abhishek was comical but went overboard at times. Deepika was sexy and charming, Boman Irani was funny well supported by Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah. Jackie Shroff as the baddie was stylish.On the technical aspects, cinematography, edits, choreography and background score were impressive. Also the costume designer deserves praise for coming out with such varied and colorful costumes to give some richness to the overall feel. I wouldn't say Vishal Shekhar has done a bad job in composing the songs but they were not impressive either.Overall this three hour film is just an entertainer and a one time watchable one apt for a festive season with nothing much to rave about in terms of content. Whether you want to watch it and whether it will make you Happy or not it's up to you to watch and decide.P.S - Please don't miss out the end title credits. There is something special out there.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazingly superb & full Entertainter,"Well, Finally the most awaited day came. The curtains were raised & we were exposed to a wonderful light heartening HNY which makes u laugh hard. HNY gives you full worth of your money. Shahrukh looked amazing. His acting was to the highest level indeed. Depika played her role artistically. In all it is a wonderful movie to watch and a family entertainer. One for his life cant miss this movie.The story of heist in this movie has been shown in a v different way. The focus is on the lighter side which is worth the fun the movie gives us in return. The songs are picturized beautifully. Hny is a completer package.

As expected! Totally Worthless!,"I'm not really sure why every time a Shahrukh Khan/Salman Khan movie comes, it's like everyone goes berserk.I'm really sick and tired of slapstick comedy. And action that clearly looks like it's done with a cable. Please spare us some brain.Farah Khan! You lived up-to my expectations. I was expecting nothing short of total garbage. Shahrukh! Please forget 8 packs. Have a decent meal. At 48, you look more than 60.And for god's sake, avoid slang/adult innuendos in a family movie. If you really want to do it, then go all out like Gangs of Wasseypur. Then it would be really awesome!Take Bang Bang for example. Despite all it's flaws, it went all out in action. And some of the action sequences were simply breathtaking. All HNY wants is great box office collections. No need to pour any substance.However, the movie was fun in parts. And I really liked those parts. Hate to admit but Abhishek and Deepika were actually quite good!But to put in a good review for the whole movie means giving a good review to an entire hotel just because the salad was good! Anyways, Shahrukh fans would stop at nothing. All I can say to you is if you really enjoy such movies, then do enjoy it.

Stealing Diamonds have become a Trend!,"Oh! My Goodness!What else can I say! It was first Aamir Khan's D(!)oom 3, then Rhitik's Bang Bang, and now KK's Happy New Year.These films give us reviewers some busy typing time in our pretty somewhat dull life.I do not know what to say to this movie. From when has it become a trend to Steal diamonds in movie themes? Oh! I forgot, Doom 3 and then Salman khan's Kick have the same Bank Robbery theme.Same old things being routinely played one after another and making it boring. I would say if the makers are out of ideas and if they are gonna steal stories from Ocean's franchise then they should go to Japanese Manga writers and buy some good stories and build on it. Look what Tom Cruise did in 'Edge of Tomorrow'. It was adapted from a Japanese light novel. I think if they are gonna cut, copy and paste crappy old stories together at such an epic level then they should not hesitate to buy a good manga story for adaptation.Please, Farah Khan, spare us and do not use your crappy movies to waste our time. Do a better job next time.No one should ever watch this film in one's life. This film has absolutely nothing to offer.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
To watch it leave brain/sense at home....,"All the movie does is string lot of jokes/comic situation together. There is no storyline as such. The producers and director it seems are firm believes that you throw big money on the table, you earn big money!!!! , coz that's what the movie does - lot of glamor, lot of big actors, but no substance or sense.What worked: Some comedy!! , some music ! - my 8 yr old loved it . Lot of color/glamor😱What didn't work: No sense of realism in the plot - staging a high tech robbery. No thrill in the storyline - u could actually predict next scene and dialogue ( in fact many dialogues were lifted of other movies ( mostly SRK movies) , maybe that was the comic value) , full footage for SRK, some for AB ( nice comedy on his part and finally doing something different from big B) and almost nil for DP -poor lass didn't even get enough exposure in her item number....😪( I wonder if she did the movie as a favor) and rest everybody else only guest appearance!!!

Why bother wasting your time and money,"Okay, the movie isn't just outrageously lavish in showcasing its stars. But the movie as a whole fails to deliver on every stage. The acting is no where realistic, and the plot can be predicted way before the first half of the movie. There is hardly a 2 min climax if thats what you wanna call it.Direction and editing are pathetic, i don't know how this movie got such a good opening. Just because it came out on a festival date and no other movies were released. Very strategically placed release to get a good opening. Pathetic and cheap strategy, well it is Farah Khans movie after-all. i just wish people read this review and don't waste your hard earned money. Movie is outrageously copied and combined with a lot of Hollywood movies,nothing original about it.The only time you really like the movie is Boman Irani's tid bits of road side humor. And thats the only part that you will enjoy. Choreography:- ?? this is what you will think after seeing them perform.Lets just state that the score of the movie has been copied from Bad Boys. Explicitly the score that is Bad Boys Heist and Bad Boys Main Title Score both of which were composed by Mark Mancina. A simple you-tube search will make you hear the sound track.

You need to experience Happy New Year yourself..I bet you'll regret if u don't.. Honestly I can't put it into words.. SHAH RUKH KHAN just smashed it..,"‪#‎HappyNewYear‬ Review - Finally after continuous anxiety and wait of almost 3 months it has arrived! ‪#‎HNYDay‬ is here!! And it has arrived and how? It was always expected to be big but how big was the question. And team HNY has answered that question in their own style. To put it simply it is EASILY year's best film. Miles ahead of last year BB yes even CE. In fact I will go out the limb and say it is EASILY SRK's best since OSO!! Why? Well here is why:- 1. Unbelievable canvas! Film looks expensive in each n every frame. 2. Unbelievable chemistry b/w all star cast! 3. Amazing humor! Ah we so missed the good family comedy timings! 4. Action was of highest standard that you can see in an Bollywood Masala film. 5. Farah Khan is back in her elements. 6. Abhishek,Sonu Sood did commendable job. 7. Vivaan and Boman both were very efficient. 8. Deepika Padukone has again shown why is the most powerful lead actress going around! 9. And last but not the least Shah Rukh Khan! He is in unbelievable form! Looking like million bucks in each n every frame, impeccable comic timing, in ROCKING action avatar! He has carried the film on his shoulder and will take it to the BO glory as well!! PS:- Watch out for the super cutest AbRam Khan playing with his father for 30 secs and it will be worth your all ticket price Also any glimpse of Mrs Khan is worthy enough well here she has shown some of her never seen before moves as well!! And in the film they end up stealing Diamond worth 300m$ it looks well set to collect 300 cores in India alone. Now as for stars do I really need to give it? See you in theaters fellas for I will be seeing it for at least 20 times more now I feel I MUST BE A BIG SRK FAN",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Mind Blowing Performance and Outstanding Humor! You will enjoy right throughout.,"I do not know if the earlier review was written, by a fan or a hater of SRK or he actually went to watch the movie in the first place and clearly he seems to be having a biased opinion on SRK, which he seems to be more of a hater than a fan and thus if an opinion is biased then it cannot be simply taken seriously as a review.Anyhow I went to see the movie yesterday while being disheartened by the previous review and thought it might be boring with all the crap and misleading statements spread made by the previous reviewer.I have to say I was actually surprised how wrong he was , the movie was excellent , it had the necessary elements of surprise and classy in all of its form , it was hilarious right through-out and I cannot recall another time I was rolling on the floor in a theater with so much laughter and joy , the actors were doing their best and were fair by their character requirements and brought it all together perfectly blended to make it a box- office mega-blaster.The plot was original in it's own form despite some claiming it to be lifted off from another , despite all this piece of art was a success in doing what they initiated to do and planned and was a complete success.Not a Minute I was bored or yawning but most of the time hardly breathing with all the humor.So either way I would like to conclude this review by noting that , go for it for the Humor and joy , have a bit of Fun , enjoy a movie forgetting all the logic (That's why we all go for a movie now and then yeah , to forget about the reality at least for a few hours, this movie excels doing that perfectly) , go to see some of the best acting by SRK , Deepika , Abhishek and rest of the crew and most of all go to enjoy the movie leaving aside all differences , trust me it's worth the money.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The worst,"I haven't seen such a rubbish movie ever.

Everyone looked so awkward and I don't know why would someone take abheshek in a movie. He has no idea of how to do acting, not even a single chance. At least be realistic while making a movie. I think you should think twice before buying any ticket for this movie.

The full on entertainment,"The superb entertainer, this movie is a laugh riot. Great work by the whole team especially Shahrukh & Deepika. Go & watch, this movie is really worth a watch. 10 out on 10.As far as the acting department is concerned, no prizes for guessing as to who the captain of the team is. It is Shah Rukh Khan, who leads the film on his able shoulders right from the word go. Be it his quintessential romance with his lady love Deepika Padukone or the fight sequences, or his acting performance as Charlie, Shah Rukh Khan excels in every department. In this film, he has been portrayed more as an action hero who can sing and dance, which again, the King Khan has done full justice to. If he sported a 6 pack abs in OM SHANTI OM, he moves 'two steps ahead' to flaunt a whopping '8- pack abs', which looks undeniably good on him! Deepika Padukone, on the other hand, does full justice to her character Marathi bar dancer. After CHENNAI EXPRESS, this is yet another quirky character that the actress has played in one more SRK film. Deepika has definitely evolved a lot as an actress and she proves that yet again with her comic role in this film. Do not miss the scenes when even her silent love for Shah Rukh Khan speaks volumes. Sonu Sood excels in his role and looks convincingly funny. Abhishek Bachchan is back to doing loud comedy in this film after BOL BACHCHAN. In this film, be ready for a double dose of Abhishek as he is seen in a double role.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

After the robbery every one will leave except deepika so that she can stand up for India.( Illogical thing at that point of time),just to extend the movie and have some sympathy.

By far the Best entertainer of 2014,"Abhishek Bacchan and SRK stand out in this Diwali blockbuster. The movie is for families and released on a festival where happiness is celebrated. Dubai locales are magnificent and it has a mass appeal.It clearly does what dhoom and kick could not do, i.e. have a good family appeal. A movie that is all about feeling and celebrating the joyhood of Indiawaale. Yes, sense is missing but that's the case with any grand movie. The box office numbers surely prove it now and SRK proves ""naam hi kaafi hai dost"". It is fun and relaxing and only unpleasant bashers and cribbers wont like it. Well done. Happy Diwali. Music is good and the screenplay is very receptive to the tune.

Farah Khan and Sajid Khan should just stop. This is the limit.,"I've read all the reviews here on IMDb. Most of them are SRK Fanatics who rate the movie to be around 9-10, and the others who rate the movie to be around 1-2. It just goes to show that there's a clear divide among movie viewers in India.Of course, this movie will start with a higher rating at first around 7-8 and end up at 6 finally, and isn't going to reach the bottom 100 list on IMDb (which it should).I'm confident that this wicked/cheap formula of making big-budget movies with a huge star cast would die down after a few more years and more meaningful films would be appreciated. I'm just hopeful.This movie is such a cringe fest all throughout. Avoid it at any costs, even if you get a free ticket. It will cost you more than the ticket costs because by the time you're out of the theater, your IQ would have decreased considerably.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

heavily PRed pathetic brain chewing thriller,"For most part, I thought it is directed by Sajid Khan. That says it all about the quality quotient to the script and attempt at humor.Imagine Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Vivaan (hardly a dancing phenomena) representing India in World Dance Competition.Sonu Sood, the macho man of the movie, doing his fight sequences as if he inherited it all from Charlie Chaplin himself. And his responsibility in the grand theft being left to turning water pipe levers.Boman Irani, who is the sole quality performer in the movie, having to contribute to the choreography in WDC eliminators with a slurry of fit, which ends up becoming a rage of hit.Abhishek was excellent, but am afraid he might end up stereotyping himself if he doesn't take up better characters. He is the man who played lead in Guru and Yuva, and he needs to remind himself of that versatile ability.Vivaan the hacker, who doesn't look like having seen enough summers, being the brainiest of the lot who can hack anything under the sun.Shahrukh falling to deeper and deeper abyss with his 'i-m-the-greatest- actor' acting mode which he is in of late. Guess who is hamming Shahrukh these days.... Shahrukh himself.Deepika was OK. Sincere in her acting and gracious in her dance.The comedy dialogs in first half are right off from the unrefined evening discussions over coffee of the script writers.Jackie was forgettable.Lastly, Farah and Shahrukh and others need to remember that the youngest generation of the country blindly follows some of the big names in the movie. So they should show some decency and behave responsibly instead of emptying their carts of cheap and at-times ghastly dialogs in the movie. Strangely, they are different people, when propagating and PRing their movie on various TV channels and serials and appealing to kids and parents and elder ones alike to come and watch their movie. But then, if they felt responsible towards their influence on the young ones, they wouldn't make such cheap brash humor anyways.Second half was exciting at times, but largely due to Abhishek and Deepika and Boman. The so-called King is in his own virtual empire at the moment, even when shooting. And Farah is challenging her own brother. Lets hope they both call it truce, and stop competing err.. making movies any more.Highly doubt such movies can make the millions they mention that they are making.

It is a pathetic with it's vomit eating scenes, male stripping scenes, burps, fake accents and what not. The only grace is the India Waale song and a scene or 2 in between. The first half is a headache! How on earth did Farah Khan make this after Main Hoon Naa and Om Shanti Om! I thought after TEES MAAR KHAN she must have learnt a lesson. Sorry, I am in no mood to write anything about the non existent plot and non existent acting from any of the actors in the movie. I will just vent out my anger and frustration at the ""KING-KHAN"" of Bollywood who now has to resort to Heavy Marketing and fake ratings to make his DUD movies work. SRK, I will always be a fan boy but since the past 4-5 years I am enjoying the movies of Remake Specialist Salman more than your crap movies and acting. Please give us a Chak De, Swades, K2H2 type of movie soon!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Hype of the year,"Happy New Year: One of the most celebrated festive season across the world, where everyone greets to welcome the new changes in their lives. So that much expectation we might have in this musical heist drama, which delivered almost in some sequences not in terms of plot. Directed by Choreographer cum Director Farah Khan, she knows the pulse of the masses by capturing the biggest star of the bollywood, some inspiring ideas from previous films(irrespective of whether it is bollywood or Hollywood) and spicy-masala dish is ready to serve. Coming to performances, Shah Rukh Khan(as Chandramohan Sharma aka Charlie) he looks great in his physique avatar but if compare to earlier Farah film's, the charm seems to have faded down. But in the emotional sequences he over shines everyone. Abhishek Bachchan(as Nandu and Vicky Grover) finally he got the certificate of acting(i hope its not fake) he is super funny and entertains through his gestures. His role should be more lengthier and meatier, but the last sequence in the vault is hilarious. Deepika Padukone(as Mohini) she looks great, almost similar character of Chennai Express but it is no where compare to that role which was exceptional. Boman Irani(as Tammy) he was the show stealer with his perfect parsi accent and hilarious in his sequences. Sonu Sood(as Jag) he was just average, nothing much to deliver except some few introduction sequences. Vivaan Shah(as Rohan) he is completely wasted as an amateur hacker. Jackie Shroff(as Charan Grover) he was fine in his part. Story is kept simple(SRK keeps saying this ""Keep it Simple""),nothing new in it. If you have seen heist films like Ocean's Eleven,Tower Heist,Italian Job etc. then there is nothing new in the heist plans and execution. Screenplay is good in bits and pieces where in the first portion they are unintentionally funny scenes. Even if they forces you to laugh, your mouth doesn't even smile for it. Second portion is much better than first with some good sequences to remember. There is a sequence which is totally illogical, why you need a helipad to do dance rehearsal? Were all the rooms in atlantis were booked? or you just want to showcase amateur kung fu hustle types stunts between SRK and a Korean man(the action was good but unintentional). Music is good by Vishal-Shekhar but not as good as OSO. Verdict: **.5 stars On the whole, it is a complete family entertainer but in bits and pieces with some good hilarious moments. Abhishek and Boman are to watch out for, they are hilarious in their sequences. Irrespective of what the reviews are, moviegoers will watch it for SRK as it has been made for his fans. Even it is a multi starrer film. If watched it will remind you of many good entertainers and if skipped will not make you feel about missing out something important. Still missing the SRK of 90's(only the evil side).",5.0,Anonymous,Music

3 precious hours of your life that you will never get back,"I used to be a solid SRK fan until couple of years back but some of his recent movies like Chennai Express and now HNY has made me realize that he cannot be an actor/entertainer anymore. His big lifestyle demands colossal money spinners with unabashed budgets. This means , most of the time no-brain movies which makes absolutely no sense at all and are sometimes downright insulting. Happy New Year is one such movie. Although I did not expect a cult classic from Farah Khan when I went to the theater, I surely did not expect the low standards that the movie stooped into. Its such a low brow, poorly scripted tedious torture of a movie that you would just want to step out and get some fresh air. The clichéd tiring jokes which you might have seen a million times are run through this movie again to evoke laughs. The movie makes fun of epileptic people even going so low as to invent a signature dance move based on Boman Irani's character which is epileptic. There is no respect to women and every thought in this movie is parochial and stereotyped. From calling North Korean dance team 'Chilli Chicken' to a Bar dancer's poor English or the quaint Parsi accent , everything is unapologetically made fun of . People like Sajid and Farah should stick to what they are good at whatever it is and refrain from making movies. I regret wasting 3 torturous hours of my otherwise happy and fun Diwali 2014.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

bakwaas,"bakwaas, pakau, faltu, senseless. 0.000001 out of 10.Farah Khan lives up to to her abilities - which is non-existent. Her love for Sharukh Khan has again resulted in a movie that lacks a script at all, and something which she claims to be entertainment. Her love for melodrama and songs, has resulted in yet another disaster called Happy New Year. As she and her like minded directors always do - this movie is high on color and glamor, but has a poor script and dwells on low quality humor. Its the kind of humor which probably a low IQ person would only appreciate. Its a waste of money watching this movie. Please go and spend money on other movies. A consistent feature in such kind of movies is the minimal importance given to female actors. Deepika Padukone plays a dumb damsel in distress. I wonder why a female director would like to portray a female actor in such a light. Such stereotypical projections can only go against he case for women equality in the country.all wasted 'Happy New Year' movie made to kill those people who were survived after watching Ra-One...tees maar khan himaatwala ......joker ..",1.0,Anonymous,Music
WHY Farah WHY?,"OK first thing first, I am here to rant about the new assault on our senses brought about by the most expensive holiday advertisement for Dubai a.k.a Happy New Year. I think Farah Khan thinks her audiences are a stupid bunch and I think she might be right. After all we do go to the theater and spend our hard(ly) earned money on those expensive movie tickets, obligatory and overtly expensive sodas, candy and popcorn. Boman Irani plays a Parsi middle aged man who still lives with his mother and surprisingly is the hottie of the society. Sonu Sood is the all brawn no brains guy who can hear through only one ear and gets crazy mad, huffing and puffing like he is in a gym lifting a really heavy barbell #nuffsaid. Abhishek Bachchan is neither brawn nor brains but he drops his pants in the movie (no ladies, no sawariya happening here) and oddly the only guy who is slightly funny in this anesthesia fest. I won't be too harsh on the young Vivaan Shah playing the nerdy hacker who is socially awkward especially around women (talk about stereotypes), it is his second film and no one would pass up an opportunity to stand next to this cast. Deepika Padukone does what she was supposed to do, sing songs, dance sexy, look pretty, act dumb, shed some tears, fall in love with SRK and be Kamlee (hihi see what I did there). Jackie Shroff looks good as a baddie daddy but that's all I can say for it. Last but not least SRK plays the young man named Charlie who is also a Boston university topper (so we know that he is very smart) but works in a dinghy, muddy fight club as a fighter dude (so we know that he is strong). Somehow, we make through to the end of the movie where everything is right with the world, all wrongs have been corrected and the cast is dressed in sparkly costumes dancing away to glory in midst of fireworks, platforms that lift up in the air (ooohh fancy) and all that razzle-dazzle. Finally, this brain numbing movie comes to an end and the audience is left dumbfounded by what just happened to them! To all those people who are ranting on the internet about how bad this movie was, please remember guys we did this to ourselves, we knew what was going to happen but we still went on hoping against all odds that this movie would be something else. We sat there coz SRK, we cried internally and got brain bleed coz SRK and we came out of the theater feeling dead inside coz SRK. At least there were abs, all 8 of them. P.S. This is in no way to disrespect anyone's feelings, I love SRK and I am a huge fan of all the other actors in the movie, in fact, I like Main hoon na and Om Shanti Om a lot but I couldn't help talking about Happy new year. As a true blue SRK fan, I would say just go and watch it for yourself. Maybe you will feel differently, though I doubt it.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
All about the 100 crores Race - Watch at your own Risk,The movie is simply a disaster. Farah Khan could have completed it in 2 hours but I guess the target audience is the people living in villages and uneducated youth who love to watch movies without any logic or quality of acting. Most of the scenes are illogical and irrelevant.Please download it from torrent websites and watch it in your laptop(So that u can skip those boring scenes). The theme of the movie is simply vague.. SRK tries to induce a feeling of patriotism among the viewers but the story of the movie doesn't match with the theme.Software engineers please DO NOT watch this movie.. There is a hacker(Vivaan Shah) who can defy all the laws of computer and web technology.Final Verdict: Watch at your own Risk.,1.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome Family Movie,"A motion picture without serious dramatic content, a weighty message, or intellectual depth, which serves simply as enjoyable entertainment. This is according to Google the characterization of a popcorn movie. And this is exactly what Happy New Year is to us as a family. It is packed with lots of fun scenes and we keep going back to watch them. The songs are catchy and although not of Indian origin our kids started to sing along. The cast seemed to have a good time making the movie and has definitely found some new fans here in Switzerland.

A Missed Opportunity,"Happy New Year feels like a missed opportunity. Despite a star cast led by Shah Rukh Khan, the film never quite clicks. The plot is far too stretched, relying on superficial humor and grand set-pieces that do little to engage. Shah Rukh's usual charm is overshadowed by a predictable script, while Deepika's performance fails to make an impact. The comedy feels forced, and the action sequences don't bring anything new. The movie, though visually impressive, lacks emotional depth, and the over-the-top approach makes it a tiring watch. It's hard to connect with any character, and by the end, it leaves you wanting more meaningful storytelling.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
What was SRK thinking?,"What was SRK thinking? Man, he not only produced this mess of a movie, also over acted in one.

Childish dialogues, garish costumes, over the top WhatsApp messages as jokes.The plot is too simplistic. How can a top luxury hotel like the Atlantis be broken this easily.Farah Khan, please invest in good writers, having the same tropes doesn't make a good movie. Similar work in Tees Maar Khan ensured, it was a disappointment. The filmmaking has changed this past decade and it seems, you're still in that old era.

I'm a huge SRK fan but let's be real... this movie is awful,"Come on people. It's OK. Let's admit it. Happy New Year is a terrible film. Did I laugh? Yes. Do I regret going to see it with my friends? No. Did I have fun watching it? Yes!But the movie is just plain bad. I won't totally trash it. The good parts - Abhishek was very funny, the fight scenes were nicely choreographed, and SRK took his shirt off a number of times. The mindless jokes had my friends and I cracking up at times. But the negative aspects of the film - well, I'm assuming IMDb has some maximum word count, so I will not even attempt to list those things. However, I will say the absolute worst part of this film was the patriotism organism that exploded randomly in the last 10 minutes of the film. Just... there are no words.Here's some solid advice: if you want to enjoy this movie, turn you brain off. By this I don't mean suspend a need to analyze every aspect of the plot, I mean, literally, turn your brain off. All the way off. Don't think at all. Thinking during this film could be a health hazard. The moment your brain turns on, it could explode from the insane amount of plot holes, inconsistencies, mindlessness, and most of all the awful clichéd dialogues. But be warned, the movie tips the 3 hour mark - so this is no simple feat. If you can turn your brain off in this way, AND if you like the actors, you will enjoy this movie (although you might leave the theater missing a few IQ points). I enjoyed it for that reason. However, if you don't have this power, or if you're not a fan of the actors, I would not recommend this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Bad Spoof of Shalimar,"Happy New Year review:The film borrows its heist plot from the 1978 Dharmendra - Zeenat Aman starrer ""Shalimar"",with a retribution angle thrown in. This hackneyed story, old as the hills, is crammed with Farah Khan brand of gross humor which includes Abhisheks character puking all over, a gay interlude between 2 contest judges, Sajid Khan screaming in a special appearance and general low brow spoofing of Srk's past hit dialogues. Admittedly, there are a few LOL moments like the team learning salsa and the silent ""argument"" inside a lift.On the acting front, Srk despite looking old and tired, pitches in a restrained performance allowing the other actors to take charge. Abhishek Bachchan surprisingly does well in his over the top act.The end product is a dafter version of ""Shalimar"" but definitely better than Farah Khans last outing ""Tees Maar Khan"". Risk it!!Regards,

Crappy New Year,"Why is there no number lower than 1 allowed for voting? This is one of the most awful movies out there in recent times. There is no story and no content in the movie. There was no hard work done to write some original dialogues. Everything was just recycled from old movies. The only saving grace of this movie was Deepika Padukone. She looked like a million dollars and performed as good as any of her other movies. No wonder she is the queen of the 100 Crore+ movies. Boman Irani was ho hum as an older single Parsi. Sonu Sood was sadly wasted. Naseer's son (cant even remember his name) made a mistake by signing this movie. He will never be taken seriously now. What to say of Abhishek. He has once again proved that he is a failed hero who cant act apart from his two and a half expressions that he has learnt by copying his superstar father. My advice to him would be, if you really want to continue as an actor even after your father is no more, then please take a break and learn your art by joining a theater for a few years and then come back. Till then please spare us. Lastly, SRK. Absolutely boring. Trying to compete with Salman by showing off his fake photo-shopped abs. Really? SRK, do you think we are fools??? The ONLY reason this movie has had great opening is because of the hype created by SRK as he does with all his movies. Nothing more nothing less. I personally don't believe the figures in the media though. They sound fake. This movie should be called Crappy New Year. Don't waste your time with this one.

"Cringfest, Waste of Time","So I checked out this movie on Netflix OTT on ""New Years Eve"" 2024. The songs that I have heard from the movie ""Indiawaale"" and ""Manwa Lage"" were big hits received lot of airplay on radio. So I expected a movie to be at least a one-time watch. For the 1st 20 minutes the plot and story looked okayish. An upcoming heist, diamonds, Jackie Shroff's screen presence. But then the cringefest started. A 15 min long action scene with Sonu Sood's character fighting off 10 odd bouncers where they keep spilling food and juice over Boman Irani's character, not once but 4-5 times. And when Shah Rukh Khan as the narrator introduces Abhishek Bachchan's character as a person with a tendency to puke and they showed him vomitting in a festival, that crossed the limit of trashiness for me. I switched off the TV. My advice, just download the album and listen to the songs. The movie is a waste of time.

What did I just watch..,"Only reason I decided to watch this, was because it looked like it was getting a lot of hype about it and it appeared in Netflix.

It did attempted to be a drama and a romance but, with the sudden switches between these themes, it was difficult to take it seriously. Most of the romance were silly clichés, as well.The silly theme of love at first stuff. Also, it keep showing the main guys' shirtless all the time.I know its probably to get female views because of them have six packs, but it was too much.

This is the story of a team who attempts to steal diamonds by entering in a dance competition to reach  Atlantis Hotel in Dubai...,"It's a wonderful movie: action mixed with original humor and great screenplay and acting. The fight scenes are really delectable and each character has been carefully crafted. The character portrayed by Deepika, a dancer and wanna-be dance teacher, is simply wonderful! Her obsession with people who speak English is hilarious,but that has a significant message, reflecting how missed dreams can influence our hearts...She is also the target of SRK three times when the latter talks in a humiliating manner about her, while she has silently approached him and stood behind his back. That's a funny moment even if we see Deepika breaking into tears...Regarding the story, the theme of stealing precious stones is found in Bang Bang as well, and at one point, I got the impression that it's a bad timing to release these 2 films close to each other! Also, I find that the title is not appropriate, as it does not correspond to the theme. When we hear of ""Happy New Year"", we tend to anticipate that the movie will be about some end-of year celebrations; but this is not at all the case!

Happy New Yeaf struggles to deliver,"""Happy New Year (2014)"" falls short of expectations with its lackluster execution and formulaic approach. The film's plot, revolving around a heist during a dance competition, fails to engage viewers due to its predictable and contrived nature. The characters, though a mix of talented actors, struggle to break free from one-dimensional archetypes, leaving the audience disconnected from their motivations and struggles.The film's excessive runtime, combined with elaborate dance sequences, results in a bloated narrative that loses focus on its core story. While dance can be an exciting element in Bollywood films, in ""Happy New Year,"" it often feels like a distraction from the already weak plot.Furthermore, the attempts at humor and emotional depth come across as forced, preventing any genuine connection between the audience and the characters. The film's over-reliance on slapstick comedy and melodrama undermines any potential for nuanced storytelling.In conclusion, ""Happy New Year (2014)"" struggles to find a balance between its heist premise and dance-centric narrative, leading to a disjointed and unsatisfying cinematic experience. It fails to rise above the trappings of a typical masala film, resulting in a forgettable addition to the Bollywood landscape.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika and Abhishek,"I usually see the movies of Shah Rukh Khan on day one. For some reasons I did not get the chance, and watched it today. I do recollect his movie 'Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India!' that was the movie I have gone on day one.I also did not get the change to attend the tour of this movie when they came to USA.Keep it up Shah Rukh, bring more and more of these kind of movies and you know the taste of audience and you know how to make people to come to your movies.Job well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
bad... really bad,"It's very bad movie that i ever seen in my life. What is this man Shahrukh? Day by day u r getting worst actor. It is very shameful acting. Please do not do this type of nasty film. The blockbuster success of Happy New Year may have put a 300 core smile on actor Abhishek Bachchan's face but it's likely been wiped off by this damning criticism from his mother, actress-politician Jaya Bachchan.Mrs Bachchan described Happy New Year as a ""nonsensical film"" at the recently concluded Mumbai Literature Festival. The Rajya Sabha MP, speaking at a session titled 'the failure of literature in informing current cinema,' said, ""I only watched it because Abhishek is in it. I told him he's a great actor if he can act stupid in front of the camera like that.""Jaya Bachchan, star of acclaimed films like Abhimaan, Mili and Sholay, also said, ""I can't be part of what is being done in films these days and hence I don't do films anymore.""Abhishek's character, Nandu Bhide, is seen in various get-ups and also performs what he calls a 'snakes dance' in the film. With co-stars Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah, Abhishek plays a 'loser' who enters a dance championship in Dubai but really intends to rob a bank.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Must-Watch Masaalaa Pot-boiler....Full On Entertainment...The second best from Farah Khan after ""Main Hoon Naa"".........","I was a bit scared to go to the theatre due to Farah khan's last venture ""Tees Maar Khan"" and Shahrukh's ""Chennai Express"". But, I was wrong.... The film opening sequence shows the lavish Palm Islands in the best way and You will just love it... The film with its huge star cast,breath-taking cinematography, quirky lines, a 2- min mute comic sequence (where many stars come in cameos and teach the Indiawaale team how to dance),""Long"" Laugh Sequences, appealing songs and their visual choreography (special mention to ""Manwaa Laage"" and ""Indiawaale""), action sequences and nationality theme makes your three hour show a real fun ride. You will find everything ....from comedy to action, dance, songs, nationality and a bit of stupidity too. Farah khan had made jokes on everything....whether it be the resemblance of Chinese and Koreans, Modi's ""Acche Din"" slogan , Sajid khan, Mumbaiyaa Hinglish and herself...Deepika, Boman and Abhishek have come out with a new funny avatar..I feel pity for the people who go and search logic in each and everything...A family which goes to a movie on an occasion/festival needs entertainment rather than searching for logic...It's not just a Shahrukh Khan film... This film equally belongs to each and every star in the movie as everyone has given their best ... A real treat for bollywood movie buffs...A perfect diwali entertainer...Find your funny bone and GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What the hell is this? It's not comedy action romance what genre movie is this. Worst movies ever no common sense. This should not be called a movie.,Worst movie ever. This is beyond jani dushman. Bollywood actors will do anything for money nowadays. Just shows human nature. Sadness.,1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Horrible to no story line, mediocre direction","Farah Khan has been known to make some good films but this one is definitely not one of them. The quintessential element that binds a movie together is the storyline. ""Happy new year"" lacks in it. Acting is mediocre at best. Direction is not that great either. I liked the songs but other than that the movie is not worth a watch.Apart from that the movie seemed a culmination of several other prior films. Every step of it seemed predictable and not interesting. It's amazing to know it made so much at the box office. I wonder how that happened.Acting-wise, SRK is his usual self, junior Bachchan probably needs to go to acting school, Deepika is her wonderful self and Kareena seemed charming as ever. Sonu Sood did a great job as well.All in all, although the movie has probably one of the biggest (and most expensive) star-cast and quite a few lovely songs, it lacks in all other aspects. Can I get my money back?",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Bullshit movie,"Typical bullshit movie.Most of people liked it because they are die hard fan of sahruk.I also like sahruk but i never thought sahruk who is king of bollywood choose this movie. Acting so far good. Honestly after watching this movie, one thing that struck my mind was - Since when Bollywood audience have become so dumb/stupid/senseless that they really want to watch any kind of crap these stupid film makers throw at them. Really a poor attempt at creating entertainment.Such a boring and dull story line.I couldn't under stand how it ranked 6.9 :o. People should rank it by judging everything.Its not just like ""I love sahruk so 10.:o",1.0,Anonymous,Music

"Fun musical, great dancing","I like these big productions out of India. This one is fun, funny, and lavish. Lots of costumes, expansive sets, great lighting. My favorite part, however, was the CREDITS! That's right, the credits are fun too, for each group —gaffers, electricians, makeup—all get a chance to dance too. Very original and fun idea. And the robbery? Suspend disbelief and enjoy the show.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Happy New Year Review: A Family Comedy perfect for yours.,"Let me first tell you Happy New year is about 6 ""losers"" go through a dance championship just to steal a handful of highly-worthful diamonds.Abhishek Bachchan. Just that. He utterly smashed his performance and superglues you to your seat. His famous quote in the movie was ""Nandu Bhide, Demak na firee"" (I'm Nandu Bhide and I've lost my mind!) He more than makes up for the 175 minute duration due to his quote and what he calls -world famous- snake dance. two other people entertained us in the movie, Boman Irani and, of course, Shah Rukh Khan.The Heist plan in the film is well planned out and the film is full of twists and surprises into the second half. The first half tells us their ride up the mountain and the second half tells us how they go down. The first half length is fine but the second half is stretched too far, no kidding. But the second half did have more funny moments than the first half, unpredictability and Nandu Bhide, so it doesn't keep you bored. The film does have lots, I mean lots, of special appearances and the introduction scene to everyone are really funny.The climax may be predictable to some while others won't have a clue, and finally Manwa laage, the best song in the album. Deepika comes 50 minutes into the film with ""Lovely"".So Happy New Year Directed by Farah Khan and Starring Shahrukh, Deepika, sonu, abisheik, boman & Vivaan is WORTH A WATCH. 8/10 stars (4/5 stars)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome,"Best movie of 2014. I really love it. Specially SRK and their team. Love you guys!!!! Keep it up :) The most amazing part in movie was Comedy+Action. I recommend others too to watch this great movie. I am a big fan of SRK and watch his all movies and this movie really increased my interest to SRK. Also Abhishek Bachan, his acting was really an awesome one. Really, whole team worked hard, love you all. I saw this movie 8 times and still now not bored at all. I am really willing to watch this movie again and again. Great Movie!!!!! Best of luck guys for your future movies and keep other entertaining. This is how a movie should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

An entertaining and fun movie...loved it!,"So big deal, the movie had a lot of cliche's in it. No one cares about that in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You sort of expect it. I enjoyed this movie because it was ""entertaining"" and took me away from all the depressing things I see on a regular basis in life. Just seeing Shah Rukh Khan dancing in a pink tutu and jumping into the arms of Sonu Sood was enough to make me laugh out loud. I mean, c'mon, how can you not laugh at scenes like that, which by the way had the piano tune, ""The Entertainer"" playing in the background, or Shah Rukh Khan dressed like Jackie Chan, sparring with a Korean dude, while ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting"" is playing?Okay, it started out as a well planned heist for revenge, but turned out to be, for me and for ""Charlie,"" a story that made me feel good about 6 people who were willing to put themselves out there and won the respect and applause from all those people that had originally booed them and treated them disrespectfully. It was one of those movies that made you happy to see the the underdog win!I'm not from India, I'm Italian, but during this movie, I found myself cheering on ""Team India"" primarily because they were so proud of their country and their heritage. Not only that, the music and dancing was great! It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while, so I bought the soundtrack...and the movie.""Happy New Year"" was definitely a ""feel good"" movie. I don't think the movie was meant to be this epic drama. Leave that to ""Devdas"" and ""Kal Ho Naa Ho."" It was meant to be a fun, happy, musical movie that left you energized and proud of your country and it's people! We need more of that in our world!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Best movie of 2014,"Iam telling you there are some stupid people

A great 3 for 1 Movie,"This movie has drama , comedy & dancing .
The characters are very fun and drama ads that extra dimension .
We actually used this for New Years Eve 2020 and while preparing food I heard the people in the living room laughing their heads off .
We were a a diverse group . . . 2 Indians , an African and 3 USA folk .
The Indian girl knew Shah Rukh Khan but had never seen the movie .
She believed the brain damaged people who call this a bad movie and didn't want to watch it . Later she was laughing and had a great time .
I also noticed she became completely taken during Deepika's dance numbers .
Everyone was in much better spirits after this movie which is important given the horrible COVID year .
Thanks Red Chiles for this great Comedy / Drama / Dance production .
We Love you here in Silicon Valley / Northern California !",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it,"Barely finished this with literal minutes to leaving Netflix. For a 3 hr flick it flew by, and left me all smiles. Very surprised it wasn't a newer flick, it's color palette was made for Dolby Vision 😍Yes, it is basically Oceans 11 the Bollywood version, but I'd watch this over that any day of the week. An absolute blast, so much beautiful coloration, a wholehearted feel good flick without the sap of Hallmark. Good guys win and bad guys lose, if only the real world were the same! Anyways, Happy New Year! TEAM INDIA FTW.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Entertainment for whole family,"I am not saying that this film is excellent but it's good for time pass entertainment. If you are SRK fan or you want to pass your time then you should watch Happy New Year. Actually it's a mindless film. So, give your brain a rest and watch it. The best part of the film is light hearted comedy and music. The run time of film is 3 hours. Well, 3 hours!! are we in 1980s. Farah Khan's direction is good. I don't think that this film deserves 200 crores.Good pointsfamily entertainment- yes, many kids are fan of SRK and they went to theatre with their family. comedy- everyone loves comedy. who doesn't wants to laugh. music- there are many songs in this film. India waale and manwa laage are at the top, other songs are good too.Bad pointsaverage acting- nobody's performance was above average. film duration- the run time of the film is sufficient to bore a person.",,Anonymous,Music
